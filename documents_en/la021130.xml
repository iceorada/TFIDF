<HD>Into the rich past of Dylan and Stewart</HD>

<LD>Two new sets -- one from rock's greatest singer-songwriter, another
from one of its great songwriter-interpreters -- illustrate two paths
that diverged at a fork in the road called fame.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Dylan never took the bait of superstar celebrity, always
zigzagging away from its lure, while Rod Stewart bit big time when it
was dangled in front of him in the mid-'70s.</LD>
<LD>   A live set from Dylan's 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue points up how
consistently he's worked to defy expectations, while the collected
works Stewart recorded before he became a rock god remind us how far
a supremely gifted musical soul went astray in choosing the path of
fame.</LD>
<TE>   ( The Rolling Thunder Revue was Dylan's antidote to the tour he'd
done the previous year with the Band, his first full-fledged tour
since his 1966 motorcycle accident sent him into seclusion for nearly
a decade.</TE>
<TE>   With the Band, Dylan delivered incendiary, full-throttle rock
performances (captured on the "Before the Flood" live album), but he
later said he felt that the scale of the arena-dominated outing was
uncomfortably beyond his control.</TE>
<TE>   So he came up with the Rolling Thunder Revue, a caravan for rock
'n' roll gypsies that would permit the performers, songs and
arrangements to ebb and flow nightly with their moods -- a setup far
more in sync with Dylan's mercurial spirit than the more tightly
scripted shows with the Band.</TE>
<TE>   He gathered a cast of musicians, both little-known and famous,
from Joan Baez and Roger McGuinn to T-Bone Burnett and Scarlet
Rivera, most of whom he'd been working with in the studio on the
"Desire" album.</TE>
<TE>   The new double CD "Live 1975: The Rolling Thunder Revue -- The
Bootleg Series, Vol. 5" on Columbia includes only Dylan's
performances, so it doesn't give the full scope of the Rolling
Thunder shows. But Dylan himself sounds more relaxed, without
sacrificing the power he'd mustered with the Band.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the album opens with a punchy treatment of "Tonight I'll
Be Staying Here With You" that sounds as if he has the Band behind
him, except for the heavy steel-guitar presence. His vocal also
pushes to the point of strain, something more characteristic of the
'74 performances.</TE>
<TE>   But starting with the next cut, a double-time country-rock
arrangement of "It Ain't Me, Babe," Dylan turns to the more
comfortable, conversational tone that became the hallmark of Rolling
Thunder shows.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan has never been content to stick with recorded versions of
his songs, a compulsion toward freshness that's in full bloom here.
With 1974's "Blood on the Tracks" album, Dylan was back at the top of
his songwriting game, yet he reinvents the "Blood" songs "Simple
Twist of Fate" and "Tangled Up in Blue."</TE>
<TE>   Dylan's been known to ignore his latest albums when he hits the
road, but here he offers five of the then-new songs from "Desire."
"Hurricane" and "Sara" follow the recorded versions closely, but
"Romance in Durango" gets a livelier norteno arrangement that ideally
accents the story of a tragic border romance.</TE>
<TE>   The sound quality is far crisper and more full-bodied than the
1976 "Hard Rain" album drawn from the same tour. There's only one
song in common, "Oh, Sister," and a different performance is included
here.</TE>
<TE>   The set includes an entertaining if occasionally self-aggrandizing
essay by journalist Larry Ratso Sloman adapted from his recently
reissued book "On the Road with Bob Dylan," about his time covering
the Rolling Thunder tour.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a DVD with the "Tangled Up in Blue" and "Isis"
performances from the "Renaldo and Clara" film shot during the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan's songs have long been a touchstone for Stewart, who
included one on most of his early solo albums. The Englishman also
looked to material from such great folk and rock writers as Chuck
Berry, Tim Hardin, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and Sam Cooke.</TE>
<TE>   What's most striking in "Reason to Believe: The Complete Mercury
Studio Recordings," a three-CD set spanning the years 1969 to 1973,
is the unerring vision and relentless striving for heart and soul he
exhibited in the selection and delivery of both outside material and
his own songs.</TE>
<TE>   At times it seems impossible that the same guy who sang such
scrappy, heart-on-sleeve numbers as "Handbags and Glad- rags,"
"Gasoline Alley," "Mandolin Wind," "You Wear It Well" and "Every
Picture Tells a Story" was the same person who later got so caught up
in his own celebrity that the most profound question he could muster
was "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"</TE>
<TE>   In the Mercury recordings, the sandpaper grit that seems to coat
his vocal cords is the ideal conduit for songs drawn out of a
hardscrabble life and imbued with values rooted in basic needs and
desire.</TE>
<TE>   It's the palpable ache of an impossible wish we hear from a
prodigal son who swallows his pride and asks (in "Gasoline Alley")
for something or someone to "take me back, carry me back down to
Gasoline Alley where I started from."</TE>
<TE>   That same yearning turns up time and again in his own songs and in
the likes of Dylan's "Tomorrow Is a Long Time" and Elton John and
Bernie Taupin's "Country Comfort" (Stewart's version far more raw
than Johns').</TE>
<TE>   Stewart also kept things on a more human scale musically until he
left Mercury for Warner Bros. Records in the mid-'70s. His band
(usually including future Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood, his
frequent songwriting partner) employed mandolin, 12-string acoustic,
Dobro or slide guitars and primitive-sounding drums to create a
living-room atmosphere that tapped the British troubadour tradition
and American folk and blues sources.</TE>
<TE>   On that front, he even beat the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
revival to the punch by 30 years with his rendition from the "Rod
Stewart" album of the bluegrass standard "Man of Constant Sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is back on the charts with his album "It Had to Be You ...
The Great American Songbook," in which he applies that signature
raspy voice to songs by Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern and
the like. The album has received mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   But these recordings from three decades ago show there's never
been a question of whether Stewart has the gifts to be a first-rate
song stylist -- only whether he was willing to put his heart and not
just his famous mug into his music.</TE>

<HD>'American' evangelist</HD>
<DH>Stumping for a film that was nearly DOA, Michael Caine
savors work after retirement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Abramowitz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Caine is wearing mascara. The redoubtable English actor, now
Sir Michael Caine, is not performing a replay of his famous
cross-dressing psychiatrist from "Dressed to Kill." In fact, the
69-year-old actor is merely noshing on potato-encrusted salmon at
Beverly Hills' Peninsula Hotel, in a black shirt and jacket and blue
pants -- an outfit more professorial than fashionable.</LD>
<LD>   While he was never blessed with chiseled matinee idol looks, his
face hasn't lost its impact as it ages. It's an expanse of bland
English features, ruddy but unlined, punctuated by a fiercely
impudent nose and animated by an unruly, unpredictable intelligence
and mercurial cerulean blue eyes, one just the tiniest bit sleepy.</LD>
<TE>   The mascara is courtesy of one of Caine's self-devised acting
tips, which he promulgated in a now famous acting tape and book on
acting: If you have blond lashes, always darken them, or, as he
noted, "you might as well be in a radio play." He demonstrates
another dictum -- never blink to the camera -- opening his eyes to
their fullest, and suddenly what had been rather kindly grandfatherly
orbs radiate with the cool intensity of every evil character he's
ever inhabited, like the crime boss in "Mona Lisa." It's simply a
display of technique, but it winds up being intimidating, perhaps
because Caine believes that "cold people you play on technique
because cold people live on technique. Cold people are easy to play
because there's no emotion. They are sort of acting with you."</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that so much of his acting advice focuses on
the eyes: They're the hallmark of his naturalistic acting style,
which has never been more on display than in his turn as British
journalist Thomas Fowler in the new film "The Quiet American." Almost
his entire performance is carried in his gaze as it flows from
cynical to crafty to wearily despairing. The eyes are forever
registering subtly shifting degrees of loss.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which debuted last Friday, is set in 1952 Vietnam. It
details Fowler's love for the young Vietnamese beauty Phuong and her
relationship with his rival for her affections, Alden Pyle, a
seemingly idealistic American aid worker who in actuality is a CIA
operative.</TE>
<TE>   Caine is wearing the mascara because he's just emerged from
several photo shoots. Part "Quiet American" evangelist, part
perpetual one-man dinner host, Caine is determinedly stumping for the
film, and is scheduled to appear in publications from Time to Modern
Maturity as well as on talk shows. November has become the kickoff of
the Oscar season, the time when contenders emerge from their
tinted-window limousines to attend swank private parties and
industry-heavy affairs where Oscar voters are known to lurk. (As an
Oscar contender, Caine is hardly alone in his sudden ubiquity. Jack
Nicholson, another strong best actor candidate, for "About Schmidt,"
has even been spotted flirting on "Access Hollywood.")</TE>
<TE>   In the last four days, Caine has not only done a junket for "The
Quiet American," but also attended the film's premiere and an AFI
retrospective on his career, and he is soon off to give talks to
members of the Screen Actors Guild and the British Academy of Film
and Television Arts. Although Caine and his wife of 30 years,
Shakira, usually leave their home in the English countryside for the
winter, this year's destination is Beverly Hills, in part to be
around to promote the film.</TE>
<TE>   Caine's mission has special urgency partly because the film almost
was a victim of Sept. 11 jitters. Although Joseph Mankiewicz's 1958
film version of the novel betrayed Graham Greene's vision, turning
Pyle into an innocent businessman and Fowler into a communist dupe,
this version, directed by Australian Phillip Noyce, is much truer to
the prescient darkness of Greene's book. The first test screening
took place Sept. 10, 2001, with subsequent test screenings going
badly. The film's fate hung in the balance for months until it was
finally scheduled for release in January, usually a dumping ground
for films.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going to be dumped like it was the worst movie that ever
happened. It's anti-the CIA, who took America into Vietnam, which
everybody computes as being anti-American," Caine says. "Not in my
case. I'm the most pro-American foreigner you've ever met, and I
would never make an anti-American film. I have a feeling that a
couple of critics that [Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein] knew in
New York had seen it and didn't like it, and I think they had had an
effect on him."</TE>
<TE>   Caine, who considers himself part of the informal Miramax family,
having won a Golden Globe and supporting actor Oscar for such Miramax
films as "Little Voice" and "The Cider House Rules," lobbied the
Miramax chief personally. "I said, 'Listen, give us a shot.' "
Miramax agreed to test the waters by letting the film premiere at the
Toronto Film Festival in September. After overwhelmingly positive
critical response, particularly for Caine, Miramax decided to release
"The Quiet American" for a two-week Oscar-qualifying run now and to
go wide early next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Snubbed by Oscar</TE>
<TE>   After 48 years in the movie business and more than 130 films and
TV movies, Caine has never won a best actor Oscar, although he's been
nominated three times, for "Alfie" (1966), "Sleuth" (1972) and
"Educating Rita" (1983). He knows just how lucky he is to be having a
career resurgence at just about the time he qualifies for Social
Security. Just eight years ago, Caine temporarily quit the movie
business, disgusted with the level of scripts coming his way.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens is, if you're a movie actor, you don't retire, the
business retires you," he says. "The great thing is never to be
fashionable -- as in the aphorism 'Always be in style, never in
fashion.' I think I've done it unconsciously," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To Caine, his performance as Fowler is the best he's capable of.
"I transfused myself into Thomas Fowler. When I met Fowler, he was an
empty shell. When I got home, I was the empty shell."</TE>
<TE>   Caine based the character specifically on Greene, whom he knew
slightly. The first time they met, however, was hardly auspicious.
Greene stopped Caine in a restaurant to tell him how much he hated
the 1983 film version of his book "The Honorary Consul," in which
Caine also starred. "He didn't like it at all," recalls Caine, who
was surprised to have the 6-foot-5 author looming over him. "It was
all right, because in the end he said, 'I'd just like to say, I did
like your performance.' " He adds, self-deprecatingly, "And I
thought, oh, he's just letting me off a bit lightly here."</TE>
<TE>   The part of the soul-exhausted, jealous Fowler is a high-wire act
for an actor. Director Noyce says, "There's a real task here: Can you
maintain the audience's sympathy while absolutely testing their
loyalty? There would be no forgiveness in the wrong hands."</TE>
<TE>   And yet the role seems to fit Caine so effortlessly that most will
miss the fact that he's not even using his normal Cockney accent, but
more enunciated, middle-class British tones. When he's not
performing, Caine makes a point never to use anything but his
naturally broad South London voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, there's a lyric in 'My Fair Lady,' it takes an Englishman
to open his mouth for another Englishman to despise him," says Caine,
summing up class differences in England. "My own view of class in
England was, I wanted everybody to know where I came from, especially
the people who were where I came from, to know that it's not
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Caine was born Maurice Mickelwhite in 1933. His father was a fish
market porter, his mother a charwoman. His childhood was marked by
extreme poverty and evacuation from London during World War II. (He
stayed with a family who locked him in a closet while they went
shopping for hours until his mother rescued him.) He saw Asia around
the time of "The Quiet American" -- as a 20-year-old British soldier
attached to an American division in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   He describes his experience as similar to those of soldiers in
World War I: "trench warfare, bombardments every day and then at
night. We were on one side of a valley, the Chinese on the other. In
the nighttime you try to keep control of the middle, which is a scary
thing."</TE>
<TE>   He spent another eight years trying to break into show business,
and didn't succeed until the age of 29, when he appeared as Lt.
Bromhead in "Zulu." He emerged as one of a new breed of working-class
actors, including Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay, who defied the
assumption that Brits were only good to play swank toffs and
Shakespearean heroes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Driven by fear of poverty</TE>
<TE>   Still, several decades of success later, Caine tells the SAG
audience that his greatest fear remains poverty. It's a childhood
horror of returning whence he came that drove some less-than-inspired
career choices. Indeed, the proliferation of such commercial
Hollywood clunkers as "Jaws: The Revenge" and the Steven Seagal flick
"On Deadly Ground" on his resume threatened to obscure Caine's
immense talents.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I was going to get another [movie], so I always
took 'em," Caine explains, adding, "If you come from a very poor
family, everybody around you is poor. It's the old cliche, he's a
young boy, he's got to buy his mother a house. I bought everyone a
bloody house. You cannot go into a luxury area, leaving everybody
else behind living like pigs. You have to take everyone with you!"</TE>
<TE>   One of the good things about his temporary retirement was being
able to return with a new set of priorities. "I went away for a while
in order to become someone else," says Caine, who spent his two years
off writing his autobiography and running his six restaurants. "I'd
been a movie star for a long time. I came back as a movie actor,
which means, I'm older, I can do what I like. I came back without the
responsibility of having to do work of any kind because I needed the
money. So now I only do what I judge to be excellent."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, in the last few years, even his commercial Hollywood
films have been winners, and this summer he was inspired in spoofing
his '60s spy persona as Mike Myers' secret-agent dad in "Austin
Powers in Goldmember."</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, Caine retires for yet another photo session, trotting
through his paces like a well-seasoned thoroughbred. As he sits in
one of the Peninsula's anterooms looking professionally pensive, a
deliveryman wanders by and stops, clearly delighted to have spotted
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a famous person," confesses the passerby. "I know
he's famous, but I don't know who he is." Caine looks up under his
hooded lids and says dryly, "I guess I haven't done enough
publicity."</TE>

<LD>Picasso's WarPicasso's War</LD>
<LD>   The Destruction of Guernica, and the Masterpiece That Changed the
World</LD>
<LD>   Russell Martin</LD>
<TE>   Dutton: 276 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Picasso's War" is a fetching and well-crafted account of Pablo
Picasso's huge and astounding painting, "Guernica," that has come to
symbolize the elemental barbarism of the recently deceased 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   In measured paces, Russell Martin, the author of the recent
best-selling "Beethoven's Hair," tells how the painting sprang from
the bombing by German planes during the Spanish Civil War of the
ancient and nearly sacred Basque town of Guernica and the world's
horrified reaction to this first deliberate aerial attack upon
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Martin deftly weaves the story of the painting into the background
of the rise of Fascism and the course of the Spanish war, with all
its overtones of the greater war to come. He is knowledgeable about
the place of "Guernica" in the development of Picasso's art. He
recounts the painting's long residence at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York and its eventual return to Madrid in a peaceful, democratic
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "Picasso's War" could be, in short, a model of a guide to a most
engaging subject -- even in tone, illuminating, deft -- indeed a
painterly little book. Except for one thing: Martin must claim for
the painting something it was not. It did not change the world or, as
he writes, ensure that "the often uncomfortably intersecting realms
of politics and art -- and of human misery and aspiration -- never
would be the same again."</TE>
<TE>   Is it not enough that the painting simply is? In "Guernica,"
Picasso broke no new stylistic ground for himself or for any other
artist. He changed no history, stopped no massacres. He simply
expressed in images of uncertain meaning, but of the greatest power,
the anguish of a small town, and of an age. Surely an artist can do
no more, nor should he be asked to.</TE>
<TE>   Martin aptly quotes the always enigmatic Picasso as saying that
his art is not propaganda, and as saying also that "no, painting is
not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war."</TE>
<TE>   Martin's excesses aside -- and they are few -- his book is
beguiling. He tastefully works into it his own personal encounter
with Spain, with Catalonia and the Basque country, as a visiting
student from Phillips Andover Academy to Barcelona in 1968. A wise
teacher named Angel Vilalta introduced him to the bloody history of
Spain in the 1930s and its aftermath under the victorious dictator
Francisco Franco.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's sympathies are with the beleaguered Spanish Republic.
What democrat's would not be? But as Martin points out, many in the
world were only too willing, for too long, to believe Franco's lie
that Guernica was destroyed not by German bombers but by the
defending "Reds."</TE>
<TE>   As the author knows well, the Spanish Civil War was a tangle of
ideologies, idealism, opportunism, cruelty, hate, the whole panoply
of human characteristics. As the Nazis and the Italians intervened on
one side, the Soviet Union did on the other; both sides indulged in
atrocious behavior.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing like the deliberate attack on civilian Guernica had
happened in modern Europe before. As soon as the news reached Paris,
Picasso, already commissioned to do a large mural for the pavilion of
the Spanish Republic for the 1937 Paris world's fair, began drawing
sketches for the work that would become his most widely known. Its
development was well-documented by Picasso's changing designs and the
photographic record by his mistress, Dora Maar.</TE>
<TE>   Finished, it was 20 feet wide by nearly 12 feet high, oil on
canvas, no color, only black, white and gray. At its center is a
shrieking horse; a dead or dying man lies on the ground; on the left
a screaming woman with a dead child is under the thoughtful gaze of
an enigmatic bull; on the far right a man, yelling, with upstretched
arms, then a woman who seems to be pleading; at the top, illuminating
all, a sun/lightbulb; near it, entering at the top, is a
compassionate-looking woman with a lamp.</TE>
<TE>   Picasso refused to explain it. As Martin makes clear in his
absorbing book, "Guernica" did not need explication. It spoke, in all
its mysterious force, of a world in destruction. Some, too, saw in
the face of the woman carrying the lamp a sign of hope.</TE>

<HD>The rites and wrongs of crediting script rewriters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Burt Prelutsky</AU>
<BD>Burt Prelutsky is a Writers Guild member whose credits
range from "McMillan and Wife" and "Diagnosis Murder" to "MASH,"
"Newhart" and TV movies. He lives in North Hills.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As anyone who's been reading Calendar lately must be aware, there is
a vituperative battle being waged in the Writers Guild of America.
(Right. So what else is new?) The question on the floor is, just how
hard should it be for rewriters to take credit away from the original
writer -- particularly when the subsequent writer is a director or a
producer? What complicates the issue and makes the battle so heated
is that very often those people also happen to be, themselves,
members of the WGA.</LD>
<LD>   Original writers feel that they've done all the hard work and that
it's already way too easy for these hyphenates to swipe half or even
all the writing credit. And of course they're right.</LD>
<LD>   For their part, rewriters feel that without their creative
contribution, the script would have remained a good concept lurking
in a cheesy script, and would never have been produced. And of course
they're right.</LD>
<TE>   The way things are now, the hyphenated rewriter has to contribute
more than 50% of the screenplay in order to get credit. A proposal
just turned down by the guild's membership ("WGA rejects credit rules
change," by Dana Calvo, Nov. 19) would have lowered the bar to 33% --
or maybe it was 24.8% or perhaps 5.67%. Let's face it, the very idea
of trying to dole out percentiles on a movie script is a notion the
likes of which even Jonathan Swift would have deemed too wacky for
satire.</TE>
<TE>   What to do?</TE>
<TE>   Well, I have always said that the only thing wrong with the WGA's
arbitration process is that it exists. My solution has always been to
give the original writer sole credit, with all subsequent
writers-for-hire, be they directors, producers or the star's
brother-in-law, in it strictly for the dough.</TE>
<TE>   The rewriters claim that if it's their talent that enables a movie
to be green-lighted, they're entitled to on-screen acknowledgment.
They're wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Except possibly for poets, writers are always having their work
tampered with. Legendary editor Maxwell Perkins took a very active
role in revising Thomas Wolfe's novels, using a blue pencil shaped
like an ax. Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" and Ross Lockridge's "Raintree
County" would have never seen the light of day if other editors
hadn't cut half the verbiage out of their original manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   Scriptwriters covet the playwright's contract, under which they
get to approve any and all changes. But the fact of the matter is
that, through the years, major stage directors, such as George
Abbott, Mike Nichols and Elia Kazan, don't sign on without the clear
understanding that changes can and will be made. And when it comes to
rewriting, it's as rampant a practice on Broadway as it is in
Hollywood. When the late Abe Burrows wasn't writing "Guys and Dolls"
or "How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying," he kept busy
"doctoring" plays. After all, it's all well and good to say that
playwrights can't be rewritten, but when half the New Haven audience
is walking out in the second act, it's no time to stand on ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that when it comes to books, plays and musicals,
only the original writer gets the credit, no matter how many chefs
have had a hand in concocting the broth. And that's as it should be,
seeing as how he was the guy working on spec.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it took the playwright or the screenwriter a month or five
years to write the darn thing, he was the schnook taking all the
risks. The idea that a hired gun should not only get paid handsomely
for his services, but also expect to get his name plastered on the
screen, is chutzpah with an oak-leaf cluster.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when you consider how lousy most Hollywood product is,
wouldn't you think all parties would prefer to remain anonymous?</TE>

<HD>What a parade does to survive</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood Christmas Parade, a 70-year-old Los Angeles holiday
tradition that brings out hundreds of thousands of spectators, had
come to this:</LD>
<LD>   Television stations were reluctant to air it. Many celebrities
wouldn't ride in it. One who did, a female wrestler, encouraged
families in the grandstand to buy her new Playboy centerfold as
"stocking stuffers."</LD>
<LD>   After losing money two years in a row, the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce debated last summer whether to cancel it.</LD>
<TE>   But on Sunday night, the 71st Hollywood Christmas Parade, the
working-class cousin to the elite Rose Parade (to say nothing of the
rowdy family outcast, the Doo Dah Parade), will be reincarnated as a
one-hour variety show to air Dec. 8 on NBC in a last-breath shot at
the TV stardom organizers desperately say they need to keep the event
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the parade will kick off as usual in all its kitschy
splendor, with throngs of adoring fans in antler headbands and Santa
hats cheering the free show. Police guess their numbers to be
anywhere from 400,000 to 700,000, a public gathering ranking up there
with the Los Angeles Marathon and Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   But the live televised form of the event, seen in Los Angeles the
Sunday after Thanksgiving since the early 1960s, has come to an end,
an "old and tired entertainment form that isn't as interesting as it
used to be," said the variety show's executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   For its network make-over, the Hollywood Christmas Parade, like so
many stars on the Walk of Fame, will have to change its name, let go
of its past and leave old associations behind. It will emerge as the
"Blockbuster Hollywood Christmas Spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   Purposefully missing from the title is the word "parade."</TE>
<TE>   "You are not going see marching bands and equestrian units and
cars with octogenarian stars in them," executive producer Bob Bain
said. "What you are going to see is a special specifically created to
relate to a contemporary national audience that uses the parade event
as its environment."</TE>
<TE>   The parade will be all but gone -- "Eliminated! Eliminated!" Bain
said -- from the network special.</TE>
<TE>   And that's fine with parade fans -- just as long as the special
doesn't ruin their fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you what this parade is about, why it's so popular,"
said Jean Pearlman, 53, who used to watch it on TV and now volunteers
at the event. "It laughs with you and stays with you like a little
glow.... And being there is 100 times better than watching it on TV."</TE>
<TE>   It's about crowds so excited that they break into cheering matches
across Hollywood Boulevard. It's about kids giddy to be out at night
and getting to wear snow hats and mittens because this is Los Angeles
cold. "It's not about A-list celebrities. It's about celebration,"
said Lisa Wills, 40, of Chino Hills. "You get this feeling that
you've just stepped into 'It's a Wonderful Life.' It feels like
Christmas, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   That's just the emotion the "Spectacular" wants to exploit,
without actually having to show the parade. Bain, who also produces
the Miss America Pageant, says you can expect to see cut-aways of the
crowds, and host Nancy O'Dell of "Access Hollywood" saying something
like "I'm live at the world-famous Hollywood Christmas Parade, a
Southern California tradition for 71 years."</TE>
<TE>   The street parade will star grand marshal Mickey Rooney, 82, who
said he hopes to sing a round of "Jingle Bells" with the spectators
packed 50 deep at the corner of Hollywood and Vine.</TE>
<TE>   The televised "Spectacular" will star LeAnn Rimes and Destiny's
Child singing cuts from their new holiday CDs as 200 paid extras
surround the stage on cue and act like parade-goers.</TE>
<TE>   The parade will go on with the Center Grove High School marching
band from Greenwood, Ind., and its baton-twirling gymnasts.</TE>
<TE>   The "Spectacular" will go on with stunt man Bobby Brown falling
off a 10-story building to promote the December release of "XXX" on
DVD.</TE>
<TE>   The parade will end as it always does with Santa Claus,
ho-ho-ho-ing greetings in five languages to wild ovations.</TE>
<TE>   It's uncertain, however, whether Santa will make it to the final
edit of the "Spectacular." In recent weeks, as both sides scrambled
to assemble star lineups, Hollywood the Parade and Hollywood the
Industry formed a delicate alliance. "Obviously there is trepidation,
" said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
"This is an enormous change for us, and we are hoping it will give us
a long-term outlook for the parade." If the special flops, the
chamber may not be able to resuscitate the parade.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't have any other options. And it wasn't the first time
the parade had been in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   It started out as the Santa Claus Lane Parade in 1928 as a way to
attract shoppers to Hollywood Boulevard, but by the 1960s it had lost
its luster and could not attract crowds or prominent celebrities. In
1978, the chamber recruited John F. Goldman, the longtime head of
Western Costume Co., to restore glamour to the event.</TE>
<TE>   The parade reached its broadcast peak that year, airing on 130
stations covering 80% of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Grant, now the unofficial "mayor of Hollywood" but back
then a KTLA personality, aided Goldman. Grant's boss at the time,
KTLA owner Gene Autry, happened to love the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Autry had been inspired to write "Here Comes Santa Claus" while
riding his horse Champion in the parade in the 1940s. He agreed to
televise it, and Bob Hope signed on as grand marshal.</TE>
<TE>   Other celebrities followed: Michael Landon, Stevie Wonder, Robert
Wagner and Natalie Wood, Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, Jimmy Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   As late as 1993, the parade broadcast on KTLA drew 20% of Los
Angeles viewers. But in the last three years, about four times as
many people watched it from the boulevard as on TV.</TE>
<TE>   As viewership eroded, so did the celebrity roster. But some stars
still attended and had a blast.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Patrick, known for playing John Doggett on "The X-Files"
and the bad cyborg in "Terminator 2," was one of the few dozen who
replied in 2001 to the 400-plus invitations sent by a celebrity
brokerage firm hired by the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Riding in the parade, he decided, would be his way of showing
post-Sept. 11 patriotism. But then he started to have second
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "I wondered, it doesn't attract huge stars.... Do I have to worry
about my image? Should I do this?" he said. "Then I thought, image be
damned. I feel like being patriotic."</TE>
<TE>   Once he got in the convertible, the parade scene carried him away.
"This is so old school, so cool," he said. "It's just the thing we
all grew up with." Patrick told the chamber he would be back.</TE>
<TE>   KCOP, owned by the Fox network, however, told the chamber that it
no longer wanted to cover the entire parade live. This week, KCOP
finally decided to air a taped version of the parade, sans
"Spectacular" acts, on Christmas morning.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the KCOP's near-pullout sent the Hollywood chamber's board
of directors into several heated meetings last summer: Should it kill
the parade?</TE>
<TE>   Grant, known for his unabashed boosterism of Hollywood, made his
case: "I said to them, 'With Hollywood turning around right now, if
you announce that one of your biggest and most popular cultural
events is being shut down because of lack of interest or sponsorship,
that would be a black eye.' "</TE>
<TE>   Enter Jeffrey Lotman, CEO of Global Icons, the licensing agency
hired by the chamber to market the Hollywood sign and the Walk of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's this parade that has been around for 70 years and has this
incredible following," Lotman said. "Why can't we re-brand it ...
make it the biggest event in L.A.?" A new parade could take advantage
of the area's resurgence, he argued, noting that just last year, the
Oscars returned to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Lotman talked with United Talent Agency and agreed with Ferris
Thompson, head of entertainment marketing for UTA, that they could
"take a great local tradition to a new level."</TE>
<TE>   They pitched their non-parade "Spectacular" to NBC, which decided
to air the show because it gets an exclusive West Coast companion to
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and an original addition to its
holiday lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured it was worth a shot, something families can gather
around and watch for the holidays," said Jeff Gaspin, executive vice
president of NBC specials. "The Christmas spirit really drives
everything in viewership."</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster, the nation's largest DVD and video retailer and the
"Spectacular's" sponsor, gets a national platform to promote holiday
DVD releases.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, craving attention for its
revitalization efforts along Hollywood Boulevard, gets needed
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   And just like the Santa Claus Lane Parade of 1928, the Hollywood
Christmas Parade of 1978 and the "Blockbuster Hollywood Christmas
Spectacular" of 2002, the event remains true to its original mission
of attracting holiday shoppers to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Asked NBC's Gaspin: "What's more Christmas than marketing?"</TE>

<CX>   Hollywood Christmas Spectacular -- An article in Saturday's Calendar
reported that stuntman Bobby Brown was going to jump off a 10-story
building as part of the Blockbuster Hollywood Christmas Spectacular.
Instead, stuntman Mike Kartvedt performed the jump from a 12-story
building. Also, the story misidentified the longtime head of Western
Costume Co. His name was John F. Golden, not Goldman.</CX>

<HD>Artist is bigger than the room</HD>
<DH>Victor Bailey, ensemble prove that they deserve to be heard
more often and by more people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bassist Victor Bailey has worked with everyone from Weather Report
and the Zawinul Syndicate to Madonna and Mary J. Blige. He is, in
other words, a player with a far-ranging set of skills. One doesn't
replace the inimitable Jaco Pastorius in Weather Report and then move
on to provide the rhythmic foundation for a demanding pop icon like
Madonna without possessing a fair share of one's own creative
impulses.</LD>
<LD>   Yet as Bailey sardonically pointed out on Wednesday night at
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, the moderate-size crowd greeting his opening
set was in startling contrast to the crowds of 5,000 and 6,000 that
turned out for his recent European tour. Not quite a prophet without
honor in his own country, Bailey nonetheless receives far more
appropriate attention overseas than he does in his U.S. performances.</LD>
<LD>   Listening to his provocative opening set, one could only wonder
why that was the case, why such an imaginative, immensely
communicative artist would have a minimal number of recordings under
his own name, why he would only be booked for a pair of nights in a
room such as Catalina's. There wasn't a dull moment in his set,
performed by a sterling ensemble that also included saxophonist Benny
Maupin, pianist Patrice Rushen and drummer Poogie Bell.</LD>
<TE>   Two pieces were particularly impressive. Maupin's "Steamy," in
which he played bass clarinet, was based upon a mesmerizing rhythmic
ostinato, similar to the sort of thing he wrote for Herbie Hancock's
Headhunters in the '70s. Starting with an atmospheric soundscape
provided by Rushen's synthesizer, enhanced by the eerie,
low-frequency sounds of the bass clarinet, the piece blossomed into a
churning rhythmic whirlwind.</TE>
<TE>   Riding its crest, Maupin, also too little recognized, whipped
around his horn, generating a wild array of sounds, calling out into
the primordial musical wilderness. In the second highlight, Bailey
paid tribute to Pastorius with "Do You Know Who He Was?" based on the
great bassist's piece, "Continuum." Not only did Bailey write lyrics
for the basic line, he also composed a set of remarkable vocalese
words for Pastorius' solo, and played and sang both, an extraordinary
feat. He was outstanding in the balance of the set, often singing
along with a line, scatting with his own improvisations, strumming
brisk harmonic accents on his four-string bass and adding occasional
passages of whistling to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   It was a performance as entertaining as it was musically
captivating: the work of an artist who should be heard more often, by
larger audiences, for the very good reason that he has something
important to say.</TE>

<LD>DISCO drove me crazy as a teenager. I couldn't escape the music and
culture--it was pervasive, it was everywhere, it was like McDonald's
("Get down, get funky: Disco gets its due," by Scott Martelle, Nov.
26). Plus, it was gaudy. Put it this way: We thought the whole thing
was just gross.</LD>
<LD>   The awful, repetitive slickness of disco music did actually
motivate me, though, and for that I will be ever grateful. In the
middle of 1977, in desperate search for something real, I impulsively
purchased Neil Young's raggedy "American Stars 'n Bars" album. Now
there's an "anti-disco" album if there ever was one--full of sad
tales, lumbering rhythms and cranky guitars.</LD>
<LD>   And for all of this, disco gets a museum exhibit and "American
Stars 'n Bars" is not even available on CD. There ya go.</LD>

<HD>Rosenberg on killing of kudu</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>HOWARD Rosenberg's biting wit is right on target when he insightfully
describes the way in which a beautiful, defenseless kudu is killed in
cold blood by what can only be described as a delusional "sportsman"
operating under the assumption that he is somehow doing something
masterful in his testosterone-drenched world ("Gatherers of
beautiful, deceased animals," Nov. 22).</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, this bizarre, destructive behavior is repeated tens
of thousands of times each year. The clarity of Rosenberg's eye
really lets us see how devoid of sensibility these vacuous people
really are.</LD>

<TE>   IN less than a week, 18 people have been violently killed on the
streets of Los Angeles. Why is it then that everyone only seems to
get upset when Bambi is hunted and (legally) killed or a tree needs
to be cut down in order to widen a road?</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg should stick to the self-serving, crotchety,
Hollywood puff pieces that he had become known for. Next time, why
not try using your remote to turn the channel?</TE>

<HD>Noyce's frustration</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MOST probably due to the imperfection of my telling, but certainly
exacerbated by the sub-heading ("Pandering to the A-List"), Patrick
Goldstein's article ("Nowhere Man," Nov. 19) gives the false
impression that Harrison Ford somehow acted unreasonably while trying
to decide if he would reprise the role of Jack Ryan in "The Sum of
All Fears."</LD>
<LD>   For the record, Harrison had always been very forthcoming with his
misgivings about "The Sum of All Fears" story line. I think simply
out of loyalty to the rest of us involved with the project at that
time, Harrison tried in vain to summon enthusiasm for the material.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison's personal reluctance to commit to a project he didn't
believe in was not the factor that drove to me to leave "Fears" and
return to Australia to make "Rabbit-Proof Fence." In my comments to
Patrick, I meant to convey my frustration with trying to mount
another huge studio-based project, not frustration with Ford.</LD>

<LD>Bravo to Christopher Knight for his scathing review of the Keith
Edmier-Farrah Fawcett show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
("Like, Conceptual, dude," Nov. 25). Once again this show reinforces
my belief that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has been taken
over by the entertainment industry.</LD>

<LD>I never cease to be amazed at liberal pundits who rail at the
inability of Michael Jackson to take hold since he was dumped by KABC
for poor ratings. ("This Michael Jackson is the one twisting in the
wind," by Al Martinez, Nov. 25).</LD>
<LD>   God forbid we let the marketplace work.</LD>
<LD>   It is as if it's some sacred violation if we don't listen to
Jackson. Are we less than noble for not supporting his program? Did
it ever occur to Martinez that many of us don't like what we hear? If
Jackson is the quintessential talk radio host Martinez suggests, then
why did Limbaugh clean his ratings clock?</LD>

<HD>Bush parody banned in Britain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Center, a British watchdog group,
has banned a commercial that pokes fun at President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   In the offending ad, Bush is shown opening a copy of a video,
saying "My favorite -- just pop it in the video player." He then
sticks it into a toaster and burns it. The ad promotes a video and
DVD of highlights from "2DTV," an animated series that mocks
politicians and celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   The ad could only be shown, the group said, if the makers sought
the president's permission -- a guideline for the portrayal of living
people. "People are entitled not to be exploited for someone else's
commercial gain," said the group's director.</LD>
<TE>   Giles Pilbrow, producer of "2DTV," said requiring satirists to
seek permission from their targets was "an idiotic request" that
would mean asking Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein if it was all
right to caricature them. "I doubt we could get Bin Laden's
permission -- he's a bit tricky to track down at the moment," he
said.</TE>

<LD>Joe Pantoliano may feel right at home on Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   The actor, whose character on the HBO show "The Sopranos" recently
was retired in a rather violent fashion, is set to make his Broadway
debut Jan. 1 in the hit revival of "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire
de Lune."</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old joins a mob of "Sopranos" actors now on Broadway:
Lorraine Bracco has been taking it all off as Mrs. Robinson in "The
Graduate," Jamie-Lynn Sigler is the beauty half of "Beauty and the
Beast," and Saundra Santiago will appear in the Roundabout's revival
of "Nine."</LD>
<TE>   Another "Sopranos" cast member, Edie Falco, has been appearing
with Stanley Tucci in "Frankie and Johnny" since the show opened in
August. She and Tucci leave the show Dec. 29; Falco will be replaced
by Rosie Perez.</TE>

<LD>Britain has slapped a temporary export ban on a rare early
pen-and-ink study by Michelangelo to give time for efforts to raise
the $11.7 million needed to buy it for the nation.</LD>
<LD>   "Study of a Mourning Woman," one of only five examples of
Michelangelo's early work, of which only two are in private hands,
was sold at auction in mid-2001 for $9.1 million to a London dealer.</LD>
<LD>   The sketch, a three-quarter profile of a standing woman, now
belongs to an American collector and was destined to be moved
overseas before the ban.</LD>
<TE>   The ban lasts to the end of January but could be extended through
June if there is indication of a serious attempt to raise the funds,
Arts Minister Tessa Blackstone said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The sketch has been dated to between 1494 and 1504.</TE>

<LD>ABC's show about dinosaurs came up a turkey in the ratings.</LD>
<LD>   The months-delayed premiere of "Dinotopia" on Thanksgiving night
ran a weak fourth in its time period. ABC ran back-to-back episodes
from 8 to 10 p.m., but CBS was first with reruns of "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation."</LD>
<LD>   CBS also claimed victory in overall viewing for the November
ratings sweeps, which officially concluded Wednesday night. Based on
preliminary Nielsen data, the network finished the four-week period
averaging 13.3 million viewers per night, versus 13.1 million for
runner-up NBC.</LD>

<AU>Tim Rutten</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California -- and particularly Los Angeles -- may defy comprehension,
but they cannot escape explanation.</LD>
<LD>   Things being what they are, most of the latter is what
professional explainers technically refer to as blather. To anyone
forced to sit through it -- and who among us has not? -- it is hard
not to wish for what might be described as a Thomas Guide of the
Mind, a reliable road map to where we've been, who we are and where
we might be going.</LD>
<LD>   Inconveniently, no such volume exists. But a
too-little-appreciated renaissance in the publishing of new and
classic California histories as well as a series of first-rate new
literary anthologies suddenly make it possible to assemble a fairly
compact shelf of books through which diligent readers might discover
their own explanations of this perplexing place.</LD>
<TE>   History is the place to start, and the jumping-off point has to be
"California: A Study of American Character," which philosopher and
historian Josiah Royce published in 1886. His willingness to ponder
the ills and ambiguities, as well as the achievements, attendant on
conquest and settlement was the beginning of a modern understanding
not only of California, but also of the West. It is a book now
available in several handsome volumes and collections.</TE>
<TE>   (Besides, who would not want to spend time with a philosopher who
once said: "My idea of heaven would be to know the complete meaning
of anything I was doing at a particular moment.")</TE>
<TE>   Because the everyday experience of nature remains central to the
California experience, at least one of John Muir's books ought to
come next. Everyone with even a passing familiarity with the work of
the environmental movement's founding father has his own favorite,
but for this purpose either "The Mountains of California" (1894) or
"A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf" (1916) would be a pretty good
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Here -- just because it's California -- a place ought to be made
for a work of thinly fictionalized history, Frank Norris' 1901 novel,
"The Octopus," an epic account of the struggle between the railroads
and Central Valley wheat farmers. Norris' book is important not only
for its own sake, but also because it so strongly supports the
argument he made in his posthumously published "The Responsibility of
the Novelist." Its contention that socially conscious American
fiction should involve naturalistic writing based on firsthand
experience subsequently exerted a powerful influence on such writers
as Upton Sinclair, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis and John
Steinbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Norris on this imaginary shelf should come "Fool's
Paradise: A Carey McWilliams Reader," recently published by
California Legacy, a joint project of the University of Santa Clara
and Berkeley-based Heyday Books. McWilliams -- lawyer, journalist and
radical -- was 20th century California's indispensable social
conscience. This volume brings together well-chosen excerpts from his
classic works, "Factories in the Field," "North From Mexico,"
"Southern California: An Island on the Land" and "California: The
Great Exception."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Starr's magisterial synoptic history of California -- the
seventh volume of which is forthcoming this year -- gets the next
slot. No one has marshaled so many facts so gracefully in the service
of the state's cultural history.</TE>
<TE>   Given his panoramic scope, Starr's treatment of many topics is
necessarily glancing. Thus, the series' greatest pleasures are to be
found on those pages where his personal enthusiasm eddies into deeper
pools of reflection and exposition. For example, readers who may be
participating in one of the ongoing sponsored readings of John
Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" would profit from consulting
Starr's account of its composition in his fourth volume, "Endangered
Dreams: The Great Depression in California." It is a fascinating
exploration of how Steinbeck's close ties with the Hollywood film
community influenced the novel's character.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, to finish up the Los Angeles end of this section, one
might turn to Mike Davis' "City of Quartz" and David Rieff's "Los
Angeles: Capitol of The Third World." (For the record, both books
have about as many detractors as admirers, and this writer is one of
the voices frequently quoted in the latter volume.)</TE>
<TE>   Now things get a little more interesting. Suddenly, we are so
awash in intelligently chosen literary anthologies that it is
possible to get a comprehensive survey of historical and contemporary
California writing in less than a half-dozen volumes. Every anthology
is an invitation and a provocation, and a good one should evoke at
least as many controversies as it does compliments. That's part of
the genre's pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Begin with the first volume of "The Literature of California:
Native American Beginnings to 1945," published a little more than a
year ago by the University of California Press. This is a judiciously
-- and often surprisingly -- chosen collection. The astonishingly
rich array of Native American and 18th and 19th century writing will
repay the reader many times over.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious companion choice is the recently published "Writing
Los Angeles: A Literary Anthology," edited by David L. Ulin for the
authoritative Library of America. Although this is bound to be the
most controversial of the literary volumes on this imaginary shelf,
it is nonetheless the best collection of its kind yet assembled.</TE>
<TE>   Next should come a pair of unexpected anthologies published in the
past few months: "Under the Fifth Sun: Latino Literature From
California" is a stunningly rich 548-page collection edited by
printer and publisher Rick Heide for the California Legacy series.
Here is a real education for those who have lazily consigned Latino
letters to the propaganda section of the identity politics movement.</TE>
<TE>   Arranged thematically into sections such as "Arriving," "Pop
Culture" "Working" and "Violence," the authors chosen range from
Nobel laureate Octavio Paz to contemporary L.A. novelist Yxta Maya
Murray and from the historical meditations of turn-of-the-century
geneticist and bohemian Jaime de Angulo to 24-year-old Indio-born
poet John Olivares Espinoza, whose "Aching Knees in Palm Springs" is
a heartbreaking account of working with his landscape gardener
father.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, these selections make a convincing case for Latino
writing not as a parallel but as an integral part of California
letters.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, does "The Dirt Is Red Here: Art and Poetry From Native
California," recently published by Heyday and selected by Margaret
Dubin, longtime editor of News From Native California, the quarterly
magazine of the state's Indian communities.</TE>
<TE>   Technically sophisticated and often movingly executed, many of the
poems in this volume will make a claim not only on readers, but also
on the compilers of more general surveys of California literature.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of that, all our Thomas Brothers of the Mind needs to
reach provisional completion -- and what in this state is not
provisional? -- is Dana Gioia's forthcoming anthology of California
poets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! The Learning Channel! Be there from 8 to 10
p.m. for "Chariot Race 2002"! Monster Roman chariot action like
you've never seen before!</LD>
<LD>   It's too bad the Learning Channel chose to present what is
inherently an exciting subject in an annoying way. Chariot racing was
the spectator sport of the ancient Romans, full of the drama of
victory, defeat and death. Race days were public holidays, and there
was such lust for chariot races that by the time of the fall of the
Roman Empire, every other day was a race day. There's no need to make
the subject palatable to modern audiences by sugar-coating it in a
veneer of Extreme Sports Mania!</LD>
<TE>   If you can get past the grating staccato narration and the
heavy-metal guitar riffs, "Chariot Race 2002" presents fascinating
peeks at the culture of charioteers and their rabid fans. The program
re-created an ancient Roman chariot race in Spain, including training
four modern charioteers and reconstructing authentic chariots and a
Circus Maximus-type course. The program comes alive when the real
history emerges in the form of mosaic murals, sculptures, written
records and other artifacts. We learn that ancient Romans took the
races so seriously that they would inscribe curses on lead tablets,
roll them up and bury them at the starting gate or at dangerous
curves on the track. Other interesting tidbits: Charioteers drank a
combination of wine and boar's dung to regain their strength after
races.</TE>
<TE>   These intriguing visions of the past are interrupted by the modern
charioteers' training, kvetching and racing. When they meet on the
newly built track, the showdown is a bit of a letdown. The
reconstructed race can't compete with the imagined scene of the
Circus Maximus crowd of a quarter-million fans roaring so loudly they
could be heard throughout Rome. And no Roman charioteer ever yelled,
"Yeah, baby!" upon emerging victorious, like the winner of this
contest, who is clearly unable to re-create that principal Roman
virtue, stoicism.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagination and boldness, energy and innovation separate the great
recitalists from the ordinary. David Finckel and Wu Han, the
exceptional cello and piano duo (and husband and wife), demonstrated
these qualities again, in a Rosalinde Gilbert concert in Bing Theater
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   On paper, the 20th century Russian program looked a little gloomy,
and it was all unfamiliar. But the players' virtuosic musicianship
and their complete immersion in the works made it exhilarating and
ear-opening.</LD>
<LD>   The best came last, with Alfred Schnittke's explosive and ghostly
Sonata (1978), a series of mechanical hurdles for the performers and
a work of abrasive and haunting beauty for the listener. Finckel-Han,
an ensemble that probes musical sensibility as deeply as it
delineates musical form, played it with authority and spontaneous
heat.</LD>
<TE>   They also gave full value to the dramatic and technical challenges
in two other sonatas from the 20th century, Prokofiev's late Opus 119
(1949) and Shostakovich's early--near the time of "Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk"--Sonata of 1934.</TE>
<TE>   These works are not dissimilar, although each shows the composer's
special characteristics in a specific period. Each should be heard
more often than it is.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after intermission and at the end of the recital, the
duo handsomely performed transcriptions from Rachmaninoff piano
pieces.</TE>

<HD>Of two formulas, one adds up</HD>
<DH>The lively 'Christmas Rush' and sluggish 'Christmas Shoes'
both use familiar elements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christmas programming kicks into high gear Sunday night with two
original TV movies from different traditions -- one naughty, one
nice.</LD>
<LD>   "Christmas Rush," airing at 7 p.m. on TBS, could have been another
lame wannabe "Die Hard" in a transplanted setting, in this case a
Chicago mall. Instead, this thriller starring Dean Cain, Eric Roberts
and Erika Eleniak successfully reworks the ingredients that made "Die
Hard" a smash in 1988: a captivating villain and dry jokes that fly
almost as fast as the bullets and glass.</LD>
<LD>   Next comes a more traditional take on the holiday season, "The
Christmas Shoes," airing at 9 p.m. on CBS. It could have been just
another by-the-numbers Scrooge story -- and, unfortunately, it is.
This sluggish drama stars Rob Lowe as a callous corporate lawyer and
Kimberly Williams as a dying mother in intertwining stories that
connect on Christmas Eve.</LD>
<TE>   In "Christmas Rush," Cain plays Cornelius Morgan, a suspended cop
who has a fight with his wife, Cat (Eleniak), on Christmas Eve, then
races to the mall where she works to try to make up. But wily thief
Jimmy Scalzetti (Roberts) is there on a mission of his own, pulling
off one last score to pay for his son's leukemia operation.
Scalzetti's crew takes shoppers and employees -- including Cat,
naturally -- hostage.</TE>
<TE>   This tale is a derivative kick, thanks to writer-director Charles
Robert Carner's knack for pacing and straight-faced comic relief.
Action junkies will enjoy stunts such as Morgan using a giant
Christmas tree to break his fall from the mall's top floor, and fight
scenes like one in a sporting goods store involving hockey sticks and
archery arrows.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite the likable Cain is a menacing but sympathetic presence
in Roberts, sad-eyed and unusually soft-spoken. His Scalzetti is no
mustache-twirling bad guy, but a cunning, decent man who does the
wrong thing -- he's a cross between Alan Rickman in "Die Hard" and
Denzel Washington in "John Q." You can root for him without a trace
of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "Christmas Rush" proves there's no crime in following a familiar
recipe, if you do it well.</TE>
<TE>   "The Christmas Shoes," directed by Andy Wolk and adapted by Wesley
Bishop from a book and song of the same name, is an uninspiring start
to Lowe's career after "The West Wing." You have to wonder if by New
Year's he'll be resolving to get his old job back.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe plays Robert Layton, a workaholic who neglects his loving
wife, Kate (Maria Del Mar), and their 12-year-old daughter, Lily
(Amber Marshall). On the other side of town, Maggie (Williams),
Lily's beloved choir leader, is preparing for the school Christmas
concert. When she suddenly faces a life-threatening illness, she
realizes every moment with her husband and 8-year-old son, Nathan
(Max Morrow), must count.</TE>
<TE>   As Robert and Nathan both search downtown for the perfect
last-minute gift, their paths cross serendipitously. When Robert
helps Nathan buy a pair of red shoes for his mom's final Christmas,
the man learns life's most important lesson from the boy: It's all
about the family.</TE>
<TE>   Among many coincidences, the store has just one pair of the shoes,
which fit Maggie perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Sappy music and corny dialogue make this journey all the rougher.
Robert's mom tells him, "Don't just make money, make memories." But
that would require a different movie.</TE>

<HD>TV shows that were 'Brilliant, but Canceled'</HD>
<DH>Trio, a cable channel devoted to arts, next month will show
series that appealed more to critics than viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the winter forecast calling for the traditional flurry of
midseason shows in January, next month provides a timely reminder of
television's most maddening conundrum -- namely, how pressure to
amass the widest possible audience so often prevents TV's cream from
rising to the top.</LD>
<LD>   Trio, a cable channel devoted to the arts, explores this dynamic
with "Brilliant, but Canceled," a festival of flops that includes a
two-hour documentary by the same name Dec. 8. The schedule gets
underway Monday at 4 and 7 p.m. with the short-lived "East Side/West
Side," to be followed through the month by series -- among them
"Kolchak: The Night Stalker," "The Ernie Kovacs Show," "Now and
Again," "United States" and "Profit" -- that were hailed by critics
but failed in the ratings.</LD>
<LD>   For Trio, acquiring shows that few people watched in the first
place amounts to an inexpensive no-brainer. After all, TV stations
and cable channels jockey for after-network rights to "Friends" and
"CSI," not "Action" and the short-lived anthology "Gun."</LD>
<TE>   There's also something appropriate about a network available in
only about a sixth of U.S. homes paying tribute to programs that went
largely unseen -- perhaps the inevitable result of a 200-channel
universe, creating shelf space even for discontinued products.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of dedicating a month to canceled shows raises
intriguing questions, perhaps foremost among them whether some series
are, as the documentary proposes, simply "too smart, too edgy or too
hip for TV."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tension between television -- implicitly a mass medium --
and good work," noted Trio President Lauren Zalaznick, who said the
"Brilliant, but Canceled" concept could become a recurring event or
even a regular franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Television's history is certainly littered with laudable programs
that died prematurely. The special, in fact, offers a depressing
parade of shows that tested boundaries and challenged conventions --
from "Twin Peaks" to "My So-Called Life," "Buffalo Bill" and "Freaks
and Geeks" -- a quartet that didn't last half as long, put together,
as "America's Funniest Home Videos."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could say that the best shows I've done are the ones
that were most successful. It's just not true," Ian Sander, a
producer on NBC's short-lived gem "I'll Fly Away," concedes in the
program.</TE>
<TE>   This examination of how TV treats its best material also comes at
a time when the relationship between fans and television is changing
-- not in the sense that people suddenly become attached to shows
that don't endure (they always have), but because the Internet has
created an outlet for them to mobilize and share their passion and
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   The one problem with this democratic exercise is that it's easy
for "save our show" organizers to lose sight of the fact that a few
thousand disgruntled folks with laptops do not a hit make, and that
artistic merit notwithstanding, as former CBS programming chief
Michael Dann flatly states, "there's no such thing as a successful
show with poor ratings."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in his interview, veteran manager-producer Bernie
Brillstein calls campaigns on behalf of low-rated series "a waste of
time," an assertion unlikely to be embraced by zealots pining for
series such as the Sci-Fi Channel's "Farscape."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the truth is that since "Cagney &amp; Lacey" made its Lazarus-like
return from cancellation in 1984, it's hard to remember a case where
fan reaction significantly swayed network lightning-seekers facing
the dilemma of a quality series that just won't spark commercially.
As Brillstein asks sympathetically, "How do you know how long it
takes for the public to get used to something?"</TE>
<TE>   A show's demise frequently comes down to factors beyond its
control, from bad timing to bad time periods. Consider NBC's "The
Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," which mined some of the same terrain
as "Sex and the City" in the late 1980s but in hindsight was probably
more suited to the less demanding environs of pay cable.</TE>
<TE>   "My So-Called Life," by contrast, had the misfortune to premiere
in 1994 opposite "Mad About You" and another program that made its
debut that year, "Friends." The drama starring Claire Danes drew only
marginal ratings, but ABC still hasn't been able to match its modest
audience in that hour since dropping it.Fans have grown more
technically savvy about lobbying for shows than they were in
"Cagney's" day, raising money to place ads and bombarding network
officials with e-mails. Even if these efforts do little more than
line the pockets of a billboard company or Hollywood trade paper, for
some the sense of community fostered becomes an end in itself.</TE>
<TE>   Producers and actors connected to ill-fated programs, meanwhile,
sound more resigned to the idea that in television, longevity is not
always based on merit.</TE>
<TE>   Dabney Coleman, who starred in the pretty brilliant and very
canceled "Buffalo Bill" and "The 'Slap' Maxwell Story," speaks to
this mind-set by telling his interviewer that the more intelligent a
person is, "the less you watch television. That's just a fact."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, Trio, the Internet and local events like
Un-cabaret's "The Other Network" -- a weekly showcase of unaired TV
prototypes, introduced by their creators -- at least offer producers
the consolation of knowing that some people found their
network-rejected babies to be beautiful. They also forge bonds among
fans and demonstrate that there are intelligent people out there who
take their quality television very, very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, such minor victories don't pay the rent, but it's
always nice to have your brilliance recognized, even if it doesn't
make you any less canceled.</TE>

<HD>Twisting path between dreams and reality</HD>
<DH>Painting at Santa Monica gallery explore metaphysical
questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly Myers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the center of the first image in Nancy Jackson's "The Dreamer" --
a keenly mystical, 12-part series of gouache paintings -- is a
fair-skinned male figure in a loincloth who sits in a lotus position
on a patch of bare earth. This figure is the eponymous dreamer, whom
we will follow over the course of the next 11 images, on a winding
path between dream life and reality.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by the writings of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, the series
is an appealingly accessible exploration of some potentially daunting
metaphysical questions.</LD>
<LD>   In the first image, we find him suspended between his two worlds:
in an archetypically idyllic landscape -- a river, trees, snow-capped
mountains in the distance -- that is marred by a busy strip of
freeway. In the ones that follow, he shifts from Edenic forests and
peaceful oceans to living rooms and shabby street corners, struggling
to disengage himself from earthly attachments and become one with the
dream itself.</LD>
<TE>   Accompanying each image is a sentence or two of text, written by
Jackson, that suggests the terms of the struggle without dictating a
particular narrative. "There is need of a whole world of torment in
order for the individual to produce the redemptive vision," reads one
passage, alongside the image of the dreamer floating peacefully in a
monster-infested sea. Another, posted beneath an image suggesting
Adam and Eve, declares: "It is the lot of the dream to creep
gradually into the narrows of personal fact, and to be treated by
some later time as a unique event in history."</TE>
<TE>   The real poetry of the series is in the delicacy of the painting
-- in the feathery white lines that make up the churning sea; the
expressively twisted tree trunks; and the pale, willowy figures that
seem as untainted by artistic pretension as they do by worldly
concerns.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I had an Ivy League degree, was teaching high school in Pacific
Palisades on an emergency credential, taking classes at night and
holding down a second job at a community college. While sitting in
traffic I'd imagine the day I could leave North Hollywood and move
closer to work. And then I had it, the slip of paper catapulting me
near the top of the LAUSD pay scale. It was time to move.</LD>
<LD>   Given that I didn't have much money for a down payment, I first
considered the Teacher Next Door program: The federal government pays
half the price of a home, provided a teacher lives in a specific
neighborhood. But the available addresses weren't going to work for
my family.</LD>
<LD>   I then called a real estate agent, who assured me that though
prices were high, mortgage rates were low. It was time to break into
the housing market. Every day I studied the offerings on the multiple
listings service: West L.A., Westwood, Culver City, Palms, Venice,
Santa Monica, Pico Robertson. I could not afford a small house in any
of these areas.</LD>
<TE>   No problem. Although I grew up in Southern California, I had lived
on the East Coast in tiny apartments for years. I knew one could
raise a family without a backyard and thousands of square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The search was on for condominiums. The broker, knowing my wife
and I have two boys, that we wanted safety, good schools and a
relatively short commute to the Westside, raved about a large condo
in Culver City. It was large enough and within our price range. What
got me, though, were the two shops half a block away, large signs
advertising "Guns, Ammo, Rifles, Firearms." The condo itself: no more
charm than a cheap motel.</TE>
<TE>   We continued the search. I wanted Westwood. A cute
1,100-square-foot condo across an alley from a Jiffy Lube. How about
a mile farther west? Same square footage, lower price. Architectural
style? Basic shelter. Neighborhood? A car dealership at the end of
the alley.</TE>
<TE>   Given my income, the agent shook her head when I mentioned Santa
Monica. Still, she did show my wife a nifty 900-square-foot place
next to a tile factory where saws serenaded the neighborhood. Then we
were outbid on a condo in the Pico-Robertson area. This was probably
a blessing because the price would have meant another job and less
time with family.</TE>
<TE>   We finally found a condo -- 1,250 square feet, no view, busy
street and are now in escrow. My friend says there is "light gang
activity" in the neighborhood, which, for me, is acceptable, the key
word being "light." It is only two miles from the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   I am a success story, sort of. But I am able to jump into the
market, in part, because my mother can help me with closing costs.
But what of the Angelenos who cannot afford to buy and don't have
generous mothers? Some people, usually homeowners who bought when
prices were low, claim that those priced out of the market should
stop whining, that they should leave cities where they have families,
jobs and roots to seek lower-cost homes. After all, the reasoning
goes, these are just market forces at work. Well, maybe, with a
little greed thrown in.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I have joined the 68% of Americans who own their own
homes, I am not hoping for real estate prices to drop. I would,
however, wish salaries to rise, so I might pay my mortgage and have
money for a night out once every couple of months.</TE>

<HD>No 'Village' for an Autistic Child</HD>

<LD>In an article about autism, the parents ended the piece by saying,
"We worry about what will happen to our son when we're gone. Who will
take care of him?"</LD>
<LD>   That's all well and good, but as a parent of an autistic child, I
worry about today. They say it takes a village to raise a child. But
what's a parent to do when the members of his own tribe aren't very
willing to embrace a child with disabilities?</LD>
<LD>   To worry about who will take care of my own autistic son tomorrow
is a worry to me, but I find it's all I can to do to make room for
the emotions of how people do or don't treat him today. My relatives
don't invite us to dinner, fearing the inevitable tantrums that my
son will throw. Well-intentioned cousins stopped issuing birthday
party invitations after my son was born, and I fully understand.
There is even one loving relation who excludes my son, only including
my daughter in plans. My head tells me that her discomfort is
reasonable, and I don't want to deny my daughter's interaction with
her, but my heart aches for my son.</LD>
<TE>   Finding baby-sitters is no easier task. My husband and I have
managed to grab dinner and a movie now and again, as long as the
baby-sitter isn't alone with our son. When my daughter is with my son
the tantrums are few because he has a familiar, loving face to
connect with. Without her, we've gotten frantic phone calls in the
middle of our appetizers, begging us to come home, the screaming in
the background unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   So who will take care of our son when we're gone? They say that
when autistic males reach puberty that the escalating hormones can
exacerbate their autistic behavior. I've read of families who worked
around the clock with their autistic toddlers to "pull them from the
brink of autism" (getting them to communicate, socialize, be
potty-trained and have fewer tantrums), only to lose them again when
they become teenagers. These are kids who are eventually medicated
and institutionalized because they become unmanageable for their
families. Taking care of my child today is a 24-hour job, and I can't
do it alone. There are therapists, specialists, educators and
professionals working daily to help my little square peg fit into the
round holes of society.</TE>
<TE>   While neighborhood moms schlep to soccer, music, religious school,
Little League and Scouts, we drive to speech, physical, occupational,
behavioral and other therapies. I don't for one minute consider
myself to be less fortunate than those moms, but I do sometimes find
myself grieving for the mom I might have been. My daughter, who
doesn't have a neurological disability, has to live with half a mom
because I don't have the time or energy. This doesn't mean that her
life isn't full and enriched; it just means that I regret not having
more to give.</TE>
<TE>   As parents we all have worries and concerns for our children and
their futures. We all have expectations and desires for their lives.
We worry whether they will grow up into confident, independent and
capable adults. We hope that they'll be able to work and pay their
bills on time. We want them to find love and friendship. And I do
worry about who will be there for my child when I am gone.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the attention being given to the autism epidemic will
continue so that there will be money put aside not just for research
into the causes of autism but also funds for tomorrow to sustain the
lives of the many people diagnosed with autism today.</TE>
<TE>   It is my hope that the village steps forward and embraces all of
these children, and there will be no need to ask what will happen
when the parents are gone.</TE>

<HD>'South-Central' Label Distorts the Truth</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bravo for Marcy De Veaux's critique of the media's egregious misuse
of the term "South-Central" (Voices, Nov. 23). The site of the tragic
murder of Merlin Santana is in the Crenshaw district, near the
predominantly black community of Leimert Park, a formerly white
enclave that was deemed to be within the boundaries of the Westside
when racially restrictive covenants prohibited blacks from residing
there up until the 1950s. It wasn't until whites began moving out of
areas like Leimert Park en masse in the 1960s that the boundaries of
South-Central began miraculously expanding farther westward and the
designation became cultural shorthand for any predominantly black
(and presumably less desirable) neighborhood in the city.</LD>
<LD>   The "devolution" of the black west side into South-Central offers
deep insight into the intractability of racial segregation in L.A.,
for, ultimately, this brand of misrepresentation allows the
mainstream media to cling to the myth of cultural pathology when
depicting communities of color -- further devaluing the lives of
black and brown crime victims.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Covert racism, like slapping the "South-Central" badge on a
perfectly good community just because it's black, only serves to
defame that neighborhood to protect surrounding communities from
having to shoulder the burden of the nearby crime problem. Such
characterization is potentially destructive when it comes to
image-driven costs of living like insurance and property values, as
De Veaux suggested, not to mention psychological images imported to
the most vulnerable residents, investors and potential visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully Police Chief William Bratton and the people of Los
Angeles will ignore the context in which this and many other stories
are reported and reject the "crime-ridden" characterization.</TE>

<TE>   "As Killings Ebb and Flow, Fear Keeps Its Grip on South L.A."
(Nov. 25) is heartbreaking. I feel so sad for the victims' families
and for those who must live their lives with those "rules."</TE>
<TE>   Am I left with writing my elected representatives to demand that
the local, state and federal agencies devote more resources to
reverse this situation? What steps should those agencies take? Better
education? But the "better education" isn't going to occur unless
it's safe for the residents to be taught and the teachers to teach.</TE>
<TE>   Is a bigger police force needed to provide security until the
people of that region have the education necessary to believe that
they can find a career that is fulfilling spiritually and
economically? Is the bottom line that the gang members will need to
feel like they have a stake in society before they develop empathy
for other people? Probably so.</TE>
<TE>   I have no hope that the law-abiding residents of South Los Angeles
can take back their communities by themselves. They will need the
government's help, and help from communities and people who are
better off.</TE>
<TE>   I also have little hope that the current Republican administration
cares about this problem or that it will do much to resolve it,
unless it comes under tremendous pressure. I hope to be proved wrong
on that point, but we need to apply the pressure, just in case.</TE>
<TE>   We citizens had better start addressing this problem now in a
serious fashion or it will only get worse, and more people will be
forced to live and die in such terrible conditions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Numbers Game Is Bad Medicine" (Opinion, Nov. 24) is not a service to
your readers. Dr. Scott Gottlieb's notion that lives are threatened
by timid surgeons is simply absurd. He knows full well that in our
market-driven health-care system the decision to operate depends more
on reimbursement than risk. He asserts that analysis of practice
patterns is misleading and that the "government's heavy-handed
tactics" make surgeons afraid to take on tough cases. This is pure
baloney.</LD>
<LD>   It is true that a centrally managed bureaucracy is not the way to
improve health care. But Gottlieb's only positive idea, that patients
ought to gain enough surgical knowledge to make better treatment
decisions, is just a pipe dream. Please spare us these polemic
defenses of free-market medicine, even when they feature a tasty
anecdote in the intro.</LD>

<HD>Homeland Security Shuffle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday the president and Congress patted themselves on the back
for creating the Department of Homeland Security, a glorified
shuffling of the federal bureaucracy ("Homeland Agency Is Big at
Birth," Nov. 26). In signing the bill creating the "new" department,
President Bush said that its responsibilities would include analyzing
possible terrorist threats, monitoring noncitizens traveling inside
the U.S. and gathering information to protect U.S. citizens from
global hate groups.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't this an admission that the FBI, CIA and Immigration and
Naturalization Service, among other federal intelligence agencies,
have failed miserably in doing their jobs? What have the thousands of
people who work in those agencies been doing all this time as
terrorists plotted and then carried out their murderous plans?</LD>
<LD>   How about some real reform within the federal agencies charged
with protecting American citizens on our own soil and around the
world, so that we don't live in fear that another 9/11 could happen
again?</LD>
<TE>   Talk about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</TE>

<TE>   Regarding the homeland security bill: I am extremely sure that if
Joe Blow's or Ali Abdullah's bank account is surveyed for noticeable
jumps by the FBI and CIA, Mr. Big Brother's computer will generate a
flash; I am not so sure if this would happen to the "creatively
financed" bank accounts of the Enrons and WorldComs or the accounts
of those who can afford to lob succulent viands over the wall to our
Washington fat cats. Or even those agencies that supply illegal arms
to U.S.-supported regimes that continue to backfire on this country
and pollute the world with poisons such as depleted uranium. It will
clearly accelerate the process of even more U.S. citizens losing
faith in the government.</TE>

<TE>   Is the cost of liberty in America having to live under the

Who decides what is terrorist activity in the homeland security
agenda? Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft. Dancing, drugs, abortion and peace
activists are offensive to Ashcroft. Let us all be thankful during
this holiday period that the Bush-Ashcroft theocrats haven't fully
implemented their new social order on America yet.</TE>

<TE>   In the name of national security, the Bush administration supports
a rollback of civil liberties for terrorist suspects, regardless of
U.S. citizenship, and a reduction of labor union rights for federal
employees, and now is recommending a comprehensive database on all
citizens that will surely trample everyone's right to privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the Bush administration also continues to support the
position of one of its major contributors, the National Rifle Assn.,
which opposes such a national database on gun purchases. Can't any of
them see the hypocrisy and inconsistency?</TE>

<TE>   Re "U.S. Breaks Old Legal Ground," Nov. 25: The Bush
administration is using the "war on terror" as a pretext for
curtailing civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Padilla and John Walker Lindh are both American citizens who
were accused of collaborating with Al Qaeda terrorists. Lindh is an
American citizen who was captured on foreign soil in actual battle
[in Afghanistan] but was formally charged and allowed to have an
attorney and due process, eventually entering a guilty plea on advice
of counsel.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, citizen Padilla was plucked off a plane on U.S. soil
(Chicago) but is being held indefinitely without charges as an
"illegal combatant," though he was nowhere near a battlefield, and
(unlike the World War II precedents cited) there is no formal
declaration of war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials keep trying to tell us how much they
support Latinos; so why is someone named Jose Padilla held
indefinitely without charges, while a white boy named John Walker
Lindh is allowed his constitutional rights?</TE>

spreading manure, the Republicans take aim at anyone who doesn't look
or think like them and in the near future we are all required to
stand in line, raise our right hand and then sign a statement: "I am
not now, nor have I ever been, a member of Al Qaeda."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Unfair to North Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "N. Korea's Foolish Gamble," editorial, Nov. 22: In the Agreed
Framework of 1994, the construction of two light-water reactors and
the supply of heavy fuel oil were agreed to by the U.S. as a
consideration for North Korea's freezing its graphite-moderated
nuclear reactors, not for North Korea's giving up nuclear weapons
programs. North Korea agreed to remain a party to the international
nuclear nonproliferation regime in exchange for a U.S. promise to
provide it with formal assurances against the threat or use of force,
including nuclear weapons. The U.S. has yet to fulfill this promise.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is the country that once invaded North Korea. Fifty years
later, it still maintains a 37,000-strong force on the doorstep of
North Korea. Its president openly brands North Korea as an "axis of
evil" nation. Its defense report officially names North Korea as a
target for preemptive attack. Thus, the risk of American military
invasion is not phantom but real to North Koreans.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea was never self-sufficient in food. Its rigid system
and poor management may have contributed to the worsening of the
situation. But if the U.S. gives North Korea a legally binding
nonaggression pledge, Pyongyang could substantially reduce its
military expenditures and save enough money to import food. A U.S.
nonaggression pledge would not be a new reward for North Korea. It's
the price Washington agreed to pay eight years ago in order to buy
Pyongyang's renunciation of nuclear ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Hwal-Woong Lee</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial counsels North Korea: "Spending money on weapons
instead of food and moving at a snail's pace to overhaul a
disastrously mismanaged economy threaten the nation more than the
phantom risk of invasion." North Korea and Iraq -- and thousands of
California's super-productive farm workers who nevertheless don't
know where they'll get their next meal from -- could give the U.S.
the same advice.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lion</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial posits that North Korea is making a "losing bet." I
beg to disagree. Just who is going to call the bet and make North
Korea pay off? President Bush declared war on the "terrorists," and
that worked so well that he has found it expedient to go to war with
Iraq. He has made clear that the U.N. and international law do not
constrain him, and the rest of the world's outlaws won't hesitate to
follow his lead.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has stated his policy: Might makes right. The next step in
Asia is easily foreseen -- China's takeover of Taiwan. The Republican
administration and its commitment to business as usual will certainly
not be willing to argue with its business partners in China, and our
armed forces will be occupied in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The next step after that may very likely be that North Korea will
begin a forceful reunification with South Korea. The United States
will not be in a position to do anything to prevent it, and China
would undoubtedly take advantage of the opportunity to embarrass the
U.S. again. After all, "might makes right." Now we will see who is
truly the mightiest. God bless America.</TE>

<TE>   "Striking Iraq, Stroking North Korea" (Opinion, Nov. 24) was
confused at its core. Jay Taylor asks why the president hasn't
"adopted a similar policy of deterrence and diplomacy toward Iraq" as
he has applied to North Korea. This question comes after Taylor has
expended quite a bit of newsprint explaining that while defeating
Iraq militarily will be a fairly easy matter, taking on North Korea
could be catastrophic for us and may turn Seoul into a "sea of fire."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't Taylor answer his question before he asked it?</TE>

represents a threat. Elementary strategy holds the answer: When
confronted by two enemies, don't be afraid to take them on -- one at
a time.</TE>

<HD>Instant Runoff Voting Would Help Ailing System</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Skelton is wrong in his Nov. 25 column, "Only Fed-Up Voters
Can Fix State's Damaged System for Picking Legislators." He suggests
having open, nonpartisan primaries, but this wouldn't improve
anything, especially because it would limit the general election to
only two candidates, among other things.</LD>
<LD>   Instant runoff voting might help. Under this system, votes are
cast for the candidates in order of preference. So, if your first
choice is the Libertarian candidate, you mark him or her as first
choice. Mark your second choice accordingly and the same with the
rest. If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate with the
least votes is eliminated and his or her votes are distributed to the
remaining candidates according to the next choice on those ballots.
The winner is the candidate with the highest preference by a majority
of the voters.</LD>
<LD>   This system would allow more participation in elections for voters
of all political ideologies. It makes much more sense than meddling
in the political parties' internal affairs using open primaries or
limiting the choice in the general election to two candidates. Find

<TE>   Those who excuse their not voting give a variety of reasons, such
as: All politicians are a bunch of crooks; there's no difference
between the parties; we need a new centrist party because both
parties are dominated by their particular radical extremists; one
vote isn't going to matter anyway. Unfortunately, there is a little
merit to each of these excuses, but not enough to constitute a valid
excuse for not fulfilling your patriotic duty to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Not all politicians are crooks. The parties are very different.
While they both support capitalism, they differ substantially in the
amount of control they believe necessary for it to work properly.
Having more than two parties creates more problems than it solves.
Look where it has been tried. You also miss the chance to vote a
favorite and miss canceling an opposing vote. The truth is, those who
give the above-mentioned reasons for nonvoting are as uninformed as
they are delinquent.</TE>

to let his family know that, at nearly the moment of his passing, a
group of students from Willow Elementary and Round Meadow Elementary
could be heard singing his song, " 'A' You're Adorable," to an

<LD>Re "Agile Minds in Idle Cars," Nov. 23: It should be obvious to
everyone by now that California freeway construction will never be
able to keep pace with the increase in the automobile population. I
have driven over much of Europe, where $5-a-gallon fuel is the norm.
With the average European car much smaller than U.S. cars, congestion
and parking in cities are as bad or worse than what we experience.
Their mass transportation systems are much better than ours but,
politically, mass transit has given way to the automobile.</LD>
<LD>   A feasible solution is an extensive surface and sub-surface mass
transportation system. A common mistake is requiring mass
transportation to pay for itself, and drivers are not enticed or
forced out of their cars. Mass transportation should be provided at
bargain fares. The economic return will come from less downtime in
traffic, no parking fees, reduced freeway building, reduced smog and
reduced commuter insurance costs.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Residents Assail Plans to Expand 101 Freeway," Nov. 23: When a
freeway is expanded, rather than increasing traffic speed, the added
lanes encourage additional use and the increased capacity is absorbed
by the higher demand. Proof of this is seen in the fact that there
has been constant freeway construction in Southern California, but
average freeway speeds continue to drop.</TE>
<TE>   There is an alternative, and we look to the Pasadena Gold Line
light rail system as an example of a cost-effective, environmentally
sound project. Pasadena formed a new agency for the specific purpose
of installing a light rail line from Union Station to Pasadena. The
line is being constructed on time and within budget and will be open
in July. The 101 Freeway corridor already has the Red Line from Union
Station to Chandler Boulevard, and if this line is continued to
Warner Center, there will be no need for an expansion of the 101.</TE>
<TE>   At peak rush-hour use, the Red Line can move more than four times
the passenger volume of a five-lane freeway and nine times the volume
of a dedicated busway. The Cahuenga Pass is a geologically active
area, and as we have witnessed in too many Southern California
earthquakes, elevated freeway structures fail with catastrophic
results. Conversely, subways around the world have been unaffected by
seismic events.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to make a commitment to rail.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A better headline for "Shifting Gears to Become a Teacher" (Nov. 22)
would be "Shifting Gears to Lose Your Social Security Benefits."
People thinking about making a midcareer change to teaching should be
aware that current Social Security laws will take away much of their
earned Social Security benefits when they retire from their second
career of teaching. Retired California teachers also lose their
Social Security survivor benefits. Private-sector workers collect
both their private pensions and Social Security in full. Only
teachers and other public employees are discriminated against by the
government pension offset.</LD>
<LD>   The demand for new teachers cannot be met unless public schools
can recruit teachers from among those now working in private-sector
jobs. Talented people who want to become teachers are unfairly
penalized at retirement. The solution is for Congress to repeal the
Social Security offsets by passing HR 2638 and SB 1523, sponsored by
Reps. Howard McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) and Howard Berman (D-Mission
Hills) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). President Bush should be
a real "education president" by signing these bills.</LD>

<LD>Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board (letter,
Nov. 24), cannot really believe a zero-emissions vehicle is possible.
No engine is zero-emissions or nonpolluting. Any combustion engine
will produce water, carbon dioxide or other gases, either directly or
indirectly in the production of its fuel. Electric vehicles just move
the pollution source to another location. There is also particulate
pollution from the tires, brakes, etc.</LD>
<LD>   Diesel power should not be discounted, since diesel engines are
much more efficient than gasoline engines. We just need to clean up
the exhaust.</LD>

<LD>Re "Scores Lag in Higher Grades," Nov. 24: Good college admissions
officers consider high school graduates' SAT scores, the level of
challenge in the courses they took, their grades, their
extracurricular activities and the degree to which the students have
overcome challenges. When administrators tell students that colleges
consider high schools' Academic Performance Index scores when they
look at individual applicants, they avoid stressing the truth about
the API: Chambers of commerce, real estate agents and home buyers are
really the only ones who care about these virtually meaningless
numbers.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mr. Hart's Teachable Moment," Nov. 19:</LD>
<LD>   I am a 14-year-old freshman at Kennedy High School in Sacramento,
and I am in the Program for Accelerated Education. I have read your
recent article about PACE and noticed that the focus is entirely on
the history part of the program and former state Education Secretary
Gary K. Hart, who teaches that part of PACE. Hart is a tremendous
asset to our program, but he's only half of the reason why it's so
good. The English half of the program, taught by Richard Johnson, is
inspiring and exciting students like me to challenge ourselves, too.
I never thought I'd say this, but I actually look forward to going to
this class every day.</LD>

<LD>Re "Risks to Pedestrians on the Rise, Study Finds," Nov. 21:</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps some of the pedestrian deaths can be attributed to Charles
Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest. While driving, I
often see pedestrians, including women pushing baby carriages, who
look straight ahead while crossing a street in a crosswalk and do not
bother looking to see whether traffic is going to stop or possibly
hit them.</LD>
<LD>   Some of these deaths could be avoided if people would take
responsibility for their own safety and not risk their lives on
assuming drivers will not make a mistake.</LD>

<LD>The doomsday scenario of an asteroid wiping out the Earth while
humans cower helplessly in fear has always seemed unsporting -- a
kind of ultimate drive-by shooting from outer space. But in the new
issue of the scientific journal Nature, scientists have, well,
exploded the notion that asteroids capable of causing catastrophic
damage hit the Earth as often as had previously been reckoned. It
turns out that the frequency is only about once every 1,000 years,
instead of every 200 to 300 years.</LD>
<LD>   With a new environmental hazard seeming to appear almost each day,
it's almost comforting to know that at least one threat to the Earth
has been downgraded. The researchers drew on formerly secret data
held by the departments of Defense and Energy to conclude that even
if an asteroid of the size that wiped out 700 square miles in Siberia
in 1908 were to hit the Earth every 1,000 years, a city would
probably be destroyed only every 30,000 years because the planet is
made up mostly of ocean.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it's a game of numbers. These objects, also known as minor
planets, number in the hundreds of thousands. They're the junk of
space, the residue of a planet destroyed in the distant past. Most
travel in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. But some
adventurous ones have taken a detour and headed for the Earth -- and
a good thing too for us. Scientists see an asteroid that hit the
Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago as the cause of a chilling
climate change and the extinction of dinosaurs, and perhaps the rise
of mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Asteroids have given in the past, just as they could take away in
the future. But if Nature is to be believed, for now these identified
flying objects can recede from the worry list.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles is home to multimillionaire movie execs and billionaire
developers. When it comes to the overall value of its goods and
services, L.A. County does better than Switzerland, Sweden or
Austria. It is also the poverty capital of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   To measure the widening gap between the region's haves and
have-nots, the United Way of Greater Los Angeles crunched numbers
from dozens of government and private studies. Its recently released
report, "A Tale of Two Cities: Promise and Peril in Los Angeles
County," found that the rich are not getting richer so much as the
poor are getting poorer.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone is familiar with studies showing that wages increase with
education, but lack of formal learning is not the sole reason for the
gap. The United Way study found that wages for those with the lowest
level of education are actually declining.</LD>
<TE>   Some industries never recovered from the recession of the early
1990s. Many high-paying aerospace jobs disappeared for good. Seven of
the 10 fastest-growing occupations -- retail sales clerk, security
guard and cashier among them -- pay less than $25,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 811,000 residents work off the books as day laborers
or nannies, earning substandard wages and no benefits. Almost 2
million people -- more than in any other metropolitan area -- eke out
an existence on less than $18,100 a year, the federally defined
poverty level for a family of four. The burden is even greater in
this area, topped only by New York City and San Francisco in cost of
living.</TE>
<TE>   In a time when lack of education increasingly means a life of
poverty, 30% of county residents over 25 have never finished high
school. Among the 36% who are foreign-born in L.A. County, many are
immigrants from Latin American countries with low levels of
education.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario is that Los Angeles becomes a city divided
between ghettos and gated communities. But the United Way study also
paints a city of promise, where immigrants contribute youth and
vitality to the workforce and forge a multiethnic, multilingual
version of Los Angeles that has strong links to an ever more global
economy. The way to get from peril to promise is for all of Los
Angeles to recognize the benefits of narrowing the rift between very
rich and very poor.</TE>
<TE>   United Way supports literacy classes, quality child care,
affordable housing and other ladders to the middle class. And a
strong middle class makes the best bridge between what would
otherwise be two cities doomed to isolation and fear of "the other."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After 150 years in which California stole, bought or appropriated
water whenever more was needed, the state is in viewing distance of
chronic water shortages. Warning signs are everywhere -- in the
trickle of water flowing in the Colorado River this year, in the
damage that massive pumping by water projects has done to the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta fisheries and in global warming
forecasts that are finally beginning to alarm the state's water
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The days of thirsty cotton farming and irrigated pasture in
California are numbered, even if the farmers gushing
taxpayer-subsidized cheap water onto their land think otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the Colorado. Southern California has enjoyed a bountiful
supply of water because of huge surpluses in Lake Mead behind Hoover
Dam generated by years of heavy snowfall in the upper Colorado River
watershed. Drought set in three years ago with sobering results. Lake
Mead has plummeted by nearly 8 million acre-feet, roughly the amount
of water Southern California consumes in two years. The lake level
has dropped 59 feet.</LD>
<TE>   At a Nov. 22 conference in Anaheim, city and farm water district
officials and state legislators declared the days of building more
and bigger dams and reservoirs over. There's not enough water still
to be collected to justify the huge cost. Science, technology and
creative thinking will have to lead the way to new supplies.</TE>
<TE>   For cities, desalination of ocean water finally seems to be
economically feasible. The San Diego County Water Authority recently
signed an agreement for construction of a $270-million desalination
plant, to open by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno), the retiring water guru in the
Legislature, drew gasps from the water delegates at Anaheim when he
said that more farm-to-city water transfers might reduce agriculture
production by a million acres or more. Costa is right. When San Diego
is willing to pay Imperial Valley farmers $278 an acre-foot for water
they get for $15.50 (one acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough
for two average families for a year), the shift is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers in the Imperial Valley are also hearing their own water
district asking for "extraordinary measures" to conserve water --
after years of official denial that anyone was wasting a drop. The
Metropolitan Water District, which wholesales water to all of
Southern California, and the San Diego County Water Authority also
are launching major conservation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Global warming could significantly cut long-term supply on the
rivers that provide the bulk of California's water because more
moisture in the mountains would fall as rain rather than snow. The
snowpack is the most important reservoir of all, holding the moisture
until the spring melt and runoff. This could happen within 25 to 50
years, said officials of Scripps Institute of Oceanography, as
California's population grows past 50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Growth alone in the coming decade could increase water demand by 3
million acre-feet a year at current usage.</TE>
<TE>   California's water has traditionally been doled out by a select
circle of officials known as the "water buffaloes," urban and farm
water district officials and their lawyers, who protected their own
interests first. That worked as long as there was water to waste. In
California, those days are gone for good.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Makes Few Changes in Merger Bid</HD>
<DH>The company submits a modified DirecTV deal to the FCC for
approval, but chances appear slim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Satellite television giant EchoStar Communication Corp.'s latest
merger plan looks like a rerun.</LD>
<LD>   The company's last-ditch attempt to salvage an $18-billion
acquisition of rival DirecTV Inc. is based chiefly on its previously
announced proposal to offer some satellite frequencies to Cablevision
Systems Corp. Observers say there is hardly any chance the deal will
go forward.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar filed the modified merger plan Wednesday with the Federal
Communications Commission, in the hopes that the agency would see it
differently than the Justice Department did when it rejected a
similar proposal last month because of anti-competitive concerns.</LD>
<TE>   The FCC had rejected EchoStar's original blueprint but gave the
company until Wednesday to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, FCC officials expressed strong doubt
that their concerns would be addressed by selling satellite slots to
Cablevision, which hopes to launch a nationwide satellite service
next year. FCC officials are skeptical that Cablevision has the
financial strength to compete against a merged EchoStar and DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union, had not yet
seen the revised bid, but said he doubted that the FCC would reverse
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed so rigid in their reaction against the merger," said
Kimmelman, who supports the deal because he believes that it would
enable the combined company to better compete against local cable
operators, thereby lowering cable rates. "I would hope the FCC would
have an open mind, but I'm doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   The FCC released the modified plan Friday without comment.
EchoStar executives declined to comment, and Cablevision executives
did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   A merger between EchoStar and DirecTV, owned by El Segundo-based
Hughes Electronics Corp., would create a satellite giant with 18
million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the modified plan, EchoStar would agree to transfer 51
satellite slots to Cablevision, theoretically restoring competition
after the merger of EchoStar and DirecTV. EchoStar also would agree
to license its products to Cablevision and share its transmission
facilities until Cablevision gets on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   The terms are similar to concessions offered last month to the
Justice Department. Justice attorneys subsequently ruled that the
Cablevison concessions did not go far enough, and filed suit to block
the merger.</TE>
<TE>   But this week's filing marks the first time those concessions have
been formally presented to the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   In its filing with the FCC, EchoStar insisted that the
modifications are "significantly broader" than what was proposed to
the Justice Department. It also complained that the FCC used a double
standard in approving the recent AT&amp;T Corp.-Comcast Corp. merger but
rejecting the marriage of EchoStar and DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, EchoStar appeared eager to challenge the
Justice Department, making an emergency request for an immediate
trial. But a federal judge denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar is racing against the clock to win government approval
before its merger agreement with Hughes expires Jan. 21. Hughes is
permitted to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances if
the FCC has not approved the deal by Jan. 6, EchoStar said in its
filing.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes executives have said they do not expect to extend the
deadline and are anxious to collect a $600-million breakup fee that
they say EchoStar owes their company.</TE>

<HD>Protecting Your Good Name From Thieves</HD>
<DH>During the holidays consumers are more at risk from schemes
using their identity and credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News this week that federal authorities uncovered what they described
as the largest U.S. identity-theft case in history left many
consumers wondering if they are at risk.</LD>
<LD>   And with good reason. Tens of thousands of consumer credit reports
were provided to a ring of New York-based identity thieves, according
to authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Victims of the scheme face substantial risks. Credit reports
contain an array of personal data, including bank account information
and credit card numbers, that can be used to drain checking accounts,
apply for credit cards and even get new loans in the victim's name.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers aren't liable for fraudulent charges, but sometimes it
can take years to repair the damage an identity thief can do to a
person's credit record.</TE>
<TE>   The holiday season traditionally is when consumers are at greatest
risk of being victimized. Holiday shoppers are vulnerable to losing
wallets and credit cards to pickpockets, while at the same time
retailers are pushing "instant credit" that can be secured easily
with the information in the average consumer's wallet.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at who's at risk from identity theft and what can be
done to prevent it -- or recover from it.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What is identity theft?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Identity theft usually involves a criminal using personal
information to apply for credit cards or other loans in the victim's
name. Typically, the criminal will run up thousands of dollars in
charges and then disappear, leaving the real consumer to fight with
creditors, collection agents and credit-reporting agencies after the
crime has been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, hardened criminals also are using identity theft to
hide their real identities while committing more serious crimes, said
James Vaules, chief executive of the National Fraud Center, a
Philadelphia company that designs computer systems to thwart identity
theft.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, we looked at identity theft as a financial crime,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's used in all types of criminal activity today, whether
that's fraud or terrorism or drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you know if someone is using your identity?</TE>
<TE>   A: Usually you don't, said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse. Victims typically find out that their identity
has been stolen about 14 months after the fact, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the fraud is discovered because the real consumer
has been denied credit because of defaults caused by the criminal, or
the consumer learns of the fraud from a collection agent hoping to
collect on the criminal's debts.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How can you defend against identity theft?</TE>
<TE>   A: Guard your credit cards and, most importantly, your Social
Security number -- the key to virtually all other private personal
data.</TE>
<TE>   Don't carry a Social Security card in your wallet -- it's not
needed to conduct any retail transaction, said Leslie Walker,
spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But if your number is taken by a criminal, it can be used to
obtain credit cards, open bank accounts and to apply for auto loans
or to create fake identification papers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You think you may be a victim of identity theft -- now what?</TE>
<TE>   A: The first step is to call the three major credit bureaus and
get a copy of your credit report. If you believe you are an
identity-theft victim, the report will be provided for free. If not,
there's a charge of $8 to $10.</TE>
<TE>   Check the entries on the report and call the credit bureau
immediately if you notice accounts that do not belong to you.</TE>
<TE>   Other warning signs are addresses listed on the report that are
not yours or a spate of recent "inquiries," which can be precursors
to issuing new credit that hasn't shown up yet on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What can the credit bureau do?</TE>
<TE>   A: The credit bureau should do two things: put a "fraud alert" on
your file, which will require credit grantors to call you before
issuing new credit in your name, and send you forms to dispute the
inaccurate items.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Should I notify the police?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. In many instances, the only way to have fraudulent entries
erased from your credit record is to supply the credit grantor with a
copy of a police report verifying the identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   You also may want to call the Federal Trade Commission's
identity-fraud hotline to obtain more information about ways to
repair credit damaged by identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where to turn in case of ID theft:</TE>
<TE>   If you suspect you're a victim of identity fraud, get a copy of
your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus:</TE>
<TE>   * Equifax: (800) 525-6285</TE>
<TE>   * Experian: (888) 397-3742</TE>
<TE>   * TransUnion: (800) 680-7289</TE>
<TE>   For tips on credit repair, call the Federal Trade Commission's
identity-fraud hotline at (877) ID-THEFT.</TE>

<HD>Publications Offer Gifts for the Millionaire on Your
Holiday List</HD>
<DH>Robb Report and duPont Registry cater to readers who are
'recession-resistant.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Wilson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can't think of the perfect stocking stuffer for those well-heeled
friends on your Christmas list this year?</LD>
<LD>   What about a customized jet for $70 million? Or a Formula One
super car? Or an $80-million submarine?</LD>
<LD>   Those are some of the suggestions from the Robb Report and the
duPont Registry, two publications that cater to folks not too
concerned about economic downturns.</LD>
<TE>   The submarine is one suggestion from the Robb Report, which comes
up with a list of 21 gifts for its money-is-no-object readers each
Christmastime.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of our readers haven't really been impacted by the
economy slowdown. They are recession-resistant," said Brett Anderson,
senior vice president and editorial director of Malibu-based Robb
Report.</TE>
<TE>   The duPont Registry's holiday gift catalog also features highbrow
stocking stuffers: A $450,000 Bentley Estate Station Wagon is
described as "the ultimate family vehicle for the truly refined
lifestyle." A pair of McLaren Formula One super cars go for about
$1.5 million apiece.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a 1968 Mercedes-Benz 600 Presidential Landaulet,
built for Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, for $295,000. And it
has only 30,000 miles on the odometer.</TE>
<TE>   The well-to-do also are hanging out at home a lot more.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of spending on home -- entertainment theaters, wine
cellars, commercial-grade kitchens," Anderson said. "They are
creating their own theater and restaurant in the home. It's
cocooning."</TE>
<TE>   Tom duPont, chairman of St. Petersburg, Fla.-based duPont
Publishing, said the duPont Registry items are designed to impress.
But they also reflect America's trend of staying home.</TE>
<TE>   "Along with the nesting, there is nesting going on in the garage,"
duPont said. "People with resources are buying classic and luxury
cars -- the everyday car, the weekend car and the commuter car."</TE>
<TE>   The duPont Registry and the Robb Report definitely aren't for the
Chia Pet crowd. The average annual income of a Robb Report reader is
$800,000, with an average net worth of $4.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Robb Report's list includes a 144-carat diamond necklace at
$10 million, a customized private jet for $70 million, the new
$350,000 Daimler-Chrysler Maybach 62 sedan, a $1.6-million Formula
One Ferrari, a residence in London's fabled Regent's Park for $29.9
million and a $1.25-million 24-day America's Cup vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Too expensive? How about an original copy of Ian Fleming's "You
Only Live Twice," signed by the author, for $75,000?</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said there's been a subtle change in the buying habits of
the rich because of the dot-com bust and stock market slide.
Conspicuous consumption is seen as tasteless by some.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more interested in discreet luxury," Anderson said.
"Back in the heyday of the dot-com boom, executives were buying
$200,000 and $300,000 Ferraris and there was a lot of show there.</TE>
<TE>   "What has changed is Robb readers are going back to basics --
spending on the home, classic cars and historic artifacts and
antiques.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more self-conscious about displaying wealth."</TE>

<HD>Dow Marks Its Eighth Straight Week of Gains</HD>
<DH>Similar streak has not been seen since March 1998. But
indexes slip Friday as stocks remain vulnerable to profit taking and
war worries.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock indexes slipped Friday, but the Dow industrials still
managed to notch their eighth straight week of gains -- and their
biggest two-month advance in more than 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said Friday's drop amid light trading wasn't particularly
surprising after blue-chip stocks surged 255 points Wednesday on
better-than-expected economic data.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street was closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and markets were
open for only half a day Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "The market is really hanging in there pretty well," said Barry
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.59 points, or 0.4%, to
8,896.09. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.16 points, or 0.6%, to
1,478.78. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 2.56 points, or 0.3%,
to 936.31.</TE>
<TE>   Winners and losers were about even on the New York Stock Exchange
and Nasdaq. Volume was scant on what is traditionally one of the
lightest trading days of the year.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow gained 1% to stretch its winning streak to
eight weeks, a feat not seen since the period ended March 20, 1998.
The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, their seventh week
of advances in the last eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow's two-month gain of 17.2% was the largest since January
and February of 1987, when blue chips climbed 17.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said optimism is growing about the strength of the
economic recovery, and investors are hastening to jump aboard the
current rally. Since hitting a five-year low Oct. 9, the Dow has
gained about 1,600 points, or 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts caution that stocks remain vulnerable to declines on
profit taking. In addition, many investors were watching to see how
retailers fared Friday, the traditional opening of the holiday
shopping season.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is getting a little bit ahead of itself, and people
are getting a little bit leery of buying stocks," said Dan McMahon,
head of listed trading at CIBC World Markets. "You will see more
people taking profits at these levels in the short term. The economy
seems like it has bottomed and the soft patch is behind us, but there
doesn't seem to be any real expansion."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, worries remain about the threat of war with Iraq and the
possibility of more attacks on the United States. Thursday brought a
deadly suicide bombing at an Israeli-owned hotel and an attempt to
shoot down an airliner full of Israeli tourists, both in Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   The market also was rattled Friday by news that United Airlines'
machinists union rejected wage concessions that were part of the
company's effort to stay out of Bankruptcy Court. Shares of United
parent UAL slid $1.18, or 32.5%, to $2.45.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields dipped after surging Wednesday. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 4.21%, down from 4.25% on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks were mixed as investors awaited the results of the
first big holiday shopping weekend. Home Depot added 31 cents to
$26.40 and Sears, Roebuck gained 88 cents to $27.70. But Wal-Mart
Stores fell 94 cents to $53.90 and Target slipped 52 cents to $34.78.
The Amex index of 20 retail stocks rose 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   * Toy retailer FAO tumbled 45 cents, or 16%, to $2.30 after the
company warned that it would not meet its earnings target this year
because of weak sales. FAO operates upscale children's toy stores FAO
Schwarz and the Zany Brainy and Right Start chains.</TE>
<TE>   * EP MedSystems surged $2.52, or 105%, to $4.92 after the company
said the Food and Drug Administration gave it approval to market its
Alert catheter system in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   * Sealed Air soared $13.72, or 56%, to $38.20 after the company
said it agreed to resolve all pending and future asbestos-related
claims against it for less than some investors had feared.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement boosted hopes that other companies were close to
resolving their asbestos woes. Honeywell International rose $1.57 to
$26.01 and Halliburton rallied $2.18 to $21.37. Georgia Pacific
jumped $3.05 to $20.62.</TE>

<HD>7 States Decide Against Microsoft Case Appeal</HD>
<DH>Only Massachusetts vows to continue the fight. California
Atty. Gen. Lockyer says he will focus on enforcing the settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California and six other states said Friday that they would drop
further antitrust litigation against Microsoft Corp., giving the
software giant a measure of relief from its legal battles.</LD>
<LD>   Of the nine states that opposed Microsoft's landmark settlement
with the Justice Department, only Massachusetts said it planned to
press forward with an appeal. West Virginia will announce Monday
whether it will join Massachusetts in appealing the settlement, which
was ratified by a federal judge this month.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement requires Microsoft to release more technical
information about its operating systems and bars it from punishing
computer makers that install non-Microsoft programs on their
machines. Critics have contended that the settlement should have done
more to prevent Microsoft from abusing its monopoly power in emerging
markets such as hand-held computing and Web-based services.</LD>
<TE>   In deciding against an appeal, California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
echoed the sentiments of his counterparts in Connecticut, Florida,
Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Utah and the District of Columbia by saying
he would focus on enforcing the settlement approved Nov. 1 by U.S.
District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.</TE>
<TE>   "We determined that the potential for success of an appeal is
slim," Lockyer said. "The only basis for an appeal is either abusive
discretion by the judge or that the remedy approved is ineffective.
Those are very hard claims to prove."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer already has reassigned the senior assistant attorney
general who led California's Microsoft team. Thomas Greene now heads
a task force pursuing criminal and civil investigations into whether
the state's energy markets were manipulated during the electricity
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the difficulty of an appeal, Massachusetts Atty. Gen.
Thomas Reilly said he planned to pursue his case against Microsoft on
the basis that the current settlement is "replete with loopholes."</TE>
<TE>   "The remedy does not protect consumers," Reilly said. "It does not
restore competition to the marketplace and does nothing to hold the
company accountable for its illegal behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Reilly, known in his state as an activist attorney general with a
pro-consumer bent, has taken on a number of high-profile cases.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Reilly suggested in the wake of the Catholic Church's
sexual abuse scandal that all hiring at the Boston Archdiocese should
be vetted through his office. In another case, Reilly this year held
up the sale of the Boston Red Sox, saying the baseball team's chief
executive failed to accept the highest bid.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Reilly faces an uphill battle with Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem like anyone would be successful," said Rob
Enderle, a research fellow at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara,
Calif. "But you have to remember that the attorney general's office
is a political one. Continuing a fight will undoubtedly get them
publicity and funding for their reelections." Microsoft refrained
from commenting directly on the decisions of the states.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of today's announcement, our focus is on complying
fully with the court's judgment, working collaboratively with
governments to address important public policy issues and on
developing innovative products that benefit consumers," company
spokesman Jim Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly's ruling capped a five-year case in which federal
prosecutors accused the company of using its position as the dominant
provider of desktop operating systems to drive competitors out of
business. Monday is the deadline to decide whether to appeal the
settlement, which requires Microsoft to reimburse the states for
nearly $30 million in combined legal expenses incurred thus far.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Massachusetts, Microsoft still has to contend with
numerous other pending cases. The European Commission is
investigating the Redmond, Wash., company for antitrust violations in
the markets for server computers and media players.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also faces suits from competitors -- including Netscape
Communications Corp., now a division of AOL Time Warner Inc., and Sun
Microsystems Inc. -- as well as class-action lawsuits filed on behalf
of U.S. consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares lost 40 cents to close at $57.68 on Friday in
light trading on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>An Upscale Urban Village Emerges in Genteel Pasadena</HD>
<DH>The housing boom is bringing new residents and a new
vitality to the city's commercial center.</DH>

<LD>Forget the Little Old Lady from Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The San Gabriel Valley city, thanks to a surge in urban-style
residential projects, now is attracting the likes of David and Nicola
Berlinsky.</LD>
<LD>   The young couple moved last summer from San Francisco into a
$469,000 condominium at the Hudson, a new 15-unit building at Locust
Street and Hudson Avenue near downtown Pasadena. The two of them, who
walk to the nearby movie theaters, bookstore and other shops, said
they were attracted to the area because it offered the same city feel
they left behind.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't think we could get that here, but we found it," said
David Berlinsky, 30, a digital film and video editor, of the urban
lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, the same intersection near Lake Avenue and the
210 Freeway has become the hub of an emerging upscale neighborhood of
$600,000 condominiums and $3,000-a-month penthouse apartments. "It's
become a neat little village," said Alex Wong, a partner in Trammell
Crow Residential, which built the 214-unit Alexan CityPlace
apartments at the southeast corner of Locust and Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood is part of a residential building boom
orchestrated by city officials and private investors that is rapidly
infusing new life into central Pasadena. Nearly 2,000 housing units
have been built recently or are under construction, and hundreds more
are in the planning stages, according to city estimates. The new
development translates into nearly 4,000 additional residents for the
city of about 133,000 and puts Pasadena at the vanguard of
communities -- ranging from giant Los Angeles to tiny Brea -- that
are encouraging housing in their commercial cores.</TE>
<TE>   Toward a 24-Hour City</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is crazy about Pasadena's construction boom, and the
flood of new units has many rival landlords offering move-in deals to
attract tenants. But the surge in new residences is helping to
accommodate a growing population and sustain a vibrant downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "It really helps support the urban environment that we are trying
to create," said Eric Duyshart, the city's business development
manager. The new residents "help support our retail downtown and make
it a 24-hour city."</TE>
<TE>   The projects range in size and style, from small and sleek lofts
to huge and conventional apartment complexes. Apartments and
condominiums have been squeezed into bustling Old Pasadena and
plopped above the new Paseo Colorado shopping mall. South of Old
Pasadena near Arroyo Parkway, Los Angeles-based Urban Partners is
building a 347-unit apartment complex that will wrap around a light
rail station on the upcoming Metro Gold Line. The trains will run
from downtown Los Angeles to the eastern edge of Pasadena starting in
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred apartments under construction or in development
along Colorado Boulevard means that more people will be watching the
Rose Parade from the comfort of their living rooms instead of camping
out in the cold.</TE>
<TE>   "There appears to be solid demand for this type" of urban housing,
said Fergal McHugh, vice president of Capital &amp; Counties USA Inc., an
investment firm that is teaming up with apartment owner and operator
Shea Properties to build a $70-million residential and retail project
on Colorado Boulevard near the historic Pasadena Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh and other developers are courting affluent singles and
young couples who have been attracted to downtown Pasadena, which
offers some of the vibrancy and amenities of urban life in a
relatively safe and clean environment.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the lure of city life and a shorter commute to their
jobs prompted Susanna and Robert Mellor to move out of an old house
in Claremont and into a new one-bedroom apartment above Paseo
Colorado, where average monthly rents start at about $1,700.</TE>
<TE>   "It's urban but still manageable," said Susanna Mellor, 30, a
grade school teacher, as she and her husband left their building for
an evening stroll along Colorado Boulevard. "We are comfortable
here."</TE>
<TE>   Many area merchants welcome the newcomers. Restaurant owner Peter
Bissias says the opening of the Alexan apartments and other nearby
residential complexes has not only boosted his business by about 15%
but also has improved the character of his commercial strip, which
primarily had been the domain of daytime office workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changed the neighborhood in a positive way," said Bissias,
who has owned Conrads restaurant on Walnut Street since 1982. "You
see more younger couples coming in. You see more people walking their
dogs. It has more of a community type of feel."</TE>
<TE>   Steering Growth</TE>
<TE>   Much of the residential growth has taken place recently, but the
groundwork that made much of it possible was undertaken in the early
1990s, when the city updated its general plan, Duyshart said. To
preserve the character of the city's single-family neighborhoods,
planners and city leaders decided to steer future population growth
and development toward Pasadena's commercial center, which stretches
roughly between Lake Avenue on the east to Old Pasadena on the west.</TE>
<TE>   The recession of the early 1990s dampened interest in housing
construction, but developers returned later in the decade as the
economy improved.</TE>
<TE>   While lauded by planners and developers, the downtown housing boom
has its critics.</TE>
<TE>   Affordable-housing advocates have complained that much of the
construction is too expensive for low- and moderate-income residents.
They have sued the city, alleging that it has failed to plan for
housing for low- and very low-income residents in violation of state
law. (The city recently required private developers to set aside a
portion of their projects for low- and moderate-income residents.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, concern is growing among many longtime residents about
what the growth means for nearby residential communities in terms of
increased traffic and noise. Plans by the Worldwide Church of God to
build about 1,700 housing units on the former site of Ambassador
College near Old Pasadena have resulted in fierce opposition from
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "When they start thinking about where all that traffic is going to
go ... they see it coming through their neighborhoods," City
Councilman Sid Tyler said. "I'm hearing a lot about this."</TE>
<TE>   To some, a more dense and urban Pasadena might seem out of place
in a city better known for its leafy neighborhoods of restored
bungalow homes and Craftsman mansions along the Arroyo Seco. But the
change was inevitable given the area's location near the heart of
metropolitan Los Angeles, city officials and developers say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the next logical, evolutionary step for Pasadena," developer
Dan Rosenfeld of Urban Partners said. "It's not a distant suburb
anymore."</TE>

<LD>The cost of funds index for savings institutions in the Federal Home

September, lowering monthly payments on adjustable-rate mortgages in
California, Arizona and Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The index sets payments through December. It also is used as a
base rate for West Coast mortgages and for bonds backed by those
loans.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyson Foods Inc. said three employees of a subsidiary have been
targeted by federal regulators over alleged improprieties in
financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   Tyson said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that regulators said they were recommending enforcement action
against the workers at DFG Foods, a subsidiary at the heart of a
dispute over Tyson's acquisition of IBP Inc.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ruled last year that Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson could
not back out of its planned $4.7-billion acquisition of IBP. The
meatpacker has since been rolled into Tyson operations.</LD>

previous month, indicating demand is recovering, an industry study
said.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose to $12.5 billion in October from $12.3 billion a month

<HD>Nike, Foot Locker Going Toe-to-Toe Over Sneakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nike Inc. knows who's been naughty and nice. So now that it's nearly
Christmas, is it time for a little retail revenge?</LD>
<LD>   Some say that's exactly what the athletic shoe behemoth has in
mind for its biggest customer, Foot Locker Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Although Nike will be releasing limited editions of Air Jordan
models to Foot Locker's rivals during the holiday shopping season, it
won't be sending a single pair to the New York-based retail chain.</LD>
<TE>   A Nike spokeswoman said the move is strictly business, driven by
shifting alliances within a competitive industry and Foot Locker's
desire to stock less-expensive items.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and insiders say Nike's decision to snub the nation's
largest sneaker outlet is nothing less than payback -- the latest
twist in a corporate slap fest between two of the biggest names in
the $16.3-billion athletic footwear industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Nike's trying to discipline them," said Theresa Meyer, an analyst
for investment firm D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. "This has kind of shaken up
the sneaker world a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Call it the battle of the Big Foots.</TE>
<TE>   With $5.5 billion in footwear sales alone, Nike is the undisputed
king of athletic shoe makers, with revenue more than twice that of
rival Adidas. Nike is known for marquee brands that are high priced,
marketed with celebrity sizzle and feature cutting-edge technology.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Foot Locker rules retail. It racked up $4.4 billion in
2001 sales via its nearly 3,600 worldwide outlets, most of them in
suburban malls.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies have been in lock-step as the athletic shoe
market has ballooned. Foot Locker is Nike's biggest customer, buying
11% of its output. Nike is Foot Locker's biggest supplier, accounting
for nearly half of the shoes on its shelves.</TE>
<TE>   The star of Nike's lineup is the Air Jordan, named after
basketball superstar Michael Jordan. During a recent "retro" launch
of a classic Jordan shoe, there were near-riots at malls in
Sacramento and Ohio. Teenagers willing to wait for hours to be among
the first to buy Nike's newest Air Jordan model could depend on
finding it at a Foot Locker.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The tale of the latest Jordan releases tracks a relationship that
has become increasingly strained over clashing visions of the sports
shoe market, according to analysts, executives' remarks and
Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Things started to chill earlier this year, after Nike released its
latest model, the Air Jordan XVII. Packaged in a silver metallic,
velvet-lined briefcase with a "making of the shoe" CD, the basketball
sneakers cost an unprecedented $200 a pair. Fifty percent were sold
within four days, an impressive rate but relatively sluggish for
Jordans, which typically hit that figure in the first two days. The
industry standard is 15% sell-through in the first two days,
according to a Nike spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the initial flurry of purchases, analysts say Foot Locker
struggled with the Jordan XVII line as well as Nike's $160 Shox,
Vince Carter's signature model.</TE>
<TE>   Foot Locker executives declined to comment this week, but the
company's 2002 first-quarter report blamed a 5.5% drop in operating
profit on "markdowns taken to sell slow-moving marquee product."</TE>
<TE>   Citing tighter consumer purse strings, and locked in dogfights
with other retailers offering deep discounts, Foot Locker changed
course.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials announced in May that they were scaling back
high-end orders and adjusting their definition of marquee shoes to
mean pairs costing $90 to $120.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts interpreted the move to mean that Foot
Locker was using its leverage as a top retailer to differentiate
itself from other chains that carry Nike, as well as to persuade the
manufacturer to give it more favorable wholesale prices.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Steve Nichols, president and chairman of K-Swiss
Inc., a Westlake Village-based athletic footwear company, said Foot
Locker was following the lead of consumers, who amid the soft economy
have been shunning fancy, higher-priced shoes for more affordable,
classic styles.</TE>
<TE>   "As large a company as Nike is, and as strong a retailer as Foot
Locker is, in the end the consumer talks," Nichols said. "And if you
don't listen, it's at your own peril."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the motive, Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike took an immediate
hit. The company reported that domestic orders were down 2.3% last
quarter, touching off a flutter in the stock price and chatter among
analysts. (On Friday, Nike shares dipped 31 cents to $44.78 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Foot Locker shares rose 13 cents to $13.40,
also on the NYSE.) Then Nike took action, according to SEC filings.
It slapped limits on the top-of-the-line shoes Foot Locker would get
-- even if it wanted them.</TE>
<TE>   The point was made abundantly clear in October, when Nike
re-released an earlier model, the Jordan IX. Nike turned down Foot
Locker's requests for a piece of the action. The chain was forced to
stand on the sidelines while eager customers swamped competitors such
as Footstar Inc. for the shoes, which sell for $125 a pair.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Nike sort of snubbing them," said Virginia Genereux, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch Securities who has called the fight a
"clash of the titans"</TE>
<TE>   Nike is digging in its heels even harder. The company has crossed
Foot Locker off its list for the launches Dec. 14 and Dec. 26 of
other vintage Jordan models.</TE>
<TE>   It also is doubtful Foot Locker will get a piece of the newest
model, the Jordan XVIII, when it debuts in February at $175 a pair,
Nike spokeswoman Joani Komlos said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some say the move is a definite "in-your-face," Komlos
characterized the decision as "symbolic of the shift in the
relationship" between the firms.</TE>
<TE>   "And symbolic does not mean we're taking this product away and
shame on you, you can't have it," she said. "Our relationship will
continue with Foot Locker.... It's not like they're the enemy. We
agree to disagree."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how long the spat will continue is anyone's guess. In a
conference call last week, Foot Locker's president and chief
executive, Matthew D. Serra, said his company felt no pain from
losing its priority on launch products. He also said it was placing
large orders with "new, hot suppliers" that have "worked out very,
very appetizing buying terms."</TE>
<TE>   As for Nike, still Foot Locker's biggest supplier, Serra said
talks were continuing and the firms were "on course to potentially
get back some of the special initiatives we had done in the past." He
estimated that Foot Locker's business with Nike would be down $150
million to $250 million through the holiday season and into spring.</TE>
<TE>   By then, predicted Nichols of K-Swiss, the relationship between
the giants should thaw.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are too important to each other," he said. "They will
figure out how to do business in the future."</TE>

<HD>With No Must-Have Toy, Bargains Rule</HD>
<DH>Parents search for the best buy without the added pressure
of finding the hottest gift. More manufacturers may benefit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toy shoppers began lining up at 4:30 a.m. Friday outside the Toys R
Us on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles in search of one thing --
and it wasn't a must-have toy.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they wanted a bargain.</LD>
<LD>   Claudia Santos, 33, and Rosa Bonilla, 40, came to buy a Game Boy
Advance hand-held device, which for $70 included a $30-value Super
Mario World game.</LD>
<TE>   Rosa Hernandez, 18, and nine family members came for, among other
items, a Nintendo GameCube and software, advertised at $200, or about
17% off. And Jonas and Vivian Calderon, 32 and 29, weren't sure what
to buy for the 21 kids on their shopping list, only that they wanted
good prices and a decent selection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not any one thing," Hernandez said. "We just know that every
year they have good specials."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the traditional holiday toy melee -- with parents pushing,
grabbing and driving to 18 stores in search of that one product
American children are clamoring for -- there is no consensus this
year on a must-have toy.</TE>
<TE>   There are contenders, to be sure. Many retailers are already out
of FurReal Friends, Hasbro's lifelike, battery-operated cats.
Rapunzel Barbie had proved a strong seller even before the start of
the holiday. RadioShack's pocket-size radio-control cars, ZipZaps,
are running scarce. And educational games also are popular.</TE>
<TE>   But without a clear winner in this year's toy contest, the race
remains wide-open for a share of the $23 billion that Americans are
expected to spend this year on non-video-game toys. About 40% of
those sales probably will occur during the next 3 1/2 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the $10-billion video game arena, the sheer volume of new
titles this year will make it difficult for any one or two of them to
rise above the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of toys -- 10 to 12 -- in the typical shopping
cart, and every basket was different," said Toys R Us Chief Executive
John Eyler Jr. after surveying New York-area stores Friday. "That's
less stress on parents, more kids get what they want, and it's better
for business. A group of toys collectively do a whole lot more
business than any one toy can do."</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers say the trend is good for the nation's biggest
toy manufacturers because parents are inclined to seek out classics
when there is no single hot toy on the shelf. El Segundo-based Mattel
Inc. and Providence, R.I.-based Hasbro Inc. own the largest number of
recognizable names, such as Barbie, Fisher-Price, Milton Bradley and
G.I. Joe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a time when brands actually have more value," said M. Eric
Johnson, a professor of management at Dartmouth College's Tuck School
of Business and an expert on the toy business. When parents aren't
sure what to get, "they're going to link into what they know."</TE>
<TE>   With parents likely to spend more time searching out gifts in the
absence of a hot toy, they also tend to turn to retailers with a wide
variety of goods, such as Toys R Us Inc. and KB Holdings Inc.'s KB
Toys chain.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing about a hot toy is, of course, that everyone is
talking about it and they come in looking for it," said KB's chief
executive, Michael Glazer. "The bad thing is that you disappoint an
awful lot of people" when supplies run out.</TE>
<TE>   "As a retailer," Glazer said, "you're frustrated you can't take
care of that customer. Sometimes it's nicer if there's a slew" of
offerings that kids want.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the phenomenon sometimes can work against the specialty toy
sellers. That's because, without a reason to go into a toy store,
some parents will buy things for their children wherever they happen
to be.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wal-Mart in Cerritos Towne Center on Friday, Beverly
Armstrong, a 40-year-old nurse from Los Angeles, pushed a cart
heaping with toys for her 2-year-old grandson, including Hot Wheels
and a Spider-Man web blaster.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said she was toy-shopping at Wal-Mart because she wasn't
looking for any toy in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm looking for specific things, that's when I go to Toys R
Us," Armstrong said. At Wal-Mart, "I can just pick things out."</TE>
<TE>   Discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. often offer popular items
at a fraction of the suggested retail price to lure shoppers into
stores. That's one reason Wal-Mart a few years ago took the title of
the nation's top toy seller from Toys R Us.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what creates a really hot toy is limited production. When
Cabbage Patch dolls, Tickle Me Elmo and Furby were all the rage,
manufacturers, retailers and parents were all caught off guard.</TE>
<TE>   "The scarcity was part of the appeal," said Sean McGowan, a toy
industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "You could
convey the social status of your children by procuring one."</TE>
<TE>   Small companies can put themselves on the map with a hot toy. And
the lure of creating the next big thing is one of the attractions
that keep inventors and other innovators coming back to the toy
design table, said Dartmouth's Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   But for most companies, having the hot toy may not be worth the
hype, Johnson maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "How many hot toys can you think of that were really turned into a
franchise, that five years later someone was really making money on?"
he said. "They weren't able to take Furby and turn it into something
like Barbie."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the biggest beneficiary of not having a must-have toy
might be parents, who can avoid horrendous lines, hassles and
potential heartache when something is sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Toy buyers probably shouldn't count their lucky stars just yet,
those in the industry say. A few years ago, Tickle Me Elmo was being
discounted just before Thanksgiving -- and then took off like a
rocket after the holiday after an appearance on a morning news show.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents still may get to the stage of hair pulling," McGowan
said. "We don't know what it is, but if the stores don't have enough
of it, parents will become desperate pretty quickly."</TE>

<HD>Union Asks 150 Funds to Support Corporate Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura Smitherman</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A government workers' union is asking 150 pension funds to support
its corporate governance proposals, including one each at Citigroup
Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. to let shareholders
list their choices for directors on annual company-issued proxy
ballots.</LD>
<LD>   The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
wants the public employee pension funds, which together manage more
than $1 trillion in assets, to vote their shares for the union's
proposals at 2003 annual meetings at 22 U.S. companies.</LD>
<LD>   The effort by AFSCME, which represents about 1.3 million
government workers, coincides with similar moves by other investors
and groups, such as the treasurers of state governments, as they seek
greater corporate accountability after financial scandals and
executive abuses at companies such as Enron Corp. and Tyco
International Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   "The fundamental problem with the crisis in the markets and the
lack of confidence in the markets is that shareholders don't have the
appropriate oversight, and their voice is continually not heard by
corporate boards," said Richard Ferlauto, director of pension
investment policy at AFSCME.</TE>
<TE>   The union also is asking companies to treat stock options as an
official expense on income statements.</TE>
<TE>   The proxy-access proposals at Citigroup, Exxon Mobil and Sears
would require that the companies change their bylaws. The other
AFSCME proposals -- including requests that Tyco and Ingersoll-Rand
Co. move their official headquarters back to the United States from
tax-haven Bermuda -- aren't binding because they merely urge that
certain action be taken by corporate managers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Citigroup and Exxon didn't return phone calls for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond said the company is reviewing the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Under current rules, dissident candidates for board seats must
send their own proxies to shareholders, a strategy that may cost tens
of thousands of dollars and has slim prospects for success.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO labor federation has said it plans to ask the
Securities and Exchange Commission for a rule change that would force
companies to print the names of dissident candidates on the proxies
they send to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The pension funds being petitioned by AFSCME include the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S.
public pension fund, and the New York City Employees' Retirement
System.</TE>

<HD>Fears Are Growing About United</HD>
<DH>Shares of the cash-strapped airline's parent firm lose
nearly a third of their value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines, the largest carrier at Los Angeles International
Airport, tried Friday to calm jittery travelers amid growing fears
that it is headed toward a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based UAL Corp., United's parent, also tried to calm
nervous investors -- but without success. Its shares lost nearly
one-third of their value Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The turmoil came in the wake of Wednesday's rejection of a pay cut
by United's mechanics union. The mechanics' acceptance of a reduction
in pay is key to United's securing a financial lifeline from the
federal government.</LD>
<TE>   The union's move prompted Standard &amp; Poor's on Friday to cut its
corporate credit rating on UAL and United to CCC-minus, only a few
notches from levels that indicate a loan default or bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The mechanics' vote makes bankruptcy virtually inevitable for
United and UAL," said S&amp;P credit analyst Philip Baggaley.</TE>
<TE>   The credit downgrade and a large loan payment due Monday weighed
heavily on Wall Street, where UAL shares plummeted $1.18, or 32.5%,
to $2.45 on the New York Stock Exchange during an abbreviated holiday
session. Earlier in the day the stock sank to $1.72, not far off the
more than four-decade low of $1.42 reached last month.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the company's growing financial problems, United
officials pledged Friday that Thanksgiving holiday travelers
returning home Sunday would not be affected. They also vowed to
maintain normal operations in case of a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Another major airline, US Airways, has been operating since filing
for bankruptcy reorganization in August.</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Jeff Green said the company has a plan on how it
will communicate news of a bankruptcy filing to travel agents and
customers, but said such an event "is not going to affect our flight
schedule at all."</TE>
<TE>   That's the word that travel agent Zulemi Iida at Fiesta Travel %
Cruises in Hollywood got when she called United to check on the
status of customers who had paid for tickets on United flights to San
Francisco, New Orleans and other destinations next week. The United
ticket agent Iida spoke with acknowledged that a bankruptcy filing
was "possible," but said the airline probably would continue service
without interruption.</TE>
<TE>   " 'We do not expect to stop flying. Tell your clients not to
worry. We're not going to shut our doors,' " Iida said she was told.</TE>
<TE>   Just to be certain, Iida had the United agent reconfirm each of
her customers' ticket reservations.</TE>
<TE>   At the United ticket counter at LAX, agents also were telling
customers that a bankruptcy filing shouldn't affect plans for booking
a trip.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was reassured. "I've been giving away tickets I got
with my [United frequent flier] miles because I'm afraid they're
going to go bankrupt," Manhattan Beach resident Michelle Hodges said.
"I gave my brother two tickets to Maui and my dad two tickets to
Paris."</TE>
<TE>   Hodges, a human resources manager for a pharmaceutical firm, said
she also has been flying on Continental Airlines more often lately.</TE>
<TE>   United has said it would forced to file a Chapter 11 petition if
it doesn't receive a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee that would
enable it to obtain $2 billion in private loans. The Air
Transportation Stabilization Board is expected to announce its
decision on the loan guarantee soon.</TE>
<TE>   The airline is counting on $5.2 billion worth of concessions from
its labor unions and employees -- belt-tightening that would show
federal officials that it is serious about cutting costs as part of a
proposed recovery. The decision by the mechanics' union members to
reject their share of the concessions could jeopardize the agreements
already approved by other labor groups. United employees own about
55% of the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   United faces a $375-million debt payment Monday, although a grace
period could push the deadline back to Dec. 16. The company's cash
reserves are believed to be around $1 billion and dwindling as its
operations lose an estimated $7 million a day.</TE>
<TE>   Green said the company would announce Monday whether it would make
the debt payment or take advantage of the grace period.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Glenda McCarthy and Ron White contributed to
this report. Associated Press was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>No Role for Salomon in National IPO</HD>
<DH>Citigroup's investment bank will not take part in the
initial stock sale for the firm run by daughter of Chairman Sanford
I. Weill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney investment bank has decided not
to seek a role in arranging the initial stock sale for National
Financial Partners Corp., a company run by the daughter of Citigroup
Chairman Sanford I. Weill.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company by
market value, is being probed by regulators for conflicts of
interest. Weill's daughter, Jessica Bibliowicz, is president and
chief executive of National Financial, a firm backed by financier
Leon Black that buys insurance and financial planning firms.</LD>
<LD>   "Sandy and Jessica agreed together that it was more appropriate to
use other bankers," Citigroup spokeswoman Leah Johnson said Friday.
She declined to elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for National Financial declined to comment except to
say Salomon will not underwrite the IPO. The New York-based company
said last month it plans to go public early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's decision shows how probes by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer and the Securities and Exchange Commission have forced the
company to reconsider the way it does business, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer is reviewing Weill's role in helping former Salomon
analyst Jack Grubman get his children into an exclusive New York
nursery school and Weill's request that Grubman "take a fresh look"
at AT&amp;T Corp., of which Weill was a board member. Citigroup was hired
to help arrange a sale of shares in AT&amp;T's mobile-phone business
after Grubman raised his rating on AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Weill agreed last month to leave the AT&amp;T board. He had been a
director since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup probably will pay a $500-million fine to settle
investigations into whether Salomon analysts misled investors, people
familiar with the talks said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares fell 9 cents to $38.88 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab Sued Over Termination Fee</TE>
<TE>   Charles Schwab Corp.'s $60 account-termination fee was instituted
this year without fair warning to customers and should be rescinded,
according to a customer's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Baker, a Los Angeles resident, sued the biggest discount
brokerage after it charged him $60 to transfer his assets to a rival
brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   The negligent misrepresentation and misleading advertising suit
seeks class-action status, unspecified monetary damages and an order
to strike the fee.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for San Francisco-based Schwab said he hadn't seen the
suit and declined to comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Schwab, which have fallen 20% in the last 12 months,
fell 2 cents to $11.54 on the NYSE.</TE>

<TE>   Fund Managers Betting on U.S. Economy</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund managers across the globe in November bet the U.S.
economy would gain momentum ahead of other regions and boosted
holdings of U.S. equities at the expense of Europe and Japan,
according to a Reuters poll taken this week.</TE>
<TE>   The survey of 43 fund managers showed investors were cheered by
the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the poll found.
Recently released economic data, such as the 2.8% rebound in October
durable-goods orders, buoyed sentiment for U.S. equities.</TE>
<TE>   Since hitting a five-year low Oct. 9, the Dow Jones industrial
average has climbed 22%. The FTSE Eurotop 100 index of European
shares has risen 18% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Fund managers in countries that use the euro raised their holdings
of U.S. stocks to an average of 54.1% of their total portfolios in
November, from 51% the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   British fund managers upped weightings of U.S. stocks, raised
European debt holdings and cut holdings of cash and Japanese stocks
in November, the poll found. Fund managers in Britain raised
weightings of U.S. stocks for the fourth month in a row and to the
highest weightings in more than 20 months.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. equity fund managers increased their allocation of U.S.
stocks to 50.9%, from 49.5% in October, while they cut their cash
reserves, reducing cash to 6.1% from 7.8% in the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. fund managers also cut their exposure to fixed-income
securities such as Treasuries, assuming that bonds would lose their
relative appeal as stock markets rose. They cut their average
allocation of Treasuries to 16.4%, from 23.3% in October.</TE>

<HD>Skimboarders See the Sport's Popularity Swelling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As one of skimboarding's pioneers flatly admits, his sport is about
25 years behind surfing in terms of popularity. But as skimboarding
gains converts each day from other new board sports, Tex Haines
believes the gap is closing quickly.</LD>
<LD>   "You only have to look ahead to see skimboarding is a fun sport
that has even more potential than surfing, because you can do it
almost everywhere," said Haines, owner of Victoria Skimboards in
Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Similar to surfing, skimboarding takes place closer to shore. The
ride starts with a slide across the film of water created by a dying
wave. The skimmer follows the water out as it recedes into the ocean,
then banks off the next wave and rides it back to shore.</LD>
<TE>   Haines points out that none of skimboarding's newest, freshwater
hot spots can be navigated by a surfboard: sand bars on the Virgin
and American rivers in St. George, Utah, and Sacramento,
respectively; irrigated baseball fields in Scottsdale, Ariz.; and the
banks of Lake Erie in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sport is slowly creeping across the country," he said.
"There's this merging of the sports going on: water skiing, surfing,
wakeboarding, snowboarding. And we're caught right in the middle of
all that."</TE>
<TE>   No one is more caught up in this convergence than Laguna Beach's
Bill Bryan, a nine-time world skimboarding champion, professional
snowboarder and professional surfer.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan's slender 5-foot-11, 155-pound frame and his wonderful
balance and hand-eye coordination allow him to compete professionally
in three sports, but his short attention span allows him to excel in
only one -- skimboarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Surfing is boring to me," Bryan said. "If I'm out there surfing
for an hour, I may only catch 10 waves. But if I'm skimming, I can
run for an hour and catch a hundred waves."</TE>
<TE>   That hyperactivity comes out a few minutes after Bryan arrives at
Laguna's Aliso Creek Beach, the epicenter of skimboarding. In
mid-sentence, he bails on the conversation and streaks toward the
surf -- dropping his teardrop-shaped skimboard on the smooth white
sand.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan picks up momentum as he glides on a film of water toward a
wave that is beginning to flatten out. As he leans back on his 4
1/2-foot-long foam board, he banks off the wave at an angle and
twists back toward shore, stopping for a 360-degree spin on his
return trip.</TE>
<TE>   He's only fooling around, but it doesn't take long to figure out
why Bryan is the top skimboarder in the world, according to the final
2002 Skim USA professional rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "He can read the variables in the water and react quicker than
most people," Haines said. "He grew up at the beach, and he's the
lightweight and chalky type. When you're extending the defiance of
gravity as long as possible, being lean helps immensely."</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between Bryan's electric rides and the early days of
"skimming" is striking. In the 1920s, Laguna Beach lifeguards began
skimming on 20-pound round pieces of wood. Today, an estimated 1
million people skimboard on 5-pound pintail-shaped boards (costing
anywhere from $175 to $350) using carbon-fiber technology adapted
from aerospace to achieve maximum lightness and buoyancy. There is a
even a mini-tour and a world championship, held every July at Aliso
Creek Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The sport was revolutionized in the early 1980s with the
introduction of foam-core boards that propelled riders farther out
into the water.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, riders threw their wood boards at their feet,
skimmed along the sand and threw themselves into the waves, with
their boards sometimes landing on top of their heads. Back then,
before the 360-degree spins and the aerial grabs, just gliding on top
of the water was enough of a kick.</TE>
<TE>   "When the water swooshes underneath you, it feels like you're
being jetted along at 35 miles an hour," said Haines, who started
skimboarding when he was 9.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel so strong, there's so much energy, and you're moving at
such a ridiculous pace that it's addicting to a little kid."</TE>
<TE>   Especially one who already knows how to skateboard.</TE>
<TE>   "With waves coming at you from all directions, it feels like a
skate park that never stops changing," said Haines, 50. "It's also
more gentle on the body. Water is a little more forgiving than
cement."</TE>
<TE>   Butch McIntosh, whose Skim Magazine is one of the sport's main
voices -- along with the Web site skimonline.com -- said many of the
latest and greatest maneuvers have come from skateboarders.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Bryan and the other top skimboarders have had to spend a lot
of time keeping up with creativity of the skateboarders," McIntosh
said. "Our sport is picking up new foot soldiers every day, and many
are skateboarders."</TE>
<TE>   McIntosh, Bryan and most of the sport's elite began riding at
beaches in Laguna. The spots are prime because of their steep slopes
and shore breaks. Beaches such as Huntington and San Onofre are
perfect for surfing but terrible for skimming, because the waves
break too far out and the beaches are flat.</TE>
<TE>   The slope of the shoreline helps give skimboarders momentum as
they push into the water and toward oncoming waves. The rest of the
push comes from the legs.</TE>
<TE>   The faster the start, the longer the glide, the better the ride.</TE>
<TE>   For Bryan, the keys are timing and speed.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get a feel for when the waves are breaking, you run for
them like there is a bear chasing you," said Bryan, 29. "If the
conditions are right, you don't mind doing wind sprints all day
long."</TE>
<TE>   When he isn't running wind sprints around the competition, Bryan
is spreading the skimboarding gospel through a series of videos he
produced with his brother, George, the No. 2-ranked rider and a film
major at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan said one of his biggest markets is Japan, where "skimming
has become a cult phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   Excited as he is about skimboarding's growth, he hopes the sport
learns some lessons from surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to see more competition and a higher level of riding,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But one of the best things about skimboarding is that it's not so
cutthroat. The attraction is still having the beach to yourself and a
few friends."</TE>

<HD>A Dance of Death for Kenyan Troupe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MSUMARINI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The blast that destroyed the Paradise hotel here may have been aimed
at Israeli tourists, but it shattered the lives and livelihood of
thousands of Kenyan villagers who relied on meager wages and tips for
their survival. Among the hardest hit were survivors of the five
dancers of the Giriama Dance troupe.</LD>
<LD>   Before he left his hut about 3:30 a.m. Thursday to welcome Israeli
vacationers, the troupe's leader, 55-year-old Safari Yaa, kissed his
wife goodbye and told her that when he returned, he would have enough
money to buy food for their nine children. Yaa never made it back.
Three suicide bombers slammed their explosives-laden sport utility
vehicle into the hotel's reception area, where the Giriama dancers
were performing for arriving guests.</LD>
<LD>   The entire troupe, including Yaa and his older brother Charo, was
wiped out.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the man we depended on," said Yaa's wife, Aisha, who is
eight months pregnant. "We don't know what we're going to do without
him."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this East African nation had paid a price
in the war between terrorists and the West. The 1998 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in the capital, Nairobi, killed more than 200 Kenyans.
Many among the 5,000 wounded lost limbs, their hearing or their
eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   There appears to be a consensus that the latest suicide attack
will take a toll on Kenya's floundering economy, which relies heavily
on tourists coming to enjoy the warm beaches and game reserves.
Tourism makes up 19% of the nation's gross domestic product and is
the second-largest earner of foreign currency after tea.</TE>
<TE>   People say it is difficult to imagine a village that would be more
affected than Msumarini.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, villagers began to deal with their losses. Graves were
being dug in anticipation that authorities would release the bodies
of the dancers. Every few minutes, the shrill, eerie wails of
mourning women pierced the village, a sprawling collection of tiny
mud huts surrounded by stout baobabs and swaying coconut palms.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mramba household, about 20 women sat under a mango tree
comforting Kadzo Masha, whose daughter died in the blast. Kafedha
Mramba, a 36-year-old widow, had taken care of her three children
with the tips she earned dancing for Israeli tourists at the Paradise
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing was Mramba's hobby, according to her father, Mweni Mramba.
Two years ago, after the unexpected death of her husband, she jumped
at the opportunity to join the troupe.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter, my daughter, what are your children going to do
now?" Elizabeth Hussein, the dead woman's aunt, wailed in her native
Giriama language. "Why did you go there?"</TE>
<TE>   For many Msumarini residents, the Israeli-owned Paradise hotel was
their only employment option. Most residents here live off the land,
harvesting small crops of maize, potatoes, beans and coconuts. The
hotel and its guests represented the main source of cash needed to
buy oil and other staples.</TE>
<TE>   Several hotel employees reported that they hadn't been paid in
months. The manager told them that their salaries from Israel were
delayed. A few months ago, management paid part of their wages with
small transistor radios and bedsheets, telling them the remainder
would follow soon. It never did.</TE>
<TE>   Yaa and his dancers did not receive a weekly wage but depended
solely on the goodwill of guests.</TE>
<TE>   Every Thursday, when a charter of about 250 tourists descended on
the resort, members of the troupe would be waiting in the reception
area to greet them.</TE>
<TE>   Safari and Charo Yaa pounded out robust African rhythms on their
homemade drums while Mramba and two other female dancers swayed and
jiggled. The dancers would leave the hotel with about $25 dollars in
tips, which they divided among themselves, according to Aisha Yaa.</TE>
<TE>   She said Thursday that her husband told her he would use his
portion of the tips to buy maize meal, tea and bread.</TE>
<TE>   "How are we going to eat? I don't know," Aisha said. "My oldest is
18 years old, and he doesn't have a job. We have nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The next moment, Aisha was wondering who would dig a grave for
Safari. The children were too young for that. Maybe, she said to some
neighbors who had come to her house to comfort her, other villagers
might be willing to help.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agreed that Msumarini -- a tiny village on the Indian
Ocean -- was an unlikely place for a terror attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents -- those who could afford a battery-powered radio
-- said they had heard about the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. but
didn't believe terrorists would come to their village.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a problem with them," said a bewildered Dreesen
Maye. "Why are they doing this to us?"</TE>
<TE>   Robert Chingere, a 19-year-old bead craftsman, fretted that his
livelihood went up with the flames that destroyed the hotel. Now
there was no one who would buy key chains, necklaces and wrist bands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest loss," he said. "It's going to take a little
while for people to realize that Paradise is no longer there."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, villagers were digging Mramba's grave. Evening was
approaching, and the five bodies would arrive any minute.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Head Back to Work, Still Smoldering</HD>
<DH>British leader Blair's uncompromising stance toward unions
is a bid to save his government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British firefighters will leave the chill of their picket lines and
go back to putting out fires this morning, a pause in a battle for
higher pay that has mutated into a much larger showdown between
resurgent union power and a Labor Party prime minister with a wary
eye out for old political ghosts.</LD>
<LD>   The strike, which began Nov. 22, has raised memories of 1970s and
'80s labor militancy in Britain, when union muscle rolled over one
Labor government before colliding with the immutable force of
Thatcherism. Prime Minister Tony Blair may not have sought this
confrontation with union leaders, but he is not shrinking from it,
telling the country this week that the days of crippling work
stoppages and inflationary wage demands "are over and are not coming
back."</LD>
<LD>   Britain's 50,000 firefighters have received no offer remotely
close to the 40% pay increases they are seeking, which, for a
four-year veteran, would mean a yearly salary of $45,000. Although
they returned to work, their union has already announced another
eight-day walkout to begin Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   After his government's initially confused response to the strike,
Blair took command this week, saying any significant pay increase
must be paid for by "modernization" of Britain's fire service. That
is widely interpreted as code for staff reduction, perhaps as much as
20% of the force.</TE>
<TE>   And he warned that any large, unconditional settlement for
firefighters would lead to similar demands across the public sector,
a mantra repeated by government ministers, business leaders and the
Bank of England throughout the week.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's uncompromising tack has political as well as economic
motives. The last Labor government unraveled in 1979 over its
inability to control the unions, a debacle that damaged the economy
and left the party scarred for years as unworthy to govern. That
reputation was shucked only by the general belief that Blair's
moderation could keep the unions at arm's length.</TE>
<TE>   But after governing for five years in relative labor peace, the
prime minister faces a movement that is replacing what it sees as
co-opted leaders with younger, more radical unionists who are only
too happy to show off their leftist credentials. Bob Crow of the Rail
Maritime and Transport union famously keeps a bust of Lenin in his
office.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister's tough line -- "Blair's Done a Maggie,"
declared Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, the Sun, referring
to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the Conservative Party
-- has infuriated these leaders and raised the specter of ricocheting
sympathy strikes throughout the public sector. A militant rump of
London subway drivers, municipal workers and teachers walked off
their jobs for short periods this week -- ostensibly over other
issues, because such secondary strikes are banned under Thatcher-era
laws.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people who are doing very, very well out of the current
economic system have gone hysterical over paying a fair wage to a
small group of workers," said Andrew Murray, a senior official of
ASLEF, the transport drivers union. "Small-c conservatives in this
country thought they had won a victory for all time, thinking they
could go to their graves having dealt with the unions, and they are
just dismayed that we're back, lively and assertive."</TE>
<TE>   But although a union demonstration in solidarity with the
firefighters is planned for Dec. 7, some labor leaders have privately
blanched. Closer public scrutiny of the firefighters' existing deal
has raised eyebrows over their two-day, two-night workweek -- they
are allowed to sleep during the night shifts -- and firefighters have
balked at adopting new practices such as joint control rooms with
police and ambulance services.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters also have resisted demands that they work
overtime -- perhaps, critics say, because it might interfere with
second jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is in increasing danger," said Matthew Taylor, director
of the Institute for Public Policy Research in London. "They thought
they had public opinion on their side at the beginning, in part
because of global sympathy for firemen after Sept. 11. But as the
strike has gone on, a lot of people are saying, 'Hold on, look at the
archaic nature of some of their practices.' And the firemen have
moved from being heroes to looking a bit tarnished."</TE>
<TE>   Nor has their cause been helped by the apparently smooth
pinch-hitting of the army, which stepped in to take over their
duties. The government has noted that 19,000 soldiers have coped with
fires while using a rough version of the joint control rooms the
government wants to see become permanent.</TE>
<TE>   From their picket lines, the firefighters sneer at the soldiers'
capabilities. "Anyone can squirt water on a fire, but these guys
aren't saving buildings. They are just letting them burn down while
protecting the building next door," said London fireman Tony Martin,
45.</TE>
<TE>   But the firefighters also admit to nagging worries that their pay
demands have put some cherished privileges on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not political with us. We're not trying to bring the
government to its knees," Martin said. "We just want a decent living
wage."</TE>

<HD>Tribute to Harrison Has That Special Something</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Sutcliffe</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>"This is a special night," Monty Python's Michael Palin told the
8,000 fans gathered Friday at Royal Albert Hall to pay tribute to
George Harrison. But something about his delivery and his
gold-lame-lapel tuxedo suggested that tear ducts should be kept on
standby for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   Solemnly, he continued. The "specialness" of this night, he said,
was so "special" that its overwhelming specialness would render all
other "special" nights, well, "unspecial." Because the bigness of the
very "big" person they had come to honor was so "big" that, by
comparison, the "biggest" of other "big" people's "bigness" would ...</LD>
<LD>   And by then there wasn't a dry eye in the house, but from people
falling about laughing rather than mourning the beloved former Beatle
who died last Nov. 29 in Los Angeles after a long battle with cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Harrison would have loved it -- not to mention the spirited Python
rendering of "The Lumberjack Song."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison loved the comedy troupe's rude surrealism and, given that
the profoundly spiritual Briton considered physical death a matter of
little importance, he would surely have been delighted by his old
pals from the "Life of Brian" movie days sticking it to the Grim
Reaper.</TE>
<TE>   So the tone was set for the all-star second half of the show: the
least mawkish of valedictions and almost two hours of rock 'n' roll
the Harrison way -- marshaled by Eric Clapton, rumored to have proved
a hard taskmaster during the three weeks of rehearsals that produced
a set masterfully combining discipline and inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The band -- including Harrison's son, Dhani, on guitar -- slammed
through Beatles favorites written by Harrison, including "I Want to
Tell You," "If I Needed Someone" and "Old Brown Shoe," with lead
vocals shared by Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Procol Harum veteran Gary
Brooker. Incense filled the air, and children of the '60s -- the kind
who can afford all-for-charity ticket prices of up to $260 --
traveled back in time.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers took over for a while and did fine
with "Taxman" and a brief visit to the Traveling Wilburys repertoire,
but the occasion really gathered itself around the two surviving
Beatles, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. They got standing ovations,
and the songs they chose had their own special poignancy.</TE>
<TE>   Starr, resplendent in an embroidered scarlet velvet jacket,
reached back to Harrison's old favorite, Carl Perkins, and sang
"Honey Don't." On the Beatles' recording, Starr hollers for the
guitar break with a "Rock on, George, one time for Ringo!" This time
it was just, "Come on, let's hear you."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney, as he had done on his American tour this year, sang
"Something," the Harrison composition once described by Frank Sinatra
as McCartney and John Lennon's greatest love song.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney accompanied himself on ukulele, Harrison's favorite
instrument for an after-dinner sing-along. Then in came Clapton and
the band with the majestic lines of the original version.</TE>
<TE>   The rock show closed with modesty and charm. Dhani Harrison
thanked all the musicians -- "all my dad's friends." McCartney said
Harrison's widow, Olivia, had just told him that Dhani so resembled
his father that "it looks like George stayed young and the rest of us
got old."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, with the entire cast on stage, an old friend of
Harrison's, veteran British guitarist Joe Brown, picked up the
ukulele and, very quietly, sang "I'll See You in My Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a favorite of George's and it's designed to send you home
with a smile on your face and a little bit of love in your heart," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   While Brown sang, Olivia Harrison turned to her son and hugged
him. And as the band members filed off, McCartney, who had never been
closer than 20 yards to Starr on stage, waited in the wings for the
drummer, then hugged and kissed him.</TE>
<TE>   But the most graceful and lingering farewell may have rested with
Ravi Shankar. The first section of the tribute was devoted to music
he had composed in memory of Harrison, who, he said, had become "like
a son to me."</TE>
<TE>   Shankar's daughter Anoushka played a sitar raga, then conducted a
25-strong Indian group in a piece of dazzling complexity called
"Arpan" -- a performance that an English audience might have had no
chance of enjoying if not for Harrison's opening its ears to that
musical culture.</TE>
<TE>   The final lines of Shankar's lyrics say: "He gave so many songs to
this world / We are remembering that great soul / And we salute him
with love and respect."</TE>

<DH>Critics in Japan say a flood of foreign words makes the
language incomprehensible at times and is threatening the nation's
identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>They slide under doors, through windows and past airport immigration
unnoticed. The Internet is a veritable breeding ground, as are locker
rooms and fashion runways. Seemingly harmless in small doses, their
wholesale import now threatens Japan's very identity, say critics.</LD>
<LD>   A new computer virus? An insidious North Korean spy plot or some
new breed of walking catfish? For many Japanese, the biggest invasion
fear is the flood of foreign words infecting their vocabulary, with
English heading the charge.</LD>
<LD>   "It's becoming incomprehensible," says Yoko Fujimura, a
60-year-old Tokyo restaurant worker. "Sometimes I feel like I need a
translator to understand my own language."</LD>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi recently chided his ministers for
overusing "loan words." A government-funded institute has a hotline
to interpret and document bad usage. Echoing France, there's even a
committee to find replacement words for the foreign gate-crashers.</TE>
<TE>   Countries around the globe are wringing their hands over the rapid
spread of American English, with Coca-Cola among the most recognized
terms on Earth. However, Japan's unique writing system arguably makes
the problem here worse.</TE>
<TE>   In most countries, foreign words are assimilated relatively
quickly -- making it difficult, for example, to remember that
"smorgasbord," "maitre d' " and "hamburger" came to America from
abroad. Japan, however, writes all imported utterances other than
those from Chinese in a different script called katakana, the only
country to maintain such a distinction.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, terms such as "word processor," "managed health care" and
"baby-sitter" remain "foreign," presumably for centuries, creating a
linguistic moat between intruders and more blue blood Japanese terms.</TE>
<TE>   Katakana also takes far more space to write than kanji, the core
pictograph characters that the Japanese borrowed from China 1,500
years ago. And it stands out, given its other function as a way to
emphasize meaning, akin to using italics or exclamation points.
Readers complain that sentences packed with foreign words start to
resemble extended strings of strobe lights.</TE>
<TE>   As if that weren't enough, katakana terms tend to morph at border
crossings, like complex names at Ellis Island. "Digital camera"
debuted as degitaru kamera, then became the more ear-pleasing digi
kamey. But kamey is also the Japanese word for "turtle."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating not knowing what young people are talking
about," says Minoru Shiratori, a 53-year-old municipal employee.
"Sometimes I can't tell if they're discussing cameras or turtles."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the loan word for "dot-com" also means "suddenly
crowded," which inspired the winning entry in a recent haiku-like
poetry contest:</TE>
<TE>   'Dotsuto comu'</TE>
<TE>   What's so crowded?</TE>
<TE>   My boss asks.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's fast-paced word blender, more often than not deftly
operated by teenagers, also can leave foreigners reeling. Many
Japanese believe they're speaking English when they describe
mayonnaise as mayora; lovers of the Chanel brand as shannera; a
convenience store as a combeeni and the high-five gesture of a sports
hero as a gattsu posu, or gutsy pose.</TE>
<TE>   "I support efforts to limit katakana words because too many of
them damage the beauty and dignity of our language," says retired
financier Yukio Komatsuzaki, 60. "If you want to learn English,
that's great. Or speak proper Japanese. But keep them separate."</TE>
<TE>   Even more daunting are foreign words left in the Western alphabet,
or romanji. Toshiko Uno, a 63-year-old housewife, found herself in
desperate straits recently looking for a toilet in a Tokyo train
station before noticing a door marked "powder room."</TE>
<TE>   "Powder room?" she says. "Why put on such airs?"</TE>
<TE>   Foreign-based katakana terms account for 10% of some dictionaries.
"The spread has been just phenomenal," says Yasuko Hio, a social
linguist with Shikoku Gakuin University.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by national broadcaster NHK found half of all respondents
unhappy with the foreign flood, with people in their 60s most
concerned and those in their 20s largely unfazed.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to temper the torrent of katakana -- a system developed
by 9th century Buddhist monks to remember Chinese pronunciation, then
the only foreign language invading Japan -- the government has tapped
a Foreign Words Committee to find suitable Japanese replacements.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is quick to distance itself from French-style
language police, given that Japanese history makes the hint of force,
even against words, potentially controversial. A largely ineffective
law in France bars advertising in English.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, committee members and traditionalists here hope a
sustained campaign of persuasion, gentle reproach and leadership by
example can turn the tide. Intelligibility, not purity, is their
goal, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's less feeling the government should control it," says
Minoru Shibata, who monitors linguistic change at NHK's research
institute.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute for Japanese Language hopes to craft 100
Japanese replacement terms every six months. The group admits it's
understaffed but is seeking a $1.7-million budget increase for more
wordsmiths. "We want to tackle this aggressively," says Mitsuro Kai,
the institute's president.</TE>
<TE>   The nation took similar steps during its late 19th century
modernization drive as scholars and bureaucrats created Japanese
words for "democracy," "chemistry" and other new concepts. But life
was a bit slower then, and the channels for imports better
controlled. Society could afford to wait a decade or more while
elites found a proper Japanese word that might stand in for a foreign
term.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the committee's many challenges is the fact that
katakana terms tend to evoke novelty and excitement, a reflection of
the writing system's centuries-old role as a beachhead for
cutting-edge concepts.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is also up against some pretty aggressive opponents
in the vocabulary wars, including high-tech industries, the fashion
world, advertising, sports and the media.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers have embraced katakana with all the subtlety of an
anaconda, even tossing in Japanese words to make their soapsuds and
soy sauce sound dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we get calls because people can't recognize Japanese
words in katakana," says Sadao Yamada, chief researcher at the
language institute, who is in charge of the group's hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians and bureaucrats who hope to sound more sophisticated
and worldly aren't far behind. Economics Minister Heizo Takenaka is
accused of using so many English financial terms that his sentences
are almost incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians should be banned from using it," says Kentaro
Miyazaki, a 54-year-old janitor. "When I hear them speaking
gibberish, I just tune them out."</TE>
<TE>   Language purists argue that perfectly good Japanese words are
available if people just tried a little harder -- for instance, using
jyugyoin to describe a company worker rather than staffu.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, counter younger Japanese, but there are nuances.
Companies advertising for staffu are seen as progressive, flexible
and more equitable toward women, they say. A competitor's search for
jyugyoin evokes respectability, security and -- to some --
mind-numbing boredom.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd much rather have a staffu job than be a jyugyoin," says
Minako Yoshinaga, a 24-year-old cafe worker.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agents add that hanging your clothes in a
walku-in-kurozeto sounds much more luxurious than the more
musty-sounding oshiire.</TE>
<TE>   Bureaucrats have another reason for using katakana. While Japanese
terms have precise, well-understood meanings, fuzzier foreign terms
provide more latitude to do what bureaucrats do everywhere: skirt
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Take BSE, short for bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The foreign
scientific term for "mad cow" disease gained widespread use last year
after a health scare in part because the Japanese term -- kyogyu-byo
-- is graphically descriptive of the illness and tends to underscore
how officials failed to safeguard the nation's food supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Katakana terms make it more difficult to pin them down," says
Seizaburo Ofuchi, in the terminology office of Yomiuri Shimbun,
Japan's largest newspaper. "These 60-year-old politicians moan about
all the katakana, but they often make ample use of it for their own
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   As if all that weren't enough, katakana suffers a standardization
problem as alternate spellings proliferate for the same word. "It's
quite sloppy," says Toshio Kaminishi, an editor with Sanseido
Publishers, which puts out a katakana dictionary that has doubled in
size over the last 30 years. "Actually, it's out of control."</TE>
<TE>   For many older Japanese who struggled to rebuild their country
after World War II, only to watch it stumble in recent years,
katakana's spread symbolizes the perils of globalization, eroding
discipline and the loss of traditional values.</TE>
<TE>   These fears are unfounded, counter others. Foreign words may enter
Japan wholesale, but many fade.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they lose their freshness, they're tossed," says Toyama
University social linguist Shigehiro Kato.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the social and cultural torch that's been handed to the
younger generation exactly flawless, some add. Japan can't afford to
remain as protected as it has for much of its history, with language
an important barometer of change.</TE>
<TE>   "Older people get slower and slower at adapting, while the speed
of life gets ever faster," says cafe worker Yoshinaga. "I think this
whole anti-katakana movement is a control issue, a bid to cling to
the old Japanese identity. They feel in crisis because everything's
falling apart, and their instinct is to blame younger Japanese who
are trying to bring new things into the country."</TE>
<TE>   With words pouring in hourly, the effort to hold them back strikes
some people as quixotic and a throwback to another age when
bureaucrats and elites had far greater control over society.</TE>
<TE>   "I seriously doubt the government's campaign will be effective,"
says Osamu Mizutani, a professor at the Nagoya Foreign Language
University and a member of the foreign words committee. "Language is
a living, changing thing."</TE>

<HD>Kenya Detains 12 in Attacks</HD>
<DH>Israel dispatches experts to investigate resort hotel
bombing, firing of missiles at an airliner. U.S. officials continue
to focus on Al Qaeda.</DH>

<DL>MOMBASA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>As Israelis and Kenyans prepared to bury their dead from a suicide
truck bomb that killed at least 15 people and leveled a beachfront
resort near here, investigators Friday detained 12 people for
interrogation and searched for clues in the still smoldering ruins.</LD>
<LD>   Among those detained was an American woman and her husband. They
were expected to be released soon.</LD>
<LD>   Four Israeli air force Hercules cargo planes evacuated about 250
tourists -- in Kenya for a weeklong getaway at the Paradise hotel,
which catered to Israeli tourists -- and took home the bodies of
three Israelis killed in the blast.The attack Thursday on the hotel
in the tiny rural village of Msumarini, about 35 miles north of this
port city, also claimed the lives of at least nine Kenyans who worked
at the hotel and the three suicide bombers who drove a Mitsubishi
sport utility vehicle packed with explosives into the crowded
reception area of the resort.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the bombing was meant to coincide with a missile
attack minutes earlier on an Israeli-chartered Boeing 757 as it took
off from the Mombasa airport with 261 passengers and 10 crew members
bound for Tel Aviv. The plane was apparently hit by fragments from
one of two heat-seeking missiles fired from a canyon next to the
airfield. Despite some minor damage, the Arkia Charter Co. airliner
landed safely in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 18 injured Israelis returning home Friday on the
evacuation flight were Ora Anter, a resident of the West Bank
settlement of Ariel, whose two sons, Noy, 12, and Dvir, 14, were
killed by the massive truck bomb. Anter remained unconscious after
suffering a serious abdominal injury, apparently when she attempted
to shield her 8-year-old daughter, Adva, from the blast. Adva
survived with minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulances rushed Anter and other victims from the cargo planes to
four Tel Aviv hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli television broadcast a videotape of Noy's 12th birthday
celebration from last weekend. The family's trip to Kenya was a
special Hanukkah vacation and the children's first voyage abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives wept outside the airport terminal in Tel Aviv as the
brothers' coffins were unloaded. The third slain Israeli, whose body
was also returned Friday, was identified as Albert Dehaville, 60, a
tour guide.</TE>
<TE>   As Kenyans and Israelis mourned, authorities here were rounding up
people for questioning. Kenyan Police Commissioner Philemon Abongo
refused to give details of those being detained.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe some of them have information that could be useful,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those being questioned attacks were guests at the Le Soleil
Beach Club, just down the road from the Paradise hotel. An American
woman who checked in under the name Alicia Kalhammer and her husband
were arrested as they attempted to check out, said Ben Wafula, Le
Soleil's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Kalhammer told hotel employees she was from Florida, according to
Wafula. She and her husband, described by U.S. Embassy officials in
Nairobi as a Spanish national with U.S. resident status, were headed
for Lamu, a nearby island famous for its Swahili culture and
architecture. Indications were that the couple would be released.</TE>
<TE>   Wafula said police had instructed hotel owners in the area to
report all guests departing in the hours immediately after the blast.
"They probably just picked the wrong time to check out," he said of
the couple.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers here do not expect a major breakthrough in the
investigation soon. Some say Kenyan authorities have a history of
rounding up alleged terrorism suspects but never charging them.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan authorities have all but handed the bomb scene
investigation over to the numerous Israeli experts who flew in early
Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We have loads of experience with these kinds of things," said
Gilad Millo, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, explaining the
presence of about 150 Israel Defense Forces forensics and bomb
experts in Mombasa. In Msumarini, Israeli investigators sealed off
the front of the Paradise hotel with crime scene tape.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence agencies, meanwhile, continued Friday to focus
on Al Qaeda as the terrorist group most likely behind the attacks.
But officials cautioned that it was too early to know for sure.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a lot of hallmarks of an Al Qaeda operation," one U.S.
intelligence official said, noting that the group led by Osama bin
Laden has a record of orchestrating near-simultaneous attacks on
targets, such as in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya that killed more than 200 people -- most of them Kenyans --
and injured more than 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official said counter-terrorism experts are also
exploring whether Thursday's attacks might have been carried out by
an Al Qaeda affiliate in the Horn of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   One group that has caught the CIA's attention is known as Al
Ittihad al Islami, described as Somalia's most active radical Islamic
group. Since 1996, it has carried out regional attacks, including
bombings and an assassination attempt on Ethiopia's transportation
minister.</TE>
<TE>   The increasingly anti-Western group has received money from Al
Qaeda, and some of its members trained at Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan, the U.S. intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not ruling out Hezbollah or other Palestinian extremist
groups," the official said. "But we don't view that as likely as it
being an Al Qaeda operation."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's attacks brought unwanted attention to Muslims in
Mombasa. The city has become home to a diverse population of
immigrants, including Somalis, Yemenis and Persian Gulf Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   For several months, hundreds of U.S. and German military personnel
have been using Mombasa bases to patrol the coasts of Kenya and
Somalia in search of people with links to Bin Laden. The Al Qaeda
leader's former chief military commander, Mohammed Atef, who is
believed by U.S. officials to have played a key role in the 1998
embassy bombings, once operated a thriving fishing business near
here. Atef was killed in the U.S. bombing in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Another top Al Qaeda member, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who with three
others was convicted last year in the embassy attacks, also operated
a furniture business near Mombasa. Muslim leaders here say Thursday's
attacks have brought unwanted attention to them, and they fear
investigators may feel emboldened to harass Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Mohammed Dor, general secretary of the Council of Imams and
Preachers of Kenya, regarded here as a mainstream Muslim group,
warned Israeli investigators that if they violate Kenyans' rights,
"we will fight back."</TE>
<TE>   In Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that "our long
arm will reach those who spilled Israeli blood" in Africa. He has
ordered Israel's Mossad spy agency to take charge of retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   His statement echoed Israel's pursuit of terrorists who have
killed its citizens in the past. After a Palestinian attack on
Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, Mossad
agents tracked down and killed every alleged participant except one,
even when it meant killing bystanders in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Mossad has suffered a series of embarrassing failures in recent
years, including a botched attempt in 1998 to assassinate a leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   However, analysts say Israel's pursuit of Al Qaeda members, if the
shadowy network proves to be responsible for the Kenya attacks, would
be far more complicated than retaliation against Palestinian
factions.</TE>

<HD>Paramilitary in Colombia Vows to Hold Its Fire</HD>
<DH>In a groundbreaking move, the AUC says it's willing to
discuss disarmament. But rights groups are skeptical about the
motive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>This nation's right-wing paramilitary forces announced a unilateral
cease-fire Friday, boosting hopes for peace in a country blasted by
violence.</LD>
<LD>   The fighters pledged to begin the cease-fire, which was reported
by sources earlier in the week, on Sunday. But they reserved the
right to respond "in legitimate defense" if they were attacked by
leftist rebels, their sworn enemy.</LD>
<LD>   The declaration by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or
AUC for their initials in Spanish, also said the group was willing to
immediately begin peace talks with the government toward permanent
disarmament.</LD>
<TE>   "With a patriotic and civil spirit, and as an explicit
demonstration of our constant desire for peace in this country, the
United Self-Defense Forces have made the historic decision to declare
a unilateral cease-fire, with national reach, without renouncing our
principals or ideals," read the statement, signed by 30 paramilitary
commanders, including the group's leader, Carlos Castano.</TE>
<TE>   President Alvaro Uribe did not immediately respond to the offer,
the first time the paramilitary forces have indicated a willingness
to negotiate without a parallel cease-fire by the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Peace groups and human rights organizations welcomed the news but
said questions surrounded the larger issue of negotiations with a
group that has been responsible for the majority of massacres in
Colombia's conflict in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a very important and positive development," said
Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the Americas division of New York-based
Human Rights Watch. "My only concern is, what's the price?"</TE>
<TE>   Friday's announcement was widely expected after Uribe confirmed
this week that his government had begun secret talks with the
right-wing forces with the help of Roman Catholic Church officials.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's nearly 4-decade-old conflict pits leftist rebels
against the government and the AUC, a violent illegal army. Human
rights organizations have long accused the military and the
paramilitary groups of working together against their common enemy,
the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   A peace deal with the AUC would be an astounding achievement for
Uribe's government, which has stepped up military activity against
the rebels as well as the right-wing fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Peace talks under the previous government with the country's
largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, broke down in February after three years of fruitless
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The Uribe government also has been negotiating in Cuba with a
smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army, which has been
greatly weakened by attacks from paramilitary fighters in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts exist about whether the paramilitary cease-fire would last,
especially since the guerrillas have made no promise to stop attacks
against right-wing forces. Both groups have occasionally announced
temporary cease-fires around Christmas, and hostilities later
resumed.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups battle for control of territory for the transit of
arms and drugs, which both sides rely on for financing. The
paramilitary forces control huge areas of rural Colombia where there
is little government presence, as well as urban areas where they work
in conjunction with local police.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the AUC is engaging in a savvy political strategy
that would allow it to blame the guerrillas for continued violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Achilles' heel here is the FARC, who are going to try to
recuperate territory," said Fernando Cepeda, a political analyst.
"The paramilitaries will then be able to say, 'We are responding to
being attacked,' and cast responsibility for the war to the FARC" and
other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Even more contentious was the issue of peace talks with the
paramilitary forces, a series of private armies united in a loose
confederation totaling about 11,000 fighters. At least three smaller
paramilitary groups did not join in Friday's declaration.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-point AUC declaration imposes a series of conditions for
talks to begin. It invites the participation of not only the
government but also the Catholic church, the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.</TE>
<TE>   The AUC called for political recognition by the government, a move
that would give it the legal status necessary to begin talks that
could lead to a possible amnesty for its members.</TE>
<TE>   Next, it demanded the release of imprisoned fighters. About 1,000
are estimated to be held on a variety of charges, including drug
trafficking, torture and massacre.</TE>
<TE>   The group also insisted that the government provide its fighters
financial support while talks proceed.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary fighters finance themselves through donations
from large landowners and businessmen and from proceeds from drug
dealing.</TE>
<TE>   The final and most controversial demand, however, is that
Colombian officials drop any arrest warrants against members of the
paramilitary negotiating team -- almost sure to include Castano,
military commander Salvatore Mancuso and perhaps finance officer Juan
Carlos Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The men have dozens of warrants against them, including torture
and massacre.</TE>
<TE>   The last point was likely to be met with strong resistance from
both the U.S. and rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   All three men were indicted by the U.S. attorney general's office
in September for allegedly shipping more than 15 tons of cocaine into
the U.S. during the last several years. Also, the State Department
has declared the AUC a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   An American official said the U.S. would be unable to extradite
Castano if Colombian authorities did not first arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   And rights groups made it clear they would not accept a pardon for
Castano or others accused of crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "There cannot be impunity," said Ana Teresa Bernal, the director
of Redepaz, the country's largest peace organization. "There have
been so many victims left behind by this group."</TE>

<HD>Airlines Called Vulnerable to Attack by Terrorist Missiles</HD>
<DH>Shoulder-fired weapons are easy to obtain, analysts say.
Commercial aircraft lack systems to defend against them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron and Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The attack this week on an Israeli charter plane in Kenya underscores
the vulnerability of commercial jets to terrorists wielding
shoulder-fired missiles, which are relatively cheap, portable and
widely available on the international black market, U.S. and Israeli
officials and private analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials on Friday said the Arkia Charter Co. jet
carrying 271 people that was fired on twice by surface-to-air
missiles Thursday apparently was spared by bad aim from an old,
inaccurate weapon. But civilian aircraft owned by Israel's flagship
carrier, El Al, are equipped with flares that act as decoys for the
heat-seeking weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not only an Israeli problem," Avi Pazner, an Israeli
government spokesman, told Associated Press. "What can be done
against an Israeli aircraft can easily be done against a European or
American one."</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to cause an enormous shudder throughout the [U.S.]
government," said Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council
counterterrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, or CSIS, in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Security analysts have been warning for years about the potential
threat posed by terrorists toting shoulder-fired missiles. Al Qaeda
is believed to have fired them at planes in Saudi Arabia and Yemen,
and the Tamil Tiger rebels used them to down a passenger aircraft in
Sri Lanka in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, Benjamin said, "the airlines have always
refused to consider putting aboard the defense measures that are
necessary, for reasons of cost.... Even though the airlines are in
worse [financial] shape now, it's hard for me to see how they're
going to avoid a big, big battle over this."</TE>
<TE>   However, another CSIS terrorism expert, Anthony Cordesman, a
former director of intelligence assessment at the Pentagon, said
installing systems on commercial airlines to defend against attack by
shoulder-fired missiles is not likely to be either feasible or
effective.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airlines, Craig Martin, agreed
that putting missile-defense technology aboard commercial aircraft
would be neither cheap nor easy.</TE>
<TE>   And he argued that the basic premise of the air travel industry --
the free and safe flow of civilian air traffic -- would be undermined
by a decision to try to defend aircraft against missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't put your family on an aircraft if you think it's going
to be hit by a missile, regardless of what defenses are on board,"
Martin said. He suggested that authorities focus on the underlying
causes of the attacks and on making such attacks unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a U.S. General Accounting Office report released two
days before the Kenya attack warns that the systems developed by the
Pentagon to protect military aircraft from surface-to-air missiles
also are unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO, Congress' watchdog agency, had already warned in a
January 2001 report about problems with the military's capability to
suppress enemy air defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "The services have already identified serious reliability problems
with current self-protection systems on U.S. combat aircraft,
including jammers, radar warning receivers and countermeasures
dispensers," the GAO wrote in the report released this week. "Most of
the current systems use older technology and have logistics support
problems due to obsolescence."</TE>
<TE>   The report said that 41 of 44 F-15C aircraft and 10 of 10 F/A-18C
aircraft reported to be mission-capable were subsequently found to
have two or more faults in their self-protection systems. One F/A-18C
had 12 such faults.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found significant problems with aircraft designed
to jam the radars of air defenses, and with other craft that fire
anti-radiation missiles to destroy air defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past several years, the quantity and quality of the
services' suppression equipment have declined while enemy air defense
tactics and equipment have improved," the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   The missiles fired at the Israeli plane are believed to have been
the Soviet-made SA-7, also known by the Russian name Strela-2M. They
are older and less accurate versions of the U.S.-made Stinger
missiles, which the CIA supplied to the moujahedeen warriors fighting
the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The SA-7s were introduced in 1967 and first used by Soviet-backed
Egyptian forces against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When U.S. relations with Egypt later improved, some of the
missiles were sent to Germany, where U.S. troops trained with them.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just thousands all over the world," said retired Army
Maj. Gen. Edward B. Atkeson, a senior fellow at the Institute of Land
Warfare. "Everybody's got them. They're cheap, and it takes only
about a day to train a guy on the thing."</TE>
<TE>   The SA-7s are heat-seeking weapons that lock onto a jet's exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   Defense systems on U.S. fighter planes use sensors to detect the
missile's heat, then activate flares designed to confuse the
missile's guidance system by sending out waves of heat over a wide
area.</TE>
<TE>   But because passenger airplanes ascend and descend slowly, sending
out heat from their engines all the while, they are vulnerable to
targeting by such missiles for far longer than speeding jet fighters,
Cordesman said. This makes it relatively impractical to use
heat-based defenses on commercial craft.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are exploring other technologies -- a Russian firm
claims to have a "missile death ray," essentially a laser beam that
blows up a missile before it reaches the aircraft -- but U.S. sources
said the products are unproven and may be too large for anything but
military applications.</TE>
<TE>   Most shoulder-fired missiles believed to have fallen into the
hands of terrorists are versions of the Strela and are old enough to
be highly unreliable, Cordesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Systems that protect against them are not effective against more
modern missile guidance systems that, instead of locking onto a
craft's exhaust heat, home in on its radar profile or flight
trajectory.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in technology is a duel," Cordesman said. "Do you put
these defense systems on airliners to deal with Strelas? If so, will
it work against the newer missiles? Can terrorists get the newer
missiles? The answer to that, like everything else about terrorism,
is uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   Another uncertainty is how many of the more modern and accurate
Stinger missiles may have fallen into terrorist hands. According to a
comprehensive 1999 study by Alan J. Kuperman, now at the School for
Advanced International Studies in Bologna, Italy, some of the
estimated 900 to 1,200 Stingers delivered to Afghanistan in the 1980s
were skimmed off en route through Pakistan, with some reportedly
ending up on the black market. Others reportedly were hoarded or sold
to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA reportedly has spent $65 million on three buy-back
programs to get the remaining missiles out of Afghanistan and off the
black market.</TE>
<TE>   An agency spokesman Friday would not comment. But Kuperman
reported that one main effect of the program has been to drive up the
black market price for Stingers, from about $30,000 to as much as
$200,000 each.</TE>

<DH>The search for holiday gifts this year starts at discount
stores as customers are more mindful of prices and the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the opening day of the holiday shopping season is any guide, this
year could end up being a "Costco Christmas."</LD>
<LD>   Bargain-hungry Southern Californians swarmed the region's stores
Friday, guided largely by a sense of practicality that had thousands
rising before sunrise to snap up the best deals on a wide array of
gifts.</LD>
<LD>   Jana Flaig of Westminster does research on products she wants at
other stores but makes her purchases at Costco, where she joined
thousands of other shoppers early Friday in Fountain Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "When it comes time to buy, I come here to save the money," said
the 53-year-old college instructor. "Getting name brands at a
discount price is a duty."</TE>
<TE>   Flaig's no-nonsense attitude seemed to be the theme of the day.
Shoppers in Southern California and across the country sent clear
signals that price matters, even when it comes to holiday gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, eight of 10 consumers queried in a recent American Express
survey said they would do some shopping at mass merchandisers this
year. And 86% said their shopping decisions would be driven by what
items were on sale.</TE>
<TE>   Those results aren't surprising given that the uncertain economy
is on many shoppers' minds.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Martin, 52, of West Los Angeles said pocketbook concerns made
her more cautious about spending money and more likely to buy gifts
at discount stores and other money-saving outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares about the Macy's box or the Bloomingdale's box?" said
Martin, an associate director of financial aid at UCLA, who was
shopping at the Target store on La Cienega Boulevard. "We all went
through that stage. But with everything going on in the world, we're
all more aware of what we're doing and not being wasteful."</TE>
<TE>   Having six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas
this year also prodded folks into stores Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "People who view the Christmas buying season as starting on the
day after Thanksgiving are going to get panicked," fearing that they
have too little time to shop, said Richard Giss, an analyst with
Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there was no shortage of people in stores Friday,
although mall traffic nationwide has been weak throughout the year.
With more stores opening early for so-called door-busters --
markdowns on items intended to lure early birds -- consumers filled
shopping centers earlier this year than last.</TE>
<TE>   And they weren't there to look, said Jack Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., who for the
second year in a row visited Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles to
observe shoppers on opening day of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely people were carrying a lot more bags than they did
last year," he said. "People were literally dragging bags full of
toys" out of the mall's KB Toys store.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Galleria appeared to be having one of the busiest traffic
days in the last nine years, said Jackie Fernandez, a retail expert
with Deloitte &amp; Touche. "It could be a little panic setting in," she
said, due to the smaller number of shopping days.</TE>
<TE>   Although the day after Thanksgiving is not the busiest shopping
day of the year in terms of sales -- that's the Saturday before
Christmas -- it is an important day for retailers, who hope to snag
shoppers early and encourage them to revisit the store by Dec. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the day after Thanksgiving was the sixth-busiest
sales-generating day of the season. The weekend accounted for 8.4% of
last year's holiday sales, according to the International Council of
Shopping Centers.</TE>
<TE>   It was too soon to tell whether the nation's retailers were on
track to outperform last year's results; sales estimates and other
data won't be available until next week. Experts have predicted that
national retail sales will rise 4% this season, which would be the
smallest increase in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, observers said bargains and special discounts
were driving shoppers into malls and stores.</TE>
<TE>   Sharply discounted prices Friday attracted so many shoppers to
Fry's Electronics in Fountain Valley that the store reached its
maximum capacity of almost 1,500 people an hour after opening,
prompting fire officials to ask store managers to control the crowd
by making arriving customers wait in line outside, a store spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wal-Mart in Panorama City, the line began forming about 11
p.m. Thursday, growing to about 300 people by the time the store
opened at 6 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Hamm staked out her place in line at 5 a.m. Friday so she
could snag a $698 Hewlett-Packard computer. "I prayed about that
one," said Hamm, a special education assistant in her 30s who lives
in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   She also picked up some sweats, toys, games and an array of $5
household gadgets, such as an electric knife that she'd "been dying
for."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Hamm said, she is spending less this year "because of the
economy in general." To make sure she can buy presents for everyone
on her long list, Hamm said, she always shops the early-bird
specials.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Jacutin, a 22-year-old nursing student at Cal State L.A.,
didn't mind jostling other customers in crowded aisles at the
Panorama City Wal-Mart to get to the early specials. She was able to
purchase seven gifts for $48 before 11 a.m., including a $15
hand-held vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   Jacutin said that the state of the economy and the possibility of
war with Iraq is a constant concern, "but when I was inside the store
I wasn't thinking of it. I just wanted to buy something cheap."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, many shoppers have been tuned into
problems at the ports, where some Christmas goods still have not been
unloaded, Kyser said. Thus, they fear they may not get what they want
if they don't move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "You still have retailers saying, 'We have merchandise stranded on
the docks,' " Kyser said. "Popular toys are going to be in short
supply. I think that's another thing that's pushing people along."</TE>
<TE>   If consumers' shopping fever gets hotter over the next three
weeks, analysts wonder whether stores will be able to satisfy demand,
since retailers have been vigilant about maintaining lean inventories
as the economy slowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you have a big turnout and people are roaring to buy,
there's not enough inventory to have a really big holiday season,"
Giss said. "If the economy ends up fooling us and people go out there
and start spending, there will be a lot of missed sales for retailers
because they won't have the inventory to fulfill the desire."</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood resident Gordon Williams, 38, was ready to seize the
moment Friday morning. He was lured -- along with hundreds of other
shoppers -- to Best Buy in Cerritos, where DVD players were
discounted to $69.99 and CDs were $6.99.</TE>
<TE>   He, like many other shoppers, seemed to be driven by a desire to
take advantage of the day's deep discounts, whether they were for
Christmas gifts or not.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here because we're trying to get more gifts for the
dollars, as opposed to waiting a couple of weeks and getting stuff at
retail," said Williams, a Home Depot employee who was pushing a cart
loaded with five DVD players, a PlayStation 2 and a portable stereo.
"The way things are going and with the stock market, you can't do
what you were doing five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk resident Marilyn Strange also was taking the practical --
and less expensive -- approach to shopping.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old hairstylist and part-time nurse shopped at
discount apparel retailer Ross in Cerritos. She was loaded down with
evening wear, a denim skirt and workout clothes -- all gifts for
family members. She said she wouldn't be giving gifts to her friends
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a Nordstrom shopper all the way. I definitely went for
quality," Strange said. "This year it's all the discount stores."</TE>
<TE>   Although some shoppers have shifted to lower-priced stores and
others cling to the more expensive options, most consumers have
become comfortable shopping at both ends of the spectrum, retail
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The crossover is phenomenal," said Michael Baker, an economist
with the International Council of Shopping Centers. "We shop
everywhere now.... I don't think we should see this as a stampede of
people from one retail channel to another."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles nurse Jennie Del Rosario, 29, started out Friday
shopping at the Kmart near 3rd Street and Fairfax in L.A., where she
planned to buy discounted microwave ovens for $99 for herself and her
mother, along with gifts for acquaintances. Later, she was heading
for the nearby Grove shopping center to hit upscale Nordstrom and
some specialty shops to buy family gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to give, even if it's not high-end products," Del
Rosario said. "But when it comes to loved ones, you want to get them
something special" and price is less a concern.</TE>
<TE>   Some shoppers were forced to be frugal after a tough economic year
that saw job loss and no pay raises.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Todd-Cantrell, 28, said her husband lost his job a year
ago, so they "do what's practical." She was shopping with her mother
at the 3rd Street Kmart, where she bought food in bulk, a
Fisher-Price Spiral Speedway for her son and one unplanned item for
her family, a George Foreman grill.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette Johnson of West Los Angeles went to Target for just a few
items Friday, including two popular Bratz dolls, which she added only
because the dolls have the same names as her daughters, Jasmine and
Jade. Other than that, Johnson, who has been on disability, said she
was trying to do her shopping on the cheap and to be practical.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of her own precarious financial situation, she plans to
handle much of her shopping list this year with gift certificates
from area grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm into getting something that's going to benefit people
rather than just getting something cute," Johnson said. "My finances
changed and so have a lot of other people's."</TE>
<TE>   That means forgoing the usual trips to the more expensive mall
stores, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to be much more interested in department stores and
other fancier stores," Johnson said. "Now, you just put a bow on it
and that's it. It doesn't matter where the bow is from, either."</TE>

<HD>Homeless Often Take a One-Way Street to Skid Row</HD>
<DH>L.A.'s dumping ground for the down and out nears breaking
point as people keep pouring in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On his release from Chino state prison in July, broke and with no
home to go to, Demetrious Williams got on a bus and headed for
downtown Los Angeles. The career burglar had previously lived in the
Crenshaw area and the Inland Empire, but he had only $200 in "gate"
money and needed a quick place to shower and sleep. There seemed few
alternatives but skid row, where more than 60 social agencies crowd a
50-block expanse.</LD>
<LD>   Months later, out of work and with few prospects, he is still
downtown at a homeless agency on a forbidding stretch of skid row,
trying to dodge drug dealers and crime that could land him back in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   "If you don't have family very close or friends, you have nowhere
to stay but the streets," said Williams, whose thick eyebrows and
mustache are flecked with gray. "In prison, I heard about the
services word-of-mouth. A lot of people know about skid row."</LD>
<TE>   Although parolees like Williams are not the only faces of skid
row, they symbolize how the central city area has become a dumping
ground for the region's down and out.</TE>
<TE>   State officials estimate that 2,000 parolees are on downtown
streets, but the area also draws out-of-work families with children,
emancipated foster kids, poor workers led to the area's low-cost
single-room hotels, ex-cons who can't find work and criminals who see
the row as a sort of Wild West show into which they can blend.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, business owners, police and even some advocates say
conditions have gotten out of hand and that other law enforcement
agencies, hospitals and charities must stop sending to skid row the
troubled people the rest of Los Angeles County can't handle.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the new scrutiny is altruistic, a response to increasing
numbers of homeless living in squalid street encampments. Ambitious
redevelopment plans and an influx of upscale loft residents also are
major driving forces, say business leaders and advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The Central City Assn., which represents business interests,
recently proposed laws to prohibit sidewalk encampments and stricter
ordinances banning public urination and defecation. City Councilwoman
Jan Perry has already introduced motions to restrict the homeless
from sleeping in front of businesses and to limit outdoor meals,
following the passage in Santa Monica of similar ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies last week conducted sweeps of skid row,
arresting about 200 for parole violations and other crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division created a
special team to tackle street problems such as trash bin fires
associated with the homeless, enlisting a neighborhood prosecutor
from the city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for all of those who share a concern about the homeless
and about our neighborhood to look at this crisis in a new way and do
something about it," said Central City Assn. President Carol E.
Schatz.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the concentration of social services on skid row has
attracted more and more homeless people, who in turn have attracted
more services.</TE>
<TE>   Besides those in hotels and shelters, at least 4,000 may be on the
streets, city officials say. Now there is virtually nowhere else in
the city for the destitute to turn, heating up tensions with business
owners in the toy, flower and garment districts and even on Bunker
Hill and in South Park.</TE>
<TE>   It is an environment that feeds on itself, experts say. Service
providers in the area recount tale after tale of out-of-town police
cars letting transients out on sidewalks in the middle of the night
and of parole officers wanting to leave newly released offenders at
their doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals release indigent patients, sometimes in wheelchairs or
stretchers, on a regular basis at the Downtown Drop-In Center, a
24-hour facility operated by the Volunteers of America on San Julian
Street, said its director, James C. Howat.</TE>
<TE>   And police agencies deliver drunks picked up for public
inebriation from across the county to a separate VOA program on
nearby Crocker Street, he added</TE>
<TE>   "They are at a loss to know what to do with them," Howat said.
"This is probably the only area of the city where there are services
for them."</TE>
<TE>   The area is also a magnet for the so-called day visitors -- drawn
from East Los Angeles, the Valley, the South Bay and South-Central --
to do drugs or shoot craps on the street with little risk of being
caught.</TE>
<TE>   "The homeless service network is an important part of the city's
work, but difficulties arise when you get too many people
concentrated in one area, which is what is happening in downtown,"
said Michael Dear, a USC geography professor who has studied
homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Skid row's notoriety spreads beyond city boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Jacksonville, Fla., cops infamously put a homeless man on
a bus to L.A.'s skid row. The disabled Vietnam vet ended up being
taken in by LAMP, an organization for the mentally ill homeless. The
group helped him obtain his veteran's benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department releases dozens of
indigent prisoners from the nearby county jail each day. Many of the
former inmates suffer from addictions or mental illness and never
leave downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The problem got so bad that Sheriff Lee Baca proposed erecting an
open-air shelter near the jail, an idea that has met with resistance
from some business owners. He has installed another program at the
jail's release center, with the Volunteers of America manning a booth
to steer inmates toward support services and away from skid row.</TE>
<TE>   But last week's headline-grabbing police sweeps only accentuated
the perception of the area as a dangerous frontier.</TE>
<TE>   From 30,000 to 40,000 parolees are released back to Los Angeles
County from state prisons each year, and some studies estimate that
as many as 50% are homeless for a period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Some ex-cons fall back into crime, but many are trying to stay
clean even though they say few programs are available to help them
reenter society.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento and Oakland, an experimental program that requires
parolees to attend reorientation sessions and provides support
services has reduced recidivism and homelessness, said Department of
Corrections spokesman Russ Heimerich. The program is not yet
available in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Housing vouchers are available for some parolees, but priority is
given to those at highest risk of being rearrested, such as sex
offenders, Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had never been homeless before hitting skid row. He has
experience as a warehouseman, a forklift driver and a trucker and has
filled out dozens of job applications. But there have been no offers
for a 50-year-old ex-felon.</TE>
<TE>   In his time on skid row, he has witnessed the downward spiral of
others like himself.</TE>
<TE>   "They lose faith in something good happening to them and resort to
drinking and using drugs just to function from day to day," said
Williams, who has caught pneumonia since his release and struggles to
speak without hacking. "It ruins reality for them, and they wind up
staying down here. Some stay to the point of going insane."</TE>
<TE>   When Diane DeFrancisco, 51, was paroled from the California
Institute for Women at Frontera recently after an 18-month stint for
drug possession, she got on a bus and came to skid row because "I
knew if I had to sleep on the sidewalk I could."</TE>
<TE>   She settled on Towne Avenue in a tent, renting out one side for $5
per half hour. She had to move when two women sleeping on the street
nearby objected to her presence, feeling she might be a prostitute
who would steal some of their business.</TE>
<TE>   DeFrancisco -- small and wiry with close-cropped hair -- escaped
downtown for a while, renting a room in Tujunga until a fight with
her landlady. The scrape landed her back on skid row, this time in a
transient hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be down here till my parole ends in March, then I want to go
back home to Chicago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Neely is executive director of skid row's Homeless Outreach
Program, part of which provides services for parolees. Many of them,
Neely said, are suffering from mental illnesses and released from
prison with no medications.</TE>
<TE>   They are angry and agitated and they can fall into what Neely
calls a homeless paralysis, unable to see anything beyond day-to-day
survival.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the problems associated with homelessness -- sidewalk
encampments, panhandling, drug use -- have reached a critical mass,
affecting public health and safety.</TE>
<TE>   But crackdowns in the past have been short-lived. And Neely and
others say some of the problems of skid row stem from deliberate
policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   When the railroads came downtown in the 1870s, a large transient
population of railroad men and packing plant workers stayed in
single-room hotels, said Donald R. Spivack, deputy administrator of
the city's Community Redevelopment Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The temperance movement brought the first missions to the area,
and the Great Depression turned transient workers into the transient
unemployed, many of them alcoholics.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1976 report, the Los Angeles Community Design Center outlined
a policy of "physical containment" of homeless people and services on
skid row to lessen their impact on the rest of downtown. That policy
has been more or less followed for 27 years. As a result, many
facilities were added or refurbished.</TE>
<TE>   It is a community, Spivack emphasized, with about 6,500
single-room hotel units housing about 8,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a neighborhood like any other although it is not treated as
such. But it is entitled to the same considerations as anyplace
else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Spivack agreed that the city and county have to look at ways
to disperse services.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Capt. Charles Beck, commander of the Central
Division, said the behavior accepted on skid row would not be
tolerated anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "I think now people want something more for Los Angeles," Beck
said. "There's a lot of revitalization, and they see the core of the
city as an asset. Maybe that wasn't in the city fathers' minds 30 or
40 years ago when they placed all of the services in one place."</TE>
<TE>   What's needed, he added, is "the collective will of society not to
let people live like this."</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspects Slipped Past Authorities Time and Again</HD>
<DH>Investigators often did their best, but the duo's 18-month
trek reveals law enforcement flaws.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bound together on their relentless 18-month odyssey across the
country, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo moved like ghosts
through the American system, skirting past authorities every time
they ran into trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The vast network of federal and local agencies responsible for
maintaining public order lost sight of the perturbed Gulf War veteran
and the Jamaican teenager the same way thousands of common criminals
and illegal immigrants are left to vanish each day into the
underground.</LD>
<LD>   Some failures were outright human error. But many were the
familiar structural shortcomings that plague bureaucracies in a
democratic society -- the inevitable minor breakdowns that occur in
institutions that rarely operate at peak efficiency. Overburdened
officials missed cues, hampered by poor communication among agencies.
Government inquiries moved slowly or sputtered out. Technology failed
to perform as promised.</LD>
<TE>   In many instances, authorities appeared to have done their best as
they wrestled with warnings about the two drifters charged in the
sniper attacks that killed 10 people, left three critically wounded
and traumatized Washington's suburbs last month. But bad luck and
poor timing often intervened.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like one of those connect-the-dot paintings," said James
Cavanaugh, a veteran U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
supervisor involved in the sniper task force investigation. "We had
single dots, but you need a whole bunch of dots to figure out what
picture you've got."</TE>
<TE>   A low-level State Department alert that might have thwarted them
at the Canadian border was not passed on to proper authorities,
allowing the suspects to slip into the country. Police and federal
agents in Washington state failed to pursue warnings about Muhammad
from suspicious acquaintances. Malvo was able to stay on with
Muhammad even after immigration agents determined the Jamaican
teenager was in the U.S. illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the three-week spate of shootings, evidence found at
an Alabama crime scene was not compared quickly to federal databases
that might have led to the two suspects. And as the shootings
mounted, Muhammad and Malvo surfaced repeatedly in front of an army
of investigators, but remained anonymous until their own brazen
mistakes finally tripped them up.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that the sniper case has exposed bureaucratic flaws that
might be exploited by terrorists, some federal and local police and
government agencies are now considering some fine-tuning, sobered by
the human wreckage attributed to two penniless drifters, a
telescope-equipped rifle and a $250 junker sedan allegedly converted
into a rolling sniper's nest.</TE>
<TE>   "The worry here is that we might see the same sort of multi-state
crime wave repeated, not so much by organized terrorists, but by
random sympathizers," said a Justice Department official.</TE>
<TE>   Changes Doubtful</TE>
<TE>   But criminal justice experts who have examined the performance of
public agencies in their pursuit of elusive killers doubt there will
be widespread changes. Unlike the public outcry that followed the
televised horrors of Sept. 11, the serial sniper killings traumatized
a region, not a nation -- and the Washington area's sense of urgency
faded soon after the suspects' Oct. 24 arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of second-guessing and Monday-morning
quarterbacking and pointing to the mistakes that were made -- and
there are some," said James Alan Fox, an analyst of serial killings
and professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Government agencies may weed out common criminals before they
transform into serial killers. But no bureaucracy is prescient: "Were
it not for that rampage and the many [Muhammad] allegedly killed,"
Fox said, "he would just be a run-of-the-mill crook who falls through
the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   The falling began nearly two years ago. Even before Muhammad and
Malvo left Antigua for the United States last year, U.S. officials
had reason to stop them at the border. But a series of breakdowns in
communications among agencies responsible for monitoring traffic into
the U.S. allowed the future sniper suspects to make their way to
Washington state, where the cross-country murder binge allegedly
began.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad had been living in Antigua since March 28, 2000. He had
flown there with his three children. All were using fake names after
Muhammad's bitter falling out with his wife, Mildred, in Washington
state.</TE>
<TE>   Settling in a shack on the tourist resort island, Muhammad began
using forged papers to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United
States. Among those Muhammad supplied with phony documents, Antiguan
and U.S. authorities said, was Una James, Malvo's Jamaican-born
mother.</TE>
<TE>   John Fuller, an Antiguan lawyer heading up that nation's
investigation into Muhammad's activities there, said the sniper
suspect was "a serial forger" whose crude computer-generated
documents should have been red flags to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Odyssey Begins</TE>
<TE>   There were only fitful warnings, quickly buried by bureaucracy. In
March 2001, Muhammad was detained at the airport by Antiguan police
after he allegedly tried to smuggle out a Jamaican national but
escaped from custody before he could be charged. Julie Ryder, a U.S.
consular agent on the island, alerted the U.S. Embassy in Barbados to
Muhammad's activities, and that warning was passed on to the State
Department's Diplomatic Security Service for investigation.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate follow-through. A State Department official
said that without overwhelming proof that Muhammad was involved in
massive document forging or illegal smuggling schemes, his case was
not a high priority at the time. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have
since made porous border checkpoints a top concern, prompting
officials to scrutinize travel documents more closely.</TE>
<TE>   But the March 2001 alert about Muhammad's Antiguan detention was
not enough for State Department investigators to press for a warrant
from the Justice Department, the State official said. "Diplomatic
Security would have [had] to investigate further," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials also did not add Muhammad's name to the Treasury
Enforcement Communications System, a database used by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies to scan at
airports and border points for undesirables. The two agencies usually
coordinate, but the Muhammad probe was at too early a stage, the
State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, immigration officials knew nothing of Ryder's alert
when Muhammad flew into Miami International Airport on April 14,
2001. Muhammad was questioned by INS anti-smuggling investigators
after officials noticed he was traveling with two Jamaican women and
a child.</TE>
<TE>   The Jamaicans were quickly deported under INS "expedited removal"
provisions, a Justice official said. INS investigators were concerned
enough about Muhammad's activities, the official said, to contact the
U.S. attorney's office in Miami for guidance.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant prosecutor declined to pursue charges, the Justice
official said, and Muhammad was released. But Jacqueline Becerra, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, said there is no
evidence the INS referred the case for prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Muhammad again set out for the United States from
Antigua, this time with his children and Malvo in tow. On May 31,
they joined crowds of Memorial Day arrivals in Puerto Rico at San
Juan's Marin airport. Muhammad passed through without trouble. So did
Malvo, who authorities said was posing with a forged birth
certificate as Lindbergh Williams, Muhammad's son by a previous
marriage when living in Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official said the agency's border agents had little time to
examine Malvo's documents. The INS agents were working quickly under
a federal law that mandated travelers could not wait for more than 45
minutes in line -- a requirement repealed after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "No system is foolproof," said an INS official. "There are people
out there who will always attempt to exploit the system."</TE>
<TE>   Splintered Family</TE>
<TE>   Once in the U.S., Malvo joined his mother, Una James, in Fort
Myers, Fla., while Muhammad returned to Washington state. By year's
end, Muhammad's family life was in tatters. After Muhammad's children
were found staying with him in a homeless shelter in Bellingham,
Wash., child welfare officials returned them to his ex-wife. His only
consolation was the arrival of Malvo, now a runaway.</TE>
<TE>   Their budding companionship was threatened in December 2001 by the
intervention of police and immigration authorities. After arriving in
Bellingham, Wash., by bus, James asked police to help her find her
runaway son. Police turned Malvo over to child protection officials,
who reunited him with James on the condition they return to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But four days later, a Bellingham High School official noticed
Malvo was back in class. Alarmed, the official contacted Border
Patrol agents. Rounding up Malvo and James, INS officials
fingerprinted them, a routine procedure that later proved crucial in
connecting Malvo to the sniper killings.</TE>
<TE>   The pair lied to Border Patrol agents, saying they had stowed away
to Florida on a cargo boat, then changed their story, claiming they
had paid a smuggler to sneak them into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative critics of INS policy and some Border Patrol agents
have seized on Malvo's case as an example of the agency's
inefficiency. Malvo and his mother, they said, should have been
quickly deported as stowaways.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Pierce, a Border Patrol agent in Tampa, Fla., and vice
president of the agents' National Border Patrol Council, criticized
the INS for lax deportation policies. But Pierce also noted that the
agency's "expedited removal" is allowed only when illegal immigrants
are caught near their port of entry. And INS officials said the
pair's changing stories tied their hands, forcing delays while they
sought lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   James was freed after she posted $1,500 bond in January, and Malvo
was released in her custody. They were ordered to return for a
closed-door hearing, which was repeatedly delayed. At the hearing
finally held in Seattle last week, an immigration judge ordered James
deported. Malvo, who like Muhammad is being held by Virginia
authorities in the sniper killings, did not attend.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official insisted that Malvo "was treated as the system
would treat any individual. I would dispute an assertion that Malvo
slipped through a crack."</TE>
<TE>   But within days, the boy had fled from his mother again, rejoining
Muhammad in the Bellingham shelter. As Muhammad found odd jobs around
town, his brooding chatter about buying silencers and killing police
frightened some acquaintances into contacting police and federal
agents.</TE>
<TE>   Calls Unanswered</TE>
<TE>   Al Archer, director of the Light House Mission, where Muhammad and
Malvo stayed, said he told the FBI's Seattle office about suspicions
that Muhammad's frequent travels might indicate a terrorist
connection. Archer said he never heard back from the bureau. ATF
officials were also tipped off that Muhammad had asked a gunsmith to
illegally file down a rifle barrel. But after the gunsmith told an
ATF agent he did not know Muhammad's name, the agency lost interest.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2002, Harjeet Singh, a man who had befriended Muhammad,
told police the former Army veteran had talked admiringly of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, asked for help in making a silencer and
confessed an urge to "shoot a police officer," then plant a bomb at
the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Two Bellingham officers and an FBI agent met with Singh, but again
nothing came of it. "Including me, five people from Bellingham told
the FBI about him, but they never did anything," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials say they referred the case to the Seattle ATF office
because of possible firearm violations. Martha Tebbenkamp, the ATF's
spokeswoman in Seattle, said her office "never got any kind of a
formal referral about Muhammad from the Bellingham Police Department
or any other law-enforcement agency." The only informal contacts, she
said, came "over coffee or during a meeting" with police and FBI
agents.</TE>
<TE>   By summer, it no longer mattered. Muhammad and Malvo were on the
road, heading east through a drifter's landscape of highway rest
stops and YMCAs. They were allegedly armed with a Bushmaster XM-15
rifle that had disappeared from the shelf of a Tacoma, Wash., gun
shop. After the sniper suspects were captured, ATF agents spent eight
days inspecting the shop's sales records but were unable to find any
documentation of the weapon's sale. The gun shop later filed a police
report claiming the gun had been stolen -- unnoticed -- from a
display rack.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities now say the rifle and a .22 Magnum handgun were used
in a string of killings and robberies spanning from Maryland to the
Deep South. On Sept. 21, the sniper suspects allegedly killed a man
at an Atlanta liquor store. Hours later, one woman was killed and
another was wounded at a Montgomery, Ala., liquor store. On Sept. 24,
a beauty supplier was slain as she left her shop in Baton Rouge, La.,
Muhammad's childhood home.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives pursued each killing as a local crime, unaware of the
links to crimes in neighboring states. But the suspects stumbled
during the slaying of Claudine Parker, a Montgomery liquor store
clerk, authorities said. A patrolman saw a youth later identified as
Malvo standing over Parker's body. And police recovered .223-caliber
fragments and a magazine page bearing a fingerprint -- key evidence
that would help link Malvo, then Muhammad, to the sniper slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama forensics examiners spent a futile month examining the
fingerprint and bullet fragments. Evidence technicians at the Alabama
Bureau of Investigation compared the single print from the liquor
store killing with thousands filed on index cards at the bureau's
Auburn headquarters. But the bureau found nothing because its
database is "primarily Alabama crimes," said spokeswoman Dee Dee
Sharp.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has built a massive forensics database over the last
decade, offering states the ability to find millions of possible
matches. The bureau's Automated Fingerprint Information System
provides more than 44 million fingerprints on its database. Daunted
by high costs of the technology and hesitating to commit manpower,
only 19 states have so far tapped into the FBI system, said FBI
spokesman Paul Bresson.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama officials did not send the Montgomery liquor store print
on to the FBI, convinced that most of their forensic leads are found
within their own files. Some law enforcement authorities suggest that
this failure prevented Montgomery police from focusing earlier on
Malvo as a possible suspect in the Sept. 21 slaying. The FBI's
database contained Malvo's INS fingerprints -- and technicians
probably would have made the match with the print recovered from the
Montgomery crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Alabama bureau insisted they were employing
normal procedure. "Everybody's following their own protocol," Sharp
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama officials also did not tap into the ATF's National
Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database containing
nearly 900,000 images of bullets and cartridges from crime scenes
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Idle</TE>
<TE>   F. Taylor Noggle, interim director of Alabama's Bureau of Forensic
Sciences, said his agency looked at only state ballistics files but
"didn't have anything in our database that matched." Alabama had a
network machine in its Birmingham office, but it wasn't up and
running, Noggle said, because state technicians were still learning
how to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama authorities did send the Montgomery fragments to federal
officials once sniper task force investigators suspected their cases
were linked. But even then, technicians could not make a match until
Muhammad and Malvo were arrested and their rifle was test-fired.</TE>
<TE>   The test-firing was the pivotal moment, sniper task force
investigators say, when they knew they had their suspects. They had
spent three weeks searching desperately for the killers, unaware that
Muhammad's car -- a battered 1990 Chevrolet Caprice bought in New
Jersey in September -- had been repeatedly spotted by police.</TE>
<TE>   Police who noticed it ran computer checks on the car 10 times
between Oct. 2, the night of the first shooting into a Michaels
crafts store, and the suspects' Oct. 24 capture.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was screaming: 'Stop me,' " said a federal investigator.
"It's dilapidated. It's got Jersey tags. It's got a homemade window
tint." And several officers told investigators they were suspicious
because they had recognized the vehicle as a converted police car.</TE>
<TE>   Each time they scanned the Caprice, police were provided
information from Maryland motor vehicle records and the FBI's
National Crime Information Center files, a database of 12 systems
scanning criminal histories, vehicles and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But the tag checks found nothing useful, authorities said. There
were no roadway violations. Muhammad's Antiguan detention was not
serious enough to warrant inclusion. A Washington state shoplifting
arrest was too insignificant for storage, FBI officials say. And a
Washington state restraining order barring him from stalking his
ex-wife and children was not available, FBI officials said, because
such orders are not a regular feature of the system.</TE>
<TE>   Without a file that provided "probable cause" to search Muhammad's
Caprice, police did not stop or search the car, letting it drive off
again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "Those officers were clearly paying attention," said Gary M. Bald,
an FBI special agent from Baltimore who headed the bureau's massive
task force contingent. "They just didn't realize what they were
looking at."</TE>
<TE>   At least one witness had accurately described the blue Caprice at
a Virginia shooting scene in a Fredericksburg mall on Oct. 4.
Spotsylvania County Sheriff Ronald Knight said the witness insisted
to investigators that he had spotted "a Caprice, dark-colored, either
blue or black."</TE>
<TE>   The report was forwarded to the task force but went unheeded. The
lookout was for white box trucks or vans. Another witness had seen a
Caprice "driving away slowly" from a sniper murder scene the night
before in Washington, D.C. But that car was described as
burgundy-colored, said D.C. Metropolitan Police spokesman Joe
Gentile. D.C. detectives mistakenly searched for that Caprice,
finding only a "burned-out burgundy Plymouth," Gentile said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the witnesses had the colors right, we might have got this
thing wrapped up weeks earlier," a federal investigator said. "But
you're only as good as the information you get. We just didn't have
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Reports that the killers were unable to get through on FBI-run
police tip lines prompted bureau Director Robert S. Mueller III to
order a review of the training given to his phone-answering teams.</TE>
<TE>   But one federal investigator said the killers also hung up on
dispatchers several times, apparently fearing their calls would be
traced. One call from the killers suddenly clicked off, the
investigator said, because "one of those geniuses ran out of
quarters."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and other federal agencies are also planning reviews of
their handling of the sniper case. And some state governments are
showing a new surge of interest in hooking up to the ATF ballistics
system and the FBI's fingerprint databases, Bresson and other
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the suburban Washington epicenter where six residents were
slain, Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan has asked aides to
look into devising a system that police could use to learn quickly if
suspect vehicles are repeatedly scanned by patrol car computers.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said they doubted such a system would
have made a difference during the sniper killings. Investigators
would likely have been deluged with the names of scores of motorists
whose cars provoked repeated tag checks by police, Bald said.</TE>
<TE>   But Duncan said he intends to pursue a warning system to "make
sure that if someone's tag gets rung up time after time, it triggers
somewhere in our database so police can take a closer look at that
person. That clearly didn't happen this time."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUEKOUE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Government troop reinforcements sped toward the western Ivory Coast
on Friday to try to quell a rebellion that has split control of the
West African country three ways.</LD>
<LD>   The south is under loyalist control, the north has been held by
rebels for more than two months, and a chunk of the west is now in
the hands of other insurgents.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of heavily armed troops massed in the town of Duekoue,
joining soldiers who were driven Thursday from Danane and Man, about
300 miles northwest of the country's main city, Abidjan.</LD>
<TE>   The rebels holding Man said they were planning to advance south
and seek the death of President Laurent Gbagbo for the killing of a
former junta leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to go all the way to Abidjan," said a spokesman for
the group, which calls itself the Movement for Justice and Peace.</TE>
<TE>   The faction is linked to Gen. Robert Guei, who ruled for 10 months
after a 1999 coup and was shot to death by loyalists Sept. 19, the
day of a failed coup attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Young rebels in stolen pickup trucks cruised the streets of the
captured towns.</TE>
<TE>   On Ivory Coast's northern battle front, French troops reported
that Gbagbo's forces and foreign mercenaries had pulled back behind a
cease-fire line after striking into territory held by main rebel
group Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast.</TE>
<TE>   French soldiers are monitoring a truce agreed to six weeks ago by
rebels who have held most of the largely Muslim north since the
failed coup kicked off the war.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds have died in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The latest violence has added to confusion at peace talks between
the main rebel group and government negotiators in Togo. Nearly a
month of wrangling has brought little sign of a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The northern rebels accuse Gbagbo, a Christian from the southwest,
of encouraging ethnic discrimination and want him to step down.</TE>

<HD>Navy Faces a Terrorist Minefield in Persian Gulf</HD>
<DH>Concerned about possible underwater explosives, the service
is going full speed ahead in hunting down the deadly devices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain</DL>
<LD>As a possible conflict with Iraq approaches, the U.S. Navy has
serious concerns that terrorists might try to strike ships in the
Persian Gulf by mining the busy waterway.</LD>
<LD>   Mines, said a veteran captain of a Navy minesweeper, are "the poor
man's weapon of choice": cheap to buy, easy to deploy and difficult
to detect. Finding mines in the Gulf is made more difficult by the
high salinity and murkiness of the water.</LD>
<LD>   Since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, during which two American
warships were damaged by mines, the United States and other Western
countries have sharply increased their efforts at mine detection in
the region.</LD>
<TE>   Four American anti-mine ships, a mine-hunting helicopter squadron
and a group of Navy divers are assigned full time to the Persian Gulf
to seek out the explosive devices. At the request of the U.S., the
British Royal Navy in recent days deployed four mine-hunting ships to
the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to quantify the threat," said Stephen Saunders,
editor of Jane's Fighting Ships. "The essence of mine warfare is not
so much what you know but what you don't. The discovery of one mine,
however old and unsophisticated, poses problems."</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces are known to have
bottom, drifting and moored mines in their inventory, U.S. Navy
officials are confident that the threat posed by his military has
largely been thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and its allies cleared more than 1,300 Iraqi mines from
the area after the 1991 war, and the Iraqi navy no longer enjoys
unfettered access to the Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has mines purchased from China and Russia, as well as
Russian-made submarines that can be used to place mines. But the
Iranians have assisted the U.S. in recent months in blocking Iraqi
oil tankers from violating a United Nations restriction on oil
exports, and some civilian analysts believe they have also provided
intelligence about mines.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest mine threat is not posed by Iraq but by terrorists who
want to make a political statement or kill Americans, according to
Lt. Christopher Davis, spokesman for the Navy's 5th Fleet,
headquartered here in Bahrain, a tiny island nation in the Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   The cheapness and portability of mines "makes some kind of
harassment or limited offensive mining campaign a serious concern,"
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Mines can be purchased for a few hundred dollars and dumped
overboard by boats no larger than the fishing vessels that are
ubiquitous in the Gulf. The Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka have used
mines to sink a number of that nation's naval ships.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., Britain and Australia are continually monitoring the
Gulf -- with ships, aircraft and satellites -- but no amount of
surveillance is absolute, officials note.</TE>
<TE>   "Mines are very 'layable' by small boats, and with all the traffic
in the Persian Gulf all the time, it's not hard to imagine a fishing
boat carrying a mine or two," said retired Rear Adm. John Pearson,
chairman of the mine warfare division at the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the kind of operation that would stick out like a sore
thumb," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The British anti-mine warfare ships Bangor, Blyth, Sandown and
Brocklesby -- accompanied by the supply ship Sir Bevidere -- are
slated for "interoperability" training with U.S. and Saudi Arabian
ships that are scouring the Gulf for mines, in anticipation of a
large number of U.S. ships being sent to Kuwait carrying troops and
supplies necessary for a land offensive against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A century ago, the Royal Navy was the largest in the world. Now
the fleet is barely one-tenth the size of the U.S. Navy. But mine
hunting remains a British area of expertise, with skills honed by
decades of standing guard against possible mining of Britain and the
western European coastline by the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has two main classes of anti-mine warfare ships -- Osprey
and Avenger -- both of which can detect and neutralize mines. The
Osprey, known as a mine hunter, is used primarily in coastal waters;
the larger Avenger is a minesweeper with greater detection
capability.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the possibility of "non-state actors," which is the
military euphemism for terrorists, attempting to lay mines in the
Gulf, U.S. Navy officials responsible for hunting mines are confident
that they and their allies -- the French, Dutch and Germans also have
done minesweeping in the Gulf -- will repel any threat.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Gulf War, which some analysts believe caught the U.S.
Navy without a minesweeping plan, any new conflict would come after a
decade of attention to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very large footprint in the Gulf these days," said
Capt. Terry Miller, mine warfare command operations officer at the
Navy's training center at Corpus Christi, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, detecting mines remains a tedious business even with new
technology and improved training. A mine-hunting ship that moves at 4
knots -- just over 4 mph -- is considered speedy; sonar often cannot
detect the difference between a bottom mine and a sunken
refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "Mine warfare is one of the most difficult, time-consuming,
complicated, exacting and least understood areas of modern warfare,"
said Cmdr. Steven Ritchie, former commanding officer of the
Avenger-class minesweeper Scout.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding a small, irregular shaped and sometimes nonmetallic mine
is similar to finding the proverbial needle in a haystack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry was recently on assignment in Manama.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>A regional official warned coastal residents Friday to brace for the
worst this weekend as another massive slick from a sunken tanker
drifted toward shore, and he said the ship is probably still leaking
fuel oil from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The tanker Prestige was carrying about 77,000 tons when it split
in two and sank Nov. 19.</LD>
<LD>   Reconnaissance planes have spotted new slicks, Galicia's fisheries
minister, Enrique Lopez Veiga, said in Santiago de Compostela.</LD>
<TE>   The central government said anything bubbling up from the Prestige
was probably the ship's own fuel or lubricant, but it did not rule
out that the cargo of oil could be leaking.</TE>
<TE>   The oil had been expected to solidify at temperatures just above
freezing.</TE>

<HD>Islamic Hard-Liner Takes Office</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An Islamic hard-liner was sworn in Friday to lead a Pakistani
province considered vital in the hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban
fugitives. He vowed to impose strict religious rule in the area.</LD>
<LD>   "Implementation of Islamic laws will be our first priority," said
Akram Durrani, the new chief minister of the North West Frontier
Province.</LD>
<LD>   Durrani rode to power in nationwide elections last month on
support for a radical religious alliance. The result has triggered
concern in Washington about a backlash against President Pervez
Musharraf's support for the fight against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance, the United Action Forum, had its best showing in two
of Pakistan's four provinces that border Afghanistan. In these deeply
conservative regions, clan ties often outweigh regional or national
interests.</TE>
<TE>   The victory marks the first time a hard-line religious group has
won control of a Pakistani province and came after leaders criticized
the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan. The groups supported
Afghanistan's former Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance also polled well in Baluchistan province, also on the
Afghan border, where it still has a chance of forming a coalition
government. The hard-liners also won enough support to be a powerful
opposition voice in the national legislature, which last week elected
moderate, pro-U.S. Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali as prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani security forces, with help from U.S. agencies, are
searching for Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants in the border regions.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali has said the government will continue Musharraf's policies
of working with the United States in the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, however, Durrani said he would not let U.S.
troops operate in his territory if he were elected chief minister.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech to the provincial assembly, Durrani said he would
crack down on alcohol consumption and gambling -- which are already
illegal under Pakistani law, although violations frequently occur in
private.</TE>

<HD>To Save $200, Life Will Have to Wait</HD>
<DH>Bargain hunters stand in line for two hours to get into a
Fry's Electronics store.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 20 minutes it took to park Friday at Fry's Electronics in
Fountain Valley was nothing compared with the two-hour wait to enter
the store.</LD>
<LD>   Within an hour of its 7 a.m. opening, the store was filled to its
1,469-person capacity, forcing arriving customers to stand in line
outside before being allowed to enter.</LD>
<LD>   Fountain Valley fire officials, who had come to assist with a
minor medical incident, noticed that the store was extremely crowded
and suggested to store managers that they create a line to help
control the flow of customers into the location, Fire Chief Joe
Vasile said.</LD>
<TE>   "It promises good things for the rest of the holiday season when
you're almost kicking people out the first day," Fry's spokesman
Manuel Valerio said.</TE>
<TE>   By noon, shoppers inside the store were scribbling down rebate
information by hand because all the forms were gone. Outside, a line
of about 100 customers, many clutching store ads with selected items
marked, snaked along the building.</TE>
<TE>   With consumers worried about war, terrorism and the state of their
pocketbooks, Fry's, like many of the nation's retailers, used
discounts and other early-bird specials as bait to get shoppers into
its stores on the day after Thanksgiving. The San Jose-based chain
advertised its "lowest prices of the year" and $200 off most computer
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   At the Fountain Valley Fry's, some would-be customers walked away
when they realized the line outside was just to get into the store.</TE>
<TE>   But others said the potential savings were worth the wait.</TE>
<TE>   Pete McGovern, 31, of Newport Beach had been at the store when it
opened and snatched up a $40 DVD player and a $700 laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   He returned around noon to help his friend Melissa Hernandez pick
out her own laptop and accessories for the machine she hoped would
still be in stock.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's a sale like this, you need to have a complete
military strategy," said McGovern, who planned the fastest route to
the computer section while standing in line. "You can't just waltz
around and hope the good deals are still going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, 20, a junior at UC Irvine, said knowing she would save
hundreds of dollars justified the wait.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were just to save $2, I would have gone home," she said.
"But $200? I can spare the time to wait for that kind of deal."</TE>

<LD>A man charged in a Philadelphia crack house massacre in which seven
people died two years ago pleaded guilty Friday and will probably
testify against the other three suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Veney, 26, pleaded guilty to seven counts of third-degree
murder, robbery and related offenses. In exchange, prosecutors will
recommend Veney get 15 to 30 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Police initially believed the massacre resulted from a turf battle
among drug dealers. But prosecutors now say the slayings were touched
off by a dispute over a car with a broken clutch.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>Former Providence Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci Jr. bid adieu to his
working life Friday as he readied himself for prison.</LD>
<LD>   His last day as a talk-show host at WPRO-AM ended with a
relatively upbeat mood.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, this is it," said Cianci, 61, as his shift ended.</LD>
<TE>   Next Friday, he reports to federal prison in Fort Dix, N.J., for a
sentence of five years and four months.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci was convicted in June on a racketeering conspiracy charge
for heading a wide-ranging bribery scheme out of City Hall. He has
maintained his innocence and held out hope for a successful appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at life as an experience," Cianci told
listeners. "You believe in yourself, and you believe in the
[judicial] system, and you go on and live with it."</TE>
<TE>   Cianci presided over the rebirth of Providence for parts of four
decades but decided not to seek reelection after his conviction. In
mid-September, he accepted an offer to be co-host of a talk show for
two hours each weekday morning.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't his first turn behind a microphone: He was host of a
show on another station from 1984 to 1990, after he pleaded no
contest to assaulting his wife's lover with a lighted cigarette and a
fireplace log. Cianci was reelected mayor in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday's show, Cianci said he's been preparing for his life
behind bars. He said he may try to quit smoking, lose weight and
learn Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going to a very inexpensive spa," he said.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Temperatures hovered near freezing, storm clouds threatened a mix of
wet snow and rain, and Chester MacDonald was happily up to his knees
in muck.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen months after post-Sept. 11 security worries drove
MacDonald and dozens of other clam diggers off the flats near Logan
International Airport, he returned Friday to the backbreaking work he
loves.</LD>
<LD>   Under a state law approved this summer, about 40 to 50 clam
diggers who used to work the flats have been allowed to return --
after being fingerprinted by police, issued new identification cards
and receiving a security briefing.</LD>
<TE>   MacDonald, 71, was among more than two dozen clammers who showed
up Friday, their first day back.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a godsend here, because Christmas is coming," he said.
"All I can tell you is that it's been a long 14 months."</TE>
<TE>   The day after the 2001 terrorist attacks, clammers were evicted
from about five miles of prime flats in Boston Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Port Authority officials then established a 500-foot
security zone around the airport that included the rich clamming
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The clammers appealed to lawmakers, who passed a law giving the
diggers an exemption to the security zone, provided they passed
background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Massport officials frowned at the exemption, calling it a "less
than ideal scenario in terms of securing the airport perimeter."</TE>
<TE>   The clammers each have to pay $110 for the background check,
fingerprinting and an ID card. They have to attend an anti-terrorism
class, where they are told to immediately report any suspicious
activity or people on the waters around Logan.</TE>
<TE>   They also must wear a black and yellow vest while clamming in the
secure zone.</TE>
<TE>   The clammers are so familiar with the airport's noise and smell of
burnt rubber, most knew something was amiss the morning of Sept. 11,
2001, when suddenly everything went silent.</TE>
<TE>   It was only hours later that they learned two of the planes that
left Logan that morning were hijacked and flown into the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald said the clammers will make the airport more secure, not
less.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows this waterfront better than us?" he asked. "Anyone we
see who doesn't belong here, we call the police."</TE>
<TE>   The three beds near the airport are some of the most productive in
the state and key to their economic survival, clammers said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the roughly 150 days a year the clam diggers work in Boston
Harbor, more than half are spent on the beds near the runways. The
beds also account for most of the 16,000 bushels of clams hauled out
of the area each year.</TE>
<TE>   The clammers said they lost about 70% of their clams and profits
during the 14 months they were barred from the flats.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald said he will make about $160 from the 4 1/4 bushels he
dug during his first day back.</TE>

<LD>Six Cubans found in a stranded boat were released to relatives Friday
from U.S. immigration custody, including a 14-year-old boy
authorities say is a material witness in the case against two alleged
smugglers.</LD>
<LD>   The boat ran out of fuel Monday off Key West, Fla. The Coast Guard
towed it to shore, unaware the six were hiding inside. The five
adults scampered onto a dock. Cubans who make it to shore usually are
allowed to stay in the U.S. The boy was not sent back to Cuba because
he is considered a witness against boat owner Elizardo Ruiz Alvarez
and Martin Mendez Diaz, officials said. The two Miami men were free
Friday in lieu of bail.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's mother in Cuba has identified him as Leonel Figueroa
Orozcohas. She said she wants him to remain in the United States with
his father.</LD>

<HD>Forbidden City Exhibit Allows for a Bit of History</HD>
<DH>A Hong Kong native duplicated -- at 1/20th the size -- the
complex of palaces in Beijing that served Chinese emperors for 500
years.</DH>

<LD>KATY, Texas -- Thirty miles west of the steel and glass of Houston,
rice fields flourish alongside new tract home developments. Land is
cheap, plentiful and relatively free of red tape -- which goes a long
way toward explaining how a 40-acre, $16-million miniaturized replica
of China's Forbidden City came to be built here by a reclusive
Seattle millionaire named Ira Poon.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Poon was born and raised in Hong Kong and wanted to pay
respect to his culture and America," said Melinda Schmidt, director
of Forbidden Gardens, as this intricately conceived homage to
imperial China is called. "When his children started school in
Seattle, he realized you learned very little about world history. So
he decided to build an educational museum."</LD>
<LD>   Poon's good intentions haven't exactly caught fire with the
neighbors here. It's not that they haven't noticed the orange pagodas
rising from the Texas prairie -- it's impossible not to. But "people
don't know what it's for," said Tommy Cassidy, 22, a museum
maintenance worker. "Lots of people think it's a Chinese restaurant.
To tell you the truth, so did I until I started working here."</LD>
<TE>   The Forbidden City, in the heart of Beijing, is a legendary
complex of palaces that served Chinese emperors and scholars from
1420 to 1911.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas version, which opened in 1996 down the road from a
Dollar Store, is a faithful reproduction 1/20th the size of the
original. A 40,000-square-foot outdoor pavilion shelters a series of
intricate, doll-size palaces populated by hundreds of ceramic
figurines.</TE>
<TE>   Loyal Guards</TE>
<TE>   An equally ambitious companion exhibit reproduces the tomb of
Emperor Qin (pronounced "chin" -- "China" is derived from his name).
Here, a huge earthen pit holds 6,000 half-size terra cotta soldiers
standing guard in long, neat rows.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance to the crypt is guarded by two marble half-man,
half-dog creatures that employees have dubbed Harry and Larry.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, every piece on display at the museum was handcrafted
by artisans in China and shipped to the Port of Houston. Poon
insisted on authenticity. The clay used to make his terra cotta
soldiers came from the Chinese province that produced the originals.
The palaces of the Forbidden City are painstakingly re-created with
carved dragons on the roofs, hand-painted tiles and wooden screens.
The ceramic figures of royalty, guards and concubines are dressed in
beautifully painted robes, uniforms and kimonos.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the expense and planning, the designers evidently
forgot one important detail: Houston's steam-bath climate. The sun
and humidity here have damaged some of the outdoor displays beyond
repair -- splintering wood, cracking clay figures and buckling
foundations never meant to withstand the punishing Texas heat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Chinese craftsmen were looking at it from an artist's
perspective, not how it would hold up in the kind of weather we have
here," said Marian Schmidt, the museum's assistant director and
Melinda's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Renovations began two months ago, and the small staff here is
doing what it can on what the younger Schmidt calls "a shoestring
budget." Maintenance workers like Cassidy are repainting cracked
palace walls and reinforcing sagging roofs.</TE>
<TE>   They spent days gluing heads and arms back onto the crumbling clay
soldiers guarding Emperor Qin's tomb. Each soldier originally held a
weapon -- fingers curled inward, thumb pointing skyward -- that were
lost to the sun. Now thousands of clay soldiers stand empty-handed,
giving the emperor a cheerful thumbs-up.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy brightened the gardens of several imperial palaces with
tiny, homemade cherry blossom and bonsai trees he purchased at a
craft store.</TE>
<TE>   "We went down to the Hobby Lobby and got a lot of cheap stuff,
like fake flowers, and put it all together," he said. "It was like
being in home-ec in high school."</TE>
<TE>   Periodic Checks</TE>
<TE>   Every so often, Poon's representatives come here to check on the
operation. The mysterious Poon hasn't made an appearance in two
years, Melinda Schmidt said. "He's quiet and soft-spoken. He may be
in his 60s. I think he made his fortune in real estate in Hong Kong
or Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Schmidt knows little about her employer.</TE>
<TE>   "We mainly deal with his representatives. I don't even know a
number to call for Mr. Poon," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 125,000 and 200,000 people visit the museum each year,
said Schmidt, who said museum officials were disappointed in the
attendance and attributed it, in part, to the delayed opening of a
nearby freeway. Most attendees are schoolchildren on field trips.</TE>
<TE>   They pay $5 a head to get in; adult admission is $10.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, Arty Gladstone, a visitor from Florida, stopped
to gaze at the maze of tiny palaces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cute, but it ain't the real thing," said Gladstone, 74, who
said he has toured China several times with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   But on closer inspection, he reassessed.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're going through the real thing, it's so immense you
lose perspective," he said. "Looking at this, you get a better sense
of what it's all about."</TE>

<DL>RIVERHEAD, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Celebrity publicist Elizabeth Grubman left jail quietly Friday after
serving time for backing her Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle into
a crowd outside a Hamptons nightclub and fleeing.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman, 31, avoided the cameras and was whisked away in a private
car after serving 37 days of a 60-day sentence at the Suffolk County
Jail, with time off for good behavior, said her lawyer, Stephen
Scaring.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman had built a thriving business promoting clients including
singer Britney Spears, rapper Jay-Z and the Backstreet Boys.</LD>
<TE>   She was jailed Oct. 23 after pleading guilty to assault and
leaving the scene of an accident outside the Conscience Point Inn,
where she backed into and injured at least 16 people after allegedly
shouting epithets at a club bouncer. Some witnesses said her actions
the morning of July 7, 2001, seemed deliberate, but Grubman said the
whole thing was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman still faces lawsuits filed by six people who were hurt.
Other plaintiffs have settled cases for undisclosed amounts.</TE>

<HD>38 in Hawaii Vie for 5-Week Seat in House</HD>
<DH>Among the hopefuls in today's vote to finish the late Rep.
Patsy T. Mink's term is her husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Cabdriver John Parker is taking a shot at being congressman for a
month.</LD>
<LD>   He's in good company. There are 38 hopefuls in a winner-takes-all
election today to serve out the last five weeks of late Rep. Patsy T.
Mink's term.</LD>
<LD>   Parker's pitch is all economics: He says he won't spend a penny
campaigning and promises to send anything he is paid back to the
national treasury.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't get a better deal from any candidate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sentimental favorite is Mink's widower, hydrologist John Mink,
who has no professed political ambitions and won't be running in the
more important race on Jan. 4 to determine who serves in Congress for
the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the costly election to fill out Mink's term say voters
today may share her husband's lukewarm attitude toward politics:
Ballot stations will be competing with the Hawaii vs. Alabama college
football game, the start of the holiday shopping season and surfing
contests on the North Shore's gigantic waves.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, even some candidates are showing apathy.</TE>
<TE>   Many haven't bothered to provide information about themselves on a
free state Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Congresswoman Mink, a Democrat, died Sept. 28 of pneumonia at age
74 while campaigning for reelection. Constituents voted her in
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The January election, in which 44 candidates are running for
Mink's seat, has much riding on it.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans see it as a chance to win their first Hawaii seat in
decades after their candidate, Linda Lingle, won the governorship
from the Democrats for the first time in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   One person taking today's election seriously is former state Rep.
Ed Case, who hopes victory will give him something of an incumbent's
luster that will carry over into January. The cousin of AOL
Time-Warner Chairman Stephen Case lost the Democratic gubernatorial
primary and is one of the few candidates to actively campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Several candidates backed out of the race in deference to John
Mink, who said he is running only in the hope of letting his late
wife's staff wrap up her affairs in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One of those who dropped out of the race and all but endorsed the
widower was Mink's Republican opponent in the November election,
former state Rep. Bob McDermott, who is running only for the full
term.</TE>
<TE>   Even the head of the state GOP, Micah Kane, called John Mink "the
right individual" for the short-term job.</TE>
<TE>   Votes from outlying precincts are to be flown uncounted to
Honolulu after the polls close. Counting is expected to be completed
and a winner announced by Sunday afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Calm Season for Hurricanes Comes to End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>With only four hurricanes, the Atlantic storm season that ends today
was the calmest in five years, and forecasters attributed it to the
climate phenomenon known as El Nino.</LD>
<LD>   Don't expect such help next year, though: Storm expert William
Gray said El Nino probably will be gone before the new season begins
July 1, and he echoed other forecasters' concerns about the potential
for a killer storm. "It's quite ominous because there's been such a
buildup of people along the Southeast coast," said Gray, from
Colorado State University.</LD>
<LD>   In all, the season produced a dozen tropical storms, two more than
average. The four hurricanes -- Gustav, Isidore, Kyle and Lili --
were two fewer than average, and all developed in less than a month,
between Sept. 8 and Oct. 4.</LD>
<TE>   Eight of the 12 tropical storms came in September, setting a
monthly record, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Likely to Get Geography Lesson in 2004</HD>
<DH>Analyses point to a repeat of what the party faced this
year: Many competitive races will be fought where President Bush is
the strongest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Geography is looming as a formidable barrier to Democrats' hopes of
recovering from their 2002 losses and recapturing either the Senate
or House in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Strategists in both major parties completing their first analyses
of the 2004 political landscape say Democrats will face a repeat of
the problem that confronted them in 2002: A disproportionate number
of the most competitive races will be fought in the places where
President Bush is strongest.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 11 Democratic representatives who won with the narrowest
margins this year, seven will be running in districts -- shown in red
on election night television -- that Bush carried in 2000. And 10 of
the 19 Democratic senators up for reelection in 2004 will be running
in red states.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, just three of the 15 Senate Republicans on the ballot
in 2004 are running in "blue" states, the ones that voted for
Democrat Al Gore in 2000. Likewise, five of the seven Republican
House members who won with the smallest margins in November will be
running in districts where Bush carried more than half the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nov. 5 elections, a similar tilt in the key battlegrounds
proved an enormous advantage for the GOP. Most of the GOP's House
gains came in districts Bush carried in 2000. And Bush's ability to
inspire turnout in the red states was a key to the Republicans'
recapture of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Geography turned out to be the strongest force in the cycle,"
said Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the advantage for the GOP in red-state congressional
races could be even more pronounced in 2004, when Bush is expected to
be on the ballot. After Bush's contribution this fall to Republican
victories against Democratic Sens. Max Cleland in Georgia and Jean
Carnahan in Missouri -- two states he carried last time -- Democratic
senators facing 2004 races in Bush-leaning states are already looking
over their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "The analogy is a wide receiver who is getting ready to catch the
ball, and can hear footsteps behind him," said Sen. John B. Breaux
(D-La.), who faces a 2004 reelection battle in a state Bush won
comfortably last time.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what you do, you can hear the footsteps of the White
House coming after you."</TE>
<TE>   That concern could spell rising conflict for Democrats over the
next two years. After the 2002 losses, many Democratic activists are
urging more confrontation with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Already that pressure has been reflected in the selection of
liberal Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) as House minority leader,
and the escalating attacks on Bush's agenda -- particularly his tax
cut -- from the likely 2004 Democratic presidential contenders.</TE>
<TE>   But after this year's elections, many of the Democrats from Bush
states may be even more reluctant to oppose him. That's because
Republicans scored points against red-state Democrats like Cleland
this fall by painting them as obstacles to Bush's agenda on issues
such as homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who is running in 2004 and knows the president is going
to be on the ballot has to worry," Breaux said. "You know that if I
am contrary to the president, he's going to come down and talk about
it. And so you worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, predicts that anxiety could produce widespread
pressure on Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota to
abandon the strategy of maximizing contrast with Bush and instead
look to cut deals that would allow vulnerable members to run in 2004
on shared accomplishments with the president.</TE>
<TE>   "Understanding the geography of the election, Daschle took an
enormous risk this time by making his guys play the opposition party
role," Bainwol said. "If the minority now instead decides to play
'let's make the government work,' then that has an impact on the
context of the next cycle."</TE>
<TE>   Most key elements of the electoral environment for that next
election cycle, of course, won't be known for many months: the state
of the economy, the outcome of the confrontation with Iraq, the
nation's success at preventing more terrorist attacks, and the
overall level of Bush's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing is already apparent: Many of the key contests that
will probably decide control of Congress will be in the states and
districts where Bush's support is almost certain to be at its
highest.</TE>
<TE>   And that could allow him to maximize his influence on the
congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bush demonstrated an impressive ability to leverage his
approval rating into votes, especially in the places where he is most
popular.</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 redistricting, the red states gained seven House
seats; if Republican Lee Fletcher, who's favored, wins a runoff next
week in Louisiana, the Republicans, on a net basis, will pick up all
seven of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Republicans won the Democratic seats in Missouri
and Georgia, both red states, and captured the seat left open by the
death of Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone in Minnesota, which Bush lost
only narrowly in 2000. Even in Minnesota, Republican Norm Coleman's
victory was powered by a surge in rural and exurban counties that
voted for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important to the Republican takeover was their success at
defeating serious Democratic Senate challenges in six other states
Bush carried in 2000; that list included five states where
Republicans were forced to defend an open seat.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest exception to the GOP's red-state dominance was in
Arkansas, where controversy about Republican Sen. Tim Hutchinson's
personal life helped carry Democrat Mark Pryor to victory.</TE>
<TE>   In 2004, Democrats will face as great a need to find ways of
winning in these Bush-leaning districts and states.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, the Democrats' problem is simple math: Although
Gore won more votes in 2000, Bush won more states -- 30 in all. Which
means 60 of the 100 senators come from Bush states.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 19 Senate Democrats up for reelection next time, six will
be running in states Bush carried by double digits: Zell Miller in
Georgia, John Edwards in North Carolina, Evan Bayh in Indiana, Ernest
F. Hollings in South Carolina, Daschle, and Byron L. Dorgan in North
Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Reid in Nevada, Blanche Lambert Lincoln in Arkansas and
Breaux will be running in states Bush won by single digits; Bob
Graham is up for reelection in Florida, which divided almost evenly
between Bush and Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings, Edwards, Lincoln and the South Dakota seat, if Daschle
retires, top the Republican target lists for next time.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have fewer obvious opportunities. Their top target will
probably be Sen. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, an increasingly
Democratic state in presidential voting.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats will also probably aim at Sens. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who will be running
in swing states that divided relatively narrowly between Gore and
Bush last time. Kentucky Republican Jim Bunning won by only 6,000
votes in 1998, but Bush's strength in the state may move him down on
the Democrats' list in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   It's a similar story in the House. Overall, Democrats had more
close calls this time than did Republicans. According to calculations
by independent political analyst Charlie Cook, 11 Democrats won with
51% of the vote or less, compared with seven Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans will aim first at the seven Democrats in that group
running in districts where Bush carried more than 50% of the vote --
sometimes astronomically more. In Texas, Democrat Charles W. Stenholm
squeaked by with 51% in a district where Bush won 72% in 2000; in
Utah, Jim Matheson managed 50% in a district that gave Bush 64% last
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go after those seats," GOP consultant John Morgan
said. "Those are ground zero."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, just two of the Republicans who won with 51% or
less are running in districts where Bush didn't carry a majority --
and in both those instances he won at least 48% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats' opportunities are greater one rung down: All three
House Republicans who carried between 51% and 52% of the vote this
month are running in districts Gore carried.</TE>
<TE>   Some high-ranking Democratic operatives believe this geography
could force the party into a defensive posture for 2004 that
minimizes their prospects of recapturing a House majority.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about evidence of a rising Republican tide in the red
states, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee late in the
2002 campaign quietly shifted emphasis. Rather than trying to gain
seats by funding challengers, it switched to protecting seats by
moving money toward embattled incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   But with Bush on the ballot, that trend could accelerate next
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We are playing defense in the red states and hoping to contain
the losses ... while hoping to move forward a little bit in the blue
states," one senior Democratic operative said. "It's not a recipe for
picking the House back up."</TE>

<HD>Mormon Church May Penalize Grad Student</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A graduate student with Mormon family roots says he probably will be
excommunicated next week for articles he has written questioning the
validity of the Book of Mormon.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas W. Murphy, 35, published an article in the May Signature
Books anthology, "American Apocrypha," which uses genetic data to
discredit the Book of Mormon claim that American Indians are heathen
descendants of ancient Israel. The conclusion also is the thesis of
his doctoral dissertation at the University of Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "We're told to tell the truth, but not if the truth contradicts
church doctrine. I would prefer to tell the truth," Murphy said.</LD>
<TE>   Murphy, chairman of the anthropology department at Edmonds
Community College in Lynnwood, Wash., will face a church disciplinary
council on Dec. 8. There, he will be allowed to make a statement and
council members may try to change his mind about the Book of Mormon.</TE>
<TE>   Church spokesman Dale Bills declined to comment specifically on
Murphy's case.</TE>
<TE>   "Matters of church discipline are handled on a confidential basis
between church members and their local leaders. Local church leaders
determine what, if any, disciplinary action is appropriate," Bills
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lavina Fielding Anderson, a historian who was excommunicated in
1993, said Murphy is one of at least three scholars either threatened
with expulsion or excommunicated in the last three months, raising
concerns about renewed efforts to purge dissident church members.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail sent Tuesday to Signature Books, Anderson said the
two other scholars were hoping to avoid public exposure. "Such
ecclesiastical actions are deeply distressing," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was excommunicated after she presented a history of
troubles among church leaders, scholars and feminists at a 1992
conference.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Elder Boyd Packer, a member of the Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, declared feminists, homosexuals and "so-called
intellectuals" dangers to the church. A series of excommunications
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said he has made it his quest to expose racism in the
scriptures, starting with the teaching that American Indians are
descendants of Middle Easterners known as Lamanites, the heathen
antagonists in the Book of Mormon.</TE>
<TE>   Mormons believe the Book of Mormon is a history of the Americas
beginning in 600 B.C. Scripture teaches that a group of Lamanites who
decided to forgo violence and war became Christians -- and white.</TE>
<TE>   "That's racist," Murphy said.</TE>

<HD>Officer Defies NYPD Over Homeless</HD>
<DH>The force suspends Eduardo Delacruz for his refusal to
arrest a man sleeping in a garage. He calls his stand a matter of
principle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Amid growing complaints that the New York Police Department is
singling out homeless people in anti-crime sweeps, police officials
have suspended an officer who refused orders to lock up a homeless
man sleeping in a private Manhattan garage.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Eduardo Delacruz was taken off the force for 30 days after
telling superiors he would not participate in the arrest of Stephen
Neil, 44. The man had refused a police request to immediately move on
or report to a shelter.</LD>
<LD>   Delacruz, who was part of the department's Homeless Outreach Unit,
reportedly had told other officers earlier that he would not take
homeless people into custody. According to a police report, he
reiterated that position when other officers began to arrest Neil
during the Nov. 22 incident, saying: "I told you before, I'm not
going to do it. I won't arrest an undomiciled person."</LD>
<TE>   The suspended policeman stood by his actions Friday, telling the
New York Post that his refusal was a matter of principle that "means
a lot to a lot of people." He has refused all further comment about
his suspension.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy underscored a growing debate over the way the NYPD
monitors homeless people. Although precise figures are not available,
police officials say that the number of homeless arrests for a
variety of infractions is increasing, mainly because there have been
more encounters between officers and street people. There are an
estimated 37,000 homeless people in New York City, an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   Advocacy groups blasted the suspension as heartless, and Patrick
Markee, spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless, said Delacruz
should be applauded for his sensitivity. Other groups are trying to
end what they call a deliberate practice of arresting more homeless
people.</TE>
<TE>   Picture the Homeless, a Manhattan-based organization, filed a
lawsuit this week against the NYPD, charging that police have been
told to aggressively seek out homeless people and take them into
custody for minor infractions that would normally not result in
arrest. The New York Civil Liberties Union has also filed a lawsuit
on the matter, seeking to have the policy declared unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials stress that the Delacruz case is more about
internal police procedures than the question of how to deal with
homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly defended the department's
decision to take away Delacruz's gun and shield. Under police
guidelines, a refusal to follow an order calls for an immediate
suspension, officials said. Delacruz, an eight-year veteran on the
force, will probably face a departmental trial for insubordination.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be able to follow the directions of a supervisor,"
Kelly said. "Being a police officer is not for everybody. And perhaps
this officer feels he's not suited for the job. We don't know."</TE>
<TE>   New York adopted tougher policies on the homeless under former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, sweeping them out of Times Square and
other large public spaces. Despite these efforts, however, the number
of people without shelter in the city -- a perennial problem -- has
been growing rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose policies toward the homeless
have come under fire from activists, backed up the Police
Department's disciplinary actions and said: "There's always somebody
that doesn't understand the law and doesn't interpret it the right
way. That's what we have management for, and the NYPD in this case is
really above reproach.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody suggests that we don't have compassion, nor that the NYPD
doesn't have compassion," he added, standing before the 43rd Precinct
house in the Bronx. "They look at the people in the streets, and they
know they need help, and they try to get it for them." Although the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn. has declined to comment on Delacruz's
case, the police officers union has branded the policy of arresting
homeless people as "organized harassment." And several homeless
people who spend time near the Manhattan garage where Neil was
arrested have voiced sympathy for the suspended officer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good guy; he's got a heart," Michael O'Shaugnessy said of
Delacruz. "He knows it's not a crime to be homeless, and the NYPD
should be ashamed of itself."</TE>

<HD>High Court OKs Putting Menorah in City's Plaza</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal judge's ruling that
Cincinnati cannot bar a Jewish organization from displaying a menorah
on a downtown plaza during the holidays.</LD>
<LD>   In its ruling, the high court lifted a stay by the U.S. 6th
Circuit Court of Appeals, noting the square's historic character as a
public forum.</LD>
<LD>   A municipal ordinance says that only the city can use Fountain
Square from the last two weeks of November through the first week of
January. The ordinance grew out of the city's efforts to prevent the
Ku Klux Klan from erecting a cross during the Christmas season.</LD>
<TE>   Chabad of Southern Ohio, a nonprofit Jewish organization,
challenged the ordinance, saying it violated the 1st Amendment's
guarantee of freedom of speech.</TE>
<TE>   City lawyers argued that allowing private groups to erect
unattended displays would overcrowd the square and make it difficult
for the city to keep order.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Susan J. Dlott ruled Wednesday that the
ordinance attempts to transform the square into a zone where only the
city's message is welcome, and ordered the city to provide permits
allowing Chabad to erect a menorah during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Dlott's ruling, the city asked the appeals court
for an emergency stay, which was granted a few hours later.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Astronaut Takes Over at Space Station</HD>
<DH>Kenneth Bowersox relieves Russian cosmonaut Valery Korzun
as commander. The new crew will stay at least until March.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>An American astronaut formally took charge of the international space
station Friday, succeeding a Russian cosmonaut who said he was going
to miss his "space house."</LD>
<LD>   "We were so happy to live here, to work here," Valery Korzun said
in a change-of-command ceremony full of naval tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Korzun said it was a sad time for him and his two crewmates, who
will depart aboard shuttle Endeavour on Monday after a six-month
stay. "We will miss our space house," he said, adding that they tried
their best to improve it.</LD>
<TE>   With that, Korzun told his replacement, Kenneth Bowersox: "I am
ready to be relieved."</TE>
<TE>   Korzun moved into the space station June 7, along with American
Peggy Whitson and Russian Sergei Treschev. They moved out Monday
night, shortly after Endeavour arrived with their replacements.</TE>
<TE>   "We really did have a good time," Whitson said at a news
conference Friday evening. "I can very easily say without lying in
the slightest that it really was a blast being here and I am ready to
come back."</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Whitson wasn't quite ready to leave, but she
gradually came around. "My husband reminded me that it's much better
to leave while you still want to stay than the other way around," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whitson said she can't wait to eat something that does not come in
a bag. She's already put in an order at NASA crew quarters for "a
nice steak with a Caesar salad with tons of garlic in it." She's also
looking forward to weeding her garden back home in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Bowersox, a Navy captain, said the departing crew set a standard
that will be difficult to match. He will remain on board until at
least March with American Donald Pettit and Russian Nikolai Budarin.
They are the sixth team to occupy the orbiting outpost.</TE>
<TE>   "I only hope that my crew, Don, Nikolai and I, will be able to
work as well over the four or however many months we end up living on
station, hopefully more than four," Bowersox said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The commander of the docked shuttle, James Wetherbee, issued a
challenge to the station's new residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Expedition 6, it is your duty to sail on and disappear over the
horizon, but return after discovering new land and make the world a
better place," said Wetherbee, a Navy captain.</TE>
<TE>   One more spacewalk is on tap before Endeavour pulls away Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's outing will be the third and final one for the shuttle
crew and will wrap up work on the $390-million space station girder
that was delivered and installed this week.</TE>

<LD>A volcanic island submerged off the coast of Sicily for the last 170
years could reappear in the coming weeks if furious seismic rumblings
continue, Italy's chief seismologist said.</LD>
<LD>   "We've seen [the Sicilian volcano Mt.] Etna erupting, seismic
activity to the north and east of Sicily, and gas activity around the
Aeolian Islands," said Enzo Boschi, head of Italy's Institute of
Geophysics and Volcanology. Formed by the tip of a submerged volcano,
the island last popped up in 1831, sparking a diplomatic spat among
several nations, before it sank beneath the Mediterranean waves six
months later.</LD>

<LD>After receiving heavy doses of electronics-crippling radiation while
flying past Jupiter's small inner moon Amalthea on Nov. 5, the
Galileo spacecraft appears to be functioning again. The radiation
levels forced the orbiter into safe, standby mode for a week. But a
Jet Propulsion Laboratory flight team is still trying to determine
why a tape recorder used for storing data has not resumed
functioning.</LD>

<LD>Harnessing the biological prowess of "extremophile" microbes gathered
from the steaming, sulfurous springs of Yellowstone National Park,
scientists have found a way to make tiny structures that could one
day be used to make nanoscale electronic components.</LD>
<LD>   A team from the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley used
modified proteins from single-celled organisms taken from
near-boiling acidic muck to grow mesh-like structures.</LD>
<LD>   Those crystalline structures are about 20 nanometers across, or
5,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.</LD>
<TE>   Today's standard computer chips have features that measure about
130 nanometers apart.</TE>
<TE>   The structures can pick up pieces of gold or semiconductor -- a
first step in creating a new generation of "nanoparticles" that could
serve as computer memory, sensors or calculators.</TE>
<TE>   The team worked with an organism that could withstand high
temperatures so it would have a protein able to tolerate the heat of
lab processes.</TE>
<TE>   The progress, said project leader Jonathan Trent, "takes advantage
of the innate ability of proteins to form into ordered structures and
for us to use genetic engineering to change nature's plans,
transforming these structures into something useful."</TE>

<HD>Vehicles Endanger U.S. Turtles, Report Finds</HD>

<LD>Cars and trucks may be destroying U.S. turtle populations by
squashing too many of the slow-moving animals while they forage for
food or plod across highways to lay eggs, according to a report in
the December issue of Conservation Biology.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists James Gibbs and Gregory Shriver of the State University
of New York in Syracuse built a computer simulation that modeled
movements of three turtle types -- land turtles, and small- and
large-bodied pond turtles. The model also included road and traffic
volume data for 19 counties in New York state.</LD>
<LD>   The simulation found that in many regions, more than 5% of turtles
were squashed under car wheels -- an ominous number, because studies
suggest many turtle species cannot withstand more than a 2% to 3%
annual death toll, and many U.S. species are declining.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists noted that their simple model did not consider whether
a driver would swerve to avoid a turtle, or try to hit it -- or the
possibility that turtles may avoid roads. To save the animals,
researchers urge road-free zones or turtle crossings.</TE>

<DH>National title was on line when Trojans, Irish met in 1988,
and for USC players that defeat still stings more than any other</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A high-scoring USC team featuring a Heisman Trophy candidate at
quarterback and a ball-hawking defense prepares to play Notre Dame in
a game with major bowl implications.</LD>
<LD>   Sound somewhat familiar?</LD>
<LD>   Former USC quarterback Rodney Peete recalls the buildup
surrounding the 1988 showdown, a game similar to today's matchup at
the Coliseum between the sixth-ranked Trojans (9-2) and No. 7 Notre
Dame (10-1).</LD>
<TE>   The stakes were higher 14 years ago. Both teams were unbeaten,
with Notre Dame ranked No. 1 and USC No. 2, the only time the
historic rivals have met while holding the top two spots in the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved all the hype that surrounded that game," Peete said. "It
was something that, growing up, you dreamed about."</TE>
<TE>   But it became a nightmarish afternoon for the Trojans. Although
USC outgained Notre Dame and held a nearly three-to-one advantage in
first downs, the Irish made all the big plays and capitalized on four
Trojan turnovers for a 27-10 victory before 93,829 at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The sting of the defeat is still felt by Mark Carrier, the
Trojans' starting safety as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't have many regrets from my time at SC, but that was
one," Carrier said. "We had a chance to win a national championship
and, boom, it was gone that fast."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame went on to defeat another unbeaten team, West Virginia,
in the Fiesta Bowl and win the national title with a 12-0 record.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't help but think, 'That could have been us,' " Carrier
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Carrier's case, that was especially true. The former Long Beach
Poly High standout chose to attend USC over Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I wanted to play in that game," said Carrier, whose
USC teams were 0-3 against the Irish in 1987-89. "Unfortunately, I
came out on the short end of the stick."</TE>
<TE>   No one would have predicted that things would go so badly for the
Trojans on Nov. 26, 1988.</TE>
<TE>   They were 10-0 after defeating UCLA, 31-22, the previous week to
earn a berth in the Rose Bowl. With Peete, a senior All-American, at
the helm, they were averaging 34.6 points a game. The defense,
boasting Carrier, linebacker Junior Seau and linemen Dan Owens and
Tim Ryan -- all future NFL starters -- had helped USC to a plus-17
turnover ratio, third-best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, on the other hand, went into the game defending itself
against critics who claimed the Irish weren't a legitimate No. 1
team. Irish players fumed when USC was made a 4 1/2-point favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Holtz, then Notre Dame's coach, acknowledged that many thought
the defense-minded Irish were winning ugly and joked, "[People think]
our football team is prettier than I am, but that's about it."</TE>
<TE>   Public perception of Notre Dame's chances didn't improve when, on
the morning of the game, Holtz sent home two of his top players --
tailback Tony Brooks and receiver Ricky Watters -- for being late to
team functions.</TE>
<TE>   That left Tony Rice, an option quarterback with limited passing
skills, as the main offensive weapon for the Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Rice promptly earned a place in Notre Dame lore by providing the
game's most enduring image: a 65-yard touchdown run in the first
quarter that made the cover of Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "The one play I remember the most is Tony Rice running down the
sideline for a touchdown," Carrier said. "For some reason, I can't
get that image out of my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Carrier's assignment on the option play was to cover tailback Mark
Green in case Rice pitched the ball. But as Carrier reached the
outside, he watched Rice run past him on the inside. Carrier said two
defenders were assigned to the quarterback, but both were blocked,
springing Rice into the secondary where he eluded the last Trojan,
strong safety Tracy Butts, at the USC 20-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "People asked me later, 'Why didn't you tackle Tony?' " Carrier
said. "But if he had pitched it to [Green], no one would have been on
him."</TE>
<TE>   While Notre Dame cashed in its scoring opportunities, the Trojans
squandered theirs. Tailback Aaron Emanuel lost a fumble in the first
quarter, setting up an Irish touchdown. In the second quarter,
tailback Ricky Ervins fumbled at the Notre Dame 19, ending a scoring
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Peete, under constant pressure from a blitzing Notre Dame defense,
threw two interceptions in the first half, the second of which was
returned 64 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Stan Smagala to give
the Irish a 20-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan receiver John Jackson slipped on the play, allowing Smagala
to step up and make the sideline interception.</TE>
<TE>   "That swung the momentum hugely," Peete said. "Up to that point,
it was a tight ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Adding injury in insult, when USC regained possession with a few
seconds left in the half, Notre Dame defensive end Frank Stams sacked
Peete, forcing him to leave the game with a separated left shoulder.
Peete played in the second half but left the Coliseum with his left
arm in a sling.</TE>
<TE>   It concluded a trying two weeks for the quarterback, who'd
overcome measles to play against UCLA and then suffered from
laryngitis, causing him to lose his voice for a few days before the
Notre Dame game.</TE>
<TE>   A field goal late in the third quarter pulled USC within 20-10,
but Notre Dame drove 70 yards for the clinching touchdown. It was the
only sustained drive of the game for the Irish, who were outperformed
in total yardage, 356 to 253, and in first downs, 21-8.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't score touchdowns when we had the ball in scoring
position," Peete said. "I think that was the big thing."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was Notre Dame's sixth consecutive victory over
USC, a streak that would grow to a series-record 11. Peete, a
quarterback with the Carolina Panthers, said the Trojans' failures
against the Irish -- his teams were 0-4 -- have stuck with him over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely one of those things that lives with you for a
long time," he said. "The last couple of years, when I played in
Oakland with [former Notre Dame receiver] Tim Brown, he never let me
forget it."</TE>
<TE>   USC, demoralized after missing a chance to win the national title,
lost to Michigan in the Rose Bowl, 22-14, and finished 10-2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a very anticlimactic Rose Bowl," said Larry Smith,
who was USC's coach that season and now has a radio sports show in
Tucson. "Losing to Notre Dame was tough to recover from."</TE>
<TE>   Although today's USC-Notre Dame game is similar in a lot of ways
to the 1988 game, Peete predicts there will be a different winner
this time. And he's on a roll. When the Trojans defeated UCLA last
Saturday, 52-21, Peete won a bet with Carolina teammate and former
UCLA running back DeShaun Foster, who had to wear USC clothing and
gear this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it's a bigger game and there's going to be a lot of
hype, they shouldn't press or think they have to do anything extra,"
Peete said of the Trojans. "They should do what they've been doing
all year long.</TE>
<TE>   "If they do that, then they should win the game."</TE>

<LD>Mike Williams, who lost his starting job five games into the season,
ran for a career-high 162 yards and four touchdowns and Arizona State
scored the last 21 points and defeated Arizona, 34-20, in a Pacific
10 Conference game Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a great feeling to get the ball over and over again and
get in the rhythm of the game," said Williams, who had 40 carries.
"It's kind of hard when you're second- or third-string."</LD>
<LD>   The Sun Devils (8-5, 5-3 Pac-10) clinched at least a tie for third
place in the Pac-10 and a probable berth to the Sun Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona (4-8, 1-7) lost its 11th consecutive Pac-10 home game. The
Wildcats were coming off an upset victory at California, which came
four days after 41 players met with President Peter Likins to
complain about what they felt was verbal abuse from Coach John
Mackovic.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of young players on this team," said Mackovic, who
has three years left on his contract. "We'll have a good group of
young players on the field, and we'll have a good nucleus of
seniors."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a junior tailback starting because Cornell Canidate was
sidelined with a shoulder injury, scored on runs of five, four, eight
and four yards.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, when Arizona won at Tempe, the Wildcats danced on the
logo of Sun Devil mascot Sparky, igniting a shoving and shouting
match.</TE>
<TE>   There were no such incidents Saturday</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Dirk Koetter] said we were going to come out here, we're
going to dominate and be the better team, and we're going to win with
class," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Suggs sacked Johnson twice to give him 22 for the season,
extending his NCAA record. The old mark was 17, set by Dwight Freeney
of Syracuse in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The unofficial record is 24 1/2 by Zeke Gadson of Pittsburgh in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Suggs, a junior, has not decided whether to return for next
season.</TE>

<LD>   San Francisco (0-2) at UC Santa Barbara (1-2), 7 p.m., KEYT-AM
(1350) -- In losses to Seton Hall and Nevada, the Dons shot an
average of 36% from the field. Santa Barbara was as cold as ice in
its first two losses at the Top of the World Classic in Fairbanks,
Alaska, but was blistering from the field in an 84-69 victory over
winless Centenary, making 27 of 42 field goal attempts.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego (2-0) at UC Riverside (0-1), 7 p.m. -- It's another
tough one for Riverside, which was soundly defeated by USC, 81-68.
San Diego beat No. 14 UCLA, 86-81, in overtime Tuesday. Jason Keep
scored 30 points and had 16 rebounds as San Diego out-rebounded the

without center Will Kimble, who has left the team after being
diagnosed with a heart condition. Senior forward Boomer Brazzle,
who's generously listed as 6-7, could move to center. The Waves have

<LD>When the Boston Red Sox hired Theo Epstein as general manager earlier
this week, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy shook his head in
disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   Epstein is only 28, making him the youngest general manager in
baseball history.</LD>
<LD>   "It sounds like a Bill Veeck stunt, like sending midget Eddie
Gaedel up to the plate as a pinch-hitter," Shaughnessy wrote. "Come
to think of it, wasn't there a movie like this -- little kid inherits
Minnesota Twins from grandfather and makes himself manager?"</LD>
<TE>   But Shaughnessy relented, noting that Epstein's decisions probably
won't have much impact outside the baseball world.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come right down to it, this is only baseball. John F.
Kennedy was 26 when the Japanese cut his boat in half in the Solomon
Islands in 1943. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his first symphony
when he was 8. Theo probably can make the call on Dustin Hermanson."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most skins won in a single
Skins Game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How 'bout some humble pie? Annika Sorenstam won eight times on the
LPGA Tour in 2001 and fellow tour player Karrie Webb said she would
eat her hat should Sorenstam continue at such a torrid pace.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Elling in the Orlando Sentinel offered some serving
suggestions after Sorenstam won last weekend for her 11th title of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Gulp. What best complements a cotton chapeau, red or white wine?
Care for an order of Vegemite with that, miss? Perhaps it'll go down
easier as a sandwich," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   To which Webb responded: "I might have to add some salt and tomato
sauce to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's no dope: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle defends
the NFL substance abuse policy, which mandates an automatic
suspension for ephedra use, but no suspension for first-time
marijuana users:</TE>
<TE>   "[Ephedra] could give an unfair chemical advantage over an
opponent," Ostler writes. "If I'm playing football and my opponent
wants to smoke pot before the game, I'll bring him matches."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Expensive phone call: The Arizona Cardinals' leading rusher,
Thomas Jones, will miss the rest of the season after breaking his
hand while answering the telephone at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals put him on reserve/non-football injury and will not
have to pay him for the remainder of the season. It will cost him
about $135,000.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, Jones will invest in a hands-free headset before next
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, Bo Jackson rushed for 221 yards
to lead the Los Angeles Raiders to a 37-14 rout of the Seattle
Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Greg Norman, who won all 18 in the 2001 Skins Game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune doesn't see
much hope for USC making a BCS bowl no matter the outcome of today's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thankful that, whatever happens against [USC] on Saturday
night, Notre Dame will go to a BCS game, and USC probably won't,"
Morrissey wrote in his Thanksgiving Day column. "I'm pretty sure
Trojan Coach Pete Carroll isn't thankful that college football is
better when Notre Dame matters."</TE>

freshman players," Montgomery said.</TE>

<HD>Odom Says His Return Is on Target</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette underwent arthroscopic surgery Friday to remove
damaged cartilage from his right knee and is expected to sit out for
at least one month. It means Maggette will be set to return not long
after fellow small forward Lamar Odom is scheduled to be back on the
floor.</LD>
<LD>   "Hopefully, we'll have everybody back on the floor by
mid-January," said Odom, sidelined by a sprained right wrist and
ankle since going on the injured list Jan. 24. "We want to be going
strong heading into the All-Star break."</LD>
<LD>   With that in mind, Odom and the Clippers are taking a cautious
approach to his return. Odom said his ankle, which he sprained in
January and re-injured during the off-season, is much improved. He
had an MRI exam and visited recently with a specialist, who
determined that all was well.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm on target," Odom said, referring to his expected return near
Christmas. "My lateral movement is not good, but it's getting there.
It's not as strong as I want it to be, but I want to get back.... I
want my ankle to be ready. I don't want to be out there struggling
with an ankle injury. I want to wait until it's ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry on the raucous atmosphere at Arco Arena, where
the Kings went into Friday's game against the Clippers with a 7-0
record: "It's like a college atmosphere here and they feed off that.
It's by far the loudest arena in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has no desire to begin a feud with King fans the way
Laker Coach Phil Jackson has.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mess with them," Gentry said. "I think it's great the
support [the Kings] get from their fans."</TE>

<LD>Brian Calhoun, a freshman who is No. 4 on Colorado's tailback depth
chart, ran for 137 yards Friday as the No. 13 Buffaloes defeated
Nebraska, 28-13, in a Big 12 Conference game at Lincoln, Neb.</LD>
<LD>   It was Colorado's first victory at Lincoln since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Fullback Brandon Drumm added two touchdowns for the Buffaloes
(9-3, 7-1 Big 12). Colorado clinched the Big 12's North Division
championship and will play Oklahoma on Dec. 7 in the conference
championship in Houston.</LD>
<TE>   Calhoun had all but one of his 20 carries in the second half while
Bobby Purify sat out after suffering a bruised knee and sprained
ankle. Purify had been filling in for Chris Brown, the nation's
third-leading rusher, who did not play because of a bruised sternum.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Gary Barnett opted to go with Calhoun instead of
third-stringer Marcus Houston once Purify left for good in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised," Calhoun said. "I knew Chris wouldn't be able
to go, so I prepared myself all week to be the man to carry the
ball."</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers (7-6, 3-5) ended their worst regular season since
1961, when they were 3-6-1. The Buffaloes denied the Cornhuskers a
chance to extend their unprecedented streak of nine-victory seasons
to 34. Nebraska could have reached nine by winning Friday's game and
a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers, who have lost four of six games, had a losing
conference mark for the first time since 1968, when they went 3-4.
They came back to go 9-2 overall the following season and won the
national title in 1970 with an 11-0 record.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that we were in the ballgame," Nebraska Coach
Frank Solich said, "but we didn't get the things done that needed to
get done in order to make it work."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska's loss marked the first time since 1990 it had failed to
beat a ranked opponent. That year, the No. 9 Buffaloes came to
Lincoln and won, 27-12.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska will get invited to a bowl, and the Cornhuskers must win
that game to increase their streak of winning seasons to 41.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Texas 50, Texas A&amp;M 20 -- Chris Simms passed for 278 yards
and three touchdowns to lead the Longhorns at Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The game was played four days after Aggie freshman defensive
tackle Brandon Fails died after collapsing in his dorm. Aggie players
wore stickers on their helmets with his No. 89.</TE>
<TE>   Fails will be buried today.</TE>
<TE>   Texas (10-2, 6-2) broke open a tight game with 27 consecutive
points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M (6-6, 3-5) had six turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The blowout could mean the end of R.C. Slocum's 14-year tenure as
Texas A&amp;M coach. He is the Aggies' winningest coach with 123
victories, but is only 29-23 the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed -- and that's as mild as I can put it -- about
this season," said Slocum, who said he has no plans to quit.</TE>

<DL>COOLUM, Australia</DL>
<LD>John Daly was disqualified for failing to sign his scorecard Friday
in the Australian PGA.</LD>
<LD>   Daly, playing a week after his mother's death, threw his putter
and ball into a lake near the 18th green after shooting a 78.</LD>
<LD>   After shaking hands with playing partners Greg Norman and Craig
Parry, Daly -- upset by a rules call on the 13th hole -- walked alone
back up the 18th fairway to his villa on the course grounds.</LD>
<TE>   Daly was fined $5,600 by the Australasian PGA Tour, according to a
tour official who spoke on condition of anonymity. His appearance fee
was believed to be $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, who had a 75 Thursday, looked as though he would easily make
the cut after playing the first nine holes in four-under 32.</TE>
<TE>   But he bogeyed Nos. 10 and 11, got a stroke back with a birdie on
No. 12 and saw his hopes fade on the 13th when he took a seven on the
par-four hole.</TE>
<TE>   Daly's tee shot went into the water along the left side of the
fairway.</TE>
<TE>   A rules official was called when Parry suggested that Daly was
attempting to take a penalty drop from an incorrect spot.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the shot on a television replay, the rules official
agreed with Parry and asked Daly to take the drop much closer to the
tee.</TE>
<TE>   Daly reloaded, hitting his driver off the fairway, and put his
next shot back in the water to the right of the green en route to the
triple bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Norman said he agreed with where Parry said Daly should take the
drop, and Parry said he felt he was correct in asking Daly to move
his drop down the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Daly made a bogey on the par-five 15th, a double bogey on No. 16
and a triple bogey on 18.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Moseley shot a six-under 66 to take the second-round lead
by one stroke over Aaron Baddeley (65).</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lonard was two strokes back after a 68.</TE>

<LD>Jockey Jerry Bailey and trainer Bobby Frankel moved closer to records
in New York and Kentucky on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   After the two hall-of-famers had combined to win the $150,000 Top
Flight Handicap at Aqueduct with favored Sightseek, Frankel and
jockey Jorge Chavez won a thrilling $457,200 Clark Handicap at
Churchill Downs with 2-1 choice Lido Palace.</LD>
<LD>   Bailey, the nation's top jockey almost annually, earned his 63rd
stakes win of 2002, four behind Mike Smith's record of 67 set in
1994, and the $91,710 he earned in purse money pushed him closer to
his own record for earnings in a year. His mounts have won
$22,286,899 this year, $310,821 less than in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Frankel, en route to his third consecutive Eclipse Award as the
nation's top trainer, earned $377,464 Friday with his two graded
stakes victories and his stable has now earned $16,999,228 this year.
The record of $17,842,358 was set by Wayne Lukas in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Amerman Racing Stables, Lido Palace, a 5-year-old Chilean
bred son of Rich Man's Gold, won for the 11th time in 23 starts, but
the victory did not come easy.</TE>
<TE>   He was all out to beat a stubborn Crafty Shaw, the second-longest
shot in the field at 42-1, by a head in 1:49 for the 1 1/8miles.
Hero's Tribute, a 6-1 shot, was a length back in third.</TE>
<TE>   Sightseek, a 3-year-old Distant View filly owned and bred by
Juddmonte Farms, won for the fourth time in five starts and stayed
unbeaten on the main track with a 1 3/4-length victory over 32-1 shot
Zonk in the Top Flight.</TE>
<TE>   Sightseek, the 7-5 choice, won even after being struck in the face
by the whip of Charles Lopez, the jockey on the runner-up, in the
final furlong. She completed the mile in 1:35 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   A winner at four tracks in New York and Kentucky, Sightseek is
likely to make her California debut in the $200,000 La Brea Stakes on
Dec. 28 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The third time in the $200,000 Hollywood Turf Express was the
charm for Texas Glitter.</TE>
<TE>   Second in the Grade III in 2000 and fourth last year, the
6-year-old Glitterman horse got the money, running past pacesetter
Rocky Bar in the final sixteenth of a mile to win the turf race by
three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Glitter, ridden by John Velazquez, completed the 5 1/2
furlongs in 1:01 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on the first day of Hollywood Park's weekend Turf
Festival, Atlantic Ocean -- purchased for $1.9 million earlier this
year by the Thoroughbred Corp. -- kicked away in the final quarter of
a mile to win the $200,000 Miesque Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic Ocean completed the mile in 1:34 3/5 under jockey David
Flores.</TE>

<LD>Gentlemen, Geri, Fastness, Al Mamoon, Lord At War and Fly Till Dawn
are among the horses that have won the Citation Handicap over the
years, but none of those stars did what Good Journey has a chance to
do today.</LD>
<LD>   With a victory in the Grade II, which has a purse of $500,000, the
6-year-old Nureyev horse can become only the second two-time winner
of the race. Forlitano, owned by the Evergreen Farm and trained by
the late Charlie Whittingham, won in 1987 and '88.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by a partnership that includes breeder Flaxman Holding and
trained by Wally Dollase, Good Journey won the Citation, one of the
six races in Hollywood Park's annual three-day Turf Festival, over a
good course, outfinishing Decarchy, who is back for a rematch today,
by half a length.</LD>
<TE>   In four starts since, Good Journey has won three times and, at the
top of the stretch of last month's Breeders' Cup Turf, he appeared
headed to another victory. At the finish, however, he and jockey Pat
Day had to settle for third, beaten by three-quarters of a length by
longshot winner Domedrive and a by nose by favored Rock Of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of six of his 14 starts and with more than $1.35 million
in earnings, Good Journey has never lost in three races on the
Hollywood Park turf and is two for two at the Citation distance (1
1/16 miles).</TE>
<TE>   The other stake on the Hollywood Park schedule today is the
$200,000 Generous. The race, one mile on the turf for 2-year-olds,
features a rematch between Man Among Men and Peace Rules, who
finished a nose apart in a thrilling Pinjara on Oct. 24 at Santa
Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: In today's $350,000 Cigar Mile at Aqueduct,
jockey Jerry Bailey will ride Congaree for the first time since they
teamed to finish third in the 2001 Preakness. Other notables in the
field include Crafty C.T., Harlan's Holiday, Red Bullet and
Aldebaran.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Anthony Dutrow. The Maryland-based trainer won with the
first five horses he ran at Aqueduct and is winning at about a 37%
clip for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Dennis Carr. The jockey won with two of his first 56
mounts at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Golden Ticket in the
seventh, using Good Journey, Decarchy and White Heart in the eighth
and Rubin's Rose, Jade Vixen, Nettie's Rose and Saxony in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/39. Money: Previous day/meet

<HD>IOC Opts to Spare 3 Sports</HD>
<DH>Members table decision on eliminating baseball, softball
and the modern pentathlon until after the 2004 Athens Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Baseball, softball and the modern pentathlon won a reprieve Friday
with the International Olympic Committee voting to postpone any
decision about whether the three sports ought to be eliminated from
the Olympic Games until after the 2004 Athens Games.</LD>
<LD>   An IOC panel had recommended the exclusion of the three sports in
August. The recommendation was surprising if not stunning -- no sport
has been cut from the Summer Games since after the 1936 Games, when
the IOC chucked polo. Three months of fierce behind-the-scenes
lobbying ensued. On Friday, in presentations to the full IOC
assembly, the three sports pleaded for mercy.</LD>
<LD>   In response, the IOC opted -- for now -- to do nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Come 2004, it remains unclear whether the three sports -- or any
sport, for that matter -- could be booted as soon thereafter as the
2008 Games in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   In the nuanced world of Olympic politics, however, much was made
clear Friday -- in particular the emerging leadership style and
political durability of Jacques Rogge, the Belgian elected last year
as IOC president, as well as the empowerment of key constituencies
within the Olympic movement, especially the international sports
federations and the national Olympic committees.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way he responded at an IOC meeting in February, when
the membership raised opposition to the format and wording of certain
ethics rules, Rogge showed Friday his willingness to be flexible.</TE>
<TE>   The ethics rules were approved a few months later by the IOC's
policy-making executive board. Now baseball, for instance, has time
to prove it can attract U.S. major league stars to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity, not a warning," Rogge said after Friday's
vote for postponement.</TE>
<TE>   "My style is an open style," Rogge also said. "I am for dialogue
... and a more interactive approach."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge also came to office promising a more corporate management
style than his predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain. Asked
this week if he could have avoided months of furious debate over the
three sports by getting more of what business types call a "buy-in"
before it was abruptly announced in August that the three were on the
block, Rogge laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't ask turkeys to vote for Christmas," he said in an
interview with The Times. "It would be naive to think that was
possible."</TE>
<TE>   He also said, "I don't see any political defeat in creating a
system of periodic review [of the sports] after each Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a news conference if he had misjudged the outcome of
Friday's proceedings, Rogge said, "I am not a naive man. I don't
think I misjudged anything."</TE>
<TE>   The jarring note to so many Olympic insiders, however, is that the
spectacle that unfolded Friday would have been unthinkable during the
Samaranch years.</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch would not have allowed a controversial proposal -- such
as the elimination of three sports -- to become public if he did not
know the outcome of the vote before the proposal became public. Then
39 speakers took to the microphone, far more than would have spoken
in the Samaranch era. Not one supported the proposal to cut the three
-- unimaginable during the Samaranch years.</TE>
<TE>   "The backstage deals clearly are not done," University of Chicago
professor John MacAloon had said before Friday's action, adding, "it
is a much more open and publicly debated process."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Samaranch put it in an interview this week, "Everyone has
his own style. I don't like to lose elections."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge also does not care to lose. He won a major victory Thursday
when the IOC membership voted overwhelmingly not to reinstate visits
to cities bidding for the Olympic Games -- a position with which he
has long been personally identified.</TE>
<TE>   In the debate over the three sports, Rogge said repeatedly he was
"neutral." He said Friday that debate is essential because sports not
in the Games, such as golf, ought to be considered -- but can get in
only if others are out. The Summer Games are capped at 28 sports, 300
events and 10,500 athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the IOC members to have their input," Rogge said.</TE>
<TE>   That they did -- in a way that foretells the new workings of the
Olympic movement. Even Dick Pound of Canada, who ran against Rogge
for the presidency, said, "I don't view this as a triumph for Jacques
or a defeat for Jacques. That's immaterial. What's important is we've
[launched] the working process to make the Olympic program relevant
to the 21st century."</TE>

<LD>For the eighth time in less than three seasons, Jamie Storr started
in goal for the Kings against the Mighty Ducks Friday at the
Arrowhead Pond. Although he gave up a game-tying goal in the third
period, Storr played well, with 23 saves in his fourth start of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt very strong and thought that I gave a good effort," said
Storr, who started only 12 games last season. "A lot of the things
that I've been working on in practice, I was able to use. It feels
good to be a part of the team and help [the Kings] get points,
especially when you're not one of the main guys on the team.</LD>
<LD>   "All I can do is keep working hard and do the best with what I'm
being dealt. That's the only way that I can look at it. But I know
that there's not too much room for error."</LD>
<TE>   Storr said facing the Ducks this season is different than it has
been in recent years because of the addition of forwards such as Petr
Sykora and Adam Oates along with rookie Stanislav Chistov.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ducks of old are forgotten," Storr said. "They have a lot of
great players on their team. They can match up very well with any
team.... You have to give them a lot of credit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck defenseman Fredrik Olausson returned from NHL exile Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson was a healthy scratch the last five games as he worked to
get back into shape. He returned to the lineup when defenseman Ruslan
Salei went out with back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt pretty strong," said Olausson, 37. "We'll see. We'll see.
I think I have accomplished some things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck forward Mike Leclerc, who had knee surgery Nov. 19, has begun
skating on his own. He is expected to be out two to three more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King forward Steve Heinze, recalled from Manchester of the
American Hockey League on Thursday, recorded an assist on a
third-period goal and hit the post on a breakaway in the second. It
was a strong first game for Heinze, 32, who reportedly has been on
the trading block since training camp.</TE>

<HD>Walker Is 'Hurt' by Bryant Remarks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Two days after Kobe Bryant said he had hoped his teammates would play
through their injuries as he plays through his, Samaki Walker, from
the injured list, said he had been "hurt" by Bryant's presumptions.</LD>
<LD>   "It's painful, because that's a character shot," Walker said.
"When you attack somebody's character, that's the worst thing you can
do."</LD>
<LD>   Walker has been on the injured list since Tuesday because of a
strained lower back he suffered in a game against the Milwaukee Bucks
two days earlier. Walker was walking gingerly and receiving daily
treatment when, after the Lakers' loss in Orlando, Bryant intimated
that Walker should have been playing.</LD>
<TE>   "I understand Samaki has some back problems and he's hurting, but
he's not hurting any more than I am," Bryant had said. "I'm out there
playing my butt off every single night. Hurt. Bad ankle. Can't walk.
Don't matter. I'm out there playing. They should be out there playing
as well. Devean George, he'll be back shortly. We have to get our
core guys out there playing basketball right now."</TE>
<TE>   Both Walker and Coach Phil Jackson guessed that a growing
frustration with what then were 11 losses in 16 games had led to
Bryant's criticisms. As one player said, "See what happens when
you're losing?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he had hoped for more compassion from Bryant, who two
seasons ago missed more than two weeks because of ankle tendinitis,
the same injury that put George on the injured list five games ago.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who was slugged from behind by Bryant on a team bus last
season, shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know what? Kobe's Kobe," he said. "I'm not going to
take it personally. You start losing, you take it tough.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to resolve this situation is to try to get healthy.
We're in this together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Friday he expected George to come off the injured
list Sunday, when he is eligible.</TE>
<TE>   George has not played since Nov. 8 at Washington but practiced
Thursday and worked with strength coach Jim Cotta before Friday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Among the roster options, the Lakers could waive center Soumaila
Samake.</TE>

<LD>Last Saturday's letters about Shaq and the Lakers were pathetic.
Everyone is so quick to criticize a team when it's down. As far as
Kobe's being overrated, how many championships did my great Magic man
win without Kareem?</LD>
<LD>   When it's all said and done, at the end of the season, I'll raise
a glass to toast the Lakers' fourth consecutive championship and I'll
have a big smug smile on my face as I remember all these people who
put the Lakers down, buried them and threw the shovel away.</LD>
<LD>   One last thing: Remember the Angels' start this season?</LD>

<TE>   Memo to Laker fans: Chill. Shaq and the rest of the team will be
ready for the playoffs. Nobody takes more pounding than he does, and
no team has played more games in the last three seasons. He has
earned the rest and he knows what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   In today's NBA, the regular schedule is only a prolonged preseason
anyway. Let the Mavericks and the rest of the league knock themselves
out trying to set records. Remember when the Bulls won 72 games
during the regular season and almost ran out of gas in the playoffs?
So does Phil. He's not going to make that mistake again.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say the Lakers are the last team to make the playoffs. Do
you think the top-seeded team would want to play them in a
first-round five-game series?</TE>

<TE>   I have to respond to those loyal and knowledgeable Laker fans who
wrote in. To Dave Drusin from Studio City, here's hoping that by the
end of the season you will have a size-23 foot in your mouth. To
Sydney Cook from Orange, you're right, Shaq has no loyalty. Those
three rings he got L.A. playing on nine toes shows just how much he
cares about the money only. To Joe Martin from Alameda, you were able
to see right through Kobe and his selfish, flashy, ineffective play.
By the way, during which triple-double did you discover this? And
finally to Mick Taylor from L.A., you're also right about Kobe's not
being able to carry a team the way Allen Iverson does. Oh, and how
many rings did you say Allen has?</TE>

<TE>   I'd like to thank Bob Toledo for teaching me how to beat traffic.
For 25-plus years of going to UCLA games, I never left a game early
before last year, but when the team quit on Toledo, my friends and I
were gone from the Coliseum early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with what has become the annual humiliation at the
hands of USC, I was home in time to see UCLA score the two touchdowns
in garbage time. Thanks for the help, "Coach."</TE>

<TE>   I am a Bruin fan and, needless to say, last Saturday was tough for
Bruin fans. There are many reasons why teams win and why teams lose,
but coaching cannot be underestimated as one of the most important
ingredients for success. Look what Pete Carroll has done with
primarily Paul Hackett's class. Look what Tyrone Willingham has
accomplished at Notre Dame with his predecessor's class. It gets you
thinking.</TE>

<TE>   Once can be a fluke, twice can be a coincidence. Three times is a

completely unprepared for nearly every big game UCLA has had in the

bowl losses to inferior teams and second-half season collapses.</TE>

<TE>   The UCLA-USC debacle only enhanced the stature of such fine young
men as USC's Carson Palmer and Troy Polamalu. Conversely, it also
further diminished the legacy of UCLA when Tyler Ebell -- whose team
trailed, 52-7, until the final minutes -- groused that the Trojan
defense was "OK" but overrated.</TE>

the UCLA football team is going to "tank" it on Dec. 7 against
Washington State. The Bruins, after being humiliated by the Trojans,
are not about to do them any favors.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction No. 2 is that Carson Palmer, while a very good
quarterback, will finish third in the Heisman race behind Miami's Ken
Dorsey and Iowa's Brad Banks. Bet the mortgage on both predictions.</TE>

<HD>Board Does Great Job of Killing Horse Racing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If anybody had any doubt that horse racing would be extinct in a few
years, all that doubt was laid to rest Nov. 21. That was when the
California Horse Racing Board voted against Hollywood Park's request
to discontinue betting a minute prior to each race. This move was
proposed to ensure the integrity of the parimutuel betting system,
which was recently rocked by the Breeders' Cup pick six scandal, and
would have completely ensured betting integrity.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of approving of the move, the CHRB vetoed it, citing that
"the change is not worth the inconvenience to the relatively few
horseplayers that we've been able to keep coming to the track."</LD>
<LD>   Don't these bureaucrats understand that unless the racing industry
begins to implement meaningful changes to the system, horse racing
will continue to lose its credibility with the racing public, and
will soon go the way of other extinct sporting institutions?</LD>
<TE>   I'll bet that one of the CHRB's directors is named Nero.</TE>

<LD>It must be college basketball season. The Bruins just lost their home
opener to another "easy" Southern California school. With the
progression from Pepperdine to Cal State Northridge to San Diego, the
Bruins might be forced to start scheduling Mater Dei or Westchester
in order to assure themselves of an early season home win.</LD>

<TE>   Steve Lavin was quoted after the overtime loss to San Diego as
saying "we made progress." Obviously Lavin thinks that not getting
blown out by 25 points at home to inferior competition is "progress."
Well, I guess he's right.</TE>
<TE>   And when Dan Guerrero finally does the right thing and shows Lavin
the door, progress will really be made.</TE>

<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Am I the only one tired of institutions starting the basketball
season by playing a patsy preseason schedule to gain confidence going
into the regular season? Branch West and EA Sports should be ashamed
of themselves for playing UCLA. Next year they should challenge
themselves with competitive teams such as Pepperdine and Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Reyerson</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All anyone needs to know about a Steve Lavin-coached team can be
seen in the final moments of regulation and the overtime with San
Diego. With the game on the line in regulation, San Diego Coach Brad
Holland calls time, sets up a play, the players execute that play and
the result is a tying layup. UCLA has the ball with a chance to win
with 14 seconds left. No play is run, no basket attacked, instead we
get Jason Kapono dribbling to the corner, faking a handoff and
shooting a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' talent wins them games and takes them to the
tournament and, at times, gets them past the first or second round.
But with this coach, UCLA will continue to lose to teams it should
blow out, will not play in the Final Four and will not win an NCAA
championship.</TE>
<TE>   It appears a new bar has been set at UCLA in football and in
basketball. That bar is awfully low.</TE>

<TE>   Letting Steve Lavin coach talented athletes is equivalent to
allowing 5-year-olds to pilot fighter jets over Baghdad. A jet might
just successfully bomb a target on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "But he gets UCLA to the Sweet 16 every year!" you say. Funny, I
haven't heard Florida bragging about being the 15th-ranked team in
college football lately.</TE>

<LD>Diane Pucin, welcome to college football. It takes 11 games (12 or 13
this year) to make a season, and the bowl selections are based on
season records. According to the "Pucin Scale" Ohio State does not
belong in the Fiesta Bowl, and maybe USC does. A glance at the
current AP poll shows OSU at 13-0, USC at 9-2, with the Buckeyes 3-0
against top-25 teams, while the Trojans are 2-2.</LD>
<LD>   According to you, there are only two quality teams in the Big Ten.
Was the death penalty somehow levied against Penn State and Michigan
and I missed it? Iowa lost to Iowa State, which lost to Connecticut.
Nice spinoff, Diane, but I think a better comparison might be to see
if Ohio State and USC played any common foes this season. Check the
results when both teams played Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   And, I do have answers to your three important questions: 1. Yes,
I would put my money on Iowa if they played USC. 2. Iowa's Brad Banks
is as hot as Palmer, and by the way he has one more win and one fewer
loss. 3. I like the Buckeyes' roster of running backs and receivers,
in comparison to the Trojans'.</LD>

<LD>As Reggie Miller made his third three-point basket in 50 seconds, he
backpedaled on defense and stared at Michael Jordan, who was sitting
on the baseline.</LD>
<LD>   What Miller couldn't say with words, he said with his eyes: Come
out and play.</LD>
<LD>   "I would never say that to the all-time greatest player ... ever,"
Miller said with a laugh. "But I was thinking it."</LD>
<TE>   The 37-year-old Miller scored 17 of his 25 points in the decisive
third quarter, and Ron Artest had 21 as the Indiana Pacers beat the
Washington Wizards, 100-84, Friday night at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference at
13-2, made 35 of 36 free throws and improved to 9-1 at home.</TE>
<TE>   With the Pacers down by six in the third, Miller pump-faked an
oncoming Larry Hughes and made a three-pointer and the free throw to
make it 61-59. Miller then made threes on the next two possessions
for a 65-64 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 106, Cleveland 99 -- Allen Iverson took over in the
last two minutes at Cleveland and the 76ers withstood a furious
fourth-quarter comeback, sending the Cavaliers to their 13th straight
loss. Iverson finished with 29 points, but had to rescue the 76ers
down the stretch when the Cavaliers chopped an 18-point deficit in
the fourth down to two with 2:02 left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 98, Boston 95 -- Morris Peterson scored a career-high 31
points and Vince Carter had 23 at Boston in his first start since
Nov. 2 as the Raptors ended a six-game losing streak. Antoine Walker
tied a season high with 31 points for the Celtics, who had their
four-game winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 100, Miami 94 -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 29 points at
Atlanta as the Hawks rallied from an 11-point deficit in the fourth
quarter to defeat the Heat in overtime. Abdur-Rahim put the Hawks
ahead for good, 94-91, on a jumper with 2:41 left in the extra
period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 96, Milwaukee 91 -- Richard Hamilton scored 20 points and
Ben Wallace had 12 points and 21 rebounds to help the Pistons win at
Auburn Hills, Mich. Six Pistons scored in double figures, and the
only starter who didn't, Chucky Atkins, had 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 95, Minnesota 77 -- Matt Harpring set a career high for the
second consecutive game with 33 points as the Jazz won its sixth in a
row, defeating the Timberwolves at Salt Lake City. Coming off his
previous career high of 30 points against the Clippers on Tuesday,
Harpring made his first seven shots and 13 of 18 overall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 92, Denver 82 -- Earl Boykins scored 20 points and
had six of his seven steals during a key run in the third quarter as
the Warriors overcame a 21-point deficit to win at Denver. Gilbert
Arenas had 27 points and seven assists for Golden State, which won
for only the third time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 94, San Antonio 87 -- Stephon Marbury scored 43 points --
his biggest output since joining the Suns before last season -- as
Phoenix rallied to win at home. Marbury had a team-record 26 points
in the fourth quarter in his biggest game since he scored a
career-high 50 for New Jersey on Feb. 13, 2001, against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 83, Seattle 72 -- Steve Francis had a streaky night and
scored 13 of his 21 points in the third quarter as the Rockets won at
Seattle. Glen Rice and Kenny Thomas each had 12 points. Seattle lost
its third in a row, shooting 37% and posting a season-low 26
second-half points.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yevgeny Kafelnikov hardly helped his big plans to retire from tennis
as a Davis Cup champion.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian lost, 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-0, to Sebastien Grosjean on
Friday, leaving the Davis Cup final with defending champ France tied
at 1-1 after the opening day in Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Marat Safin won the opening match, defeating French Davis Cup
rookie Paul-Henri Mathieu, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.</LD>
<TE>   The best-of-five final on Bercy's indoor clay court will be
decided in Sunday's singles matches, no matter who wins today's
doubles between Kafelnikov-Safin and Nicolas Escude-Fabrice Santoro.</TE>
<TE>   France is seeking consecutive Davis Cup titles for the first time
since 1932, and its 10th title overall. Russia has never won the
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Kafelnikov has said he will retire if Russia wins the Davis Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Kafelnikov, a two-time Grand Slam champion, made 41 unforced
errors and had only 20 winners. Grosjean hit 42 winners and served 13
aces while his opponent had none.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one-way traffic," the Russian said. "I wasn't able to keep
up with him in the second and third set."</TE>

<TE>   Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Hilde Gerg fashioned a nearly flawless run to overtake
Croatia's Janica Kostelic and win the World Cup super-G at Aspen,
Colo., the first speed race of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Gerg, the defending World Cup super-G champion, finished in 1
minute 17.89 seconds, edging Kostelic by 0.06 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Isolde Kostner was third, and Kirsten Clark of Raymond,
Maine, took fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Clark paced three Americans in the top 10. Caroline Lalive of
Steamboat Springs, Colo., was ninth in 1:18.49, followed by Jonna
Mendes of Heavenly, Calif., in 1:18.61.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic champion Apolo Anton Ohno earned his first World Cup
victory this season, capitalizing on a disqualification to win the
1,500-meter short-track speedskating race at St. Petersburg, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno crossed the line behind China's Li Jia Jun, who was
disqualified for impeding skaters in the seventh lap. Ohno finished
in 2 minutes 20.034 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   At Salt Lake City, Ohno won two medals -- silver at 1,000 meters
and a disputed gold at 1,500 when he finished second to South Korea's
Kim Dong-sung. Ohno was declared the winner when the referee ruled
Kim had used an illegal block to stay in front.</TE>
<TE>   World champion Irina Slutskaya of Russia got off to a slow start,
finishing fourth in the women's short program at the NHK Trophy at
Kyoto, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshie Onda turned in a technically sound performance to place
first, followed by Japanese compatriots Shizuka Arakawa and Fumie
Suguri.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya, who finished a disappointing third at the Cup of Russia
last week, failed to execute a triple lutz-double toe loop
combination in her routine.</TE>
<TE>   Former World Cup winner Primoz Peterka of Slovenia beat Adam
Malysz of Poland to win the opening event of the ski jumping season
at Kuusamo, Finland. Peterka, the World Cup overall winner in 1997
and 1998, jumped 131.5 and 143.5 meters for 293.5 points. Alan
Alborn, the top U.S. ski jumper, has a sore knee and did not compete.</TE>
<TE>   Hannu Manninen of Finland won the season's first World Cup Nordic
combined, beating World Cup champion Ronny Ackermann of Germany by
3.4 seconds at Kuusamo, Finland. The top American was Johnny
Spillane, who finished 10th. Manninen's winning time was 22 minutes
21.5 seconds.</TE>

<TE>   Lennox Lewis will defend his World Boxing Council title against
Vitaly Klitschko, probably in late February or early March. Lewis'
manager Adrian Ogun said the site and exact date will be set as soon
as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko, a Ukrainian who trains in Hamburg, Germany, is ranked
No. 2 by the WBC. He positioned himself for the bout with a
10th-round knockout of Larry Donald on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko, 32-1 with 31 knockouts, is a former World Boxing
Organization champion. He is the older brother of Wladimir Klitschko,
also a top heavyweight.</TE>

<HD>Palmer's a Pro, Scout's Honor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, it seems as if he has been at USC forever. But Carson Palmer
won't last long on the first day of the NFL draft.</LD>
<LD>   I asked several NFL general managers, offensive coordinators and
scouts about Palmer this week, and they all said the Trojan
quarterback had improved his pro stock dramatically this season. Beat
Notre Dame? Win the Heisman Trophy? All that stuff is icing for a
player who has made the jump from a second- or third-round selection
to a projected high first-rounder.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he made millions of dollars by staying in school," an AFC
offensive coordinator said.</LD>
<TE>   The college scouting director for an AFC team said the 6-foot-5,
225-pound quarterback "has a combination of size and athleticism
that's kind of unique. He's a much better athlete than, say, Drew
Bledsoe. He's got mobility, avoidance, ways to buy time. He's
definitely a threat as a runner."</TE>
<TE>   An NFC general manager said Palmer, the all-time Pac-10 leader in
yards passing and completions, looks like a different player in his
second season in Norm Chow's offense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's potentially a top-10 player," the GM said. "There's no way I
would have said that before this season. He just made too many
mistakes before this year, too many bad throwing decisions. There
were times he threw it right to the defender, kind of like, 'Why ...
are you throwing that thing?'</TE>
<TE>   "He's always had potential. But it wasn't performance, just
potential. I don't know if he couldn't learn the offense, couldn't
grasp it or what.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] now he's a whole different player. He just doesn't look
like the same guy. He has performed extremely well."</TE>
<TE>   The GM said Palmer's performance in pressure games was
particularly telling. In four starts against UCLA, Palmer is 3-1 with
1,036 yards passing, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "That just leads you to believe he really plays well in big
games," he said. "In evaluating players, you love to see that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feudin' Time</TE>
<TE>   The next time he plays against Green Bay, Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp
had better keep his feet moving. Larry Beightol, offensive line coach
for the Packers, said this week his players would retaliate for
Sapp's blindside hit on tackle Chad Clifton last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp, who got into a shouting match with Packer Coach Mike Sherman
over the hit, was not fined by the league. Clifton, who temporarily
lost some feeling in his legs and toes, suffered torn hip ligaments
and probably is done for the season -- if not longer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a cheap shot, but there has to be something where these
players look out for each other," Beightol told the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel. "There will be other games. There will be other times."</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Beightol said, he'd told his players to block Sapp
high and avoid cut blocks, which could expose him to injury.</TE>
<TE>   Tackle Jackie Slater, who had a Hall of Fame career with the Rams,
absorbed his share of out-of-nowhere hits during 20 seasons. He said
the Packers should not have been cutting Sapp any slack in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "I resent that," Slater said of Beightol's comments. "You can
never go into a game against a top-level player like Warren Sapp with
any thought other than doing whatever you have to do.... You have to
teeter on the edge of total disaster in order to get a guy like that
blocked. If you have to do something questionable, you do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- The Broncos are 3-3 at home, quite a change from their
six Super Bowl seasons, when they went 42-5 at home. After the
heartbreaking loss to the Colts, receiver Rod Smith lambasted his
teammates for their lack of killer instinct, his shouts reverberating
through the closed locker-room doors. "Rod said it all [Sunday]
night," cornerback Denard Walker told the Denver Post. "No more
needed to be said by anybody after he was through. To me, it was a
guy showing a lot of heart, and I respect that. I can't fault him for
saying the truth. We're not doing enough if we're losing like this.
Because this team right now should be 10-1."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City running back Priest Holmes accounted for 307 total
yards from scrimmage in a 39-32 loss to Seattle last Sunday, a
performance that ranks fourth in NFL history. The record belongs to
former L.A. Ram receiver Flipper Anderson, who gained 336 yards (all
receiving) in an overtime game against New Orleans in 1989. Second
and third place belong to Houston running back Billy Cannon, 330, and
Kansas City receiver Stephone Paige, 309.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- In losing to Pittsburgh last Sunday, the 1-10 Bengals
reached a rather dubious milestone. They extended their streak to
five consecutive seasons with double-digit losses. Since they last
made the playoffs, in the 1990 season, the Bengals have gone 54-133.
That said, things are looking up. Slightly. Cincinnati has outscored
opponents in the last five games, 130-127, yet is 1-4 over that
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Steeler running back Jerome Bettis rushed for 79 yards against the
Bengals and finally surpassed O.J. Simpson for 11th place on the
all-time list with 11,287 yards. At times, Bettis' pursuit slowed to
a crawl, prompting the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Ed Bouchette to
write, "For a while, it seemed as if Bettis were chasing Simpson
longer than the California Highway Patrol."</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Some people in New York called the Giants' 16-14 loss
to Houston the low point in franchise history. People in Dallas said
the same thing when the Cowboys lost their opener to the expansion
team. So how does that make the Texans feel? "It kind of comes with
the territory," Texan Coach Dom Capers said. "If you're an opponent
playing the Houston Texans, the worst thing that could happen to you
is to lose to the Houston Texans. Anytime we've beaten somebody, it's
the worst loss in their history, so that doesn't say a whole lot for
us."</TE>
<TE>   When he single-footedly beat the Broncos in a driving snowstorm,
Indianapolis' Mike Vanderjagt became the first player to kick field
goals of at least 50 yards to force overtime and to win the game. A
54-yarder tied the game, and a 51-yarder won it.</TE>
<TE>   "That second one was straight out of 'Hoosiers,' " Vanderjagt told
reporters. Colt Coach Tony Dungy later confessed he needed to be
talked into giving Vanderjagt a chance from that distance in
overtime, considering the blizzard conditions. It was the long
snapper who did the sales job. And it was a perfect guy to do it:
Justin Snow.</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Buffalo's defense is allowing an NFL-worst 28.8 points
a game and is on pace to surrender 461, which would break the
franchise record of 454. The Bills simply do not force turnovers.
They have only five interceptions this season -- four during a
horrendous game by Miami's Ray Lucas and the other when Chris Watson
picked off a Hail-Mary pass at the end of the first half against
Detroit. The NFL record for fewest interceptions in a 16-game season
is six, set by Atlanta in 1996. "Everybody always says those things
happen in bunches," Buffalo Coach Gregg Williams said of turnovers.
"We need to have them happen in bunches for us. It's huge. We've done
a great job of preventing turnovers. We need to take the ball away."</TE>
<TE>   More on that Lucas fiasco: He completed 13 of 33 passes for 165
yards with one touchdown and four interceptions and two fumbles, for
a 26.3 quarterback rating.</TE>
<TE>   He is coming off impressive performances against Baltimore and San
Diego, though, and gets another chance against the Bills on Sunday.
"Same guy physically," Dolphin Coach Dave Wannstedt said. "Different
guy mentally."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci went to great
lengths Monday to check on the condition of Philadelphia quarterback
Koy Detmer, who'd suffered a dislocated elbow against the 49ers.
After the game, Mariucci walked into the showers in the visiting
team's locker room ... wearing a business suit.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- When the Lions won the overtime coin toss and chose
to take the wind instead of the ball -- a decision that backfired --
Chicago's Larry Whigham immediately offered his appraisal: "I told
the captains, 'Y'all are stupid. That's dumb.' " No argument here.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to disagree with Chicago defensive coordinator Greg
Blache, who called the game "two bad teams praying, and they were
just worse than we were." Added Blache, "We're still a bad football
team. A miracle on offense bailed us out. We played atrociously.
We're an ugly defensive football team right now." Bad time to be
heading to Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Once billed as one of the weaker divisions, the NFC
South now boasts a league-best record of 26-17-1.</TE>
<TE>   If the season were to end today, the NFC playoff bracket would
include Tampa Bay (9-2), Atlanta (7-3-1) and New Orleans (7-4).</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson was scorching in November,
completing 63.5% of his passes (61 of 96) for 700 yards with nine
touchdowns, zero interceptions and a passer rating of 116.7.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina running back DeShaun Foster recently had microfracture
surgery on his injured knee. The procedure involves punching tiny
holes in the bone to enhance blood flow and create scar tissue, which
acts as cartilage. Three former Panthers -- Patrick Jeffers, Chuck
Smith and Eric Swann -- had the surgery, and in each case the
player's career ended shortly thereafter. Foster, the former UCLA
standout, has not played a down this season. He suffered the knee
injury in an exhibition game against New England and was supposed to
miss four weeks. He later was placed on injured reserve, meaning his
season is over.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- The Giants have a way of keeping games close.
Seventeen of their last 23 games have been decided by seven points or
fewer, and New York has not won by more than seven in nearly 14
months.</TE>
<TE>   After his team lost quarterbacks Donovan McNabb and Detmer to
injury, Eagle Coach Andy Reid received a letter from comedian Bill
Cosby, a Philadelphia native offering his services as a fill-in
passer. "Realizing there's an opening," Cosby wrote, "I felt the
adrenaline begin to pump. I ran down to the basement, pulled out my
old Central High School leather helmet (without face mask) and
shoulder pads, got the missus up, and with a Whiffle ball, had her
bending over and I took snaps."</TE>
<TE>   He signed the letter, Bill "Go Long" Cosby.</TE>

<HD>Beuerlein to Get Start Against Chargers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denver Bronco quarterback Steve Beuerlein will start Sunday against
the San Diego Chargers because Brian Griese is still favoring his
sprained left knee.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Shanahan hoped early in the week that Griese would be
able to play. He decided to start Beuerlein after reviewing practice
this week.</LD>
<LD>   "After looking at practice yesterday, he can do some things but I
hate to put him in that situation where he doesn't have full mobility
and [not] be able to do the things that he needs to do," Shanahan
said Friday. "We just studied the film and he was favoring it."</LD>
<TE>   Shanahan said he will evaluate Griese during the weekend to
determine if he will be healthy enough to be the No. 2 quarterback,
or if Jarious Jackson will be the backup.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan said earlier in the week that Griese's availability would
be a game-time decision, but he named Beuerlein the starter to give
him more time to practice with the first-team offense.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan also said tight end Shannon Sharpe (dislocated elbow)
continues to improve, but his status remains a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther running back Lamar Smith, charged Thursday night
with drunken driving, was put on paid leave by the team for the rest
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Smith will paid because the team had no choice. Under league
rules, the Panthers could not have released him because of his
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they could have waived Smith, they would have had to pay
his weekly salary of $41,176 for each of the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With their playoff hopes virtually gone, the Washington Redskins
will have to play out the string without Jeremiah Trotter and
possibly without Dan Wilkinson.</TE>
<TE>   Middle linebacker Trotter, the team's leading tackler, tore a
ligament in his right knee in Thursday's 27-20 loss to the Dallas
Cowboys. Trotter will have reconstructive surgery, which requires as
much as six months of rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Wilkinson has a partial tear in his right calf
muscle, which usually means two to four weeks on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve McNair sat out most of the Tennessee Titans' practice
because of a rib injury, and Coach Jeff Fisher said his status for
Sunday's game against the New York Giants would be a game-time
decision. McNair tossed a few passes with a trainer, but Neil
O'Donnell took most of the snaps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charger wide receiver Curtis Conway didn't practice Friday and has
been bothered by muscle spasms in his injured shoulder. Conway is
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Dolphin free safety Brock Marion might be sidelined for
Sunday's game at Buffalo because of back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaun King has quietly replaced Rob Johnson as the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers' No. 2 quarterback. Coach Jon Gruden confirmed the
promotion, although he had little to say about the change for Sunday
night's game against the New Orleans Saints.</TE>

<HD>Skudra Helps Extend Canucks' Win Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Backup goalie Peter Skudra was the latest standout during the
Vancouver Canucks' record-setting run.</LD>
<LD>   Skudra made 32 saves to help the Canucks extend their
franchise-record winning streak to nine games with a 5-3 victory over
the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday night at Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Sedin scored a tie-breaking power-play goal in the third
period.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of guys have been contributing and you need that to
happen," Vancouver Coach Marc Crawford said. "It's not going to
happen if you rely on only two or three guys."</TE>
<TE>   Markus Naslund, Murray Baron and Marek Malik also scored for the
Canucks, who are 11-1 in November. It's the first 11-win month in
team history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 6, Detroit 4 -- Jan Hlavac scored three goals and Jeff
O'Neill got the game-winner with 8:48 left at Raleigh, N.C., in a
rematch of last year's Stanley Cup finals. Hlavac, who came to
Carolina in a trade Nov. 1 from Vancouver, beat Curtis Joseph on a
back-handed rebound for the third hat trick of his career with 15:34
left. Rod Brind'Amour had three assists for Carolina as the Red Wings
gave up a season-high 41 shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Philadelphia 0 -- Ed Belfour took the lead in shutouts
among active goaltenders with 62 as the Maple Leafs won at
Philadelphia. Belfour made 21 saves as he passed Colorado's Patrick
Roy for career shutouts and recorded his second shutout against the
Flyers in six days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, Nashville 1 -- Backup goaltender Corey Schwab turned
back 28 shots to lead the Devils at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Calgary 2 -- Pavol Demitra scored three goals for his
third career hat trick and had an assist in the victory at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 3, New York Rangers 3 -- Brenden Morrow scored twice,
including the tying goal in the second period, as the Stars remained
unbeaten at home in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 6, Washington 2 -- Marian Hossa's goal extended his
point-scoring streak to a franchise-record 12 games and the Senators
remained unbeaten in nine games with a victory at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Buffalo 1 -- Alexei Kovalev scored twice and had an
assist at Buffalo, N.Y., to lead the Penguins into first place in the
Atlantic Division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Ray Whitney scored twice at
Uniondale, N.Y., to help the Blue Jackets end a three-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Montreal 2 -- Michal Grosek broke a tie at Boston with
his first goal of the season in the first game between the teams
since the Canadiens stunned top-seeded Boston in the first round of
the playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Minnesota 2 -- Antti Laaksonen's third-period goal
lifted the Wild into the tie at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Flyers will be without star forward John LeClair
for as many as 12 weeks because of a dislocated shoulder. He will

<KH>Helene Elliott / ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Kings, Ducks Share in the Moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was like planets colliding, an extraordinary moment when the Kings
and Mighty Ducks were both above .500 and involved in a meaningful
game.</LD>
<LD>   Their orbits have rarely aligned in the nine-plus seasons since
the Ducks joined the NHL, a period the Ducks insist on calling a
"mighty decade," the mathematics notwithstanding. If one was up, the
other was down. If one zigged, the other zagged.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past, it almost seemed like the points, not that they
didn't matter, but one team or the other was out of reach when we
played," Duck center Steve Rucchin said Friday. "Now, we're both
fighting for the playoffs."</LD>
<TE>   It might take a playoff series for this geographical rivalry to
take on the passion it lacked during much of the teams' 2-2 tie
Friday at the Arrowhead Pond. Of course, they would have to qualify
for postseason play the same year, which won't be easy for either
team, let alone both, in the tough Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe it will take on an edge because of something silly that
happened Friday.</TE>
<TE>   With the announced sellout crowd of 17,174 split about evenly
between King fans and Duck fans, the Ducks' in-game entertainment
officials decided to appeal to home-county loyalty and take a jab at
the Kings during a second-period TV timeout. In a tasteless and
poorly executed attempt at amusement -- games themselves not being
deemed entertainment enough since ticket prices hit stratospheric
levels the last few years -- the Ducks posted on their center-ice
message board a list of five reasons why King fans sit together at
Duck games.</TE>
<TE>   Forgetting, of course, that if it hadn't been for the several
thousand King fans in the stands, the building would have been
emptier than it has been so often the last few seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the entries on the list were inane. One was inappropriate,
especially during a post-Thanksgiving afternoon game with plenty of
kids in the audience. None bears repeating. Perhaps the greatest sin
of all, none was funny. And the ploy backfired, waking up King fans
to cheer in defense of their honor.</TE>
<TE>   Duck fans responded in turn -- or did they?</TE>
<TE>   A King official later said the Ducks had piped in booing sounds
because the natural noise wasn't enough, a charge the Phoenix Coyotes
made against the Ducks two seasons ago after a game at the Pond. Doug
Moss, the Ducks' senior vice president for business operations,
denied having supplemented the crowd noise but agreed that the
gratuitous shot at King fans on the scoreboard was a mistake, saying
that won't be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "My idea was to try to get the home-ice advantage back," he said.
"We've got a lot of King fans coming in here, and our fans are
quieter. I'm not sure that's the way I want to go with it."</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray was clearly irked.</TE>
<TE>   "What did they say, there's more room to stretch out and you have
more chance to sit next to a King fan?" he said, referring to the
Ducks' attendance woes. "That kind of stuff is not necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. It wasn't necessary Friday, or ever.</TE>
<TE>   After dwelling too long in hockey oblivion and missing the
playoffs the last three seasons, the Ducks have finally gathered
enough talent and mixed in enough good temperaments to be interesting
and competitive. Thanks to the generous NHL rule that gives a point
to teams that lose in overtime, they've even managed to stay with the
West playoff pack.</TE>
<TE>   As they've gotten deeper into the second quarter of the season
they've accumulated 25 points in 24 games, eight more than at the
same stage last season. The Kings, with 25 points in 23 games, are
six ahead of last season's pace and are doing an admirable job of
pushing forward while Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh, Ian Laperriere,
Ken Belanger and Lubomir Visnovsky recover from injuries. Their depth
has carried them, but the Ducks are on their heels.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows the steps they've taken to get better," King center
Bryan Smolinski said of the Ducks. "It's always nice to see those
guys winning because it's good for hockey. I played in Boston with
Adam Oates, and it's nice to see he's still kicking around.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played some great games with them and if that continues, it
will be a real rivalry."</TE>
<TE>   A rivalry can exist only if one team has reason to fear the other
might take away something precious. Each team poses that kind of
threat to the other now.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of years, we've been ahead of them but now the
standings are close," King defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. "This
was a tight game because both teams were really aware how important
these games are."</TE>
<TE>   Important enough to let the game be the thing, not sophomoric
attempts at humor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to see both buildings full," Murray said. "It would be
good for the Kings if the Ducks are selling out because it means
there's more hockey people in the area."</TE>
<TE>   When there's finally reason for each to respect the other, it
serves no one to descend to stupidity. Why spoil the moment, when
it's so rare and worth enjoying?</TE>

<HD>Tiger's Stance on Augusta Gets Support</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods says he still thinks Augusta National should admit a
woman and says he still has no vote on the issue, but is thankful for
the support he has received after a recent New York Times editorial
called on him to boycott the 2003 Masters.</LD>
<LD>   "My opinion is my opinion and it won't change one bit," Woods said
Friday. "We're certainly going to be asked a lot about it, no
question about it. And any support I've been given, I certainly
appreciate that."</LD>
<LD>   After the newspaper suggested that Woods ought to sit out the next
Masters to lead a protest, the Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke out and said
it was wrong to single out Woods.</LD>
<TE>   This week, columnist Joan Ryan of the San Francisco Chronicle
wrote that Woods was puzzled by how admitting a privileged woman to
an exclusive men's club would be a meaningful cause for women's
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Quindlen, a columnist at Newsweek, was even stronger in her
analysis of the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dispute so absurd it scarcely seems worth arguing,"
Quindlen wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger Woods signed on for the game of golf. It would be lovely if
he used the bully pulpit of athletic celebrity to address
inequalities in a way that vanquished them. But he is not obliged to
do so, not by his vocation and certainly not by his race."</TE>
<TE>   Melana Zyla Vickers, senior fellow at the Independent Women's
Forum, also found the controversy lacking substance.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no economic or social harm that has befallen
women due to Augusta National's choice to remain an all-male club,"
Vickers said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   Mark O'Meara joked that he hoped Woods would skip the Masters so
someone else might have a chance to win. Woods has won the Masters
the last two years, three times in all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great to hear support from different people," Woods
said. "For a while there, I was the only person they even wanted
answers from, the only person focused on and the only person expected
to do a lot of different things."</TE>

<DH>Argentina to Tour With Young Bunch</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina will play Mexico at the Coliseum on Feb. 4 in what will be
Ricardo Lavolpe's first game as Mexico's coach, oddly enough against
the country of his birth.</LD>
<LD>   The match will be the second in a three-game tour for Argentina,
which will also play Honduras in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on Feb. 1 and
the United States in Miami on Feb. 8.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa named a very young and
inexperienced roster of 18 players for the tour. Bielsa did not
select any of Argentina's European-based players, the entire roster
being picked from Argentine league teams.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 18, only three have played for the national team before,
led by Boca Juniors forward Marcelo Delgado, who has made 17
international appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, which will hold a monthlong training camp outside
Buenos Aires just before the tour, also is trying to arrange games on
the road against the Netherlands, Ukraine and Libya later in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has not played a game since being knocked out of the World
Cup by the U.S. in June. Lavolpe, a reserve goalkeeper on Argentina's
1978 World Cup-winning team, moved to Mexico after that tournament
and has lived there ever since. He was named Mexico's coach in
October.</TE>

<TE>   Brazilian Semifinals</TE>
<TE>   A last-minute goal by teenage striker Diego earned Santos a 2-1
victory over Sao Paulo in front of 70,000 fans in Sao Paulo on
Thursday night and put the club into the Brazilian championship
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Santos had won the first match in the two-game quarterfinal
series, 3-1 at home, and advanced on aggregate, 5-2, against heavily
favored Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   In the semifinals, Santos will play Gremio, which edged Juventude,
1-0, on aggregate. The other semifinal will pit Corinthians against
Fluminense, which ousted Sao Caetano.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pumas Reach Copa</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican club UNAM qualified for South America's Copa
Libertadores for the first time Thursday night when it defeated Cruz
Azul, 2-0, on second-half goals by Francisco Fonseca and Miguel
Espana in Mexico City. Cruz Azul had already clinched a place in the
2003 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Camacho to Benfica</TE>
<TE>   Jose Antonio Camacho, who resigned as Spain's coach after the team
was knocked out of the World Cup in the quarterfinals by South Korea,
has agreed to become coach of Benfica, once Portugal's leading club
but recently fallen on hard times.</TE>
<TE>   Camacho, 47, will take charge for the remainder of this season,
with an option to extend that contract for another year. Terms were
not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friedel Returns</TE>
<TE>   Brad Friedel, the U.S. national team goalkeeper who had surgery
Nov. 17 to repair cartilage damage in his left knee, is expected to
play for Blackburn Rovers today against Fulham in an English Premier
League game.</TE>
<TE>   "I am recovering well and my knee is responding all the time,"
Friedel told Associated Press on Thursday. "One thing is for sure,
the pain has gone away. Right now, I'm heading for 100% fitness, and
it's a pretty good feeling."</TE>
<TE>   That 149-0 Result</TE>
<TE>   Zaka Be, the Madagascan coach whose team purposely scored 149 own
goals in protest against allegedly biased refereeing, was suspended
from coaching for three years Friday by the country's soccer
federation and also banned from entering any stadium for the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   With Be orchestrating matters from the stands, to which he had
been banished, his team, Olympique de L'Emyrne, last month put the
ball into its own net 149 times in a farcical league match against AS
Adama, whose players just stood around and watched.</TE>
<TE>   Four Olympique de L'Emyrne players were banned until the end of
2002, while the rest of the players from both teams were warned about
their conduct.</TE>

<LD>Brandon Worthy made four free throws with less than a minute left and
Loyola Marymount held on to defeat Montana, 65-62, Friday in the
consolation game of the Great Alaska Shootout at Anchorage.</LD>
<LD>   Worthy's two free throws with 37 seconds left gave Loyola a 61-59
lead. After two more free throws by Kent Dennis, Montana's David Bell
made a three-point shot to cut Loyola's advantage to 63-62, but
Worthy's two free throws with six seconds left provided the final
margin.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis led Loyola Marymount (3-1) with 11 points. Bell scored 21

<TE>   Pepperdine center Will Kimble has left the team after being
diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening heart condition, but
Coach Paul Westphal said Friday it's too early to tell if Kimble will
play basketball again.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had one doctor's consultation that was serious enough to
say, 'Hey, you can't be playing,' " Westphal said. "But until all the
second opinions and tests are in, I think it's premature to make
announcements as to what his long-term future is."</TE>
<TE>   Kimble, a 6-foot-10 junior, passed out and went into convulsions
at practice Tuesday. Westphal said complete test results will not be
available until next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves (0-1) play UC Irvine (0-2) at 7:30 tonight at Firestone
Fieldhouse in Malibu. "Everybody just has to play out of position,"
Westphal said. "We've got to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Kimble, the Waves are without forward Glen McGowan.
The 6-9 junior is a potential replacement for Kimble, but he sat out
the season opener and is doubtful for tonight's game because he is
still recovering from knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Boomer Brazzle, a 6-7 senior forward, could move into the center
spot, with 6-9 sophomore Robert Turner or 6-5 sophomore Alex Acker
moving into the starting lineup, Westphal said.</TE>

<HD>Duke Is Just What UCLA Doesn't Need</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The scent of humiliation is in the air. UCLA could be in for the
college basketball equivalent of a public flogging in the town
square.</LD>
<LD>   Just when the struggling Bruins desperately need to retreat from
scrutiny and gain confidence by destroying a patsy somewhere on the
other side of the planet -- say, a collection of Belgian novices in a
fog-shrouded London gym -- the Bruins instead get No. 6 Duke.</LD>
<LD>   On national television. In an event named after John Wooden and
played in the cradle of basketball. With the legendary 92-year-old
Bruin coach in attendance.</LD>
<TE>   As for the Belgian team, Duke had first dibs.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils played in something called the International
Challenge Series in London in October, winning three of four games
and avenging their loss in the final.</TE>
<TE>   The advantages were huge for a team that -- like UCLA -- had
enormous holes to fill after losing three starters. The Blue Devils
began practicing in September, beat the Racing Basket Antwerpen of
Belgium, the Brighton Bears and the London Towers, and returned home
with answers.</TE>
<TE>   After victories over Army and Davidson on American hardwood, Duke
(2-0) is closer to midseason form than any team in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "They went overseas, got extra games and had more practice time,"
UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "It was a great opportunity for them to
take advantage of a rule.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten extra days of practice, and four exhibition games, that's
something we could obviously have used."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA dropped its opener to San Diego, 86-81 in overtime, on
Tuesday, and also lost its two exhibitions. Problems are rampant, yet
the issues are similar to ones Duke faced.</TE>
<TE>   Departed center Dan Gadzuric, forward Matt Barnes and guard Billy
Knight combined for 51% of UCLA's scoring and 46% of its rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Only forward Jason Kapono and point guard Cedric Bozeman returned
to the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Departed guard and national player of the year Jason Williams,
All-American forward Mike Dunleavy and center Carlos Boozer combined
for 54% of the Blue Devil scoring and 52% of their rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Only forward Dahntay Jones and point guard Chris Duhon returned to
the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of discovery that will go on," Duke Coach Mike
Krzyzewski said. "It's as new of a team as you could have. But I
don't want any cop-outs because of youth or inexperience."</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't needed any. With a roster that includes six freshmen --
four were McDonald's All-Americans -- Duke is averaging 98 points.
Freshman forward Shavlik Randolph, averaging 20 points a game, and
freshman guard J.J. Redick, 14.5, are the leading scorers. Another
freshman, forward-center Shelden Williams, is averaging nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Youth-fueled mistakes occurred -- Duke had 21 turnovers against
Davidson -- but this is an exciting time for Krzyzewski.</TE>
<TE>   "What I like about our [freshman] class is, first of all, it's
deep," he said. "We need them. Secondly, they are talented kids and
they are a variety of talents.</TE>
<TE>   "The environment for us to develop in is outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the case for UCLA. Freshman centers Michael Fey and
Ryan Hollins did not produce a point or a rebound against San Diego.
Their playing time against the Blue Devils is expected to be
extremely limited.</TE>
<TE>   Duke will crank up the tempo and put the onus on Bruin sophomore
Bozeman, who will have his hands full with Duhon. Jones, one of the
best defenders in the nation, will try to keep Kapono's touches to a
minimum.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA needs strong performances from sophomore forward Dijon
Thompson -- who had a career-high 21 points and five assists against
San Diego -- senior guard Ray Young and junior center T.J. Cummings
to stay close.</TE>
<TE>   "Duke plays great defense," Lavin said. "You have to take care of
the ball because they put such great pressure on you. They make you
pay for that pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "They get you to hurry up, running around like a hamster, frantic.
You bounce the ball on your feet and they go on a 20-0 blitz."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin knows the feeling. Duke eliminated UCLA from the 2001 NCAA
tournament the last time the teams met, a 76-63 Blue Devil victory in
the Sweet Sixteen. UCLA shot 38% and Duke went on to win the national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils crushed the Bruins in 1998, 120-84, a year after
UCLA had shocked Duke in Lavin's first season, 73-69.</TE>
<TE>   Those games were in February. This one comes on the last day of a
month in which UCLA typically struggles and Duke dominates.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils are 63-8 during November in 23 seasons under
Krzyzewski and have won 18 November games in succession.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 10-9 in November in seven seasons under Lavin, who
minimizes the importance of any game before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   But this one can't be downplayed. Not when it is associated with
Wooden. Not when it will be televised coast to coast. With nowhere to
hide, UCLA must come out fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've won a lot of these nonconference TV games nobody thought
we'd win," Kapono said. "Can this team do that? We'll see."</TE>

<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer has completed 62.1% of his passes for
3,214 yards and has thrown only two interceptions in the last five
games. If tailback Justin Fargas runs the ball effectively, Notre
Dame could be susceptible to play-action passes. Freshman wide
receiver Mike Williams was a step slow the last two games because of
a thigh bruise but appears to be back at full speed. Flanker Keary
Colbert showed he's a multiple threat by scoring on a 34-yard reverse
last week. Center Norm Katnik suffered a high ankle sprain against
UCLA, but is expected to play. If Katnik cannot play, Derek Graf will
start in his place. Notre Dame's defense ranks fifth in the nation
and is in the top 20 in every defensive category. Linebacker Courtney
Wilson is the leading tackler.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN NOTRE DAME HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Junior quarterback Carlyle Holiday has completed 52.3% of his
passes for 1,696 yards and 10 touchdowns with two interceptions in
222 attempts. Sophomore running back Ryan Grant averages 4.4 yards a
carry and has rushed for 1,001 yards behind an offensive line that
features senior center Jeff Faine, a Lombardi Award semifinalist.
Wide receiver Arnaz Battle is averaging 15.1 yards a catch and 21.1
yards on kickoff returns. The Fighting Irish are going against a
Trojan defense that has not allowed an opposing runner to gain more
than 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   Establish the running game: Carson Palmer and his receivers need
space to work against Notre Dame's opportunistic defense, and Justin
Fargas can provide it if he rushes as he did when he gained 139 yards
against Oregon and 125 against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Avoid turnovers: The Trojans must continue to take care of the
ball. They have not lost a fumble, thrown an interception or had a
kick blocked in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Neutralize Notre Dame special teams: Vontez Duff ranks fourth in
the nation in kickoff-return average at 29.2 yards and also is a
threat returning punts.</TE>

<HD>Kelly Angling for a Return Engagement</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kareem Kelly returned two punts last week against UCLA and hopes to
get more opportunities today when sixth-ranked USC plays
seventh-ranked Notre Dame at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, a senior wide receiver, opened the season as the Trojans'
punt returner, but was replaced by Greig Carlson midway through a
27-20 loss at Kansas State on Sept. 21.</LD>
<LD>   Carlson has provided a sure-handed presence, though he is
averaging only 4.6 yards for 22 returns.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly asked special teams coach Kennedy Pola to give him another
chance and he averaged 7.5 yards on his returns in the second half
against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him to rehire me," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said his speed would provide the punt-return unit with
another dimension.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they feel is best for the team is fine with me, but I
think I'm capable of breaking one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly needs three receptions to tie USC's career record of 201 set
by Johnnie Morton in 1990-93. Kelly has caught a pass in 46
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Henderson, a USC assistant athletic director who is in charge
of game management, said a large contingent of security personnel
would be on hand to prevent fans from coming onto the field after the
game. He said the presence was not a reaction to last week's postgame
incidents at Ohio State, North Carolina State, Washington State and
California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing more than what we would normally do for home games
against UCLA or Notre Dame," he said. "We encourage all fans to
celebrate in the stadium bowl. We haven't had any major problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC will play host to several out-of-state recruits and also
expects a large number of local players to attend a game it considers
to be a showcase.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great opportunity to see what this tradition is all about
and see our team play," Coach Pete Carroll said. "Hopefully,
everything works out [in the game] and helps us out in recruiting as
well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer needs one touchdown pass to tie the
school's season record of 29 set by Rob Johnson in 1993. Palmer is
five shy of the Pacific 10 Conference record of 33 set by Ryan Leaf
of Washington State in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame and USC began their series in 1926. The Fighting Irish
lead, 42-26-5.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Wants a Vacated Verdict</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Henry Bibby, acknowledging that his first preference of
replaying the final 2.2 seconds of Tuesday's 73-71 loss at Rhode
Island was not a practical proposition, said he had a new solution
that would be fair to all involved.</LD>
<LD>   "Vacate the game as if it didn't exist," Bibby said Friday. "Take
away the loss from us and the win from them as if the game didn't
exist. That would be realistic. I don't know if anything like that
has happened before. Maybe this could be the first."</LD>
<LD>   The Trojan coaching staff has been dissecting video tape of the
game's final 2.2 seconds and feels it has a legitimate gripe after
Rhode Island players, fans and cheerleaders stormed the court to
celebrate Dustin Hellenga's basket.</LD>
<TE>   Bibby has contended that with the ball in play, a technical foul
should have been called on Rhode Island, resulting in the Trojans
getting two free throws and possession of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the three-man Atlantic 10 Conference officiating crew
waved off Desmon Farmer's apparent game-winning three-point basket
after replays showed the ball still in his hand when the game clock
expired.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Turns Back USC Women, 69-57</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC took a shot Friday at joining the elite level of women's college
basketball, facing 10th-ranked Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   With the toughest part of a difficult nonconference schedule still
ahead, the Trojans must hope it wasn't their last shot.</LD>
<LD>   The teams dueled evenly for 28 minutes. But the taller, calmer
Fighting Irish ultimately turned back the Trojans' upset bid, 69-57,
before 1,317 at the Sports Arena. The victory improved Notre Dame's
record to 2-0. USC fell to 3-2.</LD>
<TE>   Five Notre Dame players scoring in double figures, led by Alicia
Ratay's 17 points, overcame the Trojan trio of Rachel Woodward, Ebony
Hoffman and Jessica Cheeks. Woodward had a career-high 22 points, but
only six in the second half. Hoffman and Cheeks had 10 each.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw, who worried beforehand that USC's
early schedule would prepare the Trojans well for the Irish, was
relieved by the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defense got better as the game went on," McGraw said. "In the
second half they weren't getting as many open shots, and we didn't
turn the ball over as much. But this was a great win on the road
against a very good team."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Chris Gobrecht wasn't using words like "very good" after
her team, which led, 37-34, at halftime, made only nine of 32
second-half shots (28.1%) and registered 13 of its 24 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played scared in the second half," Gobrecht said.
"We had some mindless turnovers that killed us. They had more poise
down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's 2-3 matchup zone and big frontcourt combinations
affected the Trojans, closing passing lanes and forcing USC to shoot
more often from the perimeter.</TE>

<HD>Chad's Career Hanging After Sapp's Smash Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Keep your head on a swivel."</LD>
<LD>   It's a phrase football players start hearing in their Pop Warner
days and it means: Be alert at all times because if you're not,
someone will knock you out with a big hit.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone who plays the game, from middle linebackers to
quarterbacks, understands that forceful hits are part of the game and
that's what makes the controversy surrounding Tampa Bay defensive
tackle Warren Sapp's blindside hit on Green Bay offensive lineman
Chad Clifton so interesting.</LD>
<TE>   In case you missed it, Sapp has been under the spotlight for an
open-field block he made on Clifton during an interception return by
former USC cornerback Brian Kelly in the third quarter of the
Buccaneers' 21-7 victory over the Packers on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Clifton suffered a hip injury and remains hospitalized in
significant pain, unable to take more than a couple steps at a time.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman confronted Sapp,
accusing him of a cheap shot, even though there was no penalty on the
play. Here's a breakdown of three different views of the play:</TE>
<TE>   The Packers: Because Clifton is expected to be sidelined for the
rest of the season and his career could be endangered, it's easy to
understand Green Bay's anger.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers maintain that the block was unnecessary because it
happened nearly 25 yards away from where Kelly was with the ball.
Sherman also claims Sapp celebrated while Clifton lay motionless on
the field. Clifton had to be strapped to a backboard and taken from
the field.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay offensive line coach Larry Beightol was so upset, he
called Tampa Bay defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and told him that
his players would avenge the injury by delivering cut blocks to Sapp
the next time they face him.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the saying goes, every dog has his day," Beightol told the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "We'll see about him.... Everyone is fair
game. When we see him again, we'll see how that dog fares. We'll cut
him every single time. I want him to know that."</TE>
<TE>   It's funny that the two most vocal critics of Sapp's hit are
coaches and not any of the Packer players. In football, it's common
for teammates to stand up for each other on the field but none of the
Packers stepped up to Sapp after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers: For his teammates, Sapp's hit not only was
appropriate, it also made a statement to the rest of the NFL to not
fall sleep against the Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   After years of coming up short in the playoffs under former coach
Tony Dungy, the Buccaneers believe they have the right mix of talent
and attitude to win the Super Bowl with new Coach Jon Gruden.</TE>
<TE>   And Sapp's block said it all.</TE>
<TE>   Because Clifton was loafing a little and not looking out for
himself, Sapp was able to get his helmet in front of the Green Bay
offensive tackle to deliver his hit. The Buccaneers say it was
Clifton's fault that he wasn't prepared to defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   "When I hit this man, I knew I had delivered the shot. But I
didn't know to that extent. I don't want that [injury]," said Sapp
during his weekly radio show. "I wanted him to feel it cause that's
why I delivered the shot. But it's not about malice."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL: After Beightol openly talked about payback, NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue issued a memo to both teams warning that
any coach talking about retaliation would be severely disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   So what else is new?</TE>
<TE>   Now that the NFL has become so image conscious, punishing anyone
talking about violence is predictable. But something doesn't seem
right about how the league has been penalizing players for on-field
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp's block was definitely premeditated and caused an injury to
an unsuspecting player. He was not fined, nor was there even a
penalty on the field. But defensive backs who hit receivers with
their helmets while trying to make a reactionary play on a pass are
fined every week, even though the receivers are expecting the hit.</TE>
<TE>   Very confusing.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plumber was in jail Friday on suspicion of committing a string of
South Bay burglaries.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Stinson Bounsall allegedly tried to put jewelry and a small
amount of methamphetamine and marijuana down a toilet when confronted
by detectives Wednesday afternoon at his Redondo Beach apartment in
the 2000 block of Artesia Boulevard, said Hermosa Beach Police Sgt.
Paul Wolcott.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives were able to recover some of the jewelry from the
plumbing, while other items allegedly taken during the burglaries may
have been pawned outside the area, the sergeant said.</LD>
<TE>   Bounsall, 42, was identified as the prime suspect in 10 burglaries
in Hermosa Beach, and may be a suspect in similar crimes in Redondo
Beach, the sergeant said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest occurred a few hours after police were called to a home
that had been ransacked in the 1200 block of 6th Street in Hermosa
Beach, Wolcott said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're able to tie him to all of the burglaries, it will be ...
over tens of thousands of dollars" in stolen property, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Information provided by the Torrance Police Department's Crime
Analysis Unit put Hermosa Beach police on Bounsall's trail, Wolcott
said. That unit reported that the operating style used in the
burglaries was similar to that used by Bounsall.</TE>
<TE>   Bounsall was arrested in 1992 by Torrance police and served eight
years for burglary. He is being held without bail.</TE>

<HD>Board Backs Plan to Build Homes for Field Workers</HD>
<DH>Supervisors say some zoning laws would have to be changed
and construction funds obtained to put housing next to cropland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County officials this week backed a plan to build more
barracks, apartments and low-cost homes for farm workers and their
families, a move intended to help keep the region's vibrant
agricultural economy thriving for decades.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors unanimously endorsed a wide-ranging plan
that would allow ranchers and farmers to build housing adjacent to
cropland. Zoning laws restricting such housing would have to be
changed to accomplish the goal.</LD>
<LD>   County officials, working with city leaders, would also have to
find federal, state and private dollars to finance construction,
officials said. Supervisors acknowledged that the county general fund
could not be tapped for much money because of chronic budget
troubles.</LD>
<TE>   But in the long run, providing homes for laborers would help
Ventura County maintain its semi-rural lifestyle, something voters
have made clear they want, said Supervisor John Flynn of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't have [growth control] in Ventura County unless we all
commit ourselves to providing the housing for the people who do the
work," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Several farmers have already expressed interest in designating
some of their property for housing, officials said. The location,
size and type of housing will be decided through a process set up by
county officials.</TE>
<TE>   In January, County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston is expected
to provide estimates on how much the county would have to spend to
coordinate the program. Supervisors said they intend to get the
program off the ground and then hand off its administration to a
private nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   The action comes after an August survey conducted by the county
showed that 41% of farm workers lived in crowded dwellings. More than
20% lacked adequate heating, according to the survey, and 7% had no
bathroom facilities.</TE>
<TE>   With a median annual income of $12,000, field workers have little
opportunity to improve their conditions, the study concluded. A
committee studying the problem recommended that the county take a
lead role in addressing it.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers applauded the board for pressing the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get leadership from the Board of Supervisors, that is
what makes it happen," said attorney Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an Oxnard
labor advocate. "This will really be a shot in the arm to making
agriculture sustainable in the county."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn and Supervisor Judy Mikels headed the committee that looked
into the issue. Mikels said she wants to see zoning changes addressed
right away. She cited one rancher who wanted to build a foreman's
house on his property but was unable to do so because of current
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long urged county officials to include city
planners in the process and to educate the public on the need for the
housing. Supervisor Steve Bennett said he approves of the program in
concept, but cautioned officials to carefully draft new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers should make sure that the new housing is genuinely
for farm workers, he said. And most of the units should be built
within city limits rather than on unincorporated land, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to start urbanizing the very agricultural lands we
are claiming to try to preserve," he said.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Pest Creates Big Worries for Fruit Farmers</HD>
<DH>The worst infestation of the Mexican fruit fly in nearly 50
years poses a serious threat to the economic lifeblood of a San Diego
County town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VALLEY CENTER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>This is the time of year when this farming community north of San
Diego turns its attention to Christmas and the Kiwanis Club's annual
gala auction. Or maybe to Little League signups and the never-ending
search for good umpires.</LD>
<LD>   But this season avocado and citrus farmers are fighting for their
economic lives.</LD>
<LD>   An infestation of the Mexican fruit fly has prodded county
officials to declare an economic emergency and petition the state
government to declare a quarantine zone around an estimated 6,400
acres.</LD>
<TE>   Farmers flocked to the town's community center this week seeking
answers to what is being called the county's worst fruit fly
infestation in nearly half a century. For many of them, there were
none. Hundreds of farmers are involved, each with an individual
problem, depending on the size, type and timing of their crop.</TE>
<TE>   The voracious pests consume a wide variety of fruits and, in the
worst infestations, sometimes force the government to order crops
destroyed. It is still too soon to know if growers in the "core zone"
closest to the infestation in Valley Center will be able to save
their fruit through spraying, fumigation or cold storage. It's also
too soon to know whether the government will issue an exemption to
allow farmers to use pesticides and still label their fruit as
"organic."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some day we'll look back and say, 'Yes, that's the
Thanksgiving we fought the Mexican fruit fly,' " said Rose Polito,
whose family has 100 acres of persimmons, tangelos, avocados and a
variety of other fruit, much of it ready to pick. "But right now, we
just want to survive."</TE>
<TE>   As farmers arrived at the community center, they headed for a wall
map showing the central infestation zone and the larger space around
it that is part of the proposed quarantine area -- where fruit would
not be allowed out without a government permit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so sorry," Cathy Mangold, a San Diego County agricultural
standard inspector, told one farmer as she pointed out that his
avocado farm is in the infested area. He left hurriedly, declining to
divulge his thoughts about the possibility of losing an entire crop
without compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "I cry for them," Mangold said, her eyes misting. "Especially the
organic farmers. These are my farmers; these are my friends."</TE>
<TE>   Stoicism is an admired value among farmers, and many at the
community center took the long view.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned, but I don't get carried away with it," said Al
Baillif, who has farmed in the area for 40 years. "I've seen it all:
too much water, too little water, too much wind, too hot, too cold.
If it's not one thing for farmers, it's another."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Wolford, who has 70 acres of avocados, agreed. "We're tough
over here," he said. "We're the original goat ropers. Knock us down,
we get up again."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, two adult flies were caught in baited traps,
bringing the tiny body count to 48 flies at 17 sites, along with two
sites where larvae were discovered. The two new flies were found less
than a mile from the original site. On Friday, no new flies were
found.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a positive sign that they are still tightly confined," said
Larry Hawkins, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
"But that could change tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Some groves have already been sprayed. But a decision by state and
federal officials whether to order more widespread aerial spraying
will not be made until next week, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the spraying hard-liners is county Supervisor Bill Horn, who
grows avocados and oranges in the quarantine area. He wants aerial
spraying from helicopters at 600 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to nuke this area, blast it with malathion and get rid of
everything," said Horn, who, like other farmers, was applying for a
county permit to spray his crops.</TE>
<TE>   Located 40 miles northeast of San Diego, Valley Center is
following the pattern common to once-bucolic Southern California
communities. Farmland is being replaced by subdivisions, although the
Board of Supervisors recently tried to stem the sprawl by changing
the zoning to allow fewer homes per acre.</TE>
<TE>   One imponderable is whether the Mexican fruit fly will be the
final straw for some growers, convincing them to sell their land to
developers. There is no government program to help farmers pay for
the spraying and other measures to save their crops or to compensate
them for crop losses.</TE>
<TE>   Of the long term, avocado grower Stu Lynch said: "We're headed
residential anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 census put Valley Center's population at 7,323, an
increase of more than 300% in more than 10 years. In the mornings,
Valley Center Road, the main route toward Interstate 15, is plugged
with commuters trying to get to jobs in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Still, farming is the economic and social lifeblood of the
community, and the Mexican fruit fly infestation is an unparalleled
civic threat. "Valley Center farmers have their own war now: a war
against the Mexfly," said a front page story in the weekly Valley
Roadrunner newspaper. "Losing is not an option."</TE>
<TE>   A smaller infestation in 1999 cost farmers in Fallbrook an
estimated $3.5 million, although officials were pleased that they
were able to keep the pest from spreading.</TE>
<TE>   Although San Diego County is better known for its beaches,
military bases and tourist attractions, it also has a
$1.3-billion-a-year agricultural economy. Its proximity to the border
puts the county on the front lines in the war against the Mexican
fruit fly. The fly is native to central Mexico, an area that is now
shipping fruit to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade
Agreement.</TE>
<TE>   A single female fruit fly can lay thousands of eggs in her
lifetime, and the pests find more than 50 varieties of fruit
desirable hosts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been something we've been worrying about for 10 years, and
now it's here," said avocado farmer Bill Flynn. "This is just the
beginning. If it gets loose, it's a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   As a cold wind whipped over the rolling hills, farmers continued
to march into the community center on Lilac Road.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just outside the zone of hell," said Pete Montgomery, a
firefighter who also farms two acres. "I'm lucky. This isn't my main
livelihood."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery said the tables and maps and government employees from
various agencies trying to coordinate an attack on a common enemy
reminded him of a command post at one of the wildfires that swept
over Oregon last summer. "It's a war room in there," he said.</TE>

<HD>Cuts May Limit Anti-Gang Program</HD>
<DH>D.A. is asking the supervisors for $128,000 to keep two
prosecutors on the effort full time. Some officials say the county
can't afford it.</DH>

<LD>State cuts may shrink funding for prosecutors in an anti-gang program
in Ventura and Oxnard if the district attorney's office cannot
persuade supervisors to make up the shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Saying they regret being unable to replace anticipated cuts in
state grants, Ventura County officials are urging supervisors to
reject Dist. Atty. Greg Totten's request for $128,100 at their
meeting Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not opposed to the program," Tom Womack, a top assistant to
County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said Friday. "It's about
money at this point in time. When a grant expires, departments are to
look for ways to absorb it."</LD>
<TE>   If the supervisors turn down Totten, two prosecutors exclusively
handling gang cases may have to take on other tasks, said Chief
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be in a tough spot," he said. "This is one of the most
successful programs we have going right now."</TE>
<TE>   The D.A.'s office and the cities of Oxnard and Ventura have
received grants from the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning
for their continuing efforts to stem gang violence. While police
chiefs in Oxnard and Ventura say their cities have agreed to replace
the state's probable shortfall, county supervisors have not yet
considered whether to fund the likely 37% cut.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the county to make an exception to its general rule,"
Bennett said. "We want them to do what the cities of Oxnard and
Ventura have already agreed to do."</TE>
<TE>   The money would help cover salaries and benefits for the program's
prosecutors until the end of the fiscal year in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura police officials have credited the state-funded Gang
Violence Suppression program with helping to reduce violent crime,
which in 2001 dropped by 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Making his case in a letter to the Board of Supervisors, Totten
said that a tight budget has cut his office by 14 prosecutors in the
last year. Gang cases are particularly time-consuming, because
neighborhood witnesses often are too frightened to testify, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-gang program brings together local police, prosecutors
and probation officers in an effort to get hard-core offenders off
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, the Police Activities League
and similar organizations focus on helping teenagers who may
otherwise be drawn to gang violence.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Returns From Asia With Contracts and Contacts</HD>
<DH>Agreements are expected to boost the L.A. economy and add
jobs, while relationships established during the trip may pay off
later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn returned from Asia this week armed
with 11 signed agreements with the potential to boost Los Angeles'
economy and create jobs.</LD>
<LD>   But the greater impact of the trip, according to some who
accompanied Hahn and others who do business in Asia, may be more
intangible: The mayor established relationships with dignitaries,
government officials and business leaders that could pay off in the
future, both for the city and for some of the executives who traveled
with him.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-day trip was Hahn's first major overseas mission, and it
covered a range of issues, from borrowing zoo animals in Beijing to
shipping security in Hong Kong. The logistics were at times
complicated -- he and his entourage visited Japan, China, South Korea
and Taiwan -- and discussions were conducted in various languages,
aided by interpreters and intermediaries.</LD>
<TE>   There were some disappointments: City officials had hoped to make
more progress toward securing a pair of Chinese pandas, only to come
away with a pair of golden monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   But there was headway on a number of fronts, some the result of
tough negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the deals between city officials and their counterparts in
Asia was a difficult one with Taiwan-based EVA Airways. Under that
plan, negotiated months ago but worked out only a day before the
mayor arrived in Taipei, the airline will shift its air cargo
operations from overburdened Los Angeles International Airport to
Ontario Airport.</TE>
<TE>   To get to that agreement, however, sources said city officials had
to agree to allow EVA's sister company, the Evergreen shipping line,
to reconsider its facilities, and possibly its lease, at the Port of
Los Angeles. The agreement thus could benefit Ontario Airport at the
expense of the port, a tough gamble reluctantly accepted by the city.</TE>
<TE>   In other areas, the mayor got agreements to:</TE>
<TE>   * Attempt to boost tourism from South Korea by 4% and Japan by 3%,
an increase that, if realized, could add $17 million to Los Angeles'
economy.</TE>
<TE>   * Develop plans for six major shipping companies to reduce air
pollution by turning off their diesel-fueled engines while docked and
plugging into the city's power system, which could generate $25
million to $30 million for the Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   * Open the doors for Los Angeles' public and private sectors to
win contracts in Beijing, where the government is considering a major
airport expansion and other projects to prepare the city for the
Summer Olympics in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a pilot program with Modern Terminals in Hong Kong to
more carefully screen cargo coming from Asia to Los Angeles' port.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before he left Asia, the mayor said the trip was
essential to prove that Los Angeles is a serious player in the global
marketplace and to secure the city's place in that competitive arena.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of this is laying the groundwork for future work," Hahn
said. "This is obviously not the completion of anything. These are
really agreements to work together. If you don't do these kinds of
things, you run the risk of other people being more aggressive and
Los Angeles falls behind."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always easy for the mayor, who sometimes seems
uncomfortable with small talk. In one meeting at an airport, for
example, he listened patiently as a counterpart went on at length and
the Los Angeles traveling delegation listened. The meeting grew long
and Hahn, seeking relief, sought out his sister, City Council member
Janice Hahn, with a glance. Silently, he mouthed the words: "Help
me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the mayor, used to talking more about potholes and traffic,
found himself practicing foreign affairs. "I've understood more on
this trip than ever before that city government -- and being the
mayor -- is more than just making sure the government runs and
services are delivered," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Richard Riordan took a similar trip to Asia in 1998,
spending 16 days on a more ceremonial visit, according to several
people who were on both trips.</TE>
<TE>   'More Deliverables'</TE>
<TE>   "The Hahn trip has more deliverables," said Philip Depoian, deputy
executive director of the airports department. "You can't discount
the ceremonials, but what appears to be leading this mayor's office
is: Let's get something while we're there to keep these relationships
alive. I believe the mayor and his staff have a commitment to
establishing long-term relationships with the cities and countries
we're visiting."</TE>
<TE>   The business executives who trailed the mayor are among a group of
political contributors who helped finance Hahn's mayoral campaign, as
well as his anti-secession campaign earlier this month. They paid
their own way -- about $12,000 each -- for uncommon access to Asian
government officials and to Los Angeles officials.</TE>
<TE>   Those discussions were held in coffee shops, hotel bars, buses and
airplanes. Jim Dunn of the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys traveled to
Tokyo a day ahead of the delegation to meet with clients, then
attended a dinner hosted by the city where he met the heads of those
companies.</TE>
<TE>   When he next meets with those tour operators in Los Angeles, Dunn
said, he will casually mention that he had dinner the other night
with their bosses in Tokyo. It helps, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn also spent time with the mayor on a plane from Shanghai to
Hong Kong, where they talked about ways to mend fences with those in
the San Fernando Valley who supported the unsuccessful secession
efforts there.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Zen, owner of the downtown Westin Bonaventure Hotel, said he
hopes to open a hotel in Shanghai. It was beneficial, then, for Zen
to attend a luncheon with the mayor of that city and other government
officials. It didn't hurt either for Miguel Contreras, head of the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, to spend time with Zen, whose
hotel employs about 900 union workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say, 'Remember the good old days in Shanghai' before we
start talking about our issues," Contreras said.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Baylis, senior vice president of engineering and construction
firm CH2MHILL, and Edward McSpedon, vice president of HNTB
Architects, hope to take advantage of the deal signed in Beijing
designed to open doors there for Los Angeles companies to win
contracts for airport and other city projects.</TE>
<TE>   They also used the trip to spend time with Hahn, speaking to him
at length during a bus ride back from the Great Wall about ways to
improve the Los Angeles River and the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Woo, president and chairman of Megatoys in downtown Los
Angeles, hosted a breakfast in Shanghai with dozens of
representatives of Chinese businesses, including many who work in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for the mayor -- and the city -- to build better
relationships with the business community in the Pacific Rim," Woo
said. "It will be good for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Depoian, of Los Angeles World Airports, said the trip was
important substantively and symbolically. At one private meeting with
the head of a Japanese airline, for example, the executive said his
own airport doesn't come to talk to him, Depoian said.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have is a mayor willing to come out and bless the
activities that we're doing," Depoian said. "The follow-up for a
staff person becomes that much easier."</TE>
<TE>   National Policy Changes</TE>
<TE>   But though intentions may be good at the local level, some of
these deals might work only if they are accompanied by changes in
national policy. Though Los Angeles officials sought to boost
tourism, a larger problem looms for many Asians: a rigorous visa
review process that often makes it difficult for business and
recreational trips to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Shanghai, Los Angeles officials showed a splashy video of their
city, complete with scenes of young people dancing in a rooftop bar,
cheerleaders and the beach.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Wenlin Mao of Captain Consulting (Shanghai)
Ltd., complained about the visa problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult for us to get visas for the U.S., especially
after 9/11," Mao said. "Almost impossible."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he heard the complaint in every city he visited. He
said it is one of the issues he wants to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all recognize that the terrorists who attacked the
World Trade Center came over on visas," said Hahn, who helps review
security issues as part of his role with the U.S. Conference of
Mayors. "We have to put security at the top of the list, but we have
to be smart about it too. It's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Some Local Goals</TE>
<TE>   While the mayor navigated diplomatic currents, some City Council
members undertook more local initiatives. Janice Hahn, who served
dual functions as a council member and co-host for many functions
with her brother, met in Shanghai with the largest crane manufacturer
in the world and raised with him her concerns about the effect those
cranes have on harbor residents.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, she said many of her constituents complain that the
cranes block views of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I want to stand where you stand and see what you see,'
" she said later. "That was the highlight of my trip."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, meanwhile, met with Japanese tourism
agents who recently opened an office at Hollywood Boulevard and
Highland Avenue, an area he represents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very important to put a face on Los Angeles, to reassure
them that it is safe," Garcetti said. "I don't think anyone can
underestimate how important safety and security are to the Japanese,
especially."</TE>
<TE>   He said he also got new ideas for his district: seeing the signage
in Shanghai, the parking meters in Tokyo and the pocket parks in
Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   "The best and the most modern is no longer in L.A." Garcetti said.
"We're going to have to change the way we do things.... We need to
position ourselves as the capital of the Pacific Rim."</TE>

<LD>Cocaine and heroin he could deal with, but what really got him
excited was marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last seven years, Officer Krowbar, who retired to
Riverside this week after a career as one of the most decorated dogs
in the U.S. Customs Service, sniffed out more than 65,000 pounds of
it in cars waiting to cross from Tijuana to San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   His drive to find it was so intense, and so successful, that the
Arellano Felix drug cartel, one of Mexico's deadliest, put a price of
more than $20,000 on his head. But he kept sniffing them out.</LD>
<TE>   Three years ago, the 85-pound Belgian Malinois was flown to
Washington, D.C., and had his paw shaken by the customs commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of very successful narcotics dogs," said Vince
Bond, spokesman for U.S. Customs in San Diego. "But this dog was just
phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure prowling among cars waiting at the San Ysidro
checkpoint, Krowbar sniffed out 33 tons of drugs valued at $306
million.</TE>
<TE>   But as he approached his 10th birthday, officials decided Krowbar
had earned a rest. He recently moved from his kennel in an
undisclosed location near the border to the home of his handler,
Stephen Ralston, who lives near Riverside, Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, customs officials held a retirement party for him.</TE>
<TE>   As his addiction to sniffing out drugs was extolled, Krowbar
looked a bit bored, Bond said. But when a giant rawhide bone appeared
as a retirement present, Bond said, "those ears perked up real fast."</TE>

<HD>A Tangled Web of Movie Prop Thievery</HD>
<DH>Stolen items find their way to auction houses, fans and
EBay. Studios are tightening security.</DH>

<LD>The day of filming on the "Spider-Man" set in April 2001 ended like
any other, with the one-of-a-kind suits locked up in the costume room
for safekeeping.</LD>
<LD>   But during the night, four superhero suits vanished from the Sony
Pictures lot in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   And as quickly as Tobey Maguire switched from geeky teenager to
crime-fighting arachnid, investigators launched an all-out search.
The studio offered a $25,000 reward. Hundreds of tips poured in.
Investigators traveled around the globe in search of the handmade
suits, each valued at $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   "This was like a Hollywood whodunit," said Mike Moser, executive
director of security operations for the studio.</TE>
<TE>   With collectors willing to pay top dollar for rare movie props and
costumes, thieves know that there is a market for stolen studio
memorabilia. The appetite for Hollywood collectibles has exploded in
recent years, especially since the creation of the online auction
site EBay, police say. Prices for prized memorabilia have skyrocketed
as they have become more popular.</TE>
<TE>   The ill-gotten treasures make their way into living rooms and
private collections. "There is no more famous place in the whole
world than Hollywood," said Phyllis Caskey, president of the
Hollywood Entertainment Museum. "It's owning a piece of fantasy. You
don't always say, 'Where did it come from? How did you get it?' "</TE>
<TE>   Tinseltown theft has hit all genres, from classics to comedy.
Police have recovered props and costumes stolen from studio sets of
science fiction favorites "Star Trek" and "Star Wars." Earlier this
month, an oversized golf ball and key disappeared from a fenced
off-studio set of "The Cat in the Hat" in Pomona. Superheroes haven't
been immune: Batman and Superman have been targeted along with
Spider-Man.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most-publicized thefts in recent years was not that of
a costume or a prop, but rather that of the ultimate Hollywood icon
-- the Oscar statuettes. Just days before the 2000 Academy Awards, 55
Oscars disappeared from a loading dock in an industrial neighborhood
near downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A salvage man found nearly all of the statuettes in a secluded
parking lot, earning a $50,000 reward and a seat at the Academy
Awards ceremony. Three men were convicted in the heist: A former
truck driver for the shipping company pleaded no contest to grand
theft and the others, one of them a dock worker at the warehouse,
pleaded no contest to receiving stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, studio executives were not particularly careful about
protecting movie and television memorabilia because the items weren't
seen as all that valuable, police say. Props and costumes critical to
a movie shoot were often tossed aside as junk or knickknacks once a
film was in the can.</TE>
<TE>   Employees frequently walked off sets with costumes and neighbors
searched through dumpsters for discarded items and were not accused
of theft. Some say that's what happened with at least one pair of
ruby red slippers worn by Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, however, studios have recognized the
commercial and financial value of memorabilia and have stepped up
security to protect and profit. Studio executives now limit access to
sets, monitor surveillance cameras, post security officers and lock
up costumes and props.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies ultimately realized that there was a big market
out there," said Chris Horak, a former Universal Pictures employee
who is now curator of the entertainment museum. "So they started
paying attention and taking measures to control inventory during and
after a shoot."</TE>
<TE>   At least three studios have held their own Internet auctions of
movie merchandise, Horak said. The studios also work with legitimate
dealers to sell memorabilia, he said. Warner Bros. opened a museum in
1996, which can be visited only on a guided tour, to show off and
protect many of its props and costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Studios also began reporting thefts to police departments and
working closely with detectives to investigate cases of stolen
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   But tracking down the thieves is not easy, said Burbank Police
Capt. Ed Skvarna. "You're not going to find a storefront on Hollywood
Boulevard selling this stuff," he said. "These deals are done on
handshakes and telephone calls and e-mails."</TE>
<TE>   In one case, police spent two years searching for "Star Trek"
regalia valued at $150,000 that had been stolen from Paramount
Studios. They found about $50,000 worth of the costumes and
accessories and arrested a fan, Kevin Buehler, as he tried to sell
some of the merchandise. He was convicted later of receiving stolen
property.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say they frequently have the evidence but don't have
witnesses to the studio theft, so criminal charges often involve
receiving stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   Retired LAPD Det. John Winchester, who worked on more than 20
cases of movie memorabilia theft, said he tried to penetrate the
subculture of collectors and develop informants to help him track
down culprits. Investigating the theft of "Star Trek" costumes from
Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Winchester went to a Star Trek
convention in search of merchandise and suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Often the thieves are builders, technicians, designers or guards
who spend their days working at the studios.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to be somebody who has knowledge of the layout of the
land, who has access and who has the ability to conceal the item in a
way they are not detected," said Winchester, who is now an
investigator for Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   While tighter security has made it tougher for thieves, online
auction houses have made selling purloined property easier,
authorities say. Wealthy collectors can buy items with anonymity on
the Internet without ever leaving their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become an extraordinarily big problem," said Warner Bros.
Senior Vice President Barbara Brogliatti. "It's very hard to control
EBay."</TE>
<TE>   An EBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said he relies on police
officers or studio investigators to call if they spot pilfered items
on the site. "It's really difficult, unless either the person or the
company that knows the item keeps an eye out for it on EBay," he
said. "We have no way of knowing when an item is listed if it's
stolen."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood memorabilia, including posters, props and personal items
owned by actors, are very popular on the site. The hand-held camera
and microphones used in the "The Blair Witch Project" and the boat
used in "The Perfect Storm" were legitimately sold through the online
marketplace, Pursglove said.</TE>
<TE>   Most auction houses will not offer items unless their sources can
be verified. Even so, stolen costumes and props occasionally appear
in auction catalogs. Five years ago, studios called police after they
noticed several stolen items set to be auctioned at Butterfield &amp;
Butterfield. About 25 items, including costumes from the movies
"Twister" and "Independence Day," were seized by police before
auction.</TE>
<TE>   The seizure led to the arrest of David Elkouby, a collector who
later pleaded no contest to receiving stolen property and was
sentenced to one year in Los Angeles County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Horak of the entertainment museum said collectors often have two
sides. They are obsessive people so "what they want, they want, and
they will do anything to get it," he said. But most collectors get
their merchandise in honest ways, and a lot of vintage material would
have never survived if not for collectors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some collectors simply are devoted movie fans who want to display
famous props, sets or costumes in their living rooms. Others buy the
memorabilia as an investment.</TE>
<TE>   And some are willing to pay incredible amounts of money for
valuable items. During auctions at Christie's, the Maltese falcon, a
prop from the Humphrey Bogart film of the same name, sold for
$398,500, and Bette Davis' Oscar from "Jezebel" sold for $550,000.</TE>
<TE>   Such prices encourage thieves, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the missing Spider-Man suits, studio investigators
knew the thief had had access to the locked facility because there
was no evidence of a break-in. So they began running down the list of
employees who had access to the suits, hitting one dead end after
another.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think people would go to the extent they did to steal
these props," said Gary Martin, president of production
administration for Columbia Pictures. "This was a well-organized
theft."</TE>
<TE>   As investigators hunted for "Spider-Man's" costumes, the show, of
course, had to go on. The suits, printed with a computer-generated
rectangular pattern that creates a quasi 3-D effect, had been stolen
while production was underway. Costume makers scrambled to put
together new suits, and cameramen worked to film around the suits.</TE>
<TE>   During the search, Sony Pictures received a "tremendous amount of
leads, but very few of them led anywhere," Martin said. Then the
ex-wife of Jeffrey Gustafson called, and the investigation bolted
forward, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson had worked as a security guard at Warner Bros. in 1996
and Sony in 2001, but had left the studio before filming on
"Spider-Man" began. The studio called the Culver City Police
Department, which served search warrants in Los Angeles and New York.
The investigators traveled to Texas and Japan to look for the
costumes, which were worn by Maguire and his stunt doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 18 months after the theft, following the blockbuster debut
of "Spider-Man," police found the costumes. One was located at the
home of Robert Hughes in Northridge, two were found at a collector's
home in New York and the fourth was traced to a buyer in Japan,
prosecutors said. The search also netted a Batman suit valued at
$150,000 and a mannequin that had been stolen from Warner Bros.
studios in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson and his friend, Hughes, were arrested and charged with
receiving stolen property. They are now awaiting trial in Los
Angeles. Police believe the two men may have stolen the merchandise
from the studio, but prosecutors said there was not enough evidence
to file theft charges.</TE>

<HD>Tree Demonstration Extends to Headquarters of Home Builder</HD>
<DH>Passions run strong, even in people who've never seen the
oak. The developer plans to move it so a road can be widened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Errin Haines</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the latest protesters arguing against transplanting the
400-year-old oak called Old Glory: Whisper the dog of Seal Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The fluffy white canine wore a sign around his neck reading, "Save
My Tree," despite the fact that neither he nor his owner, Cynthia
Stephenson, has seen the Santa Clarita Valley oak in person.</LD>
<LD>   The pair were among a small group of protesters, some of whom also
said they'd never visited the tree, gathered Friday at the Newport
Beach headquarters of the builder planning to move the oak.</LD>
<TE>   John Laing Homes, the developer of a subdivision near the tree, is
required by its building permit to widen Pico Canyon Road, which runs
beside the oak.</TE>
<TE>   To stop the company from disturbing the tree, Pacific Palisades
resident John Quigley, recruited by Santa Clarita Valley
environmentalists, climbed into it Nov. 1. He has been there most of
November, save a brief break in the middle of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the media attention, county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, in
whose district the tree stands, abandoned his position that the tree
be cut down and ordered its relocation, at the developer's expense.</TE>
<TE>   The oak has become symbolic of the state's beauty and humanized
the ongoing conflict between preserving the natural environment and
urban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Many have rallied around Quigley, sending money and food, visiting
him and the tree. Others have followed his story through media
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson, a self-described environmentalist who said she had
never before joined a protest, views Old Glory as a symbol of the
state's history.</TE>
<TE>   "This tree has been here longer than all of us have," she said.
"To kill it is to kill the spirit of California."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's protest didn't attract the crowd that has gathered around
the oak in the last month, but the demonstrators said their mission
was no less important.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree is where the bulldozers go, but this is where the
decisions are made," said Doug Korthof, one of the organizers. "These
are the guys that can make the decision. This is where the attention
needs to be focused."</TE>
<TE>   The day's event turned out to be a dry run, since Laing Homes was
closed for the holiday weekend. The protesters plan to return Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The developer announced last week that it would move the tree to a
nearby park at a cost of more than $250,000 -- money, said protester
Lisa Rosen, that could be better spent keeping the oak in place.</TE>
<TE>   "They're talking about spending thousands of dollars just to get
it out of the way. The same resources should be spent to save it,"
said Rosen.</TE>
<TE>   Arborists disagree over the survival chances of oak trees that are
moved, but some have said Old Glory probably would not survive more
than five years after being relocated.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it's gone, it's gone, and it's been here longer than white
people have been in California," said Jim Stewart, a Culver City
resident and member of the environmental group Earth Day Los Angeles.
"It's part of our heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Korthof said the group hopes to get a response from the developer
when the office reopens for business.</TE>
<TE>   "If they should dare to move the tree on Monday, there will be a
price to pay," he said.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Beach Resident Flip-Flops on Sandals, Wants Cops to
Get Them Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't want to imply that some residents of the affluent city of
Laguna Beach are a tad spoiled, but I did notice this in the
Coastline Pilot newspaper's log of calls to police: "Forest Avenue: A
resident threw his flip-flop sandals on top of an overhang in the 200
block at 2:09 a.m. He wanted the city to get them down and an officer
to mail them back to him."</LD>
<LD>   Asking for trouble: A while back, I ran a photo of a bus
displaying a message that said: "If you can't keep up with this bus,
better see us." Problem was, the bus was sitting on the side of the
road, having broken down. Anyway, a reader who works for a Southland
transportation agency and collects humorous shots of buses passed
along another that bore an equally ironic message (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Food for thought: I've heard of after-dinner speakers, but Craig
Endler of Canyon Country found another variety (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Flipped out: Not all the state's crazy drivers live here. Jeff
Bliss, formerly of Newbury Park (and always a sensible driver),
noticed traffic being held up on a street in San Luis Obispo by a
woman in "a mini-van full of kids who was reading/asking questions
from a study aid/flipbook. Here she is, flipping through the book.
It'll be a miracle if the children live long enough to study for
their college entrance exams."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Dancer! Oh, Prancer! The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise said a business owner complained that someone
repositioned the reindeer in his outdoor display so that they
appeared to be in amorous poses.</TE>
<TE>   No need to send a postcard: "Seems like political figures are
always in the news for untoward travel, tours and junkets," wrote
Jeff Haas, recalling such figures as Sam "Travelin' Sam" Yorty, the
late L.A. mayor.</TE>
<TE>   And Haas points out that the Avalon City Council recently went on
a jaunt that also smelled, though not for the usual reasons. It was
described in a headline of the Catalina Islander: "City Council tours
the Landfill."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The Lakers may be playing miserably of late, but at
least they're behaving off the court. Three players on the Portland
Trail Blazers, by contrast, have had run-ins with the law in recent
days. KFWB-AM radio's Bret Lewis passed along the joke about the
Trail Blazers' new uniforms: white at home, orange along the
freeways.</TE>

<HD>Earl of Perth, 95; Oversaw the British Colonies in 1950s,

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Earl of Perth, 95, who oversaw Britain's colonies in the
turbulent 1950s and '60s and managed the redevelopment of parts of
war-damaged London, died Nov. 25 at his home in central Scotland. No
cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   A tall, patrician figure who loved the arts, Perth was born John
David Drummond. He was appointed minister of state at the Colonial
Office in 1957 by then-Prime Minister Anthony Eden, when many
colonies were pushing toward independence.</LD>
<LD>   In 1962, Perth became first commissioner of the Crown Estate, and
it became his job to modernize and repair World War II damage in
parts of London.</LD>
<TE>   When World War II broke out, Perth joined the British Army's
Intelligence Corps and worked in Paris. Later, he was sent to the
United States to report on American attitudes toward the war. He
moved to the British War Cabinet Office and later the Ministry of
Production.</TE>
<TE>   He became the 17th earl on his father's death in 1951, and
restored Stobhall, the ancestral home in Perthshire, Scotland.</TE>

<HD>Charles Weldon, 82; Physician Figured in 'Secret' U.S. War
in Laos</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Weldon, 82, a country doctor from Louisiana who became a
well-known figure in the "secret" U.S. war in Laos, died Nov. 22 in
Thailand of prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The globe-trotting Weldon was best-known for his work in Laos,
where he was chief medical officer for the U.S. Agency for
International Development from 1963 to 1974.</LD>
<LD>   He described his experiences in a memoir published in 1999,
"Tragedy in Paradise: A Country Doctor at War in Laos."</LD>
<TE>   Weldon was part of a huge -- but, at the time, officially
unacknowledged -- effort by the United States to fight a Communist
takeover of Laos by native Pathet Lao rebels and their allies from
North Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in 1920 in St. James, La. He joined the Marine Corps
during World War II and fought in the Pacific theater.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Weldon attended medical school in New Orleans,
graduating from Louisiana State University School of Medicine in

<LD>Ralph Louis Engelstad, 72, a casino owner and entrepreneur in Las
Vegas and later Mississippi, died Tuesday of lung cancer at his home
in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Known best as the owner of the Imperial Palace Hotel in Las Vegas,
Engelstad eventually branched out and built the Las Vegas Motor
Speedway, which he later sold. He also developed another Imperial
Palace in Biloxi, Miss.</LD>
<LD>   The grandson of Norwegian immigrants, Engelstad was born in Thief
River Falls, Minn. He played goaltender on his college hockey team at
the University of South Dakota. He later financed the school's hockey
arena, which bears his name.</LD>
<TE>   Engelstad moved to Las Vegas in 1959, and made much of his wealth
in home construction and land sales.</TE>
<TE>   He was not without controversy, however, when it was disclosed
that he hosted parties to celebrate the birth of Adolf Hitler.
Engelstad later apologized for the parties, calling them "not only
stupid but insensitive."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Gelin, 81, a French actor known best to American audiences for
his role as a mysterious murder victim in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man
Who Knew Too Much," died Friday at the Georges Pompidou European
hospital in Paris. France-Info radio attributed his death to kidney
failure.</LD>
<LD>   Gelin had a 60-year career as an actor, primarily in French
theater, television and movies. He was known for his eclectic choice
of roles, from Napoleon in a 1955 film to a grumpy husband in the
French television series "Les Saintes Cheries."</LD>
<LD>   English-language audiences knew him best for Hitchcock's "The Man
Who Knew Too Much" (1956). He played a Frenchman who befriends Jimmy
Stewart's character, an American vacationing in Morocco. Gelin's
character is stabbed at a street market -- but before he dies, he
tells Stewart of an assassination plot.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Angers, France, Gelin attended the Paris Conservatory. He
wrote several books of poems, and is the father of producer Xavier
Gelin and actress Maria Schneider.</TE>

<HD>Priests in O.C. Plan a Day of Penance</HD>
<DH>They want to show victims of sexual abuse by clergy that
Catholic Church is sorry. Public is asked to submit ideas for acts of
contrition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dusting off a spiritual tool popular 19 centuries ago, two Orange
County priests are organizing a group of clerics to perform a day of
public penance in mid-December to show victims of sexual abuse that
the Roman Catholic Church is sorry.</LD>
<LD>   The priests will take suggestions for the acts of contrition,
which could range from eating at a soup kitchen to listening to
molestation victims, from the public for the next two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "Whatever I need to do that day, I'll do," said Father Bill
Barman, one of two organizers who sent e-mails this week to fellow
priests in the Diocese of Orange asking for their participation.
Before the messages were sent, eight clerics already had committed to
the service. "This isn't a mental exercise like prayer, but a
visible, incarnate act."</LD>
<TE>   The public penance -- thought to be the first by clerics in the
United States since the scandal broke in January -- is needed because
bishops and priests have failed to make amends for molestation
committed by the clergy, the priests said. Their hope is the idea
will spread among the rank-and-file priests at dioceses across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "We have up to this moment been perceived as part of the problem
rather than part of the solution," said Father John McAndrew, pastor
of San Francisco Solano Church in Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   "[This] is to humble ourselves and show people that we get it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of a victims support group applauded the idea, saying
steps like this can bring healing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's exactly the right approach," said David Clohessy,
executive director of the Chicago-based Survivors Network of those
Abused by Priests. "Words alone are nice, but I think what most
survivors are looking for are really practical, tangible steps taken
by church leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Barman and McAndrew came up with the idea a few weeks ago after
they started to complain about the lack of contrition shown by
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and other church leaders who have been
implicated in the church's sexual abuse scandal over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we were really good at telling others what they
should do," McAndrew said. "But what about us? We want to show an
openness to conversion, a willingness to be changed, to be more
attentive."</TE>
<TE>   The priests decided that two rules would govern the penances: They
won't be for show, and they won't be for blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing this for Cardinal Law," said Barman, pastor of Our
Lady of La Vang in Santa Ana. "This is to show solidarity with and
empathy for the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Though they haven't told their boss about their brainstorm, Bishop
Tod D. Brown liked the idea when told about it by a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire their initiative to do something on the local level to
demonstrate to the public and especially to the victims the gravity
of the abuse suffered by young people and children by members of the
clergy," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy said it's not surprising that the move came from the
ranks of parish priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's noteworthy ... that this is coming from the bottom up," he
said. "The bishops have done so little."</TE>
<TE>   Barman said he and other priests have more freedom to do something
like this than cardinals and bishops, who have to worry about pending
litigation and the public perception that "they're showing off" if
they propose something similar.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of public penance goes back to the first decades
after the death of Jesus. Because the number of Christians was small,
"when you sinned, you really hurt the body of Christ," Barman said.
So acts of contrition -- some lasting months -- were a common way for
wayward Christians to work their way back into good standing and show
the public the church took sinful behavior seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County public penances will be performed Dec. 18, when
the priests will meet at the Catholic Worker soup kitchen and
homeless shelter in Santa Ana to divvy up the public's suggestions.
An independent poverty relief organization run by laity, the Catholic
Worker has set up a telephone line -- (714) 835-6346 -- for the
public to call to recommend penances.</TE>
<TE>   The day of service by priests will take place during the heart of
Advent, the four-week period of reflection that Christians use to
prepare spiritually for Christmas. It's a perfect time for public
penances for priests, the clerics said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time of purification," McAndrew said. "Advent is about
bringing light into darkness. What better time to do something like
this?"</TE>

<HD>Rain Expected to Be a Drop in the Bucket</HD>
<DH>Today's showers would add to totals already ahead of last
year. Some predict ElNino's return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scattered rain and small thundershowers should continue falling
across the Los Angeles Basin today as two modest Pacific storm
systems move inland across Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The showers probably will last all day, but they won't be very
heavy. Bill Hoffer, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said
the total rainfall probably won't be more than half an inch in most
areas.</LD>
<LD>   Snow levels will top 7,000 feet in the San Gabriel and San
Bernardino mountains, which means winter sports enthusiasts will have
to wait a while before strapping on skis at local mountain resorts.</LD>
<TE>   The two storm systems lingered off the coast Friday, nudging just
close enough to drop a few sprinkles on Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Only 0.03 of an inch of rain had fallen by nightfall Friday at the
downtown reporting station at USC, raising the total for the season,
which began July 1, to 2.39 inches. That's more than the normal total
for the date of 1.83 inches, thanks largely to the heavy rains that
fell here three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other rainfall figures for Friday include 0.20 of an inch in
Avalon, 0.05 in West Covina, 0.03 on Mt. Wilson and 0.02 in Venice
and Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffer said the sprinkles were due largely to a small low-pressure
system that formed west of San Diego, spinning slowly
counter-clockwise and drawing in moisture from the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He said that system will merge today with a larger, offshore storm
extending south from British Columbia. The combined systems mean a
little more rain will fall today than on Friday, with sporadic
showers lasting into the night. The cloud cover should start breaking
up Sunday, with partly cloudy skies and warmer temperatures forecast
through next week.</TE>
<TE>   Although no major storm systems are expected to invade Southern
California for at least the next 10 days, long-term forecasts call
for a normal to wetter-than-normal winter in Los Angeles, largely
because of the anticipated return of El Nino.</TE>
<TE>   Warming sea-surface temperatures off the west coast of South
America indicate a reappearance of the meteorological/oceanic
phenomenon, which often is accompanied by heavier-than-normal
rainfall in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   During the El Nino winter of 1997-98, 31.31 inches of rain fell on
downtown Los Angeles, about twice as much as normal. Scientists
caution that the approaching El Nino appears to be much less
powerful, and some meteorologists say it could largely be canceled
out by other systems.</TE>

<HD>Noel Regney, 80; Wrote Favorite Christmas Tune, Hit Song
for Singing Nun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noel Regney, who wrote the lyrics for the Singing Nun's 1963 No. 1
hit "Dominique" and a Cold War plea for peace that became a Christmas
classic, "Do You Hear What I Hear?" has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   The French-born Regney died Sunday in Danbury, Conn., after a long
battle with Pick's disease, a form of dementia.</LD>
<LD>   "Dominique," an up-tempo ballad sung to the accompaniment of an
acoustic guitar, spent five weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. charts in 1963
and turned the guitar-playing Jeanine Deckers, a Belgian nun known as
Soeur Sourire (Sister Smile), into an international celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   Regney co-wrote "Do You Hear What I Hear?" with Gloria Shayne, his
wife at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Among the duo's other popular songs are "Sweet Little Darlin,' "
which was recorded by Jo Stafford; "Another Spring, Another Love,"
which became a standard for Marlene Dietrich; and "What's the Use of
Crying," which was recorded by Eddie Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   But "Do You Hear What I Hear?" was clearly their most enduring
song.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by seeing two mothers with their smiling babies in
strollers on the sidewalks of New York during the tense days of the
Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, Regney wrote the words to the
song.</TE>
<TE>   Its final stanza includes the phrase: "Pray for peace, people
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   A quarter-million copies of the original recording by the Harry
Simeone Chorale were released just after Thanksgiving in 1962 and
sold out within a week.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Bing Crosby scored a big hit with his version of "Do
You Hear What I Hear?"</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, it has been recorded by Perry Como, Mahalia
Jackson and scores of other artists and has appeared on more than 120
albums and in versions ranging from jazz to reggae.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shayne usually wrote the lyrics and Regney composed the
music for their hundreds of songs, Regney originally wrote the words
and music for their popular Christmas tune.</TE>
<TE>   When he was done, however, he was unhappy with his own melody and
asked Shayne to write music for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I am amazed that people can think they know the song and not know
it is a prayer for peace," he told the New York Times in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are so bombarded by sound and our attention spans are so
short that we now listen only to catchy beginnings," Regney said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the precarious state of the world when they wrote
the song, Shayne said in the same article that "Noel's vision was
responsible for the song's success. I said, 'We gotta be commercial,'
but he insisted, 'No, we must do something beautiful.' "</TE>
<TE>   Born in Strasbourg, France, in 1920, Regney (whose real last name
was Schlinger) studied at the university and the conservatory in
Strasbourg, at the Salzburg Mozarteum and at the Conservatoire
National de Paris.</TE>
<TE>   World War II curtailed his dream of becoming a composer.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was forced to join the Nazi army, he escaped and
joined the French Resistance.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Regney began his career as musical director of the
Indochinese Service of Radio France and worked as director of the
Lido nightclub in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   He left France in 1951 to go on a world tour as musical director
for French singer Lucienne Boyer.</TE>
<TE>   After settling in New York City, Regney worked as an arranger,
composer and conductor for television shows, wrote music for radio
commercial jingles and married Shayne, who was playing piano in a New
York hotel when he met her.</TE>
<TE>   Shayne, who wrote James Darren's 1961 top 10 hit "Goodbye Cruel
World," introduced the classical music-minded Regney to popular
music. They were divorced in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Regney is survived by his wife, Susan; two sons, Matthieu and
Paul; a daughter, Gabrielle; a stepdaughter, Patricia Spiegel; a
brother, Francis Schlinger; a sister, Annie Marie Schlinger; and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Robbery Suspects Evade Capture</HD>

<LD>Sheriff's deputies surrounded a drugstore in Lawndale on Friday
morning in hopes of capturing two men who tried to rob the store, but
a SWAT team found that the suspects had escaped.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 6:45 a.m., when the two would-be robbers
confronted the manager of the Sav-On Express store on Hawthorne
Boulevard at gunpoint.</LD>
<LD>   The manager fled to his office, called 911 and reported that two
men were trying to break into the store's safe. The attempt to crack
the safe failed because another employee in the store did not know
the combination, Sheriff's Department spokesman Ray Leyva said.</LD>
<TE>   Leyva said that, after about two hours, deputies were able to slip
into the store and rescue the manager and the other employee. No cash
was taken, and it was not clear whether the suspects had fled with
any merchandise. There were no injuries reported.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne Boulevard was closed between Manhattan Beach Boulevard
and Marine Avenue during the incident, and a number of neighboring
businesses were also closed.</TE>

<HD>Two Cities Compete for One Ethnicity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon and Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After decades of perceived indifference from its hometown of
Westminster, the Vietnamese shopping district of Little Saigon is
finally getting a pair of majestic city monuments to mark an official
gateway to the ethnic enclave.</LD>
<LD>   But the markers will be in neighboring Garden Grove.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to place the concrete monuments -- one on each end of
the designated zone, adorned with bamboo trees and the red-and-yellow
South Vietnamese flag -- has touched off a turf war over which city
has bragging rights to Little Saigon. The hot spot of tourism and
business has expanded far beyond its two-block-long birthplace on
Westminster's Bolsa Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy has revived a resentment harbored by Vietnamese
merchants, who for years felt Westminster's city leaders treated the
area's immigrants more as unwelcome guests than members of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Also for years, Vietnamese leaders pleaded with the city to permit
a privately funded Vietnam War memorial to honor those who served in
the South Vietnamese and U.S. forces. The Westminster City Council
finally relented, but only after Garden Grove expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Garden Grove has been very good for us. The city of Westminster,
they've just been talking so long," said Chieu Le, who owns sandwich
shops in both cities.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Mayor Bruce Broadwater said it's obvious that
bustling Little Saigon has spilled across city lines to include the
busy Garden Grove thoroughfare of Brookhurst Street, even if
Westminster officials refuse to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Saigon is expanding, and the Vietnamese population is
expanding," Broadwater said. "It's not patented.... We're not trying
to steal anything from Westminster. We're just trying to become a
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders in Westminster, who officially recognized the city's Bolsa
Avenue corridor as Little Saigon in 1988, don't quite see it the same
way.</TE>
<TE>   Westminster Mayor Margie L. Rice said the city has worked hard to
cultivate Little Saigon since the mid-1970s, when it consisted of
just three Vietnamese-owned businesses. Today, the cultural hub has
more than 1,000 Vietnamese-owned retailers and professional firms,
and has done much to raise the city's profile.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't take Little Saigon," Rice said. "Little Saigon is in
Westminster. They can't annex the city. They can put up the sign if
they want. It doesn't mean they own it."</TE>
<TE>   But Westminster Councilman Frank Fry Jr. said he's not surprised
to see Garden Grove courting Vietnamese business leaders. Westminster
has always given them short shrift and "hates to put money into
Little Saigon," Fry said.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than a decade for the Westminster City Council to
allow landscaped medians along Bolsa Avenue, Fry said. Even then,
there won't be any signs identifying the area as Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always fought for Little Saigon, but one can't do it alone,"
Fry said. "Westminster can't get together on a floor plan for Little
Saigon, so it's frustrating to the Vietnamese."</TE>
<TE>   Fry spearheaded the proposal for the Vietnam War memorial, and
said he nearly moved the project to Garden Grove because Westminster
put up so many roadblocks. Westminster officials were afraid it would
become a gathering place for demonstrations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Councilman Van Tran said his city's decision to
promote its Vietnamese business district was common sense and long
overdue. Vietnamese bakeries, video shops, grocery stores and other
businesses dominate Brookhurst just south of the Garden Grove
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It will promote economic vibrancy and put us on the map. Little
Saigon is not so little anymore," said Tran, who in the 1980s
successfully lobbied the state to place directional signs to Little
Saigon on the San Diego and Garden Grove freeways. "When you
formulize a business or cultural area, the designation will heighten
the awareness and prestige of the area."</TE>
<TE>   For visitors, Brookhurst has always been the gateway to Little
Saigon -- even decades ago, when the district lay exclusively in
Westminster. Plus, the latest U.S. census showed that more Vietnamese
live in Garden Grove than Westminster -- 35,406 compared with 27,109.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Garden Grove City Council voted 4 to 1 to
designate a strip of Brookhurst centered on Westminster Avenue as
Garden Grove's Little Saigon. The monuments, on the Brookhurst median
about a half-mile apart, will greet motorists with "Welcome to Little
Saigon, Vietnamese Business District of Garden Grove."</TE>
<TE>   The project will cost about $30,000, which will be raised by the
Vietnamese business community. The monuments are expected to be
installed in time for the Lunar New Year in February, the busiest
tourist season of the year in Little Saigon as families gather for
the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, the lone dissenter in the
approval vote, fears that the signs will divide the community and
stoke ethnic tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's compartmentalizing or segregating a group of people," Leyes
said at the meeting, adding that he opposed a foreign language on the
markers.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Rae of Garden Grove, who has owned a business in the city
for 25 years, also opposed the Little Saigon designation.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as potential ethnic problems," Rae said during the
council meeting. "It wasn't one culture that started Garden Grove.
Designating one area for one group causes problems and hatred. That
should be everyone's district."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the decision appears to enjoy widespread support.</TE>
<TE>   Huzaisa Ismail, owner of the Little Saigon Produce and Al-Madinah
Market on the corner of Brookhurst and Hazard Avenue in Garden Grove,
said any merchant who doesn't cater to Vietnamese residents won't
last long.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, if you're not Vietnamese, it's hard to make it
here. That's why I put 'Little Saigon' on my sign and have Vietnamese
workers," said Ismail, who emigrated from India in 1985 and is glad
his market is included in the new business district.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter-mile away, at Brookhurst and Westminster, the Vien Dong
Superfood Warehouse stands where there once was a Ralphs supermarket.
Lines form at Lee's Sandwiches, where a Blockbuster Video had closed.
A welcome sign in Vietnamese hangs on the Bank of America building.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know who your customers are," Ismail said.</TE>

<LD>A shark attack near here had an assistant Santa Rosa city attorney
recovering in a hospital Friday after surgery on his badly bitten
legs.</LD>
<LD>   Michael J. Casey, 48, was bodyboarding Thanksgiving Day off Salmon
Creek Beach when a 16-foot shark latched on and thrust him into the
air. Yells from nearby surfers may have made the shark let go.</LD>
<LD>   "He still has all his fingers and toes," said his wife, Maureen,
"but I think he's a little bummed, because he had a whole surf
weekend planned."</LD>
<TE>   Casey suffered deep cuts to his legs, but was listed in good
condition at an area hospital.</TE>

<HD>Push to Break Away From Oxnard District Builds Steam</HD>
<DH>Supporters in Camarillo want their high school students to
be part of Pleasant Valley system and have collected half the
signatures needed to put the move to a vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade-old movement in Camarillo to secede from the Oxnard Union
High School District has found new momentum, as volunteers attempt to
gather the 12,000 signatures needed to place the issue on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents want to create a new unified school district that would
merge award-winning Adolfo Camarillo High School with the 14
elementary and middle schools in Camarillo's Pleasant Valley School
District. The change also would mean moving about 600 Camarillo
teenagers out of Rio Mesa High School in northeast Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   The signature drive began about six months ago, fueled in part by
Camarillo's lack of identity with Oxnard and a desire for more local
control, said Roger Lund, a local attorney who is helping organize
the effort.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the two cities are quite different: Camarillo is a
largely white commuter suburb, while Oxnard is mostly made up of
working-class Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Union High School District was formed 100 years ago,
when it made sense for the two small farm towns to combine their high
schools. But that's no longer the case, Lund said. Oxnard has about
182,000 residents and Camarillo has about 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact we have to send anybody out of town to go to high school
is ridiculous, in my opinion, for a city of this size," said Lund,
who said about 6,000 signatures have been collected so far. "Why do
we have money leaving town and kids leaving town when we have
perfectly capable resources here?"</TE>
<TE>   But critics are worried about the financial implications of such a
move because Camarillo residents are still paying off a
multimillion-dollar bond that funded the construction of two new high
schools in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   They also question the timing. Oxnard district officials recently
began studying the possibility of building a second high school in
Camarillo, a chief goal for many parents there.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been on this team for years, and it's finally our turn at
bat. It seems like a stupid time to leave the team," said Sandy Rao,
who has a daughter at Rio Mesa High and two children in Pleasant
Valley schools. "If you simplify it, the idea sounds great. But there
are a lot of issues involved."</TE>
<TE>   The secession process is known by school officials as unification,
and it has been a topic of discussion in Camarillo for years. The
first study of the issue was commissioned by the Pleasant Valley
district in 1992; it was updated in 1998. Two Pleasant Valley board
members were elected that year after running on a unification
platform, but a signature drive never began.</TE>
<TE>   Another update of the study is to be presented to the school board
in December, said Howard Hamilton, superintendent of the elementary
district.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said Pleasant Valley board members have agreed to accept
the concept of unification, but have not gone so far as to promote
the plan. Oxnard's school board has taken a neutral position.
"Basically, it's in the hands of the voters," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the question gets to the ballot in a special election,
however, it must pass the muster of state education officials.</TE>
<TE>   The signatures of 25% of registered voters in the Pleasant Valley
district -- or 12,000 people -- are needed before an application can
be sent directly to the state Board of Education for review. If
supporters only get 10% of registered voters to sign, the proposal
goes to a Ventura County committee, which could either send it on to
the state or stop the proposal there.</TE>
<TE>   A number of obstacles must be overcome for Pleasant Valley to
become a unified district.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting control of Camarillo High to the elementary district
would significantly change the ethnic mix of the Oxnard Union High
School District, the 1998 study found, and the new district would not
have enough room to house the 3,000 students that would be added.</TE>
<TE>   That could force the Pleasant Valley district to either move to
year-round school programs or to try to pass a bond to build another
school.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, unification would cause the white student
population in the Oxnard district to drop from 28.4% to 16.1%.
Conversely, the percentage of Latino students would jump from 58% to
69%.</TE>
<TE>   While Rao said the proposal "looks like white flight," she doesn't
believe that's the secession group's motive.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, those supporting unification say they simply want to be
able to connect the elementary curriculum with what's being taught in
the high schools. Camarillo High is the Oxnard district's
best-performing high school and has won a Blue Ribbon award, one of
the federal Education Department's highest honors. But test scores in
the district are lower than in districts around the state with
similar demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the split say they also want more of a say in how
their tax and bond dollars are spent. Right now, only one of five
Oxnard board members is from Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo parents grumbled when Oxnard opened the sprawling,
$55-million Pacifica High last year -- down the street from a new
$33-million Oxnard High -- leaving few school bond dollars to repair
the crumbling Camarillo campus.</TE>
<TE>   They deny that race has ever been an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, unified districts do a better job of delivering
services," Lund said. "That alone is reason to unify."</TE>
<TE>   Still, questions remain about how the Pleasant Valley district
could afford the increased costs associated with high school
education without raising taxes, said county Supt. of Schools Charles
Weis.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Union High School District Trustee Robert Valles said
supporters of the unification movement are applying their energies in
the wrong direction. The board has been responsive to Camarillo's
concerns, he said, recently approving $13 million to remodel
46-year-old Camarillo High.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they have all the facts -- the pros and the cons,"
Valles said. "I would say it would be a poor mistake to get out of
the district."</TE>

<HD>Warm Places for Cold Nights</HD>
<DH>Shelters in Sylmar and Glendale will offer cots for up to
150 homeless people each evening through March.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cold-weather shelters will open Sunday in the San Fernando Valley
to offer homeless people hot meals and a place to sleep on winter
nights.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates for the homeless say they expect the need for refuge to
match or exceed last winter's as the effects of the Sept. 11 tragedy
continue to be felt on the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The shelters, part of a network of government-funded winter
shelters in Los Angeles County, will be set up nightly at National
Guard armories in Glendale and Sylmar. Each will have 125 to 150 cots
available until March 15.</LD>
<TE>   "We were at capacity most of the time last year," said Joan
Thirkettle, director of community services for the Glendale YMCA,
which operates the Glendale shelter. "I think the demand will be very
similar to last year."</TE>
<TE>   The shelters will open at 7 p.m. each night, and those using the
accommodations must leave by 6 the next morning. A hot dinner and a
breakfast will be served daily.</TE>
<TE>   The need for homeless services always increases with the arrival
of cold weather, but this year it appears to be heightened by
job-market fallout from the bad economy, said Ken Craft, director of
the nonprofit San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spoken with so many people on the streets who maybe were
working at the airport or in the hotel industry and who have lost
their jobs," he said. "These are not the chronic homeless, what some
might call the 'hard-core' homeless. These are the new homeless.
They've been evicted, they lost their homes, they're living in their
cars, and they don't want to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The rescue mission finds housing for 50 individuals and families a
night by using local church facilities, such as sanctuaries and
dining halls. "By February we expect to be doing 100 a night," Craft
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the county shelters, in addition to meals and cots, visitors
will be offered assistance to get back on their feet. "We try to
remove them from the streets by offering referrals for counseling,
health care, housing and employment," Thirkettle said.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Family Housing, which operates the Sylmar shelter at 12860
Arroyo St., will offer van transportation to the facility from six
locations in the Valley. In the Glendale area, those seeking
assistance should go directly to the armory at 220 E. Colorado St.</TE>
<TE>   Information on the winter shelter program may be obtained by
calling (800) 548-6047.</TE>

<HD>Suspected Stalker Killed by Police</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man wanted in connection with a Huntington Beach stalking case was
shot and killed Friday by a Seal Beach police officer he was trying
to run over in a parking lot, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "They ordered him out of his vehicle, he refused to comply, put it
in reverse and rammed one of our police cars," said Cpl. Joe Miller,
a spokesman for the Seal Beach Police Department. "Then he put it in
drive and attempted to run over one of our officers, who responded by
shooting ... multiple times, ultimately wounding him fatally."</LD>
<LD>   The man, who was not identified pending notification of relatives,
was declared dead at the scene, Miller said. The name of the officer
also was not released.</LD>
<TE>   The confrontation occurred about 7 p.m. in the parking lot of the
Old Ranch Town Center, a shopping mall at the intersection of Seal
Beach Boulevard and St. Cloud Drive, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers had been summoned to the location by a report that the
man -- identified as a person wanted for stalking and making threats
in Huntington Beach -- had been seen there. Miller declined to say
who made the call.</TE>
<TE>   There were no other injuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is being investigated by the county district
attorney's office -- as are all officer-involved shootings -- as well
as the Seal Beach Police Department, Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Cold War-Era Sirens Returning to Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sirens first installed during the Cold War will sound off again in
Huntington Beach, this time for monthly tests of a system that would
warn of possible terrorist attacks and natural disasters such as
tidal waves.</LD>
<LD>   At noon on the last Friday of each month, sirens at seven fire
stations will blast for a minute to ensure the system is operable,
said Huntington Beach Fire Battalion Chief Jacques Pelletier.</LD>
<LD>   The system was built in the 1950s when world tensions mounted with
the threat of nuclear war. It had been routinely tested until about
five years ago, when the city fire department changed its
communications center.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, the department weighed whether it should continue
having such a system or order its dismantling. Eventually, it was
decided to keep the sirens and run monthly tests to make sure they're
operable, Pelletier said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach is one of the few remaining cities in the state
with such a warning system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been on our agenda to get these sirens working again,"
Pelletier said.</TE>
<TE>   "The system can warn residents of natural emergencies like
earthquakes and also warn of impending attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier said that if residents hear a siren at noon on the last
Friday of the month, they should not worry. If it goes off any other
time, they should turn on a radio or television for further
information, he said.</TE>

<HD>Would-Be Teachers Go to the Head of the Class</HD>
<DH>The first freshman class is learning ropes of job at L.A.
Unified's new prep academy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A first-time teacher fumbled with an overhead projector in front of
the ninth-grade geometry class. Soon after, another inexperienced
instructor became annoyed because some students had forgotten their
books. The next rookie nervously lectured about longitude and
latitude, her eyes locked on her pink note cards.</LD>
<LD>   Then student David Lee, 14, raised his hand and said bluntly: "You
all are confusing us."</LD>
<LD>   The lessons ended and the would-be teachers -- all 14-year-olds --
returned to their seats looking defeated.</LD>
<TE>   Then the real teacher spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "This is preparation; it's training," said Cheryl Christopher, who
had been observing in back of the class. "It's not going to be
perfect."</TE>
<TE>   The teenage instructors will have years to get it right. They are
among the first freshmen at the Los Angeles Unified School District's
new Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy, which experts say is one of
the nation's first high schools aimed at grooming young people for
possible careers in education. Located on the campus of Los Angeles
Harbor College in Wilmington, the school opened last month with 80
students and is expected to grow to 400 within four years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is not a sure thing that every pupil will go on to
become a teacher, said Los Angeles Unified school board member Mike
Lansing, who pushed for the new campus as one way to ease the
district's teaching shortage. Before students finish college and earn
their teaching credentials, some may be lured away by higher paying
jobs or changing interests.</TE>
<TE>   But since the federal "No Child Left Behind" law requires that all
public school teachers be fully credentialed by the end of the
2005-06 school year, Lansing said the new academy is sorely needed.
"This could be a step in that direction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kasey Martin, 14, a student from Carson, said he likes "the
seriousness" in his classes so far. He feels more in touch with his
classmates, because they all share a common goal and they are focused
on their education.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said his dream is to teach middle school. He said he wants
to affect the lives of students the way his favorite eighth-grade
algebra teacher Michelle Bradley at Glenn Hammond Curtiss Middle
School in Carson did.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really a friend to many students," he said. "That is
something I want to do. I learned from her."</TE>
<TE>   Students enrolled at the new academy take regular high school
classes but also can simultaneously take community college courses,
which count toward their high school diploma and an associate of arts
degree.</TE>
<TE>   They will be coached on how to conduct lessons in front of their
peers, as well as in front of elementary school classes. They will
grade each other's papers, learn lesson planning and classroom
management techniques and take college education courses such as
child psychology, said Richard Vladovic, local superintendent for
District K, who oversees the school.</TE>
<TE>   If they graduate with at least a 3.0 grade-point average, they
will be guaranteed admittance to Cal State Dominguez Hills, along
with a teaching aide position in L.A. Unified, he said. If they
complete their bachelor's degree and required credentials, Vladovic
is promising them a teaching position with the district.</TE>
<TE>   'You Touch the Future'</TE>
<TE>   "It is the greatest profession in the world because you touch the
future," said Vladovic who has worked for the district for 33 years
and brought the idea to Lansing nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Grossman, a professor of teacher education at Stanford
University, applauded the district's effort to grab future teachers
early.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't start trying to recruit in college; it is just too
late," she said. "You have to develop their interest earlier, you
have to reach back to middle schools and high schools."</TE>
<TE>   The idea has caught on across the nation over the last 10 years
because of teacher shortages in many cities, high turnover and the
need to recruit a diverse teaching force, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although L.A. Unified's high school may be among the first of its
kind, many other high schools have recently instituted programs to
interest youngsters in teaching, mostly in collaboration with local
colleges, she said. A teacher-training charter high school is
scheduled to open in Phoenix next fall.</TE>
<TE>   A similar 1,300-student teacher preparation campus for Los Angeles
high school students is slated to open next to Cal State Northridge
in 2004, an ambitious plan that has been underway for eight years,
said school board member Julie Korenstein, who is spearheading it.
The program will allow students to enroll in university classes and
receive mentoring from college students.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a model program, and it will catch on," Korenstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Carroll, executive director for the National Commission on
Teaching and America's Future, said teacher high schools are a good
idea because they will strengthen the pool of qualified applicants,
but he added that they are not a solution to the teacher shortage.
Higher pay and better campus environments are the only remedy, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a shortage because too many teachers are leaving schools.
Chasing this as a supply problem will never solve the problem," he
said. "As fast as we can pump these teachers into the system, from
whatever source we get them, we're losing them on the other end."</TE>
<TE>   Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy Principal Mattie Adams said she
has already received phone calls from other school districts
interested in replicating the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited to be at the cutting edge of a much-needed
service to our profession," she said. "The sooner we can get students
focused on a career path, the better it is in ensuring maximum
student achievement."</TE>
<TE>   The academy, which is not part of the district's magnet system, is
nestled in bungalows in a back corner of Harbor College. The students
eat lunch together near a small set of bleachers shaded by trees and
so far are mostly isolated from college students.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to accept applicants with at least a C average in
middle school. But not enough students with that GPA applied the
first year. So, some with lower grades were enrolled if they had a
clean discipline record and showed a commitment to education.</TE>
<TE>   Students Must Sacrifice</TE>
<TE>   Academy students forfeited many traditional high schools customs
such as football, cheerleading, homecoming assemblies and
after-school clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheerleading, prom, that doesn't really matter to me because my
education is more important," said Janet Ulloa, 14. "I really want to
be a teacher because I like to help people. Without teachers there
wouldn't be any lawyers or judges or even presidents."</TE>
<TE>   Still, parents are organizing a group that will work to institute
some of those extracurricular activities. The principal also said she
wants to add a basketball team and other activities.</TE>
<TE>   There are only three teachers now at the academy. Classes are on
block schedules, similar to a college class rotation. Students are
granted access to the college gym, library and cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Newman, who teaches biology at the new school, said the
academy is on the right track. He requires students to teach lessons
to their classmates, and if he is frustrated over student behavior,
he will explain how it makes a teacher's job difficult and ask them
to come up with their own discipline policies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, students decided that gum chewing should be allowed,
as long as it is not smacked or stuck on chairs and walls.</TE>
<TE>   'I've Gone to Heaven'</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are motivated; they're wonderful. I think I've died
and gone to heaven," said Newman, who worked at Narbonne High for 18
years.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Takakuwa, 13, said there are special benefits in a
classroom where everyone cares about the learning process.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want to be teachers," she said. "If you don't know how to
do [an assignment], you have a whole room full of aspiring teachers,
including the regular teacher, to explain it."</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, students completed a preliminary course that
focused on study skills and college preparation. They are currently
taking a college-level physical education course, and are expected to
add more college classes as time goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the aspiring teachers may be mixed in alongside
college students, but Principal Adams said she wants them to stick
together in clusters, at least during the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure all of my students are successful," Adams
said. "We don't want to lose any of them."</TE>

<HD>World Trade Center Memorial Is Unveiled at Union Station</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A memorial on display through Dec. 12 at Union Station in downtown
Los Angeles honors the World Trade Center victims. The mixed-media
installation was created by volunteers, including two who worked at
the site and, during breaks, used a point-and-shoot camera to capture
the scene around them in panoramic photographs.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit depicts the devastation at the site and the efforts of
rescue workers in the days immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001,
attack. Titled "September 12th," the memorial was designed by Bill
Keokosky and constructed in collaboration with Jim Audley and the
assistance of 25 Amtrak workers.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia-area building contractors donated materials that
depict the destruction illustrated in the photographs.</LD>
<TE>   Sponsored by Amtrak, the sculpture will be installed in the rail
system's stations in 12 cities over the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Its final home will be a public place, but the location is still
to be determined.</TE>

<HD>Covert Tree Trimming Prompts Suit</HD>
<DH>Woman is angry that a neighbor had 27 tall trees pruned.
View ordinance could have resolved the dispute, but wasn't invoked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Marina Simes' view, what happened to the trees around her Rancho
Palos Verdes home is a crime.</LD>
<LD>   In Eva Wildey's, it was a crime that the 27 towering pines,
peppers and cherry trees blocked her husband's panoramic view of
Abalone Cove and the Pacific beyond.</LD>
<LD>   So Wildey allegedly sent her own tree-trimmers onto Simes'
property to lop off the tops of the trees that for years had obscured
Thomas Wildey's magnificent ocean vista.</LD>
<TE>   The pruning last Dec. 15 so angered Simes that she has sued the
Wildeys for infliction of emotional distress, trespassing and
"injury" to the shortened trees.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute along a quiet stretch of Sea Cove Drive, across the
cove from the Palos Verdes Peninsula's famous Wayfarer's Chapel, is
proof that there is often more than one point of view when it comes
to preserving view points.</TE>
<TE>   Simes, 93, said she and her late husband planted the trees around
their low-slung, glass-walled oceanfront home 40 years ago. So aside
from the shade, there is the sentimentality involved.</TE>
<TE>   "It broke my heart to see them cut; it really did. How could
anybody have done such a cruel thing?" Simes said. "It's almost
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   The unauthorized pruning took place on a day that Simes was away
from home, running errands with daughter Pamela Simes Fleming and
helping a quadriplegic friend decorate for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "We could see that the trees were missing coming down the street
on the way home," Fleming said. "My mother started crying.
Sixty-foot-tall trees had been cut down to roof level. A notch was
cut in a row of trees out by the street."</TE>
<TE>   Eva Wildey declined to comment on the pruning or the lawsuit. Her
husband did not return messages left for him at their home or at the
Rolling Hills fire station where he works as a Los Angeles County
Fire Department captain.</TE>
<TE>   But Eva Wildey allegedly admitted commissioning the cutting, first
in a phone call to Fleming and then in a handwritten note to Simes
the day after the pruning occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Wildey called at 9 the next day and said, 'We cut them down
to give my husband his dream -- an ocean view,' " Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The note, allegedly signed by Eva Wildey, accepted responsibility
for the chopping and pledged to restore the trees. "The Wildeys are
responsible for the costs attendant to fixing or replacing the
trees," the note states.</TE>
<TE>   Simes said that at her age, that's a meaningless promise.</TE>
<TE>   "Words and apologies won't help," she said. "It will take too long
for the trees to grow back. And new trees would only be little
saplings."</TE>
<TE>   Residents along Sea Cove Drive acknowledge that Simes' trees were
huge before the trimming.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a forest," Fleming said. "The Wildeys had asked if
we'd trim them. But I grew up with Tom -- we played together and went
to school together. I told him my mother couldn't bear to cut them. I
said, 'My parents planted them -- you know how much they loved them.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Wildeys could have forced Simes to trim her trees.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes is the most aggressive city in California in
protecting residents' ocean views from being obliterated by tall
trees.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the city enacted a pioneering ordinance that prevents
"needless destruction and impairment of vista points and view lots,"
requiring that overgrown trees and bushes be pruned.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, other ocean-side communities, including Rolling Hills,
Laguna Beach and Del Mar, have enacted similar laws. Currently,
officials in Malibu also are mulling over creation of a view shed
protection ordinance -- a proposal that caused one leader earlier
this month to warn that "if you want to restore views on Point Dume,
you will have to cut down all the trees."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes' law requires homeowners first to try to
resolve tall-tree disputes among themselves. If that fails, city
officials meet with the two sides next to try to hammer out an
agreement. And if that doesn't work, a 10-member View Restoration
Commission becomes involved.</TE>
<TE>   If it is decided that offending trees need to be thinned out or
topped, the matter goes to the city prosecutor, who can seek a
court-authorized warrant that authorizes enforcement of the view
protection law.</TE>
<TE>   If the property owner still refuses to trim the trees, the city
can hire landscape crews to enter the property and do the pruning. If
the owner doesn't pay the tree-trimmers' costs, the city can put a
lien on the property to recover the expense.</TE>
<TE>   The city has handled about 300 tree disputes so far, and all but
12 have been settled without court action.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent court-ordered trimming occurred last summer, when
28 tall eucalyptus trees and a "hedge" of smaller pepper trees were
thinned out at one resident's home. Rancho Palos Verdes is preparing
a bill for the homeowner, said Trayci Nelson, the city's senior view
restoration coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said the city's ordinance has survived several court
challenges. The entire process, from height complaint to city-ordered
pruning, takes about a year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to maintain the foliage on your property so it doesn't
impair the view," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But without completion of the legal process, "no one has the right
to go onto the property, even the city, to trim trees," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Sauer agrees with that. He's a Century City entertainment
lawyer who in 1990 helped entertainment mogul David Geffen win a
$1.2-million Superior Court judgment against neighbors who pruned
trees in a ravine between their lot and a home Geffen was purchasing.</TE>
<TE>   That verdict was overturned and a $700,000 settlement was reached
after a Court of Appeal decided that some of the pruning occurred
before Geffen closed escrow. But the case showed what eight
full-grown pines and four eucalyptuses are worth.</TE>
<TE>   That's because state law allows a property owner to collect triple
damages from someone found guilty of maliciously damaging a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Sauer is handling Simes' lawsuit. Using the triple-damages
formula, he calculates that Simes is owed as much as $600,000 by the
Wildeys.</TE>
<TE>   But as they say in Rancho Palos Verdes, that's his view.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Unfazed by forecasts of damp weather and a gloomy economy, Ventura
County shoppers descended on discount stores and malls Friday on one
of the busiest shopping days of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Some bargain hunters arrived before dawn, clutching checkbooks and
ready to grab discounted items ranging from bikes to Barbies,
toasters to treadmills, DVDs to large-screen TVs.</LD>
<LD>   In Oxnard, about 3,000 rapacious shoppers lined up outside a
Wal-Mart store.</LD>
<TE>   Once inside, they loaded shopping carts with electronics, toys and
bed linens, jamming the aisles and occasionally snarling at one
another amid the crush of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all nuts," said Melisa Williams of Camarillo, who ducked
down an uncrowded aisle after picking up two $48 DVD players. "A
bunch of crazy people, that's what we are."</TE>
<TE>   The craziness was good news for anxious retailers. Last year,
holiday sales faltered nationwide as many Americans turned away from
spending after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and braced for an
uncertain economic future.</TE>
<TE>   With a shorter holiday season this year, retailers have reduced
prices and extended hours in hopes of invigorating holiday purchases,
which typically account for 25% of their annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, the Gap outlet store plans to stay open for 72 hours
straight, beginning at 5 a.m. Friday and operating until 1 a.m.
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart will keep its doors open until midnight between now and
Christmas. Stores at the Pacific View Mall in Ventura and The Oaks in
Thousand Oaks will stay open until 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to ease traffic congestion and keep shoppers in a spending
mood, The Oaks also plans to shuttle its 500 employees to and from
the mall to help free up parking spots.</TE>
<TE>   "The holiday season is always very important to all retailers,"
said Cris Bremner, marketing manager for The Oaks. "This is the
season when the bulk of the business is done, and after last year, it
is even more important."</TE>
<TE>   Economists say the post-Thanksgiving rush is a key indicator of
consumer confidence as retailers enter the crucial holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, confidence appeared high as shoppers jammed the
parking lots and endured long lines to take advantage of early-bird
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   At the Coach store, women cradled armloads of reduced-price
leather purses, wallets and gloves, waiting for more than an hour to
reach a cash register.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, dozens of shoppers waited in line just to get inside the
Tommy Hilfiger store, where large red signs advertised 30% to 50%
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   With 120 stores in two sections, the Camarillo Premium Outlets
have generated about $6.5 million in sales tax proceeds for the city
since it opened eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And the stores continue to draw shoppers from across Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, retail warriors Alexandra Jimenez and Zelina Medina
drove north from Los Angeles in search of bargains. They planned to
hit Guess and Bebe and were resolute in the face of the shopping mob.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I like the battle," Jimenez said of fighting the
crowds. "It's just fun."</TE>
<TE>   Settling into a long line outside the Tommy Hilfiger store, Oxnard
resident LetyMartinez said she was willing to brave an hourlong or
more wait to buy discounted jeans and shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez estimated that she has already saved $300 by shopping at
the outlets and by taking advantage of other post-Thanksgiving sales.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the hassle, she said, "It's worth it."</TE>

<HD>Zsa Zsa Gabor Is 'Getting Better'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after she suffered broken bones in a West Hollywood car
crash, Zsa Zsa Gabor was improving Friday but still in serious
condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman
said.</LD>
<LD>   Gabor's husband, Frederic von Anhalt, said the actress is "getting
better, she recovered a little last night. It's just that she's in so
much pain she doesn't respond to anything. Her eyes were open and she
was looking around, but couldn't speak beyond a whisper. She is
trying to talk but can't. She is whispering, but she is much, much
better."</LD>
<LD>   The hospital declined to elaborate on her condition.</LD>
<TE>   The 85-year-old film and television actress was the passenger in a
car that jumped a curb and slammed into a light pole Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to suffering broken bones, Gabor received stitches to
close wounds on her head, hands, arms and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Gabor was not wearing a seat belt, said Sheriff's Deputy Bruce
Thomas. The unidentified driver, who was wearing a seat belt,
suffered minor injuries and was treated at the scene, he said.</TE>

<HD>Shelters Expect Full Houses</HD>
<DH>Effects of the economic slump mean the need for refuge will
match or exceed last year's, officials predict.</DH>

<LD>As shelters for the homeless begin opening their doors for the winter
this weekend, several operators said they expect full houses again
this year.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure we're going to fill up immediately," said Denise Burton,
director of the First Step Shelter in South Los Angeles, which offers
80 beds.</LD>
<LD>   Like many shelters officially scheduled to open Sunday, First Step
will open ahead of schedule today because of the rain.</LD>
<TE>   Advocates for the homeless say they expect the need for refuge to
match or exceed last winter's, as the effects of the Sept. 11 tragedy
continue to be felt on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The need for homeless services always increases with the arrival
of cold weather, but this year it appears to be heightened by the
poor job market, said Ken Craft, director of the nonprofit San
Fernando Valley Rescue Mission in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spoken with so many people on the streets who maybe were
working at the airport or in the hotel industry and who have lost
their jobs," he said. "These are not the chronic homeless, what some
might call the hard-core homeless. These are the new homeless.
They've been evicted, they lost their homes, they're living in their
cars, and they don't want to be there."</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, two cold-weather shelters will open
Sunday to provide hot meals and a place to sleep on winter nights.</TE>
<TE>   A network of government-funded winter shelters in Los Angeles
County will be set up nightly from Sylmar to Culver City and remain
open until spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at capacity most of the time last year," said Joan
Thirkettle, director of community services for the Glendale YMCA,
which operates a shelter. "I think the demand will be very similar to
last year."</TE>
<TE>   At some shelters, in addition to meals and cots, visitors will be
offered assistance to get back on their feet. "We try to remove them
from the streets by offering referrals for counseling, health care,
housing and employment," Thirkettle said.</TE>
<TE>   Several studies have found that Los Angeles County has among the
highest numbers of homeless people, with at least 25,000, according
to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Information on the winter shelter program, including pickup
locations, may be obtained at (800) 548-6047.</TE>

<HD>Winner Claims Its Stakes</HD>
<DH>White Prefers to Do His Living in the Present and Below the
Radar</DH>

<LD>His is the lowest of USC's four Heisman Trophy winners' profiles.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Garrett stays in the news as USC's athletic director, Marcus
Allen can be seen on CBS and soon will be seen at the Pro Football
Hall of Fame, and O.J. Simpson ... well, you know.</LD>
<LD>   If Charles White's image is on screen these days, most likely it's
his reflection on his computer monitor in the USC Administrative
Information Services office.</LD>
<TE>   Let the glory go elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I've done and people know what I've done," said
White, the 1979 Heisman winner for a season of 2,050 yards rushing
and 19 touchdowns. "I'm not caught up in living in back in the day.
Football's been good to me. God has blessed me to accomplish the
things that I've accomplished. What I've accomplished is going to
live with me for the rest of my life. I did some good things.</TE>
<TE>   "If other people get the [attention], that's fine with me. I'm
happy with my life."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, memories can be unreliable. Ask White what he remembers
about the 1978 SC-Notre Dame game, when White scored a touchdown and
the Trojans held off a Joe Montana-led comeback to win, 27-25, their
10th victory on their way to a national championship. Doesn't ring a
bell.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even recall," he said. "Man, it's been so long ago."</TE>
<TE>   It's the 1977 game, when Notre Dame beat USC, 49-19, in South Bend
that sticks with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about the gold dome and everything," White said.
"You're kind of blown away by it. Come game day, they're out there
practicing. They've got their regular jersey on. You think it's going
to be a typical ballgame. Right before the game they come out with
the green jerseys and the dark cloud rolls in.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear, they brought this big wooden horse out. Leprechauns
jumping out everywhere. I was like, 'What is this?' "</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those moments that makes the rivalry so special.
This week, finally, it feels as if those days are back. Both teams
will be in the top 10 when they meet in the Coliseum today. Major
bowl bids are at stake. Three quarters of the country will be able to
watch on television. The legacy of the four Heismans versus the
legacy of the Four Horsemen.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for college football," White said. "College
football's been missing something like this for a long time. It's
awesome, from my perspective, to sit back and say, 'This is what
college football should be like.' "</TE>
<TE>   White's career peaked in college. He was drafted by the Cleveland
Browns, but gained only 942 yards in 276 carries during his five
years there. He spent the last four years of his career in Los
Angeles, and had a resurgence in 1987 when he was reunited with
college coach John Robinson and rushed for a league-leading 1,374
yards.</TE>
<TE>   White, 44, is at the stage where he can analyze his life with
objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   That phantom touchdown against Michigan in the 1979 Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearly a fumble," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His problems with drugs early in his NFL career?</TE>
<TE>   "Dumbness and stupidness and immaturity."</TE>
<TE>   He quit because he didn't want to set a bad example for his
children. He has five of them now, between the ages of 17 and 21.
Those college-age kids are his primary motivation to work: One more
year and he'll have the 15 years at USC required to get a tuition
break for his children. He might not need it for his son Ashton, a
running back at Santa Margarita High who is being recruited by Pete
Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the most literal application yet of Carroll's return
to the "family" concept that has made the ex-football players so
happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete is trying to bring back the heritage and the tradition of
guys coming back, which is a great plus for the young guys, I'm
sure," White said. "For the old guys too."</TE>
<TE>   White coached the running backs for Robinson during Robinson's
second go-round at USC from 1993-1997. He said Robinson had begun to
bring back former players as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Until ... he got the hammer," White said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of wishing [Garrett] would have [given Robinson] one
more year. We were just starting to get the type of players that we
were going to get this program back to where it should have been."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Robinson's staff was cut loose, which meant USC's first
Heisman winner fired USC's third Heisman winner.</TE>
<TE>   "That's business," White said. "John had told us before we got the
job, 'You've got to be prepared to get fired too.' "</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of working in the USC athletic department and on
the sidelines, White looked around the Web-dominated landscape and
decided he had better get tech savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way society's going," White said. "I might as well
get caught up in it and learn as much as I can. Whatever job I get
into, I'm going to be computer literate."</TE>
<TE>   So now he monitors the school's computer systems to make sure
they're functioning properly.</TE>
<TE>   And now that he's online, he might use e-mail to send in his
Heisman ballot. As a former winner, he gets a vote every year, and
he's already made his selection.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it might slide him down even more on the list of USC's
most famous award winners, he's going for Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's Heisman-worthy," White said.</TE>
<TE>   White, don't forget, would know.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento, Jackson Knock Out Clippers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It was close. Then it wasn't.</LD>
<LD>   Sacramento guard Bobby Jackson took the hopes and dreams of the
Clippers and torched them during one sensational burst of energy that
carried the Kings to a 107-94 victory Friday before an appreciative
sellout crowd of 17,317 at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   "Bobby, Bobby," the fans chanted as the Kings rocketed away.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers never knew what hit them after Keyon Dooling made a
jump shot that brought them within 70-63 with 2:15 left in the third
quarter. The Clippers had been running in place for most of the game
after Elton Brand got them off to a solid start by making his first
four shots and carrying them to a 12-8 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson made a three-point basket for a 73-63 lead for the Kings.
Brand countered with a layup and a free throw after Keon Clark hacked
him with 1:40 remaining in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Now it seemed the Clippers were ready to surge, as they did in the
fourth quarter and overtime of their 126-118 victory Thursday against
the New Jersey Nets at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Never happened. Jackson made another three-pointer, then another,
then followed with a sweeping reverse layup after accepting Doug
Christie's 40-foot bounce pass while in full stride.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, remarkably, the Kings were ahead by 81-66 with 27
seconds left in the quarter. A taut game had become a blowout in 90
seconds and the Kings were on their way to their ninth consecutive
victory over the Clippers at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jackson] was great," Coach Alvin Gentry said outside the Clipper
locker room. "He made tough shots with a hand in his face. He just
had one heck of a run."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brand, who led the Clippers with 25 points and 12 rebounds:
"We cut it to seven and it seemed like we had a chance, but Bobby
Jackson really took over."</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, Jackson scored a career-best 31 points on 12-for-17
shooting, including four-for-seven from behind the three-point arc.
Doug Christie added 25 points, giving Sacramento a 56-24 edge over
the Clippers' starting backcourt of Andre Miller and Eric Piatkowski.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, coming off a career-best 37 points against the Nets,
missed 11 of 14 shots and sprained his left ankle midway through the
third quarter. His status for Sunday's game against the Indiana
Pacers was termed day-to-day by trainer Jasen Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were without Mike Bibby, out because of a stress
fracture in his right foot. He's scheduled to undergo X-rays Monday
and if that goes well he'll be cleared to begin light running.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the Kings have only eight healthy bodies, four
bricks shy of the usual 12-man load.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Bibby, they also were without Peja Stojakovic
(foot), Hedo Turkoglu (wrist), Mateen Cleaves (foot) and Scot Pollard
(back). What's more, Chris Webber came down with flu-like symptoms
and wasn't effective early against Brand. Webber would score 16
points in 29 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not undermanned," Gentry insisted when it was suggested
that the Clippers weren't catching the Kings at their best. "They've
got Chris Webber, Bobby Jackson, Doug Christie and Vlade Divac.
They're not undermanned."</TE>

<LD>Seven teams and four individuals from the Southland are favored to
win titles at the state cross-country championships today at Woodward
Park in Fresno.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Loyola, the No. 11-ranked boys' team in the nation by
Harrier magazine, is favored to win its first Division I
championship.</LD>
<LD>   In other boys' races, Barstow is tabbed to win its second
consecutive Division III title, Oak Park is picked to win its first
Division IV championship and La Canada Flintridge Prep is favored to
win its third Division V title in five years.</LD>
<TE>   Hesperia Sultana and Murrieta Valley, the Nos. 3- and 11-ranked
girls' teams in the nation, are favored to win the Division II and I
titles, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Oak Park is picked to win its second consecutive
Division IV girls' championship.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Poe of Etiwanda, Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio Mesa, Mohamed
Trafeh of Duarte and Bessie Hatch of Ojai Thacher are the individual
favorites from the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Poe is tabbed to win the Division I boys' title with Reid picked
to win Division II and Trafeh favored to win Division IV. Hatch is
picked to win the Division V girls' championship.</TE>
<TE>   Trafeh and Hatch are favored, but Poe and Reid are expected to be
challenged. Poe, the Southern Section Division I champion, will face
competition from Kyle Alcorn of Clovis Buchanan and Manuel Ruiz of
North Hills Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn is the defending state track champion in the 3,200 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, the two-time defending City Section champion, is trying to
become the first runner from his section to win a state cross-country
title.</TE>
<TE>   Reid handed Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge his first loss of
the season in winning the Southern Section Division II title last
week. But Haddan, two-time defending champion Yong-Sung Leal of San
Lorenzo Arroyo and Troy Swier of Imperial Beach Mar Vista are also
viewed as potential winners of the Division II race today.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola had two runners among the top five finishers, and three
among the top 15, in the Division I boys' race of the Southern
Section championships. Yet the keys to the Cubs' runaway victory were
the performances of sophomore Matt Miller and senior Ryan Foresta,
their Nos. 4 and 5 runners.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola had a strong trio all season in sophomore Mark Matusak and
seniors David Torrence and Micah Tyhurst. But Coach Lalo Diaz figured
that Miller and Foresta needed to reduce the time gap between
themselves and Loyola's top three runners for the Cubs to win their
first title since moving to the Division I level in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it wasn't about our one, two and three runners," Diaz
said. "It was about our four and five."</TE>
<TE>   Matusak placed second in 15:07, Torrence finished fifth in 15:11
and Tyhurst was 15th in 15:26 for Loyola. But it was the performance

<LD>Observers of Serra League games this season have grown accustomed to
the notion that anything is possible, but nobody could have seen this
coming.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Loyola, which stumbled to a fourth-place finish in the
Serra League, used a dominating defense to stifle league champion and
No. 3-seeded Bellflower St. John Bosco, 38-8, in a Southern Section
Division I quarterfinal Friday night at Glendale High.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola, which has won four major division championships and been
to the finals 10 times, will face Los Alamitos in a semifinal on Dec.
7 at Edison Field in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "We finally played a complete game," Loyola Coach Steve Grady
said. "I told our offensive coordinator that we would need 28 points
to win this, but I never imagined our defense would hold them to
eight."</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco, which averaged 28.7 points in its first 11 games,
had only 167 yards and six first downs Friday. St. John Bosco, which
trailed 17-0 at halftime, had 37 yards and no first downs in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stark contrast to the league meeting between these teams,
when St. John Bosco (9-3) held Loyola to 18 yards in the first half
and won, 24-13.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (9-3) forced a fumble and Quintin Daniels had two
interceptions for the Cubs. Loyola turned the three turnovers into 17
points.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco's leading receiver Joe Cowan had one catch -- a
five-yard out with 4:53 to play. Other than a short gain on a screen
pass that was called back because of a penalty, it was the only time
Cowan touched the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Bo Renaud led the Loyola offense with 159 yards and three
touchdowns in 45 carries. Quarterback Scott Deke completed seven of
13 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown. His 53-yards scoring strike
to Daniels gave Loyola a 38-8 lead with 6:23 left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels finished with four catches for 107 yards. Derrick Williams
had 90 yards in 12 carries for St. John Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>

<TE>   Long Beach Poly 43, Rialto Eisenhower 3 -- Junior wide receiver
Derrick Jones caught touchdown passes of 41, 62 and 77 yards in the
first half and the Jackrabbits routed the Eagles in a quarterfinal at
Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Poly (11-1) took a 28-3 lead by halftime on the strength of those
touchdown plays. Jones finished with four receptions for 229 yards,
all in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbit defense held Eisenhower (7-5) to 90 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were playing without Coach Glenn Thompkins, who is on
paid administrative leave after his arrest on suspicion of having sex
with a 17-year-old female student.</TE>
<TE>   The game was stopped with 5:20 left in the third quarter when Poly
receiver Khalid Abdur-Rahim was injured on a tackle along the right
sideline. Abdur-Rahim was motionless for 10 minutes before being
carried off the field on a stretcher. He was taken to Long Beach
Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Poly athletic trainer Rob Shock said that Abdur-Rahim reported
numbness on his left side but could move his arms and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Leon Jackson completed seven of 15 passes for 289
yards and the three touchdowns. Running back Lorenzo Bursey rushed
for 104 yards and a touchdown in 15 carries for the Jackrabbits, who
play Mater Dei in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 30, Anaheim Esperanza 12 -- The Monarchs took
advantage of five Esperanza turnovers and won the quarterfinal at Cal
State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei (9-3) blew the game open by scoring three consecutive
second-half touchdowns following turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei played without running back Rafael Rice, who rushed for
a team-high 930 yards and 18 touchdowns in 11 games this season, but
reinjured his back last week against Redlands East Valley and was
unable to play.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael's brother, Cortez, quarterback Jason Forcier and reserve
running back John Martinez picked up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez rushed for 67 yards and two touchdowns, Forcier rushed for
92 yards and Martinez rushed for 99 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Weiner missed a 30-yard field goal on Esperanza's opening
possession of the game, then had his extra-point attempt blocked
after he caught a 13-yard touchdown pass on the opening play of the
second half to cut the lead to 9-6.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza's loss ended the 27-year coaching career of Gary Meek,
who will step down to become the school's athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza finished the season with a 10-2 record.</TE>

<LD>With its starting quarterback unable to play because of a shoulder
injury, Mission Viejo turned to its super sub, Marty Tadman, who
responded with three touchdown passes in the Diablos' 48-14 victory
over Canyon Country Canyon on Friday night in a Southern Section
Division III quarterfinal playoff game at Canyon Country.</LD>
<LD>   Tadman, who is more mobile than starter Josh Rodarmel, completed
nine of 13 passes for 148 yards and also rushed for 43 yards to help
top-seeded Mission Viejo (12-0) win its 26th consecutive game.</LD>
<LD>   "He's just an unbelievable athlete for us," Coach Bob Johnson said
of Tadman. "He just wants the ball in his hands, and that's a great
gift for a quarterback."</LD>
<TE>   Tadman guided the Diablos to four consecutive victories when
Rodarmel broke his collarbone earlier this season. Rodarmel is still
a week away from being available, but Tadman doesn't mind filling in.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels awesome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tadman had plenty of help. Ryan Holmes scored three touchdowns and
rushed for 150 yards in 16 carries. Defensive end Justin Williams had
four of his team's six sacks. And 6-foot-5, 285-pound offensive
tackle Drew Radovich was a man among boys, clearing the way for
Mission Viejo backs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to play on Sundays," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said of
Radovich.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon (10-2) tied the score at 7-7 with five minutes left in the
second quarter on a three-yard touchdown pass from Nate Longshore to
Louis Montano.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo, ranked No. 2 by The Times, scored the next four
touchdowns to break the game open.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore, a junior quarterback, finished 17 of 30 for 180 yards.
He ended the season with 2,088 yards passing, the first time since
1988 a Canyon quarterback has surpassed the 2,000-yard mark.</TE>

<TE>   Newhall Hart 48, Chino Hills Ayala 16 -- The rain did little to
stop the Indians' passing game, or rushing game, in a quarterfinal at
Ayala.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Hart (11-0-1) rolled up 547 yards of offense,
including 284 on the ground, and Paxton Howard rushed for two
first-half touchdowns. Sean Norton completed seven of his nine
first-half passes for 103 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 4-ranked Indians scored two touchdowns on back-to-back
possessions to make the score 34-3 with four minutes left in the
third quarter before Ayala could get its offense going.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs scored their first touchdown on Nathan Davenport's
29-yard catch-and-run.</TE>
<TE>   Hart plays No. 18 San Clemente, a 13-9 winner over No. 9 Chino, in
a semifinal on Friday.</TE>

<TE>   Claremont 35, La Verne Damien 27 -- The Wolfpack held Damien four
times on their two-yard line in the game's final seconds to preserve
a quarterfinal victory at Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by eight points, Damien took possession at its 18-yard
line with 2:28 left. In 11 plays, the Spartans drove 80 yards to
Claremont's two -- aided by a 44-yard pass play from Nick Davila to
Freddie Brown Jr. on fourth and 16 -- with 22 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   But Davila threw three incomple passes and Jon McConnell and Andre
Green stuffed Daniel Venti at the one on the final play of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Claremont (9-2) plays top-seeded Mission Viejo in a semifinal on
Dec. 7.</TE>

<LD>Daniel Dixon rushed for 224 yards and three touchdowns to lead Orange
El Modena to a 24-0 upset of top-seeded Orange Lutheran in a Southern
Section Division VI quarterfinal Friday at El Modena.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon's first two touchdowns came on sweeps around the left side.
The first was good for 79 yards and a 10-0 lead with 7:23 left in the
third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Dixon scored again, from 39 yards, with 8:27 left to play to put
the Vanguards ahead, 17-0. His final score was a two-yard dive up the
middle with 1:37 left.</LD>
<TE>   Dixon has rushed for 2,396 yards and scored 35 touchdowns this
season for El Modena (9-3), which finished tied for first in the
Century League and has won six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Vanguards will meet former league rival Santa Ana Foothill in
a semifinal on Friday. In a nonleague game in Week 4, Foothill beat
El Modena, 28-24.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon's long runs were quite a contrast to El Modena's first-half
scoring drive. The Vanguards took 25 plays and 13 minutes 58 seconds
to go 91 yards, culminated with a 27-yard field goal by Steven
Sanada.</TE>
<TE>   Dominic Robinson had two interceptions for El Modena, which held
Orange Lutheran, ranked No. 23 by The Times, to 110 yards passing and
68 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended a winning streak at nine for the Lancers (9-3), who
moved up from Division XI this season.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Ana Foothill 35, La Mirada 21 -- Twice Mike Liti walked off
the field with a shoulder injury, but he kept coming back and kept
driving that shoulder right into the La Mirada defense.</TE>
<TE>   Liti scored three touchdowns for the third-seeded Knights in a
quarterfinal victory at La Mirada.</TE>
<TE>   Liti rushed 22 times for 182 yards and scored on runs of 70, 59
and 27 yards. His performance helped lift Foothill (10-2) to its
first semifinal since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, when Liti broke his second long one, that was
the first nail in the coffin," said Foothill Coach Doug Case, who
watched Liti break four tackles en route to giving the Knights a
23-14 lead with 3:40 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada (8-3), trying to reach the semifinals for the 11th time

<HD>No Drop-Off</HD>
<DH>Los Alamitos makes sure it remains in good hands with its
talented receiving corps</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a simple credo. At pass-happy Los Alamitos High, it's as
sensible as calling a pass play on third and 13.</LD>
<LD>   It goes like this: If you drop the ball as a receiver, you won't
play. You might as well turn in your jersey and equipment. Or, at the
very least, switch positions. Or sports.</LD>
<LD>   Los Alamitos has qualified for the playoffs 19 consecutive seasons
without the help of a wild-card berth, the longest such streak in
Southern Section Division I football, and it isn't because its
receivers have cement hands.</LD>
<TE>   Before Friday, senior Brandon Tripp had dropped one ball in a game
-- when he was a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jeremy Childs, who looks like the next great receiver in
a long line at Los Alamitos, knows what happens when a ball is
dropped in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five push-ups on your fingertips," Childs said, shaking
his head slowly. "Our coaches demand perfection."</TE>
<TE>   Perfection is what Los Alamitos coaches usually get from their
receivers. In all likelihood, this will be the 18th consecutive
season that a Griffin receiver has been selected to an All-Southern
Section team. In the last 10 years, Brad Melsby went to UCLA, Tyler
Cashman to USC, Keenan Howry and Tony Hartley to Oregon. Childs is
destined for a scholarship. Tripp could also get one, if he wasn't
already fielding scholarship offers for baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The success can be traced to Coach John Barnes' run-and-shoot
system, in which precise route-running and flawless catching
techniques are stressed over and over. Catch the ball away from the
body, with your hands. Don't try to catch it against your body
because it will bang off your shoulder pads.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what, don't drop it.</TE>
<TE>   Even in adverse conditions, like the heavy rains Los Alamitos
experienced Friday during its Division I quarterfinal game at La
Puente Bishop Amat, the Griffins manage to pass enough to keep an
opponent off balance.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat and the weather conditions limited Jeff Kline to 110
yards passing, but the Griffins (11-0-1) still did enough to defeat
the Lancers, 30-24. Los Alamitos will play Loyola in a semifinal next
Saturday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Lining up in the shotgun set on every play, Kline ran 17 times for
73 yards and also completed 10 of 21 passes, including a 21-yard
scoring pass to Childs early in the second half that tied the score,
21-21. Los Alamitos also got 125 yards and three touchdowns rushing
from Ryan Bagley.</TE>
<TE>   Like the weather, the night wasn't perfect, though. There was a
dropped pass -- the second of Tripp's career.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos coaches greet dropped passes with the same contempt
as they might welcome their defense to the sideline right after an
opponent scored on a triple-reverse pitch pass.</TE>
<TE>   "To drop balls here is totally unacceptable," said Thadd MacNeal,
the Griffins' fifth-year receivers coach. .</TE>
<TE>   Howry, who had 73 catches and 21 touchdowns as a senior at Los
Alamitos in 1998, still winces when asked about dropping passes.</TE>
<TE>   "A dropped pass to us was pretty much a fumble or a three-yard
loss on a run," Howry said. "You just didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos coaches make sure of it.</TE>
<TE>   There are "bad ball" drills, with passes purposely under-thrown,
overthrown and thrown behind a receiver. There are also "distraction"
drills, with a defensive player jumping in front of a receiver to
disrupt concentration, and "individual rapid-fire drills," where two
quarterbacks take turns firing at a stationary receiver, who catches
the ball, drops it to the side and prepares for another throw.</TE>
<TE>   During a "machine gun" drill at practice Wednesday this week, Los
Alamitos assistant coach Gene Vollnogle gestured toward the organized
chaos. Two quarterbacks were firing passes at receivers running
routes, then another two quarterbacks stepped in and fired away at
two other receivers. It was nonstop. No time to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "We do more passing in that 10-15 minutes than most teams do in
two weeks," Vollnogle said. "And we'll do more. We're always throwing
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The goal for Los Alamitos receivers is to catch 100 balls a day.
It starts before practice, with players throwing the ball back and
forth before stretching. Then there's a seven-on-seven passing drill.
Then the same seven-man drill without a defense, passing "against
air," coaches call it. Then the machine-gun drill.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just catching and route-running. Los Alamitos receivers
also must block, or face a fine.</TE>
<TE>   When watching game film, Los Alamitos coaches expect to see
defensive backs driven out of the picture on running plays. Receivers
that miss a block must fork over a dollar. Whoever has the least
drops at the end of the year gets the poor-blocking pool payoff, now
at $24. Tripp is currently winning.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Alamitos football is mostly about the pass and catch.</TE>
<TE>   Howry holds the Oregon record with 168 receptions and is second
with 2,648 yards receiving, 96 behind Hartley, who played at Los
Alamitos from 1993-96.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, in his 24th year at Los Alamitos, installed the offense in
1991. The results have been astounding, helping Barnes, 53, reach 217
victories, the most by a coach in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a quarterback and receiver heaven," said Barnes, a former
quarterback at Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   If current players need a reminder, framed photos of All-Southern
Section players at Los Alamitos are hung from the walls of the
coaches' office.</TE>
<TE>   It's an inspiration, sometimes an overwhelming one for Tripp, who
has been offered a baseball scholarship by Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely get nervous when I walk in that room," Tripp said.
"It's intimidating to go in there and see all the great players. I
hope my photo is up there someday too."</TE>
<TE>   Tripp and Barnes are on their way.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp, 6 feet 2 and 205 pounds, has 64 catches for 714 yards and
five touchdowns. Childs, 6-1 and 175 pounds, has 63 catches for 915
yards and eight touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's game, one of few in recent history when the Los
Alamitos passing attack didn't light up the sky, Childs was not
concerned with his lower than average personal statistics of three
catches for 40 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, Tripp, everybody, it's all about the 'W' and making the trip
to Edison Field," Childs said. "All that matters is the win."</TE>

<HD>This Tie Looks Good to Both</HD>
<DH>The Kings and Ducks each can take a measure of satisfaction
from a 2-2 draw that keeps them even in the standings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was happy news all over the Arrowhead Pond, which sounded like
home not only to the Ducks but the Kings. Everyone came out a winner,
or at least walked away with a parting gift, Friday.</LD>
<LD>   One point.</LD>
<LD>   A 2-2 tie was little more than a push for two teams in a three-way
tie for seventh in the Western Conference. As at any good carnival,
no one walked away a loser.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings, playing with a roster heavy with minor league call-ups,
took the fight to the Ducks from the start, pleasing the thousands of
King fans among the announced 17,174 -- officially a sellout with
plenty of empty seats.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have had to play the extra five minutes six of the
last nine games, didn't lose in overtime. They didn't blow a two-goal
lead late to settle for a tie. This was progress.</TE>
<TE>   "These overtime games are starting to add up a little, too much
actually," Duck center Steve Rucchin said. "When you look at all the
one-goal losses we had last season, it shows we're a better team now.
It's a little step."</TE>
<TE>   A step during a game in which there were some minor leaps forward.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings got a goal from Bryan Smolinski, his first in nine games
and second in the last 16. Steve Heinze, recycled from minor league
Manchester, had a key assist to set up Eric Belanger's third-period
goal. The two goals were enough to extend the Kings' unbeaten streak
to eight games (6-0-2) against the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the determination," King Coach Andy Murray said. "We kept
our focus to get the point. And this was a road game no matter what
it sounded like in the building."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, meanwhile, could revel in the extra revenue brought in
by the Kings' fans.</TE>
<TE>   They also got a brilliant moment from rookie Stanislav Chistov,
who outworked three King players in a sequence that led to Keith
Carney's game-tying goal 3 minutes 28 seconds into the third period.
The Ducks neither bobbled a two-goal lead in the third period, as
they did in their previous two games, nor lost in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   This time they had to rally after Heinze became the Miracle from
Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   No one expected to see him back with the Kings, yet he took
advantage of Duck confusion behind the net. Heinze ended up with the
puck behind the net and centered to Belanger, whose one-timer gave
the Kings a 2-1 lead 33 seconds into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, disappointing after signing a three-year, $6-million
contract in the summer of 2001, was left exposed for the waiver draft
before the season. He went unclaimed and was shipped to Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Kings went through triage this week, he was brought
back, along with Jason Holland and Kip Brennan. With Jason Allison,
Adam Deadmarsh, Lubomir Visnovsky and Ian Laperriere all out with
injuries, the Kings were left with a lineup that was more "Who's
That?" than "Who's Who."</TE>
<TE>   "We're in survival mode," King defenseman Mattias Norstrom said.
"That's kind of the hockey we have been playing the last few weeks.
We got a lot of guys missing, but we have been playing pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov got the Ducks even three minutes later. He toyed with King
defensemen for several seconds, then came from behind the net for a
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Jamie Storr made the save, but Chistov lunged and tapped
the rebound in front of the net, where Carney was able to chip a shot
in.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we responded very well, considering the last two games
we kind of caved in the third period," Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks did their collapsing early Friday, as an innocent play
behind their net led to the Kings' first goal.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere retrieved the puck behind the net as the Kings' Erik
Rasmussen went past defenseman Niclas Havelid and zeroed in.
Rasmussen ended up with the puck and centered to Smolinski, who may
not get an easier goal this season. That gave the Kings a 1-0 lead
just 2:52 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a misunderstanding," Havelid said. "I was yelling to
Jiggers to play it. He heard me too late, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   But Smolinski giveth and Smolinski taketh away, with Havelid
benefiting.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski was about to be called for a penalty, but before the
officials could stop play, the Ducks raced up ice. Marc Chouinard
crossed the blue line, then made a no-look backhand pass to Havelid,
who blistered a shot past Storr.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Avert Core Meltdown</HD>
<DH>With Horry hurt, other key players tired, Bryant and O'Neal
lead 112-106 overtime win at Memphis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The Lakers arrived in the fourth quarter and then overtime Friday
night, in their third town in four nights, the weight of their recent
failures gathering in expressions of weariness on their familiar
faces.</LD>
<LD>   Behind by a point, their bench having given them almost nothing in
the way of offense, Robert Horry having sat on the bench after the
national anthem and never having budged, the Lakers again had no
choice but the predictable.</LD>
<LD>   They cleared out for Kobe Bryant. They threw entry passes to
Shaquille O'Neal. They defended the Memphis Grizzlies, energized by
their proximity to -- and the vulnerability of -- the Lakers,
sometimes rigorously, sometimes not.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers won, 112-106, in overtime at the Pyramid, with Jerry
West amid the sellout crowd, at the end of another difficult day
spent searching for their usual game.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 45 points in 48 minutes, two nights after scoring 38
points in his Orlando shootout with Tracy McGrady, the last two
Friday on a flying, 360-degree dunk in front of Jason Williams. Then
he winked at a little girl wearing a Grizzly jersey in the front row,
and she smiled back in spite of herself. O'Neal had 33 points and 13
rebounds in 43 minutes, all highs since returning five games ago
after foot surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," O'Neal said about the gradual return to something
familiar. "Almost. A couple games, a couple weeks. I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   They won once in three games on the trip and are 6-11 overall, 3-2
with O'Neal. At this time last year, seemingly a different team ago
and on the way to 58 wins, they were 16-1.</TE>
<TE>   They won finally in three games when Rick Fox made two jumpers
early in overtime, and Bryant scored six of their final 10 points,
and the Grizzlies missed five of seven shots.</TE>
<TE>   "The core of this team, I wouldn't say we're weary exactly, but
we're being tested in areas of health and fatigue," Fox said. "We've
got to get stronger physically and push through it."</TE>
<TE>   It was another of those road affairs for the Lakers, who won for
the first time in eight games on the road, and for the first time
away from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The people screamed "Beat L.A." and Hubie Brown turned all shades
of red on the Memphis sideline, and then they all screamed
"Dee-fense" and watched the Grizzlies score six consecutive points to
go from 97-92 down to 98-97 up as the seconds streamed away.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the Grizzly point guard, made two three-pointers in the
final minute of regulation, the second with 14 seconds left. O'Neal
was fouled with 11.3 seconds remaining and after he swished the first
free-throw attempt, he sent the second long, leaving the score tied,
98-98.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies had a chance to go ahead, but Drew Gooden, their
rookie, was two feet long on a 20-footer from the left corner. Bryant
missed a long shot at the buzzer, sending the Laker road trip into
one more period.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't seem like anything went right for us down the stretch,"
Coach Phil Jackson said. "[But] we're happy to get a win. It didn't
matter to us."</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who after Wednesday's loss in Orlando said his feet felt
"terrible," did not play. Asked if he would play Sunday against
Minnesota, Horry said, "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Slava Medvedenko started and had a difficult time defending
Gooden, but these are not times for the Lakers to be choosy.
Medvedenko played 29 minutes. Mark Madsen played 32. And the Lakers
leaned hard on Bryant, who took 35 shots and made 18. In the fourth
quarter, when the Lakers came from three points down against a team
that only two weeks ago had lost 13 consecutive games, Bryant scored
12 points and O'Neal scored seven.</TE>
<TE>   And, while Jackson sat Bryant in the fourth quarter after he
believed Bryant had forced a shot or two, it was barely two minutes
before he waved him back in.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the process of getting better as a ballclub," Bryant
said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   It is a process, for sure. They could get forward Devean George
back Sunday, but might lose Horry for a couple of games. The injured
and mending are scattered like wadded tape in the locker room, and
they can't get a cheap, easy win anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   So, they took the win and tried not to mull the alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh and three?" Bryant said on his way out. "Naw. That's not the
look, man."</TE>

<LD>On the first business day after Courtney Kupets and Ashley Postell of
the U.S. had won gold medals at the World Gymnastics Championships,
organizers of next year's event -- to be held in Anaheim from Aug.
13-24 -- began reaping dividends.</LD>
<LD>   "Thousands of dollars of orders for tickets were coming in via fax
and e-mail," said Tim Ryan, general manager of the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   The 2003 championships had generated more than $800,000 in ticket
sales before Kupets triumphed on the uneven bars, Postell prevailed
on the balance beam and Samantha Sheehan won bronze in floor exercise
last week in Debrecen, Hungary. But Ryan said the prospect of seeing
U.S. men and women do well at next year's meet, which is the Olympic
qualifier, is bound to enhance its national appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "We were right in line with our first-year goals for tickets, and
everybody on the entire organizing committee was thrilled," said
Ryan, who projected an economic effect of $30 million to $50 million.
"Then we got the news the U.S. was bringing back three medals from
Hungary and we were even more thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   In Debrecen, 289 athletes from 54 countries competed for
individual apparatus titles. Team and all-around titles will also be
at stake in 2003. Mike Milidonis, managing director of the
competition, said 650 athletes from 70 countries and up to 1,400
delegation officials, coaches and judges were expected in Anaheim.
Eight teams plan to arrive a week before official training begins and
will practice in local gyms, perhaps inspiring future Olympians.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the legacies an event like this leaves," Milidonis
said. "Two, three years from now, kids can say, 'I remember Andreea
Raducan from Romania working out in our gym and I got her autograph
on my T-shirt.' "</TE>
<TE>   The executive committee of FIG, gymnastics' international
governing body, and men's and women's technical committees will visit
Anaheim in February to inspect the venues. The Pond's capacity will
be reduced to about 13,000 to accommodate press seating and technical
operations, and warmup gyms will be built outside the arena. The
Anaheim Convention Center will be outfitted with eight practice gyms
with equipment identical to that used in competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we have a pretty good pulse on where we stand in the
international community," Ryan said. "The key is to make sure not
only everybody in the U.S. is aware of the magnitude of the event,
but everybody in the world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Going for Gold</TE>
<TE>   Kupets, Postell and Sheehan made strong impressions in their World
Championship debuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably their names are completely unknown for major people, but
our approach is, we take the people who are best prepared at the
time," U.S. women's coach Martha Karolyi said. "Some of the older
gymnasts who had competed at other World Championships had small
injuries and were not in very top shape. I anticipated a good
showing, but I never like to anticipate medals."</TE>
<TE>   The girls' success is a good omen for next year at Anaheim,
although Karolyi said she cautioned them, "The better you are, the
more is expected of you."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "At this point, I am really able to say we have the
most depth in the U.S. than any country in the world. Our goal is to
compete equal with the gymnastics [powers], Russia, Romania and
China. I think it's possible to be at the highest level of the
podium. This world championship was a steppingstone on our way to
achieving our goal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Down, but Not Out</TE>
<TE>   Donna Mayhew isn't seeking pity.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel blessed," said Mayhew, a two-time U.S. Olympic javelin
thrower and La Crescenta resident. "There's stuff I can still do; I
just can't do what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to resume an active life, free of the injuries that are
a residue of the years she devoted to her sport.</TE>
<TE>   Mayhew, who finished seventh at the 1988 Games and 12th in 1992,
had hip problems for years but lost her medical insurance in 1999
when she lost her job as a personal trainer.</TE>
<TE>   She had hip replacement surgery 11 weeks ago, after the surgeon
and anesthesiologist had agreed to reduce their fees; she applied for
aid from Medi-Cal but hasn't yet pierced the bureaucratic thicket.
The hospital bill alone was more than $43,000 and she had to quit her
physical therapy regimen and move in with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't have enough money to do the rest of the therapy,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   While she was competing, she had elite athlete insurance through
the U.S. Olympic Committee, but said she was told it didn't pay for
sports-related injuries. She also said her osteoarthritis, brought on
by wear and tear, was deemed a progressive disease, not an injury.
The Olympic Alumni Assn. offered her up to $1,000 "if you jump
through all those hoops and fill out all the forms. I didn't even
bother."</TE>
<TE>   Mayhew said she's walking better than before the surgery but still
can't run, which ended her chances of working for the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department or Park Rangers. She's interviewing for other
jobs and hoping for the best.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still blessed," she said. "I have to admit, there's a lot of
people worse off."</TE>
<TE>   She deserves better, as do other Olympians who didn't win medals
but gave no less effort than those who triumphed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Nagano figure skating gold medalist Tara Lipinski, who had hip
surgery two years ago, pulled out of the Stars on Ice tour because of
recurring hip woes. Scott Hamilton joined the cast.... Amber Corwin
of Hermosa Beach is seventh after the short program at the NHK Trophy
event in Japan, the last in figure skating's Grand Prix series.</TE>
<TE>   A new starting-order rule took effect in World Cup Alpine skiing
this weekend. To create more suspense, the top-ranked skiers start
later in super-giant slalom races, although the course usually
deteriorates by then. In downhill, the last training run will set the
start order, with the slowest going first on race day.</TE>
<TE>   Most tickets for events at the Athens Summer Games will cost $30
or less, in an effort to attract low-salaried Greek workers. Tickets
will go on public sale May 12.</TE>

<HD>Woods Goes to Great Lengths</HD>
<DH>As the Skins Game begins today, golf's No. 1 player
continues his meticulous search for the right driver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>It might be the most intimidating sight in golf ... Tiger Woods with
a driver in his hand. And although he might be the most dangerous
competitor -- combining distance and accuracy -- that professional
golf has ever experienced, Woods is taking steps to get a little
scarier.</LD>
<LD>   If that's possible, said Fred Couples.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the best driver of the ball we have," Couples said. "He's
also the best long-iron player, the best middle-iron player and he's
got the best short game when he's on."</LD>
<TE>   Even though Tiger may be most powerful when he is holding a
driver, we have discovered that he hasn't had the same one in his
hands very often. Woods is engaged in an unusually long and intricate
campaign to test drivers and find the one he wants to play.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 months since the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach tournament, Woods has
played 173 drivers, by conservative estimate, as he tries to find the
perfect one.</TE>
<TE>   When the Skins Game begins here today at Landmark Golf Club, Woods
will continue testing Nike prototype forged titanium head drivers
that are continually being tweaked to provide the No. 1 player the
exact action he requires off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty close," said Woods, who is testing one with a
slightly shallower face. And, after testing graphite shafts with
longer lengths, Woods is back to his familiar steel shaft and length
of 43 1/2inches.</TE>
<TE>   "I might be hitting the ball just a little too high now, but I
thoroughly enjoy being able to work the ball again, left to right and
right to left, so maybe I need one with a ball flight just a touch
flatter."</TE>
<TE>   So the process continues, trying to match Woods with his driver, a
multimillion-dollar game for fledgling golf club manufacturer Nike,
which has made Woods the linchpin of its campaign to sell drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it's taken about 15 dozen drivers so far to try to find
the right one for Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Couples was floored by the number.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time I used to change was when the head cracked," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nike is determined to match Woods with the club in his hands
at the place where his game begins, the tee. Woods ranked sixth in
driving distance in 2002, averaging 293.3 yards, and he was 11th in
total driving, a combination of distance and accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tom Stites, lead engineer at Nike, Woods complicates
the project because he likes to hit so many kinds of shots with his
driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything imaginable," Stites said. "He's just one of those
guys, like Arnold or Nicklaus, who's never going to be satisfied.
That's what's cool about working with him."</TE>
<TE>   Most players hit the ball farther last year, mainly because of
improvements in equipment. Like everyone else, Woods wants distance
and is able to achieve as much as anyone else with the speed of his
swing and his ability. But he has high demands for his equipment as
well.</TE>
<TE>   A deep-faced driver with a large club head that still conforms to
U.S. Golf Assn. rules provides several places to launch the ball to
fly farther. At the same time, Woods is also a control player, using
spin to help him hit a draw or fade. Tests have shown that a club
with a slightly smaller head can increase spin.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is finding the right combination.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds complicated, it is, but Stites knows he's on the
right track when he hears Woods make contact with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a Stradivarius," he said. "Put it in some other
people's hands, it sounds like a different instrument."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson, who joins Woods, Couples and Mark O'Meara in the
Skins Game, is also making some changes in his driver. He's playing a
different version of his Titleist 983 with a new shaft, designed to
hit the ball higher.</TE>
<TE>   But Woods is the only one still testing prototypes, with none of
the standard artwork on the sole plate. Tests have shown he could
average an additional eight yards in distance with every half-inch
increase in the length of the shaft of his club, but Stites says
Woods is comfortable at 43 1/2inches, 1 1/2inches shorter than the
average on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   The process isn't done yet, as we have seen. At the Tour
Championship a month ago, Woods missed 14 fairways on the last day.
This week at the PGA Grand Slam, Woods had a round of 61 and won the
special event by 14 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever driver Woods was using, he played it well enough to win
five PGA Tour events, among them the Masters and the U.S. Open, and
to win $6.9 million in prize money. In 2003, he might not even hit a
prototype anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the driver goes, you'll see some rotation in what he
uses from now until next season starts," Stites said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said the time is coming when he'll find a prototype he
likes. Maybe when he hits the 200 mark.</TE>

<LD>Carson Palmer's first impression of the USC-Notre Dame rivalry
remains vivid.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer was at the Coliseum in 1996, a high school quarterback
thinking about his future, when USC defeated the Fighting Irish in
overtime.</LD>
<LD>   "The Coliseum erupted," Palmer said. "It was an amazing event to
be a part of."</LD>
<TE>   Palmer, USC's fifth-year senior quarterback, is hoping to set off
a similar celebration tonight when the sixth-ranked Trojans play
seventh-ranked Notre Dame in a game that carries bowl championship
series implications for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   USC (9-2) has clinched a share of the Pacific 10 Conference
championship, and can win the title outright and play in the Rose
Bowl if UCLA defeats ninth-ranked Washington State next week.
Regardless of that outcome, a victory over Notre Dame would position
the Trojans for a possible at-large berth in the Orange Bowl or Sugar
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame (10-1), under first-year Coach Tyrone Willingham, also
is in the running for a berth in the Orange or Sugar bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC players, however, say they are not considering anything beyond
the outcome of today's game. They are determined to put the finishing
touch on what could be the Trojans' first 10-victory regular season
since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors know this is our last game at the Coliseum and we
want to end our careers there on a high note," linebacker Mike
Pollard said. "The only thing we're thinking about is beating Notre
Dame."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which has not committed a turnover in its last two games,
extended its winning streak to six games by routing UCLA last week,
52-21. To win seven in a row, keep second-year Coach Pete Carroll
unbeaten in November and extend their home winning streak to nine
games, the Trojans must overcome Notre Dame and recent history.</TE>
<TE>   Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * The Trojans have not defeated the Fighting Irish, or any team
ranked in the top 10, since shutting out Notre Dame, 10-0, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   * They have not defeated UCLA and Notre Dame in the same season
since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   * They have not defeated their two rivals in consecutive games
since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   * They have not defeated a team coached by Willingham since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We've turned around a couple losing streaks this year, beating
Oregon and Stanford, so we're not worried," senior wide receiver
Kareem Kelly said. "If we play our game and don't make mistakes, we
know we're going to have a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who became the Pac-10's all-time passing yardage leader
last week, has completed 62.1% of his passes for 3,214 yards and 28
touchdowns with only eight interceptions in 412 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious to anyone that is following SC football, he is
playing the best football of his career," Willingham said. "Most
would probably say as well as any quarterback that may have ever
played there."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame ranks fifth in the nation in total defense and second
in pass-efficiency defense.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham-coached teams also have a history of success against
Palmer. In three games against Stanford, Palmer threw one touchdown
pass and five interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmer said Notre Dame would not benefit from films of his
performances against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching film from last year's game and I was like, 'Wow,
we were a different team back then,' " Palmer said. "We've changed so
much and gotten so much better than last year."</TE>
<TE>   So has Notre Dame since Willingham replaced Bob Davie last Dec.
31.</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish shut out Maryland in their opener, 22-0, and
were unbeaten after eight games before Boston College upset them at
South Bend. Ind., 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame hung on for a 30-23 victory over Navy and shut out
Rutgers last week, 42-0.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carlyle Holiday has passed for 542 yards and five
touchdowns in the last two games, but the Fighting Irish are a
run-oriented team. Ryan Grant has rushed for 1,001 yards and scored
nine touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team that will overpower you if you allow them to do
that, run the ball down your throat," Carroll said. "Very few teams
that we have played in the last six or seven weeks have had the
ability to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's victory over Rutgers was its first in convincing
fashion since a 31-7 victory over Stanford on Oct. 5. The Fighting
Irish are 6-1 in games decided by eight points or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   USC, meanwhile, has not played a close game since defeating
California, 30-28, on Oct. 12. The Trojans' average margin of victory
over their last five opponents is 23 points, and it would have been
greater if not for late touchdowns by Oregon and UCLA against USC
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "This could end up being a very defensive, low-scoring game,"
Carroll said. "I'm comfortable with that. That's the kind of game
that I know better than the other end of it. That's why the turnovers
and not making the critical mistakes are so fundamental to how we
play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this could be one of those games."</TE>

<LD>Edgar P. "Ed" Beardsley, 61, who was credited with founding a Little
League division for children with disabilities, died Tuesday at a
hospital in Bristol, Conn. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Rutland, Vt., Beardsley graduated from the University of
Hartford with a degree in accounting. He lived in the Bristol area
most of his adult life and worked as a self-employed accountant.</LD>
<LD>   In 1986, Beardsley began playing ball with his 8-year-old son
David and four other disabled children. Word spread about what he was
doing, and within three years, mentors were doing the same in other
states.</LD>
<TE>   Little League officials took on the idea in 1989, and made it the
Challenger Division. Today, more than 20,000 disabled athletes are in
the program nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Beardsley later started a basketball program for children with
disabilities.</TE>

<HD>Cathedral's Textile Lab Finds Mission Close to Home</HD>
<DH>St. John the Divine's conservation laboratory seeks to
stabilize two tapestries badly damaged in a fire that began in its
gift shop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the hushed Textile Conservation Laboratory at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine, workers spend the day bending over centuries-old
tapestries and carpets from collections nationwide, carefully
analyzing fiber, cleaning and rewarping.</LD>
<LD>   They never expected one of their greatest challenges to come from
home.</LD>
<LD>   "It was shocking," said Marlene Eidelheit, the lab director,
recalling the electrical fire last Dec. 18 that started in the
cathedral's gift shop.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze badly damaged two 17th century tapestries, "The Last
Supper" and "The Resurrection," from the official papal Barberini
looms of Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The tapestries, which had been hanging on a wall of the cathedral
nave, were scorched from the top down and lay on the floor in black,
smoldering heaps.</TE>
<TE>   Both were 40% destroyed, the figures of Christ and the apostles
all but gone from "The Last Supper," a 16-by-17-foot work, and an
image of Christ and the cross obliterated from the slightly smaller
"The Resurrection."</TE>
<TE>   Considered one of the nation's top textile conservation
laboratories, the shop handles works for such institutions as the J.
Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Philadelphia Museum
of Art.</TE>
<TE>   But its seven full- and part-time experts have shown a special
commitment to restoring the two fire-damaged Barberinis so they again
can grace the cathedral -- a 19th century, neo-Gothic landmark on
Manhattan's Upper West Side.</TE>
<TE>   Before the smoke cleared, Eidelheit had the tapestries carefully
moved to the nearby lab, where they were gently unrolled, hosed with
deionized water and vacuumed by workers lying on a mobile platform
that slides above the table.</TE>
<TE>   A mesh screen below collected debris: pieces of stained glass and
lead, plaster, buckets of dirt and tiny pieces of charred tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing months, the tapestries were reinforced with a nylon
net backing, cleaned and vacuumed repeatedly, and their condition
documented.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, the restorers continue to test burned sections,
including hundreds of fragments that range from an inch to several
feet in diameter. Most are unrecognizable; many may never be
reattached.</TE>
<TE>   But two larger fragments -- of the head of the apostle John and
the B emblem representing the Barberini family -- will likely be sewn
back onto the intact part of "The Last Supper."</TE>
<TE>   Eidelheit estimates that the entire process -- being done in
consultation with historians, museum curators and Barberini scholars
-- will take two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   Donated to the cathedral in 1891, the tapestries are part of a set
of 12 Barberini hangings woven in the mid-1600s, under the direction
of Florentine Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, for the nephew of Pope Urban
VIII. The other 10 were spared in the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Eidelheit said the specialty of the lab is conservation --
protecting what exists -- rather than restoring or replacing what is
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not trying to make it look brand new or the way it was
originally," she said. "We do a lot of documentation, a lot of
nonintrusive treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981, the textile lab has occupied the site of a former
orphanage and museum in the quiet 13-acre oasis amid the bustle of
Morningside Heights. Narrow walkways, gardens and sculptures surround
the building, connected to the cathedral by a long corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Using traditional and modern techniques, the lab handles a wide
range of textiles, including needlepoint, upholstery, carpets and
costumes, 35% of which come from private owners.</TE>
<TE>   The vital first steps of any such work are anything but glamorous.
They involve vacuuming, wet cleaning and testing for color, acidity
or alkalinity and fiber.</TE>
<TE>   In a small side room, dyes are tested, made and archived. "We keep
every recipe," Eidelheit said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent November day, Italian intern Sabrina DeVanna was
testing ways to back a fragile 1800-vintage American sampler. In
addition to stabilizing it, cleaning was required to remove blotchy
stains.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, technicians gently cleaned a Belgian lace
handkerchief, a family heirloom and wedding keepsake with
hand-stitched dates: 1875, 1915, 1941 and 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Normally the conservators use a "tabby weaving" technique to
stabilize weak areas, which assistant director Valerie Soll described
as "going from the strongest point outside the weak point with enough
space between each row."</TE>
<TE>   But in the case of the Barberini tapestries, the technique can be
used in only a limited manner because of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "This piece will definitely need a different strategy because of
the percentage that was lost," said Soll, referring to the "Last
Supper" laid out on the floor with some sections, charred beyond
recognition, on a table nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "Will they hang again? It's still a big unknown," Eidelheit said.
"They may need some kind of total support, like a slant board,
instead of them literally hanging upright."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever method is used, she said, the tapestries "won't be as
they were. They are now immense archeological artifacts, and the fire
is part of their history."</TE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>A New Jersey priest has been named the U.S. leader of Opus Dei, one
of the Roman Catholic Church's most controversial and fastest-growing
movements.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Thomas G. Bohlin was appointed vicar for the United
States by Bishop Javier Echevarria, prelate of the Rome-based
movement. Opus Dei was founded in 1928 by St. Josemaria Escriva de
Balaguer to encourage Catholic laity to bring holiness to daily life.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II elevated Escriva to sainthood Oct. 6, 27 years
after his death. As a "personal prelature," Opus Dei operates around
the world and reports directly to the pope.</LD>
<TE>   Bohlin, a New Jersey native, has worked for five years at Opus Dei
headquarters in Rome. He succeeds the Rev. Arne Panula, who is now
regional spiritual director for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the group call it "a church within a church" and accuse
it of secrecy and elitism.</TE>
<TE>   Opus Dei claims 3,000 members in the United States and 1,788
priests and 82,715 lay members around the world.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's Catholic Charities offices expect a surge in need during
the holiday season and a downturn in donations.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, president of Catholic Charities USA, said
a survey of 55 local agencies showed that 71% anticipate a shortage
in donations this year.</LD>
<LD>   More than one-third of local offices forecast a decline in food
donations, and more than half said their financial contributions are
lower this year. Hehir blamed the economic slowdown as the principle
reason, but said charity fatigue after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and the Catholic Church's ongoing sex scandal are "contributing to
the lag in income."</LD>
<TE>   Eighty-five percent of local offices are projecting an increase in
people seeking emergency financial assistance, and 66% expect a
greater need for food.</TE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, acting with evident reluctance, has accepted the
resignation of Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, the East Timorese
prelate who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end conflict
in the Indonesian-annexed territory.</LD>
<LD>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in a statement
Tuesday that Belo, 54, had previously submitted his resignation
several times because of health problems, but the pope did not accept
it until Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Francesco Maraccani, a spokesman for the Salesian order
to which Belo belongs, said the prelate was suffering from stress. He
praised Belo as a courageous bishop who risked his life for his
people. Belo has served since 1988 as apostolic administrator of Dili
in East Timor.</LD>
<TE>   The bishop led efforts by the Catholic Church to end fighting
between the Indonesian government and guerrilla forces seeking
independence for East Timor. He shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize
with Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to find "a just and peaceful
solution to the conflict."</TE>

<LD>Top officials of Valparaiso University in Indiana could face
sanctions from the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod after holding an
interfaith event to mark the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The denomination forbids interfaith worship. For holding the Sept.
11 event, Alan Harre, president of the university in Valparaiso, and
Joseph Cunningham, its pastor, could lose their status as clergy, but
because the university does not get money from the denomination, the
action would not directly affect the school.</LD>
<LD>   The event at the Valparaiso chapel, called "A Community Gathering
of Remembrance, Repentance and Renewal," was not promoted as a
religious service.</LD>
<TE>   "While our differences may prevent us from praying together, they
do not prevent us from gathering together to pray," Cunningham had
said in a news release issued prior to the event.</TE>

<HD>Copyright Upheld on Prayer Book Translation</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A translation of a Jewish prayer book is covered by federal
copyrights and can't be sold without permission, a U.S. appeals court
ruled in a dispute between two publishers within Hasidic Judaism.</LD>
<LD>   Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch Inc. owns a translation of a prayer book
widely used in the Lubavitch movement of Judaism. Otsar Sifrei
Lubavitch Inc. sought to sell a book with that translation and added
instructions and a different layout.</LD>
<LD>   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a trial
will need to determine whether Merkos is the true owner of the
copyrights. But the translation is subject to copyright law, the
judges said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first case involving a translation of a prayer book
that is used for oral prayer," said Otsar lawyer Jacob Laufer. "It
tends to give certain groups an ability to monopolize religious
works."</TE>
<TE>   Courts have held that new translations of historical religious
books, such as the Talmud, Bible or Koran, can be protected by
copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel said U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi was
correct in saying that the translation of prayers "involves partly
the precision of science but partly the sensitivity and spirit of
art. Behind the words that are found in the Hebrew and the words that
are used in the English are shades of meaning and subtlety that
cannot be labeled functional."</TE>

<LD>Public confidence in priests and the clergy has dropped sharply in
the last year, perhaps as a result of continuing scandals regarding
sexual abuse, according to a newly released Harris poll.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, 90% of adults surveyed said that they would generally
trust clergymen or priests to tell the truth. Now 64% feel that way.
Last year, clergymen and priests topped a list of 17 occupations and
professions as being most trusted for their honesty. This year they
rank below teachers, doctors, professors, police officers,
scientists, military officers, ordinary people, civil servants and
judges.</LD>
<LD>   The nationwide telephone survey questioned 1,010 adults from Nov.
14 through Nov. 18.</LD>

<LD>The new archbishop of Canterbury has launched a surprise attack on
what he sees as the pomp and circumstance of the establishment within
the Church of England, which he views as "profoundly anti-Christian."</LD>
<LD>   Rowan Williams, who describes himself as a "gloomy Celt" who
prefers to dress in plain black rather than full episcopal regalia,
said in a BBC documentary to be aired Sunday that the trappings of
power and status do not reflect traditional Gospel values.</LD>
<LD>   "The Anglican Church has bought very deeply into status," Williams
said. "It's one of the most ambiguous elements in the whole of that
culture. There's something profoundly -- I'll say it --
anti-Christian in all of that. It's about guarding position, about
fencing yourself in," he said.</LD>

<HD>Making Hanukkah a Major Holiday</HD>
<DH>American Jews cope with a 'December dilemma' by using the
Festival of Lights to show assimilation and religious distinction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the lighting of menorah candles, Jews on Friday heralded the
beginning of Hanukkah, a once comparatively minor observance that has
become a major celebration of Jewish distinctiveness in the American
cultural mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few decades, Hanukkah in America has become a
principal holiday for many Jews and one of the most popular. The
manner in which the holiday is observed -- greeting cards, extensive
gift giving, even complaints about over-commercialization --
represents an accommodation to the mainstream culture.</LD>
<LD>   But the holiday observances also help to draw important
distinctions, rabbis and other students of Jewish culture and
religion say.</LD>
<TE>   "What was a very simple, humble kind of observance of a minor
holiday in the home is now one of the most popular American Jewish
holidays and has exceeded in importance some major festivals," said
Rabbi David Baron of Temple Shalom for the Arts in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But with the assertion of Jewish traditions also comes a
confidence among Jews that they are part of the mainstream, Baron
said. "It reflects a comfort level and pride in our heritage."</TE>
<TE>   That mixture of assimilation and self-confidence is part of what
it means to be a minority religious group in America's overwhelmingly
Christian culture, said Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson, president of the
Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the University of Judaism in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's true that Hanukkah used to be a minor holiday, there's
a need for a major Jewish celebration and it fits the bill. In
December, it's very difficult to be Jewish in America" because of the
omnipresence of Christmas symbols, Artson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time when we feel most outside, so we need an
affirmation of who we are and an affirmation of who we are that fits
with the core values of the best of America," Artson added.</TE>
<TE>   One possible indication of self-confidence is that some synagogue
congregations feel comfortable holding joint services with churches
to celebrate the two holidays. On Dec. 14, for example, St. Jude's
Episcopal Church in Burbank will join with Temple Beth Emet in an
observance called "A Season of Light -- A Season of Miracles."
Christmas and Hanukkah music will be performed.</TE>
<TE>   On the eighth day of Hanukkah, the West Angeles Cathedral, a
predominantly African American congregation led by Bishop Charles E.
Blake of the Church of God in Christ, will host congregants at Temple
Shalom for a joint service and fellowship. The program will feature
the singing of the Christian hymn "Amazing Grace" and the lighting of
menorah candles.</TE>
<TE>   But Blake and Baron, along with others, emphasized this week that
they are sharing each other's culture and traditions, not forswearing
their own beliefs and heritage. Jewish and Christian authorities are
quick to note the differences.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas marks the birth of Jesus, whom Christians consider the
son of God and savior of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-day Hanukkah observance, sometimes called the "Festival
of Lights," commemorates the victory of a Jewish revolt about 150
years before Jesus' time against the Syrian Greeks who controlled
Palestine at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The revolt, led by a group of zealous Jews known as the Maccabees,
led to the reestablishment of Jewish control over Jerusalem and its
surroundings and the purification and rededication of the Temple, in
which the Greeks had carried out pagan rituals.</TE>
<TE>   According to tradition, when Judah, who led the Maccabees to
victory, sought to re-light the Temple's lamps, there was enough pure
olive oil for only one day. Yet through a miracle the lamps burned
eight days. To commemorate that, Jews light candles for eight days.</TE>
<TE>   In America, the holiday has been transformed by a combination of
circumstances and events, including cultural assimilation, that
undoubtedly would have shocked the Maccabees, said David Halperin,
who has taught Jewish history at the University of North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   In part, Hanukkah has prospered as a holiday because its story,
the candle-lighting ritual and the relative lack of liturgy make it
attractive to children.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid, if you asked me which holiday loomed larger in
my awareness and in my understanding, Hanukkah or Yom Kippur, it
would be Hanukkah hands down," said Halperin, now 55, who grew up in
a Conservative Jewish home.</TE>
<TE>   "Hanukkah was something I looked forward to."</TE>
<TE>   "Between getting presents and lighting the candles or standing in
an itchy suit in a synagogue for hours on end, there was no
competition."</TE>
<TE>   All that might have disturbed the Maccabees, Halperin notes. Their
goal was to combat foreign influences, particularly the Greek culture
that many Jews in their day found attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a festival whose explicit message is we're going to
stay separate and that anyone who tries to bring us into line with
the culture around us is going to get burned. That's the story of
Hanukkah," Halperin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet the message of its practice is that we are people just like
the people around us -- sharing the celebration and sharing the
primal pleasure of the return of light at the darkest time of year."</TE>

<HD>Robert Straub, 82; Democratic Governor of Oregon 1975-1979</HD>

<LD>Robert William Straub, Oregon's Democratic governor from 1975 to
1979, died late Wednesday at a long-term care facility in
Springfield, Ore. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Straub, who also made an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Congress, had
battled Alzheimer's disease for three years, said his son, Mike.</LD>
<LD>   Straub was elected governor in 1974. He was credited with reducing
Oregon's unemployment rate and with hiring more women, minority and
disabled people in top government positions than any governor before
him. As governor, he rechanneled freeway money into mass transit,
jump-starting Portland's light-rail system.</LD>
<TE>   In his previous job as state treasurer, Straub invested public
retirement funds in the stock market -- a move that reaped billions
of dollars in revenue and allowed hundreds of public employees to
retire in unprecedented comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Straub became known for his support for the environment, backing
conservation efforts and worrying about increases in air and water
pollution. He also supported a bill that defined Oregon beaches as
public domain.</TE>
<TE>   In his bid for reelection in 1978, Straub fell victim to a
increasingly conservative mood of voters in the West. That same year,
Proposition 13, which cut property taxes in California, passed, and
Straub's opposition to it and a similar measure in Oregon did not
help his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Straub was born in San Francisco in 1920, and was raised in a
staunchly Republican household. He served in the Army during World
War II, and received undergraduate and graduate degrees in business
from Dartmouth College in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Oregon after the war, and worked as an executive with
the Weyerhauser Timber Co. and as a building contractor before
entering politics.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Straub is survived by his wife, Pat.</TE>
