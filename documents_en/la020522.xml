<HD>Better Think Malibu, Not Stockholm, as Saab Rolls Out Its
Next Version of 9-3</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp.'s take-over of Saab is complete, and the Swedish
car maker, long known for its quirky designs, has been blanded.</LD>
<LD>   The 2003 Saab 9-3, which hits the marketplace in the fall, uses
GM's new global Epsilon platform for mid-size cars, and the result is
a Saab that has lost the angularity of its predecessors and would
look quite at home in a GM dealer's lineup.</LD>
<LD>   It's not bad looking, just different, sharing underpinnings with
the next-generation Chevy Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am, to name a few
close cousins.</LD>
<TE>   Saab says the initial sedan will be followed by a convertible, a
hatchback and then an all-wheel- drive 9-3X.</TE>
<TE>   Engine offerings are a pair of new all-aluminum, turbocharged
four-bangers rated at 175 and 210 horsepower. They'll come mated to
(choose one) a five-speed manual, a five-speed automatic or an
optional six-speed manual.</TE>
<TE>   Saab also is touting a passive rear-wheel-steering system that
flexes the rear track a tad to help in cornering.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing hasn't been announced, but isn't expected to move the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Buell Shakes Up Center of Gravity With Firebolt</TE>
<TE>   While Saab is busily being mainstreamed, Buell Motorcycle Co. is
busily going wild.</TE>
<TE>   Buell, the sport-bike subsidiary of Milwaukee's Harley-Davidson
Inc., has just introduced the Firebolt XB9R, the first motorcycle
with no gas or oil tanks (what looks like a gas tank is an air
intake).</TE>
<TE>   Instead of mounting the gas tank as a separate element atop the
bike, Buell's engineers turned the Firebolt's wide but hollow
aluminum frame into a fuel chamber. And the oil reservoir was moved
from the engine to the hollow swing arm that holds the rear wheel in
place.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Buell says, is a highly maneuverable motorcycle with a
center of gravity located somewhere down around the rider's boot
tops.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Buell uses a new Harley-designed V-twin engine. Vital
statistics: fuel-injected, 984 cubic centimeters, fan-cooled. Output:
92 horsepower and 68 pounds-feet of torque. Buell has priced the
Firebolt, just now showing up in dealer showrooms, at $9,995.</TE>

<HD>All Sorts of Buyers Taking Station Wagons to Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From women fleeing the stigma of being a "minivan mom" to skiers
seeking a snow-going alternative for the ubiquitous sport utility
vehicle, a growing cadre of car shoppers is rediscovering the station
wagon.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that in some quarters it's cool to be square. The boxy
station wagon, almost killed off by the minivan and the SUV in the
1990s, is staging a bit of a comeback. The shapes, though, are
sleeker these days and the accoutrements posher.</LD>
<LD>   The quarter of a million new wagons registered in the U.S. last
year isn't much compared with the million-a-year pace of the early
1980s. But at 2% of total passenger vehicles, it is easily twice the
annual wagon registration pace of the late 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   And wagon registrations were up 19% last year from their low point
in 1998, according to R.L. Polk Co., a Michigan firm that tracks
new-vehicle data.</TE>
<TE>   With auto makers seeking more niches to fill with specialized
vehicles, industry watchers such as consultant George Peterson of
AutoPacific Inc. in Tustin say the parade of wagons, including hybrid
designs that car companies call crossovers or sport activity
vehicles, will grow. Although wagon buyer demographics have
changed--they now sell to people young and old, singles and childless
couples as well as families--one constant remains: Most wagons still
sell because of their cargo and passenger capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular models include the Volvo V70 wagon, the
second-best-selling wagon nationally behind the all-wheel-drive
Subaru Legacy, and a favorite of couples with small children because
of Volvo's reputation for safety.</TE>
<TE>   That's what drew Michelle Miller, a 33-year-old pediatric
cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and mother of
18-month-old Benjamin, to her new $33,000 V70.</TE>
<TE>   "A station wagon is not what I would have pictured myself driving,
not in a million years," said Miller, who grew up in New York and now
lives in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But her Ford Explorer was too bulky for the short around-town
trips she finds herself making as a new mom, she said. "And it was
hard to get the baby in and out of."</TE>
<TE>   So her husband got the Explorer and it was off to the Volvo
dealership.</TE>
<TE>   "We started and stopped with wagons, and we only looked at Volvos
because of the reputation for safety," she said. "And I liked that it
has lots of room for baby stuff, and I like the interior and the way
it handles."</TE>
<TE>   Boosting the wagon market these days are sales of rugged off-road
models, performance models and ultra-luxury models usually affordable
for buyers whose careers have advanced well past apprenticeship and
whose children, if there are any, are out on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Wagon buyers "are all over the map," said Dan Gorrell, vice
president of Strategic Vision, a national automotive market
consulting firm based in San Diego. "They are as diverse a group as
any and they buy for a wide variety of reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of station wagon buyers in 2001 traded in an SUV, Gorrell
said, although the number climbed as high as 19% for buyers of
high-end wagons such as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. "I don't see this
as an anti-SUV backlash," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The station wagon, which flowered in the post-World War II baby
boom of the 1950s as the American family vehicle of choice, now fills
many market niches and no longer is being bought solely to haul the
kids.</TE>
<TE>   Ask recent wagon buyers such as 34-year-old bachelor Kaj van de
Loo, or Ray Smith, a 54-year-old whose only child is off to college
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a senior scientist with the Environmental Protection
Agency, recently bought a Volkswagen Passat wagon "because I got
tired of hauling lumber and landscaping plants and supplies in my BMW
325i."</TE>
<TE>   He sold the BMW to raise cash for the $24,600 Passat, but kept his
two-seat Honda S2000 sports car. Smith, who ordered his station wagon
with a five-speed manual transmission, considers himself an
"aggressive enthusiast" behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Like many new station wagon buyers, Smith looked at other wagons,
but didn't bother with SUVs. "As both an environmental professional
and an enthusiast driver, I think they're disgraceful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Loo, a San Francisco software developer, also considers
himself somewhat of a driving enthusiast. He also has a BMW Z3
roadster, and did look at an SUV--a BMW X5--before buying his station
wagon. His girlfriend moved from Germany to be with him, and he was
looking for a second car that would be more practical than the
convertible when they indulge their passion for skiing.</TE>
<TE>   He ended up with a $41,000 Audi allroad (and that's Audi's
preferred, no-capitals, spelling). It's a station wagon based on the
Audi A6 platform but outfitted with all-wheel drive and a suspension
that can be raised, by pushing a button, to provide as much as 8.2
inches of ground clearance when driving off-road or in the snow.</TE>
<TE>   "It has all-wheel drive for the snow when we go skiing," Van de
Loo said, "and a lot of cargo space [36.4 cubic feet versus 15.4
cubic feet in the Audi A6 sedan] for my ski and scuba gear, and it
does it all without being so big as an SUV.""</TE>
<TE>   Wagons are striking a positive chord with more people "because
there are 28 models out there now, with more coming, and each
addresses a precise segment of the market," said Bob Briscoe, chief
executive of CarsDirect.com, an Internet-based auto-buying and
consumer information service.</TE>
<TE>   The price range runs from about $11,000 for the base Kia Rio Cinco
wagon to $61,000 for the high-performance Audi S6 wagon. Wagons can
be bought bare or loaded with luxury trimmings, and with engines
powerful enough to blow the doors off most sports coupes on the road
or small enough to barely get up a steep hill.</TE>
<TE>   Salvatore Ragucci recently found himself in the market for "a car
with good power and good fuel economy that was fun to drive and would
hold my whole family."</TE>
<TE>   So the independent software designer, who lives in Glendora with
his wife, 6-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, bought a $26,000
Volkswagen Passat station wagon. Ragucci said he drives the wagon
while his wife prefers the family's panel van-styled PT Cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   "We had on Oldsmobile station wagon when I was a kid," Ragucci
said. "But this is the first one I've bought. And I'm pleased to
report that wagons have gotten a lot better. It drives like a sporty
sedan. If the image of a station wagon still is stodgy, all I can say
is, it's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Porsche, after all, is about to hit the market with a new
model--the Cayenne--that it would like to call an SUV but that has
the lowered stance and longer body of a station wagon and probably
will be called one by most industry analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Porsche, Volvo, VW, Audi, Subaru--it becomes obvious when looking
at the list of wagons that the traditional American auto makers
aren't leading the way. As they did with small cars and mid-size
family sedans, import brands have taken command of a market niche
once controlled by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, in fact, hasn't built a station wagon since it
introduced the contemporary minivan in 1984 (although a new Chrysler
due to hit the market next year, the Pacifica, is a crossover with a
wagon-ish profile and a multitude of wagon-like characteristics.)</TE>
<TE>   Ford is the domestic leader with three models: the Focus wagon,
the third-best-selling in the country last year, and the Ford
Taurus-Mercury Sable twins.</TE>
<TE>   GM's Saturn unit makes two wagons, a compact SW model and a
mid-size LW, and there are those, such as AutoPacific's Peterson,
who'd argue that the Pontiac Vibe is more wagon than anything else.
Otherwise, the last GM station wagons were the full-size Chevy
Caprice-Buick Roadmaster twins that bit the dust in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't see a lot of signs of life there, not a huge
comeback," said GM product division spokesman Jan-willen Vester.</TE>
<TE>   Import brands in the U.S. accounted for slightly more than
three-fourths of the 251,334 new wagons registered last year, while
67% of all station wagons were produced by domestic manufacturers as
late as 1987, according to R.L. Polk analyst Eric Papacek. "Today
import brands account for six of the top 10 registered wagons in 2001
and 23 of the 28 wagon models sold here are produced by import
manufacturers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But don't count Detroit out.</TE>
<TE>   After watching South Korean car makers take away small-car market
share and Asian and European import brands eat into their compact and
luxury car sales, domestic auto makers are learning to play the niche
game too.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't given up on practicality-oriented versions of family
sedans," said GM's Vester. The Chevrolet division, in fact is
"considering" a second model in the Malibu line, one with a longer
wheelbase and "and enhanced flexibility in the cargo area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Mazda Protege5, Lexus IS300 Sport Cross, Pontiac Vibe,
Toyota Matrix, Chrysler Pacifica and Porsche Cayenne, the Malibu
won't look quite like a standard station wagon, and GM probably will
call it a crossover or coin a new name, such as "urban activity
vehicle." But a wagon is what it will be.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers, even those who sell them, say it still is difficult
to get most baby boomers to look at anything they call a wagon.</TE>
<TE>   For some wagon owners, such as Van de Loo, it doesn't matter what
they call it. "I bought the vehicle that fits my lifestyle," he said.</TE>

<HD>Civic-Minded Thieves Put Upscale Integra at Top of Dubious
Heap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Successful retailers know their markets: So, it seems, do car
thieves.</LD>
<LD>   With used Honda Civics a perennial favorite among young motorists
seeking something inexpensive to fix up and to drive, the upscale
Acura Integra--with a long list of parts that bolt onto the Civic
with ease--has become a favorite of those who steal cars for their
components.</LD>
<LD>   A new study by the Highway Loss Data Institute of theft rates
among 1999-2001 model cars and trucks found that the Honda Motor
Co.-built Integra led the pack with a theft claim frequency more than
eight times the average.</LD>
<TE>   Owners of Integras from those three years, the study found, filed
21.7 claims for every 1,000 insured vehicles. The average theft claim
frequency for all vehicles was 2.6 per 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Theft investigators believe that Integras are targeted by
professional thieves for their parts and that many of those parts,
like the more powerful engine, end up on modified Honda Civics," said
Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data
Institute, an affiliate of the insurer-funded Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Civic and the Integra share the same platform, and
until this model year about 40% of an Integra's parts, including the
seats and much of the powertrain, would bolt onto a Civic of the same
model year with little or no modification, said American Honda Motor
Co. spokesman Art Garner.</TE>
<TE>   The Integra has been in the top 10 of the insurance group's "hot
car" list for five straight years, even after Honda started adding a
passive anti-theft device as standard equipment in the 2000 model
year.</TE>
<TE>   Car thieves learn to break systems almost as quickly as
manufacturers can churn them out.</TE>
<TE>   After the theft claim rate for Integras fell to 16.8 per 1,000
insured vehicles for the 2000 model year, down from 25 per 1,000 for
1999 models, the rate rose to 21.6 per 1,000 for 2001 models, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-theft device is called an immobilizer and works by
disabling the ignition unless the key that came with the car is used.</TE>
<TE>   On Acuras, as on vehicles of other brands, immobilizers are
"thought to be more effective in deterring amateur thieves than
[deterring] the professionals," Hazelbaker said.</TE>
<TE>   Acura spokesman Mike Spencer said the company believes its
immobilizer remains effective. The insurance group is counting cases
of cars that are broken into and stripped of parts without being
moved, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the study found, the overall frequency of auto theft
claims has been on the decline since 1980, when it was logged at 15
per 1,000 insured vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The average insurance payment in stolen-car cases has soared, from
about $900 per claim in the 1980 model year to just under $6,400 for
the 2001 model year.</TE>

<HD>For Cadillacs, It's Fine to Skip Rotor Turning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I recently took my 1998 Cadillac Deville in for a brake
job. The dealer charged me for pads but not for turning the rotors.
The service advisor said it wasn't needed. I've never had a brake job
in which rotors were not turned. Was I given a substandard brake job?</LD>
<LD>   E.E.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Not necessarily. It is common for most repair shops to
turn rotors, which means that the iron surfaces are ground smooth.
But General Motors Corp. has issued a service bulletin for Cadillacs
that specifically instructs mechanics not to turn rotors unless there
is scoring or gouges that are deeper than 60 thousandths of an inch.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, turning a rotor when it is not in bad condition is a waste
of money and will reduce the life of the rotor.</TE>
<TE>   After a long period of wear and after a number of turnings, a
rotor can become so thin that it does not meet the manufacturer's
specifications for structural soundness. As long as the overall rotor
does not vary by more than 1 thousandth of an inch in thickness, it
does not need to be machined smooth, according to the service
bulletin as reported by Alldata, a publisher of automotive
information.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Cadillac has recognized that some of its brakes
have a problem with excessive "grunt, groan, grind, crunch and
squeal," apparently related to a disc that does not have enough
thickness in certain areas.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a problem with noisy brakes, the recommended repairs,
as outlined by another technical service bulletin, call for new pads
and more substantial rotors.</TE>
<TE>   Premium Gasoline Not Necessarily Required</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just bought a Toyota Tundra pickup and am wondering about the
correct gasoline to use. Should I follow Toyota's recommendation for
87 octane-rated fuel or go up to a premium fuel? Didn't all grades of
gasoline used to be higher octane than now?</TE>
<TE>   F.R.</TE>
<TE>   A: As you suspect, not all premium lives up to its name, and
octane ratings have been sliding downhill for a number of years.
Premium octane in California used to be 92, but it slipped a notch to
91 during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Octane is a measure of gasoline's ability to resist uncontrolled
combustion, which causes engine knock.</TE>
<TE>   When a cylinder is in its compression stroke, the gasoline is put
under tremendous heat and pressure. If the octane rating is too low,
it will begin to explode before the spark plug detonates the
fuel-and-air mixture.</TE>
<TE>   If the gasoline does detonate, typically when you hit the
accelerator hard and the engine is under tremendous load, you can
hear pinging from under the hood. That's the sound of the explosion
ramming the piston and cylinder walls at the wrong time--when the
piston still is in the early part of its compression stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Mild knock or ping isn't anything to worry about, but a hard knock
can cause severe engine damage. In some cases, it can knock a hole
right through the piston, damage the rings or blow a head gasket.</TE>
<TE>   So gasoline refiners boost the octane of their fuel to retard
knock. Gasoline has a natural octane rating in the mid- to upper 80s,
but depending on how it's refined, conventional automotive gasoline's
octane ratings can be lifted all the way to the mid-90s.</TE>
<TE>   The term "octane" refers to the component of gasoline, made of
chains of eight carbon atoms, that best resists spontaneous
combustion. If you were to put propane in your engine and compress it
the same way you do gasoline, it would knock far more.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, octane ratings were boosted by adding lead to
gasoline, but that was discontinued in the early 1980s as more became
known about lead's health hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Octane now is boosted using alcohol, though that's expensive and
has helped to contribute to high gasoline prices. At the same time,
auto makers have redesigned engines to require lower-octane gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   If your Toyota does not ping or knock during most of the driving
you do with 87-octane gasoline, there is no reason to jump to a
higher-octane fuel. It would not provide better gasoline mileage,
though the premium fuel may contain a better additive package that
will keep the fuel system clean.</TE>
<TE>   It's still possible to buy gas with higher octane. Most brands
have a middle-octane fuel of 89. In addition, Unocal still sells a
100-octane fuel at many locations for high-performance vehicles.</TE>

<LD>I will defend to the death the general sensibility and competence of
Angelenos, especially on the road, despite the stereotypes. It is
simply a mathematical miracle that there aren't more accidents on a
daily basis. But still, I can only shake my head when three drops of
rain fall and suddenly everyone south of San Francisco forgets how to
work the turn signals and the difference between the brake and the
accelerator.</LD>
<LD>   There are many theories about why Angelenos cannot drive in the
rain: not enough practice; unfamiliarity with car when top is
up/sunroof closed; anxiety over possible water spots, muddy
footprints, personal melting. But I have come to believe it is
simpler than that, as simple as the sound of the raindrops on the
roof.</LD>
<LD>   I am old enough and come from far enough away to remember the
sound of rain falling on the tin roof of a farmhouse. (I think it was
tin, it might have been aluminum, I guess, but it was metal, of that
I am certain.) It is a lovely sound, a lulling sound, metallic enough
to be musical but muffled and watery like the ceaseless mutterings of
the womb. Listening to it, you felt safe, cozy (unless you were Dad
and suddenly realized you never did get around to cleaning out those
gutters, but that's another story).</LD>
<TE>   It is, like the thick silence after a snowfall or the sound of
frost-brittle leaves and grass splintering underfoot, an audio
touchstone that you miss when you live in L.A. The closest thing you
get is the sound of rain falling on the car roof. Although that is a
different sound--louder for one thing, with more splat and less
music--it seems to have a similar effect. Peering past the
windshields and driver-side windows of my fellow motorists on a rainy
Monday morning, I saw a lot of semi-comatose expressions. It was the
first time I had encountered anything lotus-like in this allegedly
laid-back town.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was Monday, but I think it was the rain. It is easy to be
mesmerized by the rain, especially when we've all seen so little of
it this year. I remember as a child riding in the car and watching as
the drops hit the glass, then slid and snuggled against each other,
trading molecules and forming larger drops that clung to the glass,
writhing and moving sideways or impossibly upwards until weight and
gravity did their work. The water moved with such hilarious grace,
seeming sometimes joyful, sometimes reluctant, that it seemed alive;
the drops were like fat little animals playing.</TE>
<TE>   There is restorative value in such whimsy, but not when you're
merging, changing lanes or making a left onto Alameda at rush hour.
Then such distractions, and even the soothing throb of the rain on
metal and glass, are just one more layer of insulation between us and
other drivers, between us and what is really going on.</TE>
<TE>   When we're in our cars, with music playing or a conversation
unrolling, it's easy to imagine that we are the only people in the
universe, that the rest of those ungainly vehicles are merely
obstacles to be thwarted in some huge video game on our way to work
or the store. The rain makes it even worse--it's hard to see the
people behind the glass, easier to lose ourselves in the sound and
movement of the water as it strikes and slides off our little bubble
of self.</TE>
<TE>   This is when it's a good time to open that window, or even the
sunroof. Angelenos are not as well-acquainted with the properties of
rain as they might be, but it is a bracing thing when it gets past
the roof and the glass, an reminder that there are things to be done,
including driving well.</TE>

<HD>Leveling the Playing Field for L.A.'s Young Learners</HD>
<DH>Education* Having traveled the path herself, lawyer Janeen
Steel now helps kids with learning disabilities to succeed in school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The art on Janeen Steel's office wall is made of fabric scraps, bits
and pieces painted and placed without pattern or rhythm. She created
it while attending law school. It reflects, she says, a life of
fragments, darkness and chaos, a life reaching for light.</LD>
<LD>   In it, she sees herself as well as others with learning
disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Steel, 39, is director of the Learning Rights Project at the
Western Law Center for Disability Rights, located at Loyola Law
School. She founded the program to help low-income families work with
schools to obtain services for children with learning difficulties
and disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   "She comes into the process with an open mind," says Wesley
Parsons, a special education attorney for the Los Angeles Unified
School District who has worked with Steel. "She focuses on resolving
situations in a manner that's both beneficial to the child and
practical. I think she has a good grasp on how to address the need of
students with learning disabilities in the best possible way and is
willing to work with the district in meeting those needs."</TE>
<TE>   Steel's goal: to make sure each child is properly assessed and
receives the services and rights granted them by the law. The kind of
support that keeps them in school and helps them find ways to
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   And she knows how difficult it can be to stay the course--long
before she was a lawyer, she was a high school dropout with
undiagnosed learning disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   National figures suggest that about 35%, twice the percentage of
those without learning disabilities, drop out of high school. That
statistic is why Steel is working with students such as 18-year-old
Jason Artola, a sophomore at Verdugo Hills High School.</TE>
<TE>   Although Artola has been tested as being of higher than average
intelligence, until last year, he knew only failure. Other students
called him "stupid" or "retarded." They said his family must be
stupid too.</TE>
<TE>   One day in the cafeteria of his former school, a group of about
five students swarmed around him, calling him names. They grabbed his
backpack and scattered its contents on the floor. They pushed him
against a wall, then laughed as they walked away.</TE>
<TE>   Artola turned and saw the stares. He quickly gathered his things
off the floor and left school. He took the bus to Griffith Park, and
he started to run. He ran until his chest heaved and his mind
cleared.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he got home, however, the feelings of pain and
frustration had returned. He went to his bedroom, closed the door and
lay still on the bed. What would it be like to die, he asked himself.
Which knife should he use?</TE>
<TE>   Then he thought about his family and knew that wasn't the
solution. Desperate to keep her son in school, Artola's mother
contacted Steel after hearing about her through a co-worker. Steel
studied the youth's background and met with school officials.</TE>
<TE>   He began to see improvement last year, when he transferred to
Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga. He was assigned tutors, and
other students took notes for him, allowing him to focus on what the
teacher was saying. He was placed in regular classes rather than
special education classes and for the first time received passing
marks.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first time, he was academically eligible to
participate in athletics. He went out for cross country, soccer and
track.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt school pride for the first time in my life," Artola says.
"The first time I wore a school uniform.... I teared up a little bit
because it was what I wanted for so long. It was my dream to get into
some sport."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to flourish, but then last month, Artola received a
report card with two failing marks. He was removed from the track
team. He started missing classes. "It's hard to keep going," he now
says. "I feel like giving up."</TE>
<TE>   Gayle Glazer, inclusion facilitator at the school, says he has
been switched to classes that will provide him with more individual
attention. Notes will be taken for all his classes, not just one. And
he will be given more time to work on assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything we can to help him become successful,"
Glazer says. "It's frustrating because he's so bright. Now, it's a
matter of how hard he's willing to work."</TE>
<TE>   Steel knows about the frustrations and the hard work. She grew up
dreaming of becoming a writer, but words, like all else, were a part
of her chaos. In 1981, she dropped out of Hollywood High School and
graduated from a continuing-education program. Her next six years
were spent stumbling a few steps in many directions.</TE>
<TE>   She lasted six weeks in welding school, one day in real estate
school, an hour or so in a bartending program. She was a beautician
for a while, but that didn't work out either. Nothing did. At the
same time, she was trying to fill the voids in her life with drink,
drugs and a vague notion that things would work out, just as they did
in movies, her place of escape. The only time she could forget that
her life was going nowhere was during long afternoons at the Fox,
Egyptian, Vogue, Pacific. She saw "Tommy" six times.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she enrolled at Long Beach City College to study
writing. For an English class, she was assigned an exercise in
comparison and contrast, so she wrote about similarities and
differences between health clubs and bars.</TE>
<TE>   She says she worked hard but failed the assignment. Her professor
could not understand her writing, but he had a daughter with
dyslexia, and he recognized its symptoms in Steel's work. Tests
confirmed she suffered from disabilities affecting her abilities to
read and write.</TE>
<TE>   "All the sudden, it wasn't me that was the problem," she says. "It
was my brain that was the problem. I can't explain how much it
relieved me.... Suddenly, I knew that I was going to be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Steel began working with tutors and note-takers, utilizing books
on tape and developing new strategies to process information. She
would dictate papers instead of writing directly. She made time to
get organized before setting out on a task--even something as simple
as driving across town.</TE>
<TE>   Steel graduated from Long Beach City College, where she served as
student body president, and in 1993, she received a bachelor's degree
in creative writing from San Francisco State. In 1999, 12 years after
enrolling at Long Beach, she graduated from UCLA School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout college, there were times, she says, when it seemed
that all the information being fed into her brain might somehow
abandon her as she struggled to live life in a new way, with new eyes
and new hope.</TE>
<TE>   What fueled her was the realization that ultimately she might be
able to help others with learning disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to law school, and a couple things happened," she says. "I
took an educational law class, and I started investigating students
in high school and junior high school who had learning disabilities,
whether or not they were getting accommodations, and I found out that
they weren't."</TE>
<TE>   She also discovered that students from low-income families were at
a disadvantage in that they could not afford private attorneys to
guide them through the process of assessment and compliance with
state and federal laws. Nor could they afford private tutors. The
Learning Rights Project started out as an independent nonprofit, but
in 2000, it was taken in by the Western Law Center for Disability
Rights, which now funds it. Working out of a small office, and with
the assistance of six law clerks, Steel now assists about 35 clients.</TE>
<TE>   Steel believes students in special education will benefit as LAUSD
moves toward greater inclusion. "We need to educate students the same
way we live in our communities," she says. "We don't want segregation
in our communities, so we need to educate in an environment with
people learning differently, looking differently. We need to teach
students to accept each other in schools as well as communities."</TE>
<TE>   Statistics gathered by the National Center for Learning
Disabilities indicate that there are 2.8 million students nationwide
receiving special education services for learning disabilities. About
85% of them have difficulties in the area of reading. Of Los Angeles
Unified School District's 736,675 students in kindergarten through
12th grade, 52,429 have been identified as having learning
disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Learning disabilities and behavioral issues easily become
entangled. More than three-quarters of incarcerated youths have
learning disabilities, Steel estimates, and it was through the
juvenile court system that she met Sandra, 16, a junior at Wilson
High School.</TE>
<TE>   She was kicked out of school in eighth grade and got in trouble
with the law. After she realized she had to change her life, the
question became how, and that's what Steel helped her understand.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me that I was smart," Sandra says. "It's not that I'm
not capable of doing things. It's just that I need more time to do
stuff. I'm as capable as regular students. At first, I didn't believe
her."</TE>
<TE>   Over time, however, Steel proved to be right. Sandra's disability
affected reading comprehension, written expression and math
calculation. She was accommodated through tutors, books on tape, use
of a computer for exams and assignments with software allowing her to
check grammar and spelling. She also was given more time to complete
exams.</TE>
<TE>   This year, she is receiving straight A's.</TE>
<TE>   As it is becoming for students like Artola and Sandra, life for
Steel has been a series of new beginnings. She was married two months
ago--she and her fiance, Mark Challed, a road foreman for Metrolink,
headed to a Las Vegas chapel and tied the knot at a ceremony
officiated by an Elvis impersonator. It is her second marriage. She
doesn't like talking about the first.</TE>
<TE>   Steel continues healing in many aspects of life. From time to
time, she encounters ghosts of the past, familiar faces on the
streets of Hollywood. "Literally, the people I hung around with,
they're homeless, on the streets now. Some are dead or in jail."</TE>
<TE>   When she sees them, she realizes how close she came. How far she
came.</TE>
<TE>   As she looks at the artwork hanging in her office and reflects on
her life, she describes how the darkness becomes light in the upper
left corner. "Chaos to light," says Steel. "It's always chaos to
light."</TE>

<LD>Some drooling kid in smelly diapers wearing a $450 raincoat ("Busting
the Piggy Bank," May 10) only goes to show how easily fools are
parted from their money. People are entitled to spend it on whatever
they want. They earned it. It's theirs. But what this says about
them, their lack of sensibilities and their emotional need for
display has to translate to their offspring that it is more important
to impress with looks than with deeds.</LD>

<LD>Lee Child's "Without Fear" (Putnam, $24.95, 374 pages) provides more
than a fair share of action and adventure, assuming one can put
reality on hold and accept its starting point. That's the highly
unlikely idea that the Secret Service would hire a freelance
trouble-shooter to try to penetrate the security surrounding the vice
president of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Since his first novel, "Killing Floor," Child has been chronicling
the adventures of Jack Reacher, a hard-case ex-military cop with a
penchant for changing locations and maintaining a low profile that
borders on the paranoid. Each book has required something or someone
to force him to stop and smell the roses and the cordite.</LD>
<LD>   None of the plot-establishing devices has been as effective as the
one in "Killing Floor," but "Fear" has other appealing elements to
qualify as a close runner-up to that striking debut book.</LD>
<TE>   Prime among them is his associate in mayhem, Frances Neagley, a
woman as self-reliant and lethally effective as he. The interaction
between the two--heavily professional here, but with a hint of
something more personal to come--gives Reacher a bit more dimension.
Child provides a full-out love interest for him, too, a romance
cleverly complicated by the woman's previous relationship with his
late brother.</TE>
<TE>   Though he spends more time than usual on his hero's emotional
side, the author has not stinted in the suspenseful twists and turns
that fans have come to expect. The Secret Service's real reason for
hiring Reacher turns out to be a genuine threat on the veep's life.
The villains are clever and ruthless. The puzzling elements are
provocative. Who are these seemingly invincible assassins? How do
they gain access to the corridors of power? And why in the world
would they want to bump off a vice president instead of the big guy?
All questions are answered with the maximum amount of derring-do. And
there's a terrific snowbound finale that gives new meaning to the
word "catharsis."</TE>

<TE>   Since Linda Howard is the author of nine bestsellers in a row, I
doubt she'll care much that I had a problem with her newest, "Dying
to Please" (Ballantine, $25.95, 312 pages). The Birmingham, Ala.,
location was a good idea. It's virgin thriller country. Her
protagonist's vocation is another plus: the butlers we see in
mysteries usually aren't beautiful women who also serve as
bodyguards. Sarah Stevens is, in fact, a unique creation--a former
military brat turned expert marksman, skilled in hand-to-hand combat
and fastidious in the preparation of breakfast, lunch and dinner, as
well as a whiz at doing the laundry. Howard introduces her in combat
action, foiling a home invasion. It's a well-developed sequence, but
I did get a little restless with Stevens' smug summation of the way
she acquitted herself, then seeing the same point made by a variety
of other characters, including the potential love interest, a
homicide cop who's having trust problems after being betrayed by his
sluttish ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens' handling of the home invaders is so heralded it makes it
to TV where her toothsome beauty, poise and presence are noted by a
60-something gazillionaire whose fortress castle sits on an
eight-acre estate in an exclusive section of the city. He is, of
course, the villain of the piece, a stalker as twisted as a pretzel,
who is perfectly willing to kill an unending array of Stevens'
employers just to have her for his very own. This is all pretty
acceptable as pop thrillers go. But then we come to several sections
of the book devoted to Stevens' menstrual cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I know the trend is to make suspense protagonists more human,
but isn't it possible that readers may be given too much information?
I'm not sure I want to know how that second cup of coffee effects
Harry Bosch every morning, or if Kay Scarpetta suffers from a sinus
condition. Some things should be left a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Revisiting the Familiar</TE>
<TE>   Darkness of the Old South</TE>
<TE>   The possibly pseudonymous Kenneth Abel (all the book jacket
discloses is that he lives in Ohio) introduced New Orleans lawyer
Danny Chaisson two years ago in "Cold Steel Rain," a remarkable novel
of murder and political chicanery set in the Louisiana swamplands.
Its razor-sharp plot and lyrical descriptive passages suggested that
Abel was falling in line right behind that other bard of the bayou,
James Lee Burke. The book's fascination stemmed from the mystery
surrounding its protagonist. Was Chaisson just a bagman for a bent
politician, a burnout case on a downward spiral, or was there
something else going on behind his passive exterior? "Rain" provided
the answer in a way that was satisfying and complete.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Burying Field" (Putnam, $26.95, 291 pages), Abel brings
the character back, which wasn't exactly a wonderful idea. Unlike
most current series protagonists, Chaisson hasn't any secrets left.
All his author can do is put him through a different set of the same
problems, mainly those in which the dark traditions of the Old South
continue to vie with human-rights progress in the here and now.</TE>
<TE>   In "Field," he's sent by a powerful New Orleans real-estate
developer to a sleepy bayou burg where the discovery of an
undocumented slave cemetery has called a halt to a proposed shopping
center. The Crescent City Donald Trump has given up hope of
completing his project, but he's concerned that the beating of an
elderly black man by vandals on the property may expose him to a
lawsuit. Chaisson arrives with a pal, a dangerous bar owner who also
has lost the mystery he possessed in the first novel. Here he's just
the latest in a long line of sidekicks whose main task is to unnerve
the ungodly. As he and Chaisson begin to investigate the beating, an
assortment of stock characters emerge: the taunting, muscle-bound
punks, the homicidal Klan man, the ineffectual sheriff and noble but
downtrodden black folks. Abel's prose is rich and his dialogue sharp,
but with material this familiar, it doesn't help much.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Lochte, the author of the prize-winning novel "Sleeping Dog"
and its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press), reviews
mysteries every other Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Editor Branches Out From His Technical Training</HD>
<DH>Publishing* Adam Bly, 21, launches Seed, a magazine aimed
at examining science and culture, as he aspires to get into other
media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AILEEN JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If it weren't for the age of its founder and editor, Seed might be
just another magazine launch. True, an interesting one, with its
mission to examine the intersection of science and culture. And an
audacious one, starting up during a recession that has killed off
some major periodicals.</LD>
<LD>   But Adam Bly, Seed's editor and president, is only 21.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow," says John Rennie, editor in chief of Scientific American,
who notes that, at 42, he is "precisely twice the age" of Bly, whom
he knew to be young, but not that young. Persuading backers to put up
the millions needed to start a magazine "would be very impressive for
a person of any age," Rennie says.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always had an affinity for people who do something wild and
wonderful," says Rick Leckner, a Montreal businessman who owns a
financial communications agency and is a Seed investor. Seed is based
in Montreal, but most of its 100,000 copies, which reached newsstands
in March, are distributed in the United States through Warner
Publishing Services, a division of AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Since Leckner started as a radio reporter at age 16, he's not
fazed by Bly's youth. "As an entrepreneur, I saw in Adam all the
right signs. I see a motivated, intelligent, articulate individual.
He presented his case exceedingly well."</TE>
<TE>   Bly was a whiz who won science fairs, did cancer research at
Canada's National Research Council at age 16, got a chapter published
in a book at that age and traveled to international conferences. He
later attended McGill University for one year but dropped out
because, he says, he found college too confining. In 1999, when he
represented Canada at a UNESCO-sponsored world science conference in
Budapest, Hungary, "I had an epiphany about where science is going,"
he says. "Science is having a greater impact on society.... Stem
cells, climate change, cloning, bioterrorism--they're infiltrating
pop culture and making headlines, Page One, above-the-fold
headlines," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   It was in Budapest that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon
Lederman first met Bly. Lederman, who's based in Chicago, wrote for
an initial issue of Seed that came out last year (though Bly
considers the one now on newsstands the beginning of the launch). "I
was amazed at how much support he has acquired," Lederman says.</TE>
<TE>   As with Leckner, Lederman, who's almost 80, isn't taken aback by
Bly's youth. "In science you're beginning to be over the hill at 21,"
he says. Is Bly's defection to media a loss to science? "If he were
an Einstein, I'd say yes. But he's a good scientist, and he has this
other ability." About 40,000 people in North America can do
high-level physics, he says, but the number who know science "and
have the ability to manage an organization ... is in the ones and
twos."</TE>
<TE>   Lederman says he's impressed that Bly, on a recent trip to London,
had lunch with Sir John Maddox, a former editor of the journal
Nature, which is largely read by scientists. "It was one of [Bly's]
efforts to become known, to find out who the movers and shakers are."</TE>
<TE>   Bly hopes that by 2004 he'll have 250,000 affluent readers aged 25
to 45--"a lucrative market segment," he says. He plans to expand
Seed, which has a staff of 15, into a "major player" in television
and other media. Seed is to publish four issues this year, eight next
year and 10 in 2004. "I see it as a brand," he says. "I see myself at
the helm of that," though the magazine "will always be our flagship."
One sees how he raises money.</TE>
<TE>   And one sees the young professionals demographic addressed at all
levels in the magazine's pages. The ads include full-page spreads
from Skyy Vodka, Skechers shoes, Lucky jeans and other trendy
purveyors (though not all paid full price, Bly acknowledges).</TE>
<TE>   Rennie, of Scientific American (700,000 circulation), applauds
Seed's goals, photography and some of its articles, but said the
magazine is "superficial. I worry that people could have the sense
that they're better informed about these things than they actually
are."</TE>
<TE>   Lederman, on the other hand, says he's "bowled over" by the "high
quality" of the articles.</TE>

<HD>Sculpture With a Spout</HD>
<DH>Sonny and Gloria Kamm have acquired thousands of
teapots--and not because they like to drink tea</DH>
<SE>The Collectors: One in an occasional series</SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after Sonny and Gloria Kamm moved into their sunny, tri-level
1950s San Fernando Valley home, Gloria, a docent at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, made a casual comment--an observation,
really--that would end up changing the course of their lives. She and
Sonny, an attorney for a securities firm, were wondering what to
display on the narrow glass shelves behind the bar. "You know,"
Gloria says, "we have a number of teapots."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, they had about 20, not that anyone was keeping count.
After all, they had purchased them as fine examples of contemporary
glass, just like the Dale Chihuly sculpture that sits on their living
room table. These, says Sonny, just "happened to be in teapot form."</LD>
<LD>   The teapots worked well on the shelves and as a group. And this
was the first time the Kamms really looked at them as teapots:
sculptural objects with a common denominator of handles, spouts and
lids. The form agreed with them. There was just one problem. There
weren't enough teapots to fill out the shelf space. They needed to
add a few more. That was 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the Kamms' teapot collection numbers more than 6,000,
filling closets and drawers, a nearby condominium the couple
purchased for storage, and invading--happily--their children's homes.
This figure doesn't include the several hundred items the two
classify as teapot paraphernalia or "go withs," such as teapot-shaped
sink stoppers, teapot clocks, teapot T-shirts, teapot pins, "I'm a
Little Teapot" books, or the rear license-plate frame on Sonny's car,
which reads: "He who has the most teapots wins." (The front frame
declares: "Teapot man strikes again.")</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this is revisionist," says Sonny, "After you get into
it, you realize how much you like the form. The teapot is a
complicated form in a sense. In the ceramic world in particular, it's
one of the most difficult forms to create. It has to have balance, a
spout, a lid that doesn't flip off. It has to be a conductor of heat.
The form has intrigued people who are not only artists, but
architects and designers."</TE>
<TE>   "You have a very international component as well," adds Gloria.
After all, she says, "after water, tea is the most popular beverage
in the world, and where you find tea, you find teapots."</TE>
<TE>   The segment of their collection dearest to them--a collection unto
itself--is the artist-made teapots. They have about 1,000 of these.
Few are functional, and in any case, neither Sonny nor Gloria are big
tea drinkers. Some look like teapots. Many do not.</TE>
<TE>   There is, for example, Peter Grieve's "Porcupine Teapot," a
winsome creature with a tin body and bristle tail; Margaret Wharton's
elegant "Caddy," crafted out of a found book; Michael C. McMillen's
nearly 8-foot-tall architectural "Teapot Tower Sculpture"; and Rose
Misanchuk's naughty ceramic interpretations of Blue Boy and Pinkie.
There are also teapots by notables Beatrice Wood, Keith Haring, Cindy
Sherman and Roy Lichtenstein.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very significant collection," says Adrian Saxe, a ceramist
and professor of art at UCLA. "It has a lot of depth. And it's
interesting that they came to this quest here in L.A. because the
tradition of collecting that kind of thing, you think of it as
English. Maybe toys in L.A., but not teapots." (The Kamms own about a
half-dozen Saxe teapots, as well as other works by the artist.)</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 250 of the artist-made teapots comprise a show currently on
view at Copia: the American Center for Wine, Food &amp; the Arts in Napa.
Titled "The Artful Teapot: 20th Century Expressions From the Kamm
Collection," the show runs through Sept. 2 and will travel to five
other North American locations, including the Long Beach Museum of
Art in the summer of 2003. Garth Clark--author of numerous books,
including "American Ceramics: 1876 to the Present" and "The Eccentric
Teapot," and owner of the Garth Clark Gallery in New York--selected
the teapots for the show. He also authored "The Artful Teapot," the
exhibition catalog, which is published by Watson-Guptill.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the artist-made teapots were purchased from galleries. As
former partners in Kurland/Summers on Melrose, a contemporary-glass
gallery that closed in 1992, the Kamms are firm believers in the
gallery system. They also have bought at student art shows, which
makes for interesting groupings, says Sonny; a $20,000 piece by an
established artist often will be displayed next to a student work.</TE>
<TE>   The Kamms have commissioned many artists as well. "Having been
collectors of different things," says Sonny--among them rubber
duckies, sundials and antique baby cups--"we didn't want our
collection to be like everyone else's. So we formed the idea of
having artists who had never done teapots do one for us."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles artist Peter Shire has done several projects for the
Kamms. Currently, he is working on a sizable stainless-steel teapot
mailbox/sculpture for the pair. "We have always tried to be very
invisible from the front of our house," says Gloria. "But we thought
this one thing would be a fun adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Kamms have loaned out teapots and other
selections from their extensive contemporary art collection to dozens
of museums and welcomed countless arts and education groups into
their home. There have also been two local shows dedicated to
portions of their collection: one in early 1997 at Cal State
Northridge called "All Figural" and, later that year, an exhibition
of about 80 of their teapots at L.A.'s Craft and Folk Art Museum. But
the current show, says Gloria, is the first to travel. It's also much
larger. In fact, the collection has almost doubled in the last five
years, primarily due to Sonny's enthusiastic flea-market outings,
during which he often will "inhale teapots," along with the
acquisition of several private collections.In 1999 alone, the two
bought more than 1,000 teapots. And if anything, says Sonny, the
numbers are understated.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the appearance of buying for the sake of buying, there is
a certain matter-of-factness about the Kamms' pursuit. Even when they
discuss recent scores, such as a handsome Russian samovar, their
enthusiasm is restrained.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not maniacal about it," says Sonny. "It's just interesting.
This is not a deep, burning thing that has to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Both Sonny and Gloria say they are thrilled about the Copia show.
It's been a lot of work however. The evidence is all around them in
the empty spots on shelves and remnants of adhesive museum wax where
a prized teapot once stood.</TE>
<TE>   The Kamms also have antique teapots dating back to the 18th
century, many of them purchased through the major auction houses;
children's tea sets; and salesman's samples, like a tiny blue elegant
Wedgwood design.</TE>
<TE>   Many 'Novelty' Finds</TE>
<TE>   at Flea Markets</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of their teapots fall under what Sonny calls the
"production" or "novelty" heading. Many of these he purchased on
those aforementioned flea-market forays.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of dress like a beggar and go around and find stuff," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   This group includes teapots shaped like politicians, cars, fruits
or elephants and Mickey Mouse teapots. "I could probably do a 50-foot
display of elephants alone," says Sonny, who doesn't worry much about
duplication, especially if something is a good value. "I could use
them maybe for trading," he says. Never mind the fact he's never
traded a single one.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria is less enthusiastic about this particular area of the
collection. Several years ago in fact, on a day when Sonny was out on
one of his shopping binges (he's since slowed down a bit), she made a
sign featuring a teapot with a red slash across it that she hung in
the garage, front and center. "It's been up there like 10 years. And
you see what good it did!" she jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is," says Sonny, "if we were just amassing wonderful
stuff and not going to the next level--the book, the museum show--I
might get bored.  We want to push this further in terms of exposing
it and learning more." Sonny has even penned a detailed proposal for
a foundation that would serve as a home and lending library for their
own collection and those of other collectors.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several years, the Kamms have noticed an increased
interest in teapots. Programs such as "Antiques Roadshow" and a
renewed interest in collecting in general have no doubt fueled the
trend, they say. EBay, too, has had an effect. "On any given day,
there are over 7,000 teapots for sale," says Sonny. Despite the
teapot's arrival as popular collectible, people don't always get it
when they learn the Kamms collect them. "It's like when we began
collecting contemporary glass in the late '70s," says Gloria. "People
would hear contemporary glass and smile and say, 'Those sweet little
animals they do at Disneyland?'"</TE>
<TE>   "When you say a word, like anything, people have a mind's-eye
about what it must be," says Sonny. Of course, when people actually
see the Kamms' collection, or even a small portion of it, all bets
are off. "Their typical comment," says Sonny, "is they can never look
at a teapot the same way."</TE>

<HD>Stockhausen and Bouman Deliver Sound Ideas</HD>

<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accomplished and entertaining, the duo of Markus Stockhausen and Tara
Bouman--he plays trumpets, she plays clarinets, and both play a
variety of percussion instruments--closed the Monday Evening Concert
season, this week in Leo S. Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.</LD>
<LD>   This was a gentle and varied demonstration of a few of the
possibilities these journeyman musicians have discovered as a duo.</LD>
<LD>   As composers and improvisers, they are obsessed with the effects
of small changes in timbre and texture in the progression of each
piece.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, everything they do is interesting, if not always
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   As performers, they are focused and concentrated on the moment;
thus, they hold their listeners rapt even when little musical
activity is taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Within its engaging two-hour program, the duo played short and
medium-long pieces, with titles like "Phoenix" and "Dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   One, the title of which was not revealed, found Stockhausen
exploring the dynamic properties of a single cymbal, for more than
four minutes. Fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   "Tara," Stockhausen's seven-movement basset-horn suite for Bouman,
held interest through mood-play; she moved to a different part of the
Bing stage for each part of the piece.</TE>
<TE>   The second half of the evening was occupied by a work, "The
Creative Power of Sound," described as "composed and intuitive music
for clarinet and trumpet with electronics."</TE>
<TE>   The electronics proved too subtle for these ears, but the use of
bass drum and tam-tam (like the gong in the J. Arthur Rank movie
titles) added color to the players' flights of improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   There was, in this piece and in this program, nothing startling,
innovative or fresh, yet it pleased.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Plans Plays by Locals, Noel Coward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two new plays by local writers, the U.S. premiere of an obscure Noel
Coward play and the 1997 off-Broadway hit "As Bees in Honey Drown"
are among the productions scheduled for Pasadena Playhouse in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The season will open Jan 24-Feb. 23 with the West Coast premiere
of "Looking Over the President's Shoulder," by Santa Monica-based
James Still. Based on the true story of Alonzo Fields, chief butler
at the White House during four administrations, it was previously
produced at Indiana Repertory Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Coward adapted his 1951 short story "Star Quality" into a
backstage drama, but it was initially performed only in readings and
on TV. Last year, Christopher Luscombe adapted and directed the play
for the British stage. The Pasadena production of Luscombe's
adaptation, March 14-April 13, will be the U.S. premiere.</LD>
<TE>   JoBeth Williams will star in the premiere of Gary Socol's
"Bicoastal Woman," May 2-June 1, 2003. It's a drama about a divorced
woman in her late 40s, her best friend and a younger man.</TE>
<TE>   Socol was one of 14 contributors to the sketch play "The Bar Off
Melrose," produced in L.A. in 1986. Another of his plays was produced
in Massachusetts in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Truman Capote and Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers,"
first announced as a Pasadena Playhouse possibility last year, will
show up June 27-July 27, 2003, in its new adaptation by Charles Busch
("The Tale of the Allergist's Wife") and Kenneth Elliott, a longtime
director of Busch's plays. Set in a West Indies bordello, the new
version is touted as having a more authentic Caribbean sound than the
1954 original.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Carter Beane's "As Bees in Honey Drown," Aug. 22-Sept. 21,
2003, will feature Peri Gilpin of television's "Frasier" in its tale
of a young man who is chosen to record a glamorous woman's life
story. "Bees" received a professional production in Santa Barbara in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   A sixth play for the fall of 2003 will be announced later. Sheldon
Epps, Pasadena Playhouse artistic director, also announced that this
year's December production will be "Plaid Tidings," a revised version
of last year's holiday-themed edition of "Forever Plaid."</TE>

<HD>'Earnest' Forsakes Wilde Ways</HD>
<DH>Director Parker's style is sometimes at odds with the
playwright's, but the film builds up steam in time for the classic
comedy's intricate finish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Oliver Parker so successfully directed and adapted Oscar
Wilde's "An Ideal Husband" to the screen in 1999, there was every
reason to hope that he would do the same with "The Importance of
Being Earnest." But this time he chose not to stick with the visual
elegance and crisp, taut direction that worked so well the first time
around, taking a freer and easier approach that's at odds with
Wilde's epigrammatic dialogue and tight construction.</LD>
<LD>   After a steady start, this "Earnest" commences losing energy and
pace, so crucial to keeping Wilde alive, and the film tends to
meander until it begins to build tension again for its hilariously
intricate denouement.</LD>
<LD>   In short, Parker's larky approach too often jars with the
precision of the material, a feeling reinforced by Charlie Mole's
score, which evokes 1940s swing music that, while pleasant and lively
in itself, has no connection with an 1895 comedy. The result is a
film " that is at best highly uneven and perversely at odds with
itself.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily, Wilde's delicious sense of absurdity and peerlessly witty
dialogue are pretty indestructible, and "Earnest" itself remains a
peerless comedy of manners.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert Everett is Algernon Moncrieff, the foppish, chronically but
imperturbably insolvent man about London, and Colin Firth is his best
friend, John Worthing, whose decision to call himself Ernest in town
and Jack in the country, the better to facilitate his moving between
high society and low life, triggers the plot's myriad complications.</TE>
<TE>   Problems multiply when the name Ernest becomes so crucial to the
attraction Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor) feels for Jack--and
also in the way Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon) responds to Algy,
who has also appropriated the name Ernest for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Judi Dench has some of Wilde's funniest lines as the very grand,
obtuse and frivolous Lady Bracknell, who at one point declares, "The
chin a little higher, dear. Style largely depends on the way the chin
is worn. They are worn very high, just at present." It's the kind of
pronouncement that fashion arbiter Diana Vreeland would make--but
with a deliberate sense of outrageousness.</TE>
<TE>   The entire cast is enjoyable but Anna Massey as Cecily's tutor,
Miss Prism, and Tom Wilkinson as Reverend Chasuble, who love each
other from afar, capture the delicious spirit of Wildean foolishness
most fully.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, there are some glorious sets and costumes--Lady
Bracknell's London mansion is but a tad less grand than Buckingham
Palace--but this "Importance of Being Earnest" is not as glorious as
it should be.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: PG, for mild sensuality. Times guidelines.
Sophisticated family fare.</TE>

<HD>'Memento' DVD Requires an Extras Effort</HD>
<DH>Video* To access the home disc's specialties, the viewer
has to solve an assortment of puzzles designed by the director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are puzzle-challenged, you may find the new two-disc DVD of
Christopher Nolan's innovative film noir, "Memento" (Columbia
TriStar, $28), a frustrating experience. To access any of the extra
features, including Nolan's erudite commentary, the viewer must solve
a series of mindbenders and challenges designed by Nolan himself.</LD>
<LD>   Just remember: Don't throw the remote at the TV set because you
will, eventually, be able to figure out the puzzles. One hint: The
second disc is a lot easier to solve than the first.</LD>
<LD>   Nolan, whose new film, "Insomnia," opens Friday, received an Oscar
nomination for his screenplay for this clever film about a man (Guy
Pearce) without any recollection of his recent past who attempts to
solve the murder of his wife. The British writer-director turns the
mystery genre on its head by telling the story in reverse.</LD>
<TE>   Once you do solve the puzzles, which include multiple-choice and
word memory games, you'll find the wide-screen edition of the film
and Nolan's commentary on the first disc. The second disc includes
some of the same features that were on the single-disc DVD of
"Memento" that was released last September, such as an episode of the
Sundance Channel's "Anatomy of a Scene" series and the original short
story on which the film was based, written by Nolan's brother,
Jonathan. Also included is Nolan's script for the film, and viewers
can switch back and forth between a scene and the annotated film
script.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition of the Cameron Crowe-Tom Cruise mystery
thriller "Vanilla Sky" (Paramount, $30) features audio commentary
that comes with its own musical accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe recorded the commentary for this enigmatic remake of the
Spanish film, "Open Your Eyes," with his wife, the film's composer,
Nancy Wilson. As Crowe talks about making the film, Wilson
occasionally offers her insights into the production but spends most
of the time playing the guitar. Also popping up in the commentary are
their two young sons, Curtis and Billy, who are just as
incomprehensible as the plot of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured on the DVD are the featurette "Prelude to a Dream,"
in which Crowe discusses why he made the film, and "Hitting It Hard,"
a lighthearted look at the project's international press tour.
There's also an "Entertainment Tonight" interview with Paul
McCartney, who penned the Oscar-nominated title tune; a music video;
a comprehensive photo gallery; and two trailers.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   A then-21-year-old Tom Cruise starred in Ridley Scott's lavish but
unsatisfying fairy tale, "Legend." Universal is offering a two-disc
"Ultimate Edition" ($25) that features Scott's own cut of the 1985
film, as well as the U.S. theatrical version.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's version is nearly a half-hour longer but just as lame. It
does, however, restore Jerry Goldsmith's original score for the film,
which is far superior to the one composed by Tangerine Dream for the
U.S. theatrical release.</TE>
<TE>   The edition also features Scott's sturdy commentary; a new
documentary on the making of the film, which features interviews with
Scott and co-stars Mia Sara and Tim Curry; storyboards; a music
video; the isolated Tangerine Dream music score; and "The Fairy
Dance," a lost scene that has been reconstructed through audio, still
pictures and storyboards.</TE>
<TE>   Save for Dennis Farina's riotous turn as an unabashed womanizer,
Edward Burns' romantic roundelay "Sidewalks of New York" (Paramount,
$30) is a wet noodle of a comedy. Burns, who wrote and directed the
indie hit "The Brothers McMullen," stars in this film with Rosario
Dawson, Heather Graham, David Krumholtz, Stanley Tucci and Brittany
Murphy. The DVD includes an "Anatomy of a Scene" documentary that
aired on the Sundance Channel and Burns' commentary, which is far
more interesting than his film.</TE>
<TE>   The less said about the witless comedy "How High" (Universal,
$20), the better. Rappers Method Man and Redman headline this farce
about two street-smart drug dealers who manage to get into Harvard.
The digital edition features a "making-of" documentary, deleted
scenes, music videos and raunchy commentary from Method Man and
Redman that is very offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Video is releasing the digital editions of several vintage war
films ($15 each) just in time for Memorial Day.</TE>
<TE>   John Payne, Randolph Scott and Maureen O'Hara headline the
Technicolor drama "To the Shores of Tripoli." Payne plays a playboy
who becomes a Marine. Scott plays his drill instructor and O'Hara is
his lady love. (Fox has sent out what it describes as a "limited"
number of discs with a black-and-white print of the film. If you get
one of these, call the 800 number on the back of the box and Fox will
replace it with the color version.)</TE>
<TE>   Tyrone Power and Betty Grable make a beautiful couple in the
high-flying 1941 drama "A Yank in the RAF." Power plays a brash,
fast-talking American who joins the RAF; Grable is an American
showgirl.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's called "D-Day the Sixth of June," this 1956 war drama
has very little D-day footage. It's really a pedestrian romantic
drama about a British woman (Dana Wynter) and the two men in her
life: a married American soldier (Robert Taylor) and her longtime
British beau (Richard Todd).</TE>
<TE>   Richard Burton and Robert Newton headline the scrappy 1953
action-drama "The Desert Rats." Robert Wise directed this film about
a group of Australian soldiers--led by a Scottish commando--who hold
off the Nazis at Tobruk in Africa. James Mason plays Nazi Field
Marshal Erwin Rommel, a role he played the year before in "The Desert
Fox."</TE>
<TE>   "It Came From Outer Space" (1953) was one of Universal's best '50s
sci-fi thrillers. The Jack Arnold-directed classic, which was
originally released in 3-D, landed this week on DVD ($20) with extra
goodies, including fact-filled commentary from film historian Tom
Weaver and a lighthearted documentary on the making of the film,
which stars Richard Carlson, Barbara Rush and some ugly aliens.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Universal is a lovely digital edition of the 1972
cult sci-fi drama "Silent Running" ($20). Special-effects wizard
Douglas Trumbull ("Close Encounters of the Third Kind") directed this
inspiring fable, starring Bruce Dern as a nature-loving crew member
of a space station that carries the last surviving forests of Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features thoughtful commentary from Trumbull and Dern, a
nice retrospective documentary, another documentary on the production
that was produced in 1972, an interview with Trumbull and a photo
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Shot in less than a week, the 1951 sci-fi thriller "Flight to
Mars" (Image, $25) is a real hoot. Cameron Mitchell headlines this
cheesy Monogram production about the first manned space ship to Mars.

<HD>Sweeps: When the Shark Bites</HD>
<DH>Television* A Web site tracks shows that go too far in
their quest for viewers. A book and game show are in the works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Babies, breakups, breakdowns: Another frantic TV sweeps period comes
to a close tonight, with ratings-hungry series leaving no ploy
unturned in a determined attempt to goose their Nielsen numbers at
any cost.</LD>
<LD>   This has left a nation of viewers feeling enthralled, confused or
even downright angry. But it has left Jon Hein feeling more exhausted
than anything else.</LD>
<LD>   The industry's periodic sweeps are the busiest time of year for
the 34-year-old creator of the Jump the Shark Web site, the
deliciously addictive forum on which the creative arc of a series'
life span is dragged into the court of public opinion.</LD>
<TE>   With each new wrinkle introduced in a series--changes that tend to
be particularly pronounced during sweeps periods--fans waste no time
weighing in online, giving thumbs up or down to new revelations or
directions. If the fans feel that a show has gone too far in its
attempt to spark interest, they cast their votes that the series has
"jumped the shark," meaning that it's never going to be quite the
same again.</TE>
<TE>   That creates a virtual logjam for Hein, who has been the New
York-based venture's primary caretaker since launching it in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "The site is updated every day, and as the 'jumps' happen, we get
flooded with e-mail," said Hein. "For example, when Will and Grace
were discussing having a baby, or a promo appeared with Frasier and
Roz in bed together, we got a ton of e-mail at that precise moment.
It's an interesting indicator."</TE>
<TE>   For those unfamiliar with the term "jump" (references to it have
popped up on several TV shows), the usage came from Hein's college
roommate, who based it on a fateful episode of "Happy Days."</TE>
<TE>   During a three-part story that sent the whole gang from Milwaukee
to Hollywood, the plot's climax called upon Fonzie to jump over a
penned-up shark while on water skis, leather jacket and all.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the moment years later, the idea for a Web site
(www.jumptheshark.com) was born. It seemed to Hein and his roommate,
Sean Connolly, that the stunt epitomized the lengths series would go
to re-boot their appeal for audiences. As Hein notes, not much has
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Hein said other developments, such as TV Guide's recent ranking of
the 50 best shows of all time, spark a jump in activity on his site.</TE>
<TE>   "The appearance of any sort of list gets things going," he said,
adding that fans often take issue with one another's opinions;
generally, he allows them to have at it.</TE>
<TE>   "The language, for the most part, I let go," he said. The site "is
rated R. But I won't let someone attack someone else unless they're
making a point about a show. I read every posting before it goes up.
It keeps the site special in my eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some thought 'Friends' jumped the shark when Ross and Rachel got
back together for the third time a couple of years ago," Hein said.
"But there are few shows that improve when they have a baby on the
program."</TE>
<TE>   And what does the site's most famous jumper think of the hubbub?
Henry Winkler, once TV's Fonzie, maintains that he has never been on
the Web site but acknowledged that he has run into plenty of people
who have.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the first time was when I was doing a play in New York
and somebody came up and said, 'Hey, have you heard about Jump the
Shark?' But everyone who mentions it does so in a warm, positive
way," Winkler said. "It's a great compliment that something we did so
long ago continues the legacy. That character was bigger than life."</TE>
<TE>   Winkler also pointed out that the series managed to hang on pretty
well for a show that purportedly jumped, continuing to produce more
than 150 episodes after the fateful three-parter.</TE>
<TE>   Folks asking Winkler about the site, meanwhile, could increase in
the months to come. A book based on the site will be published in
September by Dutton, and Hein said he is negotiating with King World
for a "Shark" TV game show. Both projects will open the subject area
up to include sports, politics and music.</TE>
<TE>   Winkler, who just signed a deal to take over production of
"Hollywood Squares" (which happens to be distributed by King World),
said he couldn't be happier for the "Shark" crew.</TE>
<TE>   "See, that's America," he said. "You can only hope that now they
show their Good Samaritan side, because I've got children going to
college, and I hope they'll think of that as they rake in their
millions."</TE>

<DH>Startled by hit films' violence, some parents find movie
ratings unclear and unhelpful</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Spider-Man," a goblin is impaled, a cable car full of children
hangs from a bridge, and a father and a father figure die. In "Star
Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" a mother dies in her son's
arms; a father is decapitated and his boy finds the severed head in a
helmet.</LD>
<LD>   Does this sound like appropriate fare for young children? To some
parents, the answer is a resounding no.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never had so many e-mails about a movie as I have about
'Spider-Man,'" said Nell Minow, a Washington, D.C., mother whose
5-year-old Web site Moviemom offers alternative movie ratings. Her
second-largest number of queries concerned "Attack of the Clones,"
she said.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the problem, as parents are well aware, is that
"Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" aren't just movies. They're
also cultural phenomena, and the child who isn't throwing a
"Spider-Man" or "Star Wars" birthday outing will undoubtedly be
invited to one. There's no escape from avenging heroes, superpowers
or the battles of other galaxies, no matter how far away.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Applegate, a father of two from Torrance, said his 4-year old
daughter Amanda saw commercials on television for "Spider-Man" and
started begging to see it a week before it opened.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure if it was a good movie for her or not," said
Applegate, who had heard that some scenes might be too intense for
children. "I said we couldn't go, and she started crying," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem, some parents say, is that they can't
always trust the MPAA ratings to tell them what they need to know. A
number of media critics have pointed to what they refer to as
"ratings creep," a belief that films are given less restrictive
ratings than previously.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is that the MPAA offers only "opaque" explanations
for the ratings, according to Minow, who has written a book on the
subject. "My favorite [ratings warning] is for 'mild thematic
elements.' I don't know what that's supposed to mean. You need a
degree in semiotics to understand it," Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   The MPAA rates the "Star Wars" prequel PG (parental guidance
suggested) for "sustained sequences of sci-fi action/violence" and
"Spider-Man" PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned; some material may be
inappropriate for children under 13) for "stylized violence and
action." Media critics also blame ratings creep, believed to have
resulted in downgrading movies that would have formerly been R-rated
to PG-13, and PG-13s to PG.</TE>
<TE>   For example, "Midnight Cowboy," which was rated X in 1969, would
surely be an R-rated film today, said MPAA chief Jack Valenti.</TE>
<TE>   The "Star Wars" film's PG might not be the same sort of PG that
parents recall from the earlier films, due to ratings creep,
according to media critic James Steyer, author of "The Other Parent."
"For parents, it's a big problem," Steyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings creep is also evident in language, Minow said. "It's
stunning. Words that would get [a film] an automatic R now get
PG-13."</TE>
<TE>   Valenti, however, said the MPAA panel that determines the
ratings--a group of a dozen local private citizens who make the
initial ratings, which are subject to appeal by the studios--are only
trying to keep up with what is socially acceptable. "Society has
changed, no question about it," he said. "TV is the common
denominator. The ratings system cannot be sterner than TV."</TE>
<TE>   Now parents complain they don't know what they'll find in a PG-13
movie. "PG-13 encompasses so much," said Julie Shy of Calabasas.
"It's hard to find places to go to find out why it's a PG-13." To
help them decide whether to take their 9-year-old son to see
"Spider-Man," she and her husband turned to a comic-book store owner
in Fillmore. He advised them the movie was a cross between the
"squeaky-clean" old Superman type of movie and the darker "Batman."
They let him go.</TE>
<TE>   Parents familiar with the "Star Wars" series said they were fairly
certain about what sort of violence they would find in the latest
installment. But Laura Nuchols of Torrance, who took her children,
ages 10, 8 and 6, to "Star Wars," said she was surprised to see the
decapitation. What bothered her about it was not so much the violence
as its unreality. "It's too sanitary. It makes it look really neat,
fantasy-like," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was the very bloodlessness of the violence that
undoubtedly saved it from a PG-13 rating. "In all the 'Star Wars'
movies, there's a lot of chopping going on," said Jim Ward, vice
president of marketing for Lucasfilm, which produces the series.
"We've had limbs chopped off. In the last film, Darth Maul was cut in
half. Yet it all exists within this fantasy world of 'Star Wars.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's far from us to say whether it's appropriate for kids. At the
end of the day, parents know their kids the best. Every child is
different. As the PG rating suggests, every parent makes the judgment
whether it's appropriate or not," he said. "It comes down to parents
knowing their children and making the best judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Elzer, a spokesman for Columbia Pictures, which released
"Spider-Man," said the studio wouldn't comment on the rating for the
film. "The MPAA rating is a guideline for parents and consumers, and
they are the appropriate organization to discuss the rating that any
film receives."</TE>
<TE>   Valenti reiterated the studios' stance that the ratings are
guidelines, not strict regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "In all of our definitions for PG-13, we say, 'Do not take your
young child to this picture.' Only the parent knows the maturity
resident in their child. They should read Parents magazine, talk to
friends, read reviews," he said. He said MPAA surveys show parents
are happy with the ratings system. "I get a lot of criticism from
producers, distributors, critics, directors, writers. The people for
whom it is designed seem to find it a pretty good compass course for
them to steer by," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Minow and other critics, however, think there's a need for change.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPAA has no special expertise. They see so much of this
material, they have honestly lost touch with the rest of what America
thinks," she said. "They have become desensitized."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a move to seek congressional support for a single
content-based ratings system for all media was derailed by the
September terrorist attacks, according to Douglas Gentile, director
of research for the National Institute on Media and the Family.
Parents do like ratings, he said. "But they would like better ratings
even better."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Applegate said Amanda is still upset that they haven't
seen "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been making excuses. I tell her we'll see it another time.
Or that it's too late," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I remind her that we're going to see 'Scooby Doo' when it
comes out."</TE>

<HD>The Beginning of a Beautiful Relationship</HD>
<DH>Director Dover Kosashvili makes a confident debut with
'Late Marriage,' about a man torn between duty and his heart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dover Kosashvili's "Late Marriage" will assuredly rank as one of the
cleverest, most deceptively amusing comedies of the year, marking the
remarkably confident feature debut of its writer-director, who was
born in Soviet Georgia in 1966 and emigrated to Israel with his
family in 1972. One of a handful of Israeli films that are truly
unconventional and of universal appeal, "Late Marriage" is also sure
to cause a stir for a love scene that is one of the longest and most
erotic, tender and passionate ever to occur in a serious film.</LD>
<LD>   Set in Tel Aviv's Georgian emigre community, "Late Marriage"
concerns a middle-aged couple, Lily (Lili Kosashvili, the director's
mother) and Yasha (Moni Moshonov), who become increasingly anxious
about getting their son Zaza (Lior Ashkenazi) married. Good-looking
and personable, Zaza is earning a doctorate in philosophy and has
managed to reach the advanced age--to his parents, at least--of 31
still single.</LD>
<LD>   It's not for his parents' want of trying: They clearly have
arranged countless meetings with potential spouses for their son, and
he has dutifully gone along but without accepting any of them.</LD>
<TE>   What we know and Zaza's parents don't is that he is caught up in
an intense affair with Judith (Ronit Elkabetz), a 34-year-old
Moroccan Jewish divorcee with a 6-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Zaza promises her that once he has his doctorate he will introduce
her to his parents, but he's kidding himself as well as her. Marriage
to a divorced woman is out of the question in the Georgian emigre
community, and that she is older than Zaza and has a child are huge
negatives in themselves. But they are so deeply in love that Zaza has
slipped into a double life.</TE>
<TE>   Kosashvili understands the power of simplicity and has the talent
and imagination to sustain long sequences of people merely sitting
around and talking. A lengthy and quietly hilarious set piece shortly
into the film finds Zaza, his parents and assorted aunts and uncles
crowding the tasteless living room of a potential bride's family.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion between the two families is formal, ritualistic and
tribal, much like a business transaction and not a little crass; at
times Yasha speaks, in her presence yet, of the beautiful, notably
self-possessed 17-year-old candidate (Aya Steinovits Lalor) for
marriage to his son as if she might be a broodmare instead of his
possible daughter-in-law. Neither Zaza's nor the girl's family is
forcing them into marriage, but they are hoping strongly that the two
comply.</TE>
<TE>   Kosashvili sets a droll comic tone, then follows it with Zaza and
Judith's lovemaking, which reveals the depth of their feelings and a
level of trust that allows them to be completely vulnerable to each
other; we are left to feel they really are an ideal couple. The
director then pulls the rug out from under us with dizzying
adroitness.</TE>
<TE>   Kosashvili is able to generate fear and humor simultaneously, to
maintain a steadfast detached compassion for one and all, and to
elicit the most natural yet fully drawn portrayals from his cast--all
with rueful, witty grace. "Late Marriage" marks the arrival of a
unique artist in world cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: complex adult themes, nudity and
lengthy lovemaking.</TE>

<LD>Here's a menu for the grill that doesn't require marinating time or a
lot of advance work. You'll just need to work the ribs over a little
beforehand, trimming fat and membrane.</LD>
<LD>   The ribs cook over a medium fire until bronzed and sizzling.
They're served with a coleslaw that accents their flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Buy lean rib slabs for easier preparation. And if you have
mesquite chips, add them to the grill to create a smoky flavor.</LD>

<TE>   Grilled Honey-Garlic Ribs</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 10
minutes</TE>
<TE>   Fish sauce can be found in the Asian aisle of well-stocked
supermarkets and at Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup honey</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup ketchup</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon fish sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   5 slabs lean baby pork ribs, about 8 pounds, trimmed of visible
fat</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Combine the honey, mustard, ketchup, garlic, soy sauce,
Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, ginger, pepper sauce and salt in a
mini-processor until smooth, or combine in a bowl. (The sauce can be
made several days ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room
temperature before using.)</TE>
<TE>   Using the tip of a sharp paring knife, remove the tough white
membrane on the underside along the short end of each rib. Once the
membrane is loosened, grip this edge with your fingers and pull it
off. Trim any visible fat. Refrigerate the ribs until ready to cook.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a grilling rack with nonstick spray. Heat the grill to
medium; for gas, place some soaked mesquite chips on foil and put
over the heating element. When the chips smoke, the grill is ready.</TE>
<TE>   Brush both sides of the ribs with the sauce. Place the ribs on the
grill, rounded side down and in a single layer. Cook at medium-low
temperature to avoid burning. After 30 minutes, flip the ribs and
grill until cooked through, bronze and sizzling, 30 minutes more.
Occasionally brush the ribs with sauce during cooking. (These can be
cooked a few hours ahead, refrigerated or kept at room temperature,
cut into 2 rib portions and reheated in the microwave until hot.)</TE>

<HD>When Farmers Go to Market</HD>
<DH>It starts with the harvest. Next day they hit the road
before dawn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Carpenter climbs into a white flatbed truck with 185,000 miles
on the odometer and a cracked windshield. "This is a tough way to
make a living," he says, as he heads off into the misty Oxnard dawn.</LD>
<LD>   It's Tuesday morning, and he's on his way to Santa Paula, 12 miles
away, where he will supervise the picking, planting and care of
vegetables that will be sold at the Santa Monica farmers market the
next day.</LD>
<LD>   Carpenter and his wife, Maryann, are among the best-known growers
at Southern California farmers markets. Their Coastal Organics stand
is a favorite of both chefs and discerning shoppers at the Santa
Monica and Hollywood markets.</LD>
<TE>   In many ways they are the small farmer's ideal: Their family sells
top-quality organic produce direct to the public. Such a life has its
rewards--fresh air and freedom from bosses--but also a host of
vexations. There are the usual farmers' complaints about expensive
land, erratic harvests, seasonal transitions and disastrous freezes.
But there are also some that are peculiar to farmers markets, not the
least of which is dealing directly with demanding customers for hours
at a time.</TE>
<TE>   May is particularly tricky for the Carpenters, who struggle
through several weeks of lower production, worrying that if customers
can't find what they want, they'll go elsewhere. What keeps most
shoppers coming back is the freshness of produce out of the field
less than a day--rare even at the best markets and natural foods
stores. California has roughly 400 certified farmers markets, staffed
by several thousand growers, from million-dollar farming corporations
to mom-and-pop operations harvesting backyard fruit. Here are two
days in the life of one farmers market operation, special in some
ways, but emblematic of all.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, 6:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling into a driveway at the J.K. Thille Ranch near Santa Paula,
a big lemon and avocado producer where the Carpenters lease land,
Paul points to a field of young tomato plants.</TE>
<TE>   "The avocado trees in this block had root rot, so the owner leased
it to me," he says. "I hired a specialist to get out the stumps, but
you see there are still big hunks of roots and rocks." He put in
irrigation pipes, too--a bit of a gamble, since his lease is a
handshake with the owner. Such a deal is not unusual for a small
grower in Southern California, where land is expensive and farmers
may need to be mobile.</TE>
<TE>   After growing up in a family of lettuce and cantaloupe shippers in
Arizona, Paul spent two decades as a harvest crew boss and salesman
for commercial produce houses. By 1990 he tired of the grind and
yearned to work his own farm, but had no land and little money, so he
subleased 20 acres in Camarillo and started raising vegetables Three
times since, suburban development or high rents forced him to pull up
stakes and replant in new locations. Last summer he came here, where
he leases 13 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Paul goes over Maryann's list of vegetables she wants to sell at
the next day's market and gives harvesting instructions to the
five-man crew in a mix of Spanish and English: "We need 125 bunches
of orange carrots, 50 rojos, 100 amarillos, 50 gold beets..."</TE>
<TE>   While they pick, he uses a tractor to "shank" a lettuce field,
chopping up organic material and loosening the soil to make it easier
to work. "I love being outside," he says. "After all these years,
poking a hole in the ground and watching things germinate still
amazes me."</TE>
<TE>   David Pommer, Thille's ranch manager, stops by to trade a box of
avocados for some vegetables. He says leasing land to the Carpenters
works well for him: He had taken out several blocks of avocado and
lemon trees that were sick or old, and it's unwise to replant
immediately with the same trees, he says. This arrangement brings in
some rent and enriches the soil.</TE>
<TE>   This earth is fertile brown loam washed down from the mountains.
Nine miles from the ocean, the location is at the eastern edge of the
coastal climate zone; it gets warm but not too hot, thanks to
moderating afternoon breezes that make it possible to grow
year-round.</TE>
<TE>   There's a definite rhythm to the harvest: A few crops, such as
artichokes and favas, are spring specialties, but in general May is
the cusp between winter crops such as Brussels sprouts, cabbage,
carrots, beets and spinach, and summer crops such as tomatoes,
cucumbers and French beans. This morning, the workers will pick the
farm's first summer squash of the season, round, pale green Ronde de
Nice, a type of zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the asparagus patch Paul points out flats of 275 tiny
seedlings of lettuce ready for transplanting: "You have to time the
lettuce just right to have a steady supply, so we plant some every
week."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Carpenters' 24-year-old son, Mark, harvests fennel
with a lettuce knife, prying the bulbs from the earth with the end,
and slicing off the roots with the side. He strips off the pithy
outer layers, and bunches two or three stalks together with a
twist-tie.</TE>
<TE>   "Picking fennel is a piece of cake," says Mark, who has a degree
in history from UC Santa Barbara, but is considering farming as his
career. "I love the smell."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, noon</TE>
<TE>   When the lunch siren from the nearby Limoneira Ranch sounds, a
chorus of coyotes echoes from the hills. Back at the tomato patch,
Paul sets two young workers, Noe Ramirez and Pepe Fermin-Aguilar, to
the task of pounding wooden stakes into the earth. Using a nino, a
hollow metal tube sealed at the end, with two attached arms, they
will pound down 1,800 stakes, one at a time, all by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had a huge farm we'd get a hydraulic pounder, but since
it's only a few acres, we do it manually," says Paul.</TE>
<TE>   But while the Carpenters may not be able to enjoy the same
benefits of scale as bigger farmers, they are able to realize higher
prices for their vegetables by selling at farmers markets. "I'm too
small to grow vegetables commercially [for shipping]," Paul says.
"Our costs are too high. The only way we can compete is by selling
directly to the consumer."</TE>
<TE>   While carrots are selling for 20 cents a pound at the Los Angeles
Terminal Market, the hub for Southern California's wholesale produce
sales, the Carpenters will get more than a dollar a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As the afternoon wanes, Paul heaves 60 plastic bins of vegetables,
each weighing about 35 pounds, onto the flatbed and drives over to a
hose near the asparagus patch. He sprays the vegetables, still in the
bins, to keep them moist and wash off dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The water stirs a symphony of aromas, mixing the sweetness of
carrot tops, the licorice of fennel, the clean brightness of parsley
and the funkiness of fava beans. Squash and zucchinis glisten, and
even the lettuce seems to preen.</TE>
<TE>   Spying a snail in a head of romaine, Paul flicks it away with his
finger. "That's our organic certification right there." Mark loads
the bins, still dripping, on the market truck, which is much nicer
than the farm truck and has an enclosed area for the vegetables.
"Let's do it," says Paul, and they head home, where Maryann has spent
hours taking phone orders from chefs.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   As Maryann drives the market truck in the dark along the Pacific
Coast Highway, the moon is glimmering off the ocean. She doesn't seem
to notice. She's got customers on her mind. "I'm oversold on gold and
white beets and baby artichokes," she worries.</TE>
<TE>   "Most chefs are good sports when I have to short them. They can
usually get it from somebody else. But a few complain and take it
personally." Her rule is, first ordered, first served.</TE>
<TE>   This month, she expects sales to be a third lower than during the
peak months. But that's nothing compared with when they had to change
farms last year. "We had to start from scratch," she says. "For two
months we didn't have much of anything except tomatoes. It was even
worse a few years ago, when we had a freeze and had to pull out of
markets completely for six weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Such gaps are typical of the challenges facing small growers, she
says, adding that less scrupulous market vendors supplement their
crops with items bought from neighbors or wholesale markets.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some say the recent proliferation of farmers
markets--there are now 150 in Southern California, up 10 from last
year--has stretched growers thin and diminished sales at existing
markets. The Wednesday Santa Monica market is one of the largest and
most successful in the nation--farmers there each take in $900 a day
on average, much higher than at typical markets--but on rainy days,
some vendors barely make gas money.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 6:15 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Maryann pulls into her spot at the northern end of the market on
Second Street. She is the second of 90 trucks to arrive. Son Mark and
two employees, Aki Tamai and Arthur Logan, are already there waiting
and immediately start to work unloading. Maryann hands out lists of
the day's orders from restaurants, 21 in total, and the team rushes
to assemble the items for each order before the chefs arrive.</TE>
<TE>   For Mark Peel of Campanile, Tamai puts together a box with 5
pounds of baby fennel, five bunches each of orange, yellow and red
carrots, eight bunches each of red and green chard and 20 pounds of
favas, along with a case of red romaine.</TE>
<TE>   As Maryann bags and portions out the favas, she discovers that she
has 8 pounds fewer than she thought. "Oh boy, I'm going to have to
short somebody," she frets. The 340 pounds of favas she has have all
been promised to restaurants. They will be sold out before the market
opens to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   As the market prepares to open, Second Street closes to traffic
and Mark fits together the metal poles to support the canopy, a gray
canvas tarp that shields the vegetables from the sun. Then he and
Logan set up the tables and carefully arrange the produce display.
This is the calm before the storm; in less than an hour this quiet
early-morning street scene will have turned into a packed bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the Carpenters' sales at this market go to
restaurants, a higher portion than for most other farmers. Maryann is
a foodie, and she coddles chefs. The Carpenters are constantly
refining their offerings--like a sports team honing its
roster--striving to grow new items that will intrigue restaurant
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, for instance, she shows little Crystal Wax onions
from a trial planting to Terri Buzzard, a chef at the Getty Center
restaurant who is always looking for hot new items.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so fresh and pretty," says Buzzard. "I think I'll braise
them in white wine with chicken stock."</TE>
<TE>   Catering to the pros is good not only for the short-term immediate
sale, but in the long term as well. Often new items catch on first
with chefs, who help popularize them with their customers. "I
couldn't sell yellow carrots at first," says Maryann, "but now
they're so popular many people come specially for them."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   An air horn's blare announces that the market is open for
business, and waiting customers throng the stand. There's a
mini-frenzy over an unusual item: artichokes flowers, over-mature
artichokes that have opened to reveal deep purple thistles. "What are
these?" asks an older woman, a regular customer, while a mother with
a stroller wants to know how they're cooked. Maryann explains that
they're simply ornamental.</TE>
<TE>   A bit later, Maryann tells a young man with a nose ring how to
roast beets. Several customers ask if the yellow carrots are really
parsnips, while others exclaim at the freshness and beauty of the
lettuces, such as Little Gem, a hybrid with the tenderness of butter
lettuce and the flavor of romaine.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, chefs stop by Maryann's "back office"--the rear of the
stand--to pick up their orders and schmooze. Govind Armstrong, chef
of Chadwick, needs more Orbits, unusual round carrots he marinates
and uses in a salad with watercress and endive. He also wants more
super-sweet Sugar Crisp yellow carrots, and he wants them small, so
Maryann rummages through her supplies, meanwhile weighing purchases
and taking money from customers.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The market runs until 2 p.m., but since the most devoted customers
show up early to get the best selection, the action slows at the
Coastal Organics stand. Mark arranges the vegetables that are still
left into neat stacks.</TE>
<TE>   Collin Crannell, sous-chef at Water Grill, stops by, and Maryann
says nervously, "I have some bad news."</TE>
<TE>   "Say anything you want, but don't breathe the word 'favas,'"
Crannell says, looking mock-fierce. He ordered 80 pounds, and she has
only 72. But he's OK with that, and Maryann looks relieved.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The display is down to raggedy ends, and customers are sparse.
"OK, boys, lets pack it up," Maryann says. She is exhausted from
standing on the hard concrete for six hours, greeting customers and
answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   As Mark is sweeping up, William Coleman comes by and collects a
big bag filled with carrot, beet and fennel tops for Pet Save, a
group working with the Humane Society to feed 400 rabbits that were
recently seized from the owner for neglect.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to throw anything away," says Maryann, who is planning to
use seven unsold fennel bulbs in her own soup for dinner that night.
"My vegetables are almost like children to me. Farming is such a
personal thing."</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Organics sells at these farmers markets: Santa Monica

<LD>In the past, the word "organic" has been somewhat confusing. Farms
could be "registered organic" with the state of California or they
could be "certified organic" by an agency accredited by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture--a much tougher standard. Starting in
October, only certified growers will be allowed to call themselves
organic.</LD>
<LD>   For growers such as Coastal Organics, that likely will mean a name
change, says Paul Carpenter, who runs the Ventura County farm with
his wife, Maryann.</LD>
<LD>   While their farm is registered as organic with the state, it is
not certified organic, which involves more costs and paperwork but is
considered by many as the best guarantee of purity.</LD>
<TE>   "We used to be certified, but the regulations proved too
complicated and time-consuming," says Carpenter. "I'm supposed to
make a record of everything I do: I weeded that row, I planted there.
I grow on lots of tiny blocks, and don't have the time or energy to
do all that."</TE>
<TE>   He says the temporary nature of farming rented land also works
against certification. "You need to have multiyear plans, but I don't
know what will happen," he says. "Maybe I'll have to move again and
all of that would be wasted."</TE>

<LD>The following items would like to thank the longer column that has
graciously given up its space on their behalf.</LD>
<LD>   * Americans are always surprised by the huge tails on Middle
Eastern sheep, which were bred for their tail fat. Here's what's even
more surprising: There were fat-tailed sheep in this country 200
years ago. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the
experimental-minded Southern farmers who raised sheep from Tunisian
stock. The reason there aren't any American fat-tails today is that
the Southern flocks died out during the Civil War.</LD>
<LD>   * The only insects the Bible condones eating are beetles,
grasshoppers and two kinds of locust. FYI, female locusts full of
eggs are said to be tastier than male locusts. Locust fanciers have
compared their flavor to boiled egg yolks and to fried baby fish
stuffed with buttered toast.</LD>
<TE>   * Vessels that TV's Frasier Crane probably makes a point of using:</TE>
<TE>   "Flagon" comes from flacon, the medieval French form of the word
"flask" (French has been very careless with its s's). Both words go
back to a Germanic root meaning "to weave," because the original
meaning was a vessel with a wicker covering, like the old-fashioned
Chianti bottle, or fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   "Cruet" is a French diminutive of the word "crock," so it
basically means "a small crock." Yes, "That's a cruet" means "That's
a small crock."</TE>

<LD>Too often lobster is covered with a heavy dressing or sauce. But just
a little lemon or lime juice will bring out its sweet flavor. In this
dish, skip the sauce and stay light.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the salad in martini glasses with skewers of citrus
wedges--for squeezing--and olives. The glasses are especially fun at
a party or for special occasions.</LD>
<LD>   Vary the seafood, if you'd like, by mixing the lobster with shrimp
or crab. Remember, seafood cooks quickly on the grill, so watch it
carefully.</LD>

<HD>What's Best to Buy at the Markets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big summer harvests are still weeks away, but that certainly
doesn't mean farmers markets are dull. Here's a guide to what's best
right now.</LD>
<LD>   VEGETABLES</LD>
<LD>   Artichokes: The leaves should squeak when rubbed together, and
make a satisfying snap when broken off the head. Don't worry about
blackening on the surface if its not accompanied by softening--it's
the result of the vegetable's natural enzymes.</LD>
<TE>   Beets: If the greens are crisp and fresh, the beets will be good
too. For beets sold without the tops, nick the peel with your
thumbnail; it should be thin enough to pierce easily.</TE>
<TE>   Carrots: The thumbnail test is also the best way to buy
carrots--old ones will have a thick, tough peel. Carrot tops are not
always reliable indicators because they can stay green and
fresh-looking for a surprising length of time (if they're wilted,
definitely choose something else).</TE>
<TE>   Cucumbers: Cucumbers tend to wilt, which is why the supermarkets
usually wax them--to hold in their moisture. The heavier the
cucumber, the fresher it's likely to be.</TE>
<TE>   Fennel: Really fresh heads are bright white. The bulbs yellow as
they get older.</TE>
<TE>   Green Beans: Choose beans that are crisp and snap cleanly when
broken in half.</TE>
<TE>   New Potatoes: As with beets and carrots, use the fingernail test.</TE>
<TE>   Peas and Fava Beans: Whether you're buying favas, English peas,
sugar snap peas or snow peas, look for firm, unblemished pods that
are vibrant green. Color and crispness are the first things to go.</TE>
<TE>   Squash: Choose squash that are firm and unblemished. Really fresh
zucchini--as wondrous a vegetable as there is--will be covered with a
fine fuzz.</TE>
<TE>   Greens: Choose bunches with leaves that are crispest. Avoid those
with yellowing leaves or where the stems are cracking at the
bottom--a sure sign they've been stored too long.</TE>
<TE>   FRUITS</TE>
<TE>   Apricots: Most of the early varieties of apricots that we're
seeing right now are rather disappointing. Look for the antique
varieties Royal or Blenheim at farmers markets in another couple of
weeks--they're infinitely better than most commercial apricots,
though more delicate. Pick apricots that are golden orange and avoid
any that are green--they won't be as sweet. Really ripe apricots are
quite soft, but even fairly firm ones will continue to ripen after
they've been picked.</TE>
<TE>   Cherries: Color is the key: the darkest red cherries will have the
best flavor. Be sure the stems are green and pliable, rather than
brown and woody.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberries: When you're at the farmers market, keep an eye out
for Chandler berries--the most popular commercial variety only four
or five years ago but now about as scarce as Blenheim apricots.
Though inconvenient for growers, they have incomparable flavor. At
the supermarket, you're most likely to find Camarosa berries, which
are at their best when they are so dark they are almost black.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no secret that season to season--even week to week--the farmers
market brings inspiration. Right now, just before summer comes
marching in with its profusion of fruits and vegetables, the stalls
are fairly bursting with potential.</LD>
<LD>   There are fresh English peas (maybe as an appetizer?). Tender
young greens (perhaps for a vegetarian main course?). And those
cherries (here today, gone tomorrow) for dessert.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, there it is: a burst-of-spring menu.</LD>
<TE>   Not only that, making the whole meal isn't going to take any time
at all. It's the produce that counts.</TE>
<TE>   The young, fresh ginger root that's everywhere now, and green
onions, just reaching their crisp and clean best, make a wonderful
spicy ginger sauce. Tofu is the perfect foundation, quickly pan-fried
and served with the sauce, which also highlights another gift of
spring--baby bok choy that's so crisp it's almost perky. Lightly
steamed then drizzled with a bit of the ginger sauce, the bok choy
tastes simple and fresh, the way spring vegetables should.</TE>
<TE>   As the bok choy steams, it's easy to put together an appetizer
that mixes the sweetness of newly shelled peas with the heat of
wasabi. Lightly steamed, the peas are pureed with wasabi paste for a
dip or spread. Served with goat cheese and sesame crackers, the first
course comes together in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Finish the meal with fresh cherries--but be sure to get to the
market early. Local cherries, such as Brooks and Tulare, are there
now, with Bings expected at any time. So sweet and juicy, they're
only around for a few weeks, and so popular that they often sell out
in the market's first hours. (Later in the season, cherries will
arrive from the Northwest.) Serve them with their long stems on, in a
stylish bowl or stemmed glass, splashed with a little sweet plum
wine. Swirled through the wine, plucked right from their stem, they
are one of the deep pleasures of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In no time at all, spring has come to the table, leaving time to
think about ... summer. Hidden among today's leaves and stalks at a
farmers market are glimpses of summer--early stone fruit, the first
blush of tomatoes--and more inspiration.</TE>

<TE>   Clean the bok choy and remove any outer tough leaves. Steam until
tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, ginger,
green onions and 2 tablespoons of sesame oil in a small bowl and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a large, heavy, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2
tablespoons of sesame oil. Cook the tofu on both sides until golden
crispy edges form, about 3 minutes a side. Be careful not to break
the tofu and do not crowd the pan. Use a small spatula to turn the
slices. If they start to stick in the pan, add a little more oil.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a 12-inch wok or skillet over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of
sesame oil. Cook the mushrooms until tender and lightly browned, 2 to
3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place the tofu slices down the middle of a large rectangular
platter. Arrange the bok choy along one side of the platter and place
the mushrooms on the other. Pour some of the sauce over everything;
pass the rest at the table.</TE>

<LD>"The '97 Long Meadow Ranch Cabernet--although the '98 is also very
good. I really like the way they grow the grapes--they're certified
organic. The winery is in the hills above Rutherford so the wine has
the intensity of mountain fruit. The winemaker, Cathy Corison, really
tames mountain fruit into a wine that is unctuous and delicious."</LD>

<LD>At the market the other day, I was drawn to glistening, pearly white
filets of Alaskan halibut filling two rows of the fish case. I bought
a little more than 2 pounds of fish, plenty for dinner and leftovers.</LD>
<LD>   Halibut on the grill is quick and easy. For big flavor, make a
Mediterranean paste to smear on top of the fish before grilling.
Combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of minced parsley,
the zest of 1 lemon and some ground pepper. Grill some veggies along
with the halibut. Include a few red bell peppers, and you'll have
everything you need to make this salad the next day.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Morgan is co-author of "Dressed to Grill: Savvy Recipes for
Girls Who Play With Fire" (Chronicle Books, $16.95).</LD>

<TE>   Look for tapenade at specialty markets and well-stocked
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound grilled halibut</TE>
<TE>   1 grilled or roasted red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions</TE>

<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 sandwich rolls</TE>
<TE>   4 leaves romaine lettuce</TE>
<TE>   Use a fork to flake the halibut into bite-size pieces and place in
a large mixing bowl. Add the diced bell pepper, green onions, parsley
and celery. Toss to combine.</TE>
<TE>   In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, lemon juice,
tapenade and pepper flakes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Gently toss
the salad with the dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Split the sandwich rolls in half and toast them. Place a lettuce
leaf on the bottom half of each roll. Divide and mound the halibut
salad on top. Cover with the top half of the roll, arrange on dinner

<LD>DEAR SOS: My Italian grandmother always fixed cassata for family
gatherings. When she died, we expected our mother to carry on the
tradition, but though she enjoyed her mother's cassata, she never
learned to make it. I would be grateful for a recipe.</LD>

<TE>   DEAR JOAN: Here you go. Make it for your mother.</TE>

<TE>   Sicilian Rum Cake (Cassata)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour,
plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a 2-layer cake, cut the cake in half. This spongecake is
adapted from "The New Basics Cookbook" by Julee Rosso and Sheila
Lukins (Workman, 1989).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPONGECAKE</TE>
<TE>   Butter, for preparing pan</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup unbleached flour, plus more for preparing pan</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs, separated</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch round cake
pan.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar in a mixing bowl, whisking
until thick and light. Stir in the vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites and salt until they form soft peaks. Add the
remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and beat until glossy, 15 to 20
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporate 1/3 of the whites into the yolk mixture. Sift 1/4 cup
of the flour over the mixture and fold it in. Repeat, folding in
whites and flour, until the last flour is nearly incorporated. Fold
in the butter.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the batter into the pan. Bake just until the cake pulls away
from the pan, 30 minutes. Cool slightly before unmolding.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 (9-inch) spongecake</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup light rum</TE>

<TE>   1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, grated</TE>
<TE>   Cocoa powder, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   6 candied cherries, sliced, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Cut the spongecake into 3 layers. Pour rum over the candied

<TE>   Beat the cheese, powdered sugar, cinnamon and almond extract until
creamy, about 2 minutes. Drain the fruit and stir it in, along with
the chocolate, blending well.</TE>
<TE>   Place 1 cake layer on a large cake plate and spread with 1/3 of
the filling. Top with the second layer and spread with 1/3 of the

<LD>At Long Last -- Barbecue Sauce for Vegetarians</LD>
<LD>   J.T. Pappy's Gator Sauces are an unusual tan color from their base
of mustard and tomato paste. Unlike most barbecue sauces, they're low
in sugar and totally vegetarian, using a Worcestershire sauce made
without anchovies. Hickory Heaven has a hickory flavoring; the other
three are mustardy chile pepper sauces in three degrees of heat.</LD>
<LD>   J.T. Pappy's Gator Sauces, $3.99, at Whole Foods stores and
Bristol Farms markets.</LD>

cover the tables with these textured paper tablecloths. Cut them to
fit the table, then toss them when the party's over.</TE>
<TE>   Paper tablecloth roll, 4-by-16 1/2-feet-long roll in orange

<LD>For fast, fresh Chinese dumplings and pastries, stop by Dim Sum
Express. This orange-and-yellow takeout stand posts its menu up
front, Chinese on one side, English on the other. We liked five items
we tried: wor-tiep gow, pan-fried dumplings stuffed with chicken and
vegetables; pork-filled sui mai; barbecued pork su gok, a baked
triangle of glazed flaky pastry with pork inside; hom suy gok, golden
brown fried "footballs" of chewy rice flour dough stuffed with
chicken; and, for dessert, an egg-custard tart.</LD>
<LD>   The stand also offers noodle and rice dishes and assorted drinks.
Try the tapioca honeydew, a pale green, lightly sweetened boba drink
with brown tapioca pearls.</LD>
<LD>   Dim sum from 55 cents (crispy egg roll) to $2 (chicken and rice
wrap). At Dim Sum Express, 326 N. Garfield Ave., Monterey Park. (626)
307-5800. 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.</LD>

<LD>There is probably no restaurateur in America who has done more for
the farmers market movement than Alice Waters of Berkeley's Chez
Panisse. From the day the restaurant opened its doors 30 years
ago--five years before the law that created the California certified
farmers market program--its soul has been the kind of simple,
transparent cooking that can only work with the very best
ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   Waters has always been quick to share the credit for her
restaurant's success with the farmers who supply her. That reaches a
kind of fever pitch with "Chez Panisse Fruit" (HarperCollins,
$34.95), virtually a paean to the life pastoral.</LD>
<LD>   "The perfect dessert ... is a perfect piece of fruit, and the most
perfect fruit has to be a perfect peach," she writes. That basically
sums up the book's many pleasures as well as its few problems.</LD>
<TE>   On the plus side is the encyclopedic background information she
presents on fruits both common and exotic. Waters' books (and her
restaurants) are collaborative affairs and a good part of the credit
for "Fruit" goes to Alan Tangren, now Chez Panisse's pastry chef, but
for many years its chief forager. The information on how to choose
various fruits--what varieties are best and when to expect them, who
grows them and where--is particularly valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Blenheim apricots, Meyer lemons and California farmers Ernie
Bierwagen and Todd Kennedy are the stars of this book, every bit as
much as the chefs.</TE>
<TE>   And, as always with the Chez Panisse books, a pure aesthetic
shines through the recipes. There is not an instance of contrivance,
and there are several interesting ideas that I can't wait to try out
in my own kitchen (rose geranium-scented syrup as a fruit sauce ...
mmmm). And I'm already searching for the 120 peach leaves that are
needed to make the exquisite-sounding Vin de Peche (they're combined
with a bottle of red wine, two cups of sugar and a half-cup of
Cognac).</TE>
<TE>   But there are a few problems as well. One is the repeated use of
the word "organic" as if it were synonymous with quality. Although
choosing organic produce may be correct politically and
environmentally, repeated taste tests have shown it is of
questionable flavor value. Indeed, there are many high-quality small
producers for whom the responsible use of chemicals is not only an
aid but a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   There are assorted minor quibbles as well: The gibberellic acid
used on grapes is not a "synthetic growth hormone"; despite Mas
Masumoto's evocative "Epitaph for a Peach," the Sun Crest is
generally not considered the paragon of peach-dom; and the discussion
of organic papaya-growing verges on the Talmudic.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat more problematic are the recipes. Simply put, when fruit
is the star of a dessert, there are only so many treatments possible.
Call it a tart, a galette or a crostata, it still gets a little
repetitive, one after another. And how many recipes do you need for
sherbets and jams before you get the general idea of how to make
them?</TE>
<TE>   These shortcomings are nothing major. Look at them as you the
would wormholes in an organic apple--annoying to the fastidious, but
hardly fatal.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Waters' heart (and palate) are in the right
place: She starts every cookbook, she writes, by opening the windows,
flailing her arms and screaming, "Pay attention to what you're
eating!" Even the pickiest critic would have a hard time arguing with
that.</TE>

<HD>Sealed With a Twist</HD>
<DH>The lowly screw cap is gradually replacing the cork on
high-end wines.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sommelier presented the bottle with a flourish. I checked the
label and nodded. He drew himself up and held the bottle before us
like a religious object, gazing beatifically at a point somewhere
over our heads. Then, with a deliberate, elegant motion, he unscrewed
the cap.</LD>
<LD>   We were at Nahm, one of London's best new restaurants and the
first Thai restaurant to receive a Michelin star. The wine was one of
Australia's finest Rieslings, a Mt. Horrocks 2002 from Watervale, in
the Clare Valley north of Adelaide. We thought it would be perfect
with the Thai feast we were about to enjoy in the beautiful
honey-colored dining room at the cutting edge of London's burgeoning
restaurant scene.</LD>
<LD>   It was indeed perfect, and then some. Its lime-peach fruit,
vibrant acidity and pinpoint balance played in and out of the complex
flavors and textures of dish after dish. And when it was time to
order another bottle, we did so knowing it would be just as wonderful
as the first, thanks to the reliable screw cap.</LD>
<TE>   Like it or not--and many wine lovers aren't sure they do--the
screw cap is here to stay. After decades of flirtation, high-end wine
producers are making a serious commitment to the cork alternative
once thought suitable only for jug wines. And California, the
premium-wine capital, is at the forefront of the movement in America.</TE>
<TE>   By most current estimates, 3% to 5% of all cork-finished wines are
compromised by the cork. The problem is caused by a naturally
occurring microorganism (trichloroanisole, or TCA, if you absolutely
must know) present in the oak tree bark from which corks are made.
The bacteria secrete one of the most highly aromatic compounds known
to science, which can introduce off-aromas and flavors to individual
bottles of even the best wine. A badly corked wine smells like a wet
dog. Even at sub-threshold levels a bad cork can deaden the wine's
aromatic freshness.</TE>
<TE>   Cork-tainted wine has always been like the weather: Everyone
complains, but nobody does anything about it. Finally, several years
ago some Australian producers boldly decided to eliminate corks
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. Horrocks' proprietor, Stephanie Toole, was among the
innovators, a group of Clare Valley Riesling producers led by the
Riesling master Jeffrey Grosset and including labels such as Mt.
Horrocks, Grosset, Queltaler, Knappstein, Petaluma and several
others.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally decided that if we're serious about people laying our
wines down for 10 years, we have to do something about the cork
problem," said Grosset. "It's just not fair to expect our customers
to cellar our wines with the risk that a certain percentage will be
tainted."</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident that Riesling producers took the initiative.
They're particularly susceptible to the problem. "Riesling fruit in
particular is so delicate and complex that it can be tainted by the
most minute levels of TCA," says Grosset.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, many of us have long suspected that the presence of this
piece of wood in the mouth of the bottle may compromise Riesling
fruit even without TCA contamination."</TE>
<TE>   The Clare producers collectively bottled most of their vintage
2000 Rieslings in distinctive blue bottles with metal screw-cap
closures called Stelcaps, a cosmetic update of the French-made
Stelvin closure, developed in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The next year virtually all the Clare Valley and Eden Valley
Riesling producers went to Stelcaps. Last year they were joined by a
number of other producers in Australia. Southcorp, Australia's
largest wine group, bottled all its 2001 Rieslings with Stelcaps
under the Penfolds, Rosemount and Wynn's labels. Several New Zealand
wineries got on board, too.</TE>
<TE>   Early this month, the movement spread to the Northern Hemisphere
when Oregon's Argyle Winery (owned by the prominent Australian
vintner Brian Croser) announced it would bottle most of its 2002
wines with caps. And California's own Randall Grahm said he will
bottle about 80,000 cases of red and white Bonny Doon wine with
Stelvin screw tops. Sonoma-Cutrer has also bottled some of its
Chardonnay with screw caps, and Downing Vineyards has done the same
with some 200 cases of Napa Valley Zinfandel.</TE>
<TE>   By my count, more than 50 premium winemakers--primarily in
Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.--are bottling all or part of
their production under screw caps.</TE>
<TE>   The screw cap is a roll-on, tamper-evident closure composed of a
threaded aluminum alloy cap with a multilayered liner. Compression of
the liner against the glass creates a neutral, airtight seal. It's
been the closure of choice for spirits, oils and other perishable
liquids for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Winemakers have long kept their own collections of library wines
under screw cap because they know that it will protect better than
cork.</TE>
<TE>   The last bastion of cork, upscale reds, may fall to innovation
sooner than anyone thinks. Jeffrey Grosset bottled his 2000 Gaia red
blend under Stelvin (Stelcap's more robust cousin).</TE>
<TE>   PlumpJack, an upscale Napa Valley producer, has bottled a portion
of its Reserve Cabernet under screw cap since the 1997 vintage. Now
300 cases of the 1999 are offered at $155 a bottle, a clear signal
that alternatives to cork are being investigated at every level.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of non-cork closures have long been known. Several
years ago I tasted an experimental screw-capped bottling of Henschke
Eden Valley Riesling side-by-side with their regular cork-finished
Riesling. The wines were several years old, and it was clear that the
cap kept them bright and fresh longer than cork.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most premium-level wine producers have been reluctant to take
the plunge, fearing a loss of cachet if they use a closure associated
with cheap wines. In 1991, Glen Ellen tried a limited experimental
release of Dolcetto in screw top; customer response was not
encouraging. And cost is a complicating factor. The new closures
require specially made bottles and bottling equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Grosset says, "We think the time has come to make this commitment.
We owe it to our customers, and to the wines themselves. The horse
and cart was irreplaceable two centuries ago, and perhaps the fax
machine two decades ago, but not anymore. The same is true of cork.
But we still recognize that it's risky for a single producer. So we
decided to take a stand together."</TE>
<TE>   It makes a lot of sense to me. Still, I can't help feeling bad for
generations of wine lovers raised on corks. Especially sommeliers.
The rise of the screw cap threatens to deprive them, and their
customers, of a dignified tableside ritual that has been part of the
enjoyment of wine since the first cork-finished bottlings some two
centuries ago: drawing the cork, examining it and solemnly tasting
the wine to make sure it's sound.</TE>
<TE>   It could even spell the end of that most noble of specialized
instruments, the corkscrew. One of those rare tools that has only one
application, the corkscrew is an arcane and storied contraption.</TE>
<TE>   In its purest form, the classic waiter's knife, it is an
archetypal artifact, incorporating several of the fundamental
elements of engineering that have enabled human progress: the screw,
the lever, the spring and the sharpened blade.</TE>
<TE>   It even hints at the wheel in the way its parts swivel in and out
of the handle on tiny axles. For the sommelier, it's a tool of the
trade with totemic status, like the carpenter's hammer, the fielder's
glove, the fireman's ax.</TE>
<TE>   I love using mine. Like most of the sommeliers I know, I paid a
pretty penny for it. It's a precision-engineered stainless steel
beauty from the French artisanal knife maker Lagouille. Its fine
weight and polished contours feel good in my hand, and it removes
cork from bottle like magic.</TE>
<TE>   I keep it in a leather case and use it to open special wines, when
a serviceable but ordinary corkscrew falls short of the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   I hate to think how many times I've used that excellent tool to
remove a cork that has irrevocably ruined the wine in a bottle I'd
been cellaring, and anticipating, for years. Would I miss that if the
cork became an anachronism? Certainly not. Would I miss the
cork-pulling ritual? Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s there was a vogue among the so-called boutique
wineries for closing bottles with sealing wax. Getting through the
wax to the cork could be frustrating and messy. I still have a pair
of steel tongs designed to do the job, although--thank God--the days
of wax closures appear to be firmly sequestered in the past.</TE>
<TE>   I hope someone comes up with an interesting tool for removing
screw caps, if only to give the sommeliers some stage business so
they won't feel foolish simply twisting a wrist and pouring.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2000 Ridge California Zinfandel "Sonoma Station," Sonoma.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a wine that stars the art of blending. It combines three
grape varieties from 10 vineyards--Zinfandel from Dry Creek and
Russian River valleys, Petite Sirah from Dry Creek and Carignane from
Alexander Valley among them. The result is a beautifully balanced
wine with a dried-cherry flavor reminiscent of Amarone.</LD>
<LD>   Ridge Zinfandels tend to be leaner than the big jammy blockbusters
that get the highest scores from the wine gurus. So much the better
for those of us who prefer wines that actually go with food. This one
should match up well with summer's barbecues.</LD>
<LD>   About $20. Available at most fine wine shops and retailers, and
also directly from Ridge Vineyards at www.ridgewine .com.</LD>

<LD>Going to school the next morning, Mark saw purple jacaranda trees
everywhere. That made him feel even worse.</LD>
<LD>   "You look out of sorts, Mark," his teacher, Mr. Yoshiro, said. "Is
there a problem at home?"</LD>
<LD>   "There's a problem, all right," Mark answered, and told him about
the jacaranda tree.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a shame," Mr. Yoshiro said. "I'm sort of a tree person
myself, and I know they need to be cut back sometimes, 'pruning,'
it's called. But it must be done properly, and at the right time,
never when they're in full bloom."</TE>
<TE>   "Will it grow back?"</TE>
<TE>   "It should, but when you attack a tree like that, it tries harder
to force out new branches and blossoms, so there could be even more
of them next year."</TE>
<TE>   "Yikes!" Mark exclaimed. "If he hears that, Mr. DiCosta will cut
the whole thing down. He'll sneak out at night with a chain saw
and--"</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa, Mark. Lighten up," Mr. Yoshiro laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not funny," Mark growled.</TE>
<TE>   "You are, though," Mr. Yoshiro answered. "I agree Mr. DiCosta went
too far, but you're overreacting, just like he did."</TE>
<TE>   "But I have a good reason! That tree meant a lot to me."</TE>
<TE>   "That's true, but maybe he has good reasons too. Why don't you ask
him?"</TE>
<TE>   "He might yell at me."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you'll have to take that chance. Why don't you start by
talking about how important trees are and then ask him about himself?
Here's a book that can help you."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, right," Mark mumbled as he took the book and walked away.</TE>
<TE>   "Stacey," Mark e-mailed, "get this: Mr. Yoshiro says I should talk
to Mr. DiCosta about trees and then find out why he's so grouchy!
Isn't that a dumb idea?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about that tree stuff," Stacey replied, "but you do
have to make sure this doesn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Mark take his teacher's advice?</TE>
<TE>   This is Marjorie Flathers' third jacaranda story for the Kids'
Reading Room. She too was shocked when a jacaranda tree near her home
was cut back severely, but she is enjoying the other beautiful
jacarandas in bloom and hopes you are too. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Eminem, On and On</HD>
<DH>The rapper pushes the limits again, with a CD that is full
of revealing moments, even if it's a bit long</DH>

<LD>"I'm a pit bull off his leash," rapper Eminem snarls at one point in
his new album "The Eminem Show," then later confides that his
insecurities "could eat him alive."</LD>
<LD>   It's these sweeping emotional extremes and the ability to look so
colorfully and unflinchingly at both sides of his personality that
gives the rapper's albums a power and complexity almost unrivaled on
the contemporary pop scene.</LD>
<LD>   Eminem's music, built around captivating hip-hop beats and his own
machine-gun delivery, is a pop-culture puzzle that has caused anxious
watchdog groups to condemn his music for violent and sexual imagery,
critics to acclaim it for its storytelling prowess (he has won five
Grammys) and millions of fans to buy it.</LD>
<TE>   In an era when teenagers are fascinated by the chills and thrills
of extreme sports, is it any wonder that millions of them also
respond to Eminem's extreme music?</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit rapper's last album, "The Marshall Mathers LP," has
sold nearly 9 million copies in the U.S. since its 2000 release, and
retailers are predicting that "The Eminem Show" could be the first
album since last summer to sell more than 1 million copies in its
first week in stores.</TE>
<TE>   The new CD, which will be released Tuesday (a week earlier than
planned because of widespread Internet downloading and piracy), is
too long at almost 80 minutes, but its highlights offer Eminem's most
gripping and revealing statements.</TE>
<TE>   The words are sometimes touching and funny, but also often
troubling and ugly--he still exhibits an unhealthy attitude toward
women and employs a couple of anti-gay epithets, though none of the
assaultive imagery that caused the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation to denounce his last album as dangerously homophobic.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the album seems like a continuing progress report on
the rapper's state of mind--leaving listeners to decide which parts
are fictional and which are autobiographical.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the characters in "The Eminem Show" (his dreaded mother
Debbie, his evil ex-wife Kim, his cherished uncle Ronnie and his
beloved daughter Hailie) are familiar from past albums, but he brings
new focus and insights to the songs.</TE>
<TE>   The most chilling moment comes when the rapper revisits the night
in 2000 when he was arrested for using a gun to assault a man who had
kissed Eminem's wife in a Michigan nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   "The smartest [thing] I did was take the bullets out of the gun
'cause I would have killed 'em ... both," he raps in "Cleaning Out My
Closet," a song about exorcising personal demons that carries much of
the narrative brilliance of "Stan," the standout track on his last
album.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem was sentenced last year to two years' probation on weapons
charges in the incident, and he has said in interviews that he
realizes the importance of showing more self-control. The "bullets"
line in "Closet" passes that lesson to his audience at the same time
that it serves as a harrowing reminder of how jealousy or rage can
push one to the edge of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Eminem such an extraordinary blend of commercial appeal
and artistic accomplishment is that he can move from the darkness of
"Cleaning Out My Closet" to the catchiness of pop tunes that seduce
with their cute, nursery rhyme-like charm.</TE>
<TE>   An example is "Without Me," Eminem's new hit single: "Guess who's
back/Back again/Shady's back/Tell a friend," he chants in the song,
referring to his alter ego, Slim Shady. The number is a teasing boast
about how the mainstream pop scene is empty without Shady's antics.</TE>
<TE>   In "Without Me," Eminem also draws a parallel between the
controversy over him and the one surrounding Elvis Presley in the
early days of rock. In the song, and in other parts of the album, he
suggests that his being white in a predominantly black music field
contributed to the controversy (white parents felt threatened) and
his sales impact (white teens identified with him). He raps at one
point: "Do the math, if I was black, I'd only [sell] half."</TE>
<TE>   Eminem also branches out sonically. While hip-hop continues to be
the dominant element, he adds rock touches in places, notably the
sample of Aerosmith's "Dream On" in a track with the same title that
serves as a sort of pep talk to dysfunctional youth.</TE>
<TE>   He even tries to sing in "Hailie's Song," a number dedicated to
his daughter. But his voice is shaky and he goes back to rapping
halfway through.</TE>
<TE>   The album's most painful moments involve his childhood. In
"Cleaning Out My Closet," he screams at his mother, "Remember when
Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me. Well, guess what, I am
dead. Dead to you as can be."</TE>
<TE>   The funniest line in the album is near the end when, in a slightly
confessional tone, he admits he wouldn't let his own daughter listen
to his X-rated music.</TE>
<TE>   You can picture anxious parents and congressional watchdog
committee staffers going, "Gotcha!"</TE>
<TE>   They've been charging that Eminem's music isn't suitable for young
ears since he came on the national scene in 1999. The reason Eminem's
line draws a laugh is because it's so obvious: His daughter is 6.</TE>
<TE>   The question is what Eminem, who begins his U.S. tour July 18,
would say about the music if his child were a 14-year-old boy, which
is well within the demographic range of his fan base.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of teens who buy "The Eminem Show" should listen to the
album to see if they feel they should discuss any of the themes with
their youngsters. Even the most liberal probably will want to address
a couple of points.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy is that there are so many youngsters who don't have
the strong support system to provide such counsel. That void in the
rapper's life is the pain echoing through the darkest moments of "The
Eminem Show." It is, ultimately, Eminem's most unsettling message.</TE>

<LD>Bookstore shelves are lined with self-help volumes about women who
love the wrong kind of men, finding themselves drawn to bad boys who
mistreat, neglect or simply ignore them.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to late-night television, the press appears to have
developed a similar condition.</LD>
<LD>   Today marks the 10th anniversary of Johnny Carson's final
appearance on "The Tonight Show," the date when the late-night king
bade America a "very heartfelt goodnight" before triumphantly riding
into the sunset--literally, in this case, since his home is in
Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   Commemoration of this event, however, has provided many in the
media an occasion not just to laud Carson's three-decade reign but
also to heap ridicule on successor Jay Leno as a pretender to the
throne while exalting David Letterman, ratings notwithstanding, as
late night's true heir apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it's perfectly understandable that someone would prefer
Letterman to Leno, or Carson to Leno, or Cartoon Network's Space
Ghost to Leno as a matter of personal taste. What's puzzling is why
Leno provokes such hostility--enduring barbs from various critics,
among them a surprisingly tart appraisal from an Associated Press
columnist not generally known for wielding a poison pen, who recently
called "Tonight" "a wretched one-note nightly waste of time" and
found it "galling" that anybody tunes in.</TE>
<TE>   The din has been enough to make you wonder if the motivation goes
deeper than the prevailing wisdom in critical circles that his show
is less inventive than Letterman's and his interviews feel copiously
scripted.</TE>
<TE>   What reason could there be beyond Leno's prominent jaw? For one
thing, Letterman, like Carson, is notoriously press-shy, having
shunned interviews for the last several years. Yet the less Letterman
talks, the more critics love him, whereas Leno is vilified not just
because he provides a more vanilla-flavored show--Carson actually did
as well in his own way--but because he's not above campaigning for
the audience's affection.</TE>
<TE>   Carson's own legend, meanwhile, has clearly grown because he had
the audacity to walk away from the limelight without looking back--a
phenomenon I mentioned in March, admitting that I have unsuccessfully
requested an interview with Carson every year since the fifth
anniversary of his departure. Shortly thereafter, he dropped me a
very polite note, promising that his answer would again be "No" when
I made the obligatory call next year. Oddly enough, I took it as
completely charming, even after he broke his silence, albeit to a
limited degree, in an Esquire magazine piece about him.</TE>
<TE>   Chalk that reaction up in part to human nature. Critics and
reporters spend their day being poked, prodded and courted. No wonder
those who can do without our patronage often fascinate us most.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the critical brickbats directed at Leno from some
quarters have always seemed disproportionate to whatever his
perceived misdemeanors against comedy may be.</TE>
<TE>   There is an assumption, for example, that by modulating his act to
suit the broadest audience, Leno panders to a lower (some would say
lowest) common denominator. Notably, network executives have no
quarrel with this, so long as it is reflected among families that
choose to let Nielsen Media Research intrude into their homes--a jury
that continues to find in Leno's favor.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a review of preliminary results for the May ratings
sweeps, which officially conclude tonight, indicates Letterman's show
has made no appreciable inroads into Leno's sizable ratings advantage
despite CBS' pledge to throw additional promotional weight behind
Letterman as part of his recent contract renewal. Late-night ratings
for all three networks (including ABC's "Nightline" and "Politically
Incorrect With Bill Maher") are virtually unchanged versus May 2001,
reflecting how glacial movement is on that front.</TE>
<TE>   A less obvious point is that while Leno gets painted as a sellout,
little is said about others who pander in different ways. No one, for
example, speaks much about Howard Stern shamelessly shilling for
products on his radio show, working commercials for Heineken,
corrective surgery or Showtime series he wouldn't be caught dead
watching into banter with his regular cast of idiots. Sponsors pay a
huge premium for that privilege, yet Stern--the same guy, by the way,
who provides weekly plugs for a CBS sister property, "Survivor"--is
allowed to position himself as a cutting-edge renegade.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Letterman is hailed for his creative genius, yet few
have questioned the host for being so thin-skinned about Leno beating
him in the ratings as well as his reluctance, as expressed through
various surrogates, to take any responsibility for that situation,
instead blaming the network.</TE>
<TE>   Last time I looked, Woody Allen (another tortured comic genius)
doesn't publicly lament that his films make less money than
"Spider-Man" or blame the studio for a lack of advertising. Rather,
Allen acknowledges that his act appeals to a relatively small swath
of the public, a place one would think--or hope--that Letterman could
reach. After all, why not simply accept that Leno is more popular and
enjoy his own success, from a $30-million-plus annual salary to all
the critical plaudits showered on him, as reward enough?</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Leno at least pays lip service to this philosophy.
Asked in 1999 how he felt about being left off Entertainment Weekly's
list of the 50 funniest people (Letterman came in at No. 18), he said
regarding the media skew toward Letterman, "It's like your wife's
family. It'd be nice if they like you, but it's not the end of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   As for Letterman and his media admirers, as someone who has played
hide-and-seek with Carson these last few years, I can understand
coveting what is just beyond your grasp. And while shedding that
impulse would probably make us all more contented, that remains a
trick even the most talented of stupid humans can't seem to master.</TE>

<HD>Alexander Payne: An Eye for American Idiosyncrasy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>He's only ordering a salad, pasta and a glass of wine at a pleasant
beach restaurant, but Alexander Payne does it with the, well, panache
of a native. "I don't speak French very well," he protests,
deflecting the compliment. "I have a good ear for languages."</LD>
<LD>   English most of all.</LD>
<LD>   One of the many joys of the remarkable "About Schmidt," which
Payne directed and co-wrote with Jim Taylor and which debuts in
competition at the Festival de Cannes today, is its exceptional use
of that language. Delicate and sly, able to mix humor and poignancy
with easy skill, "About Schmidt" has an exact ear--and eye--for
classically American idiosyncrasies, for the way the odd and the
normal turn out to live next door.</LD>
<TE>   Set, like "Election" and "Citizen Ruth" before it, in the
director's hometown of Omaha, Neb., "Schmidt" stars a splendid Jack
Nicholson as Warren Schmidt, a 66-year-old non-charismatic husband
and father, just retiring after 32 years as an insurance company
actuary, who, against his intentions and even his will, finds himself
on a quest aboard a 35-foot Winnebago Adventurer to make sense of his
life. It was a different kind of a role for Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing I had asked Jack is, 'I need you to play a small
man,'" the director says.</TE>
<TE>   If this kind of filmmaking sounds like the opposite of the
MTV-derived, excess-is-us contemporary cinematic style, that, like
everything else about Payne, is not an accident. "What I'm trying is
not to be cutting-edge, but to make films like they used to make
them, about Americans and human beings," the director explains. "I'm
trying to be a throwback while still believing what Rene Clair said:
'Cinema is today seen with the eyes of today.'"</TE>
<TE>   A youthful-looking 41, Payne has a reassuring air of intelligent
caring and precision about him. He knows how he likes his French
fries cooked, and he cares enough about "Schmidt's" language that
"the week before last I spent 10 hours with a native French speaker
going over the subtitles, and, because I know the language, I have it
in my contract that I have to be consulted on the Spanish ones. We
spend so much time sculpting our dialogue, it's extremely important."</TE>
<TE>   Though he says "the only reason I write is to have something to
direct" and though he notes that "my favorite part of the process is
editing, where you make the film," it's the care Payne and Taylor
take with their scripts that is the core of their success.</TE>
<TE>   "We just enjoy dialogue," he says. "I can imagine the Coen
brothers working in the same way, taking the light in dialogue, in
mining the American vernacular."</TE>
<TE>   Payne adds a cautionary "you're asking me to describe a very
intuitive process" before talking about why the words matter so much.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to show Americans. So much of who people are and
what they're doing is reflected in what they say," Payne says. "When
Jim and I start to write characters, they're defined by how the words
come out, it's how we get to know them. When film students ask for
advice, I tell them to make sure all their characters speak like
those characters would speak, not like they speak."</TE>
<TE>   'Things Are Often Better Subtler,' He Says</TE>
<TE>   One of the most satisfying aspects of "About Schmidt" is how
subtle the script's effects are, its understanding that pushing just
a fraction too hard would be disastrous. "I'm afraid of ever
overdoing it; things are often better subtler," Payne says. He
considers the typical studio underestimation of moviegoers ("I get
it, you get it, but is the audience going to get it?") to be "so
insulting, so insidious" and strongly feels there's a place even for
things that in fact not everyone is going to understand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important to have jokes only 5% of the audience gets,
only the film geek in the corner laughs at," he says. "It's better to
have 80% of people miss it than have everyone get it if that violates
the integrity of that gag."</TE>
<TE>   Payne and Taylor, who've collaborated on all three of the
director's features, were casual acquaintances who first thought of
working together after Payne's then-girlfriend moved out of his
Silver Lake apartment and Taylor showed up as a potential roommate.
"Just being able to facilitate each other's good ideas, knowing
immediately whether an idea [works] or not," is how Payne describes
the collaboration's virtues. "We can say the stupidest things to each
other--it's an ego-less constant bouncing of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   When Payne and Taylor began adapting the Louis Begley novel that
"About Schmidt" is very nominally based on, "the more adapting we
did, the more I found myself borrowing from a script I wrote when I
first got out of film school 10 or 11 years ago. The idea that got
under my skin then was if you catch someone at a certain crossroads
in life, comedy can be derived from their feeling of alienation.
Finally, all the book ended up providing was the character's last
name and the idea that he has an only daughter who's about to marry a
boob, a guy who has something of an overbearing mother. But I'm
grateful to the book for reigniting my interest in this theme."</TE>
<TE>   Payne says he does write scripts with actors in mind, but not
necessarily living ones. When he wrote "Citizen Ruth," he says, he
was thinking of Giulietta Masina, Federico Fellini's celebrated
collaborator, and with "Schmidt" he had William Holden and John
Randolph ("Seconds," "Prizzi's Honor") in mind.</TE>
<TE>   But he knew Nicholson would see it first because the book had been
purchased by producers Harry Gittes and Michael Besman as a possible
vehicle for the actor. And dealing with Nicholson, it turned out,
couldn't have been simpler.</TE>
<TE>   "He read it on a Monday and I was at his house on Wednesday,"
Payne says. "I have such immense respect for his work; he has a
strong authorial voice rare in an actor. And I do like the idea of
using an actor who's been very much the voice of alienation in this
particular film. It's a nice thing to have."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with Nicholson firmly attached, Sony, the studio that had
a first look at the project, passed on it. Surprisingly, Payne has
nothing bad to say about the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't want to make it, it was risky, and I understand
that," he says. "The nice thing about Sony is that they immediately
said, 'Go and take it, make it somewhere else,' and I have nothing
but good feelings about that." The more common studio practice of
refusing to put a project into turnaround because of fears of looking
bad in the future infuriates Payne:</TE>
<TE>   "That's very anti-cinema, the worst crime. How can you possibly do
that? It's a mischievous act in the eyes of the film gods."</TE>
<TE>   "About Schmidt" was soon set up at New Line (it's scheduled for a
fall release), but even with the success his projects have had, Payne
says making his kinds of films has not been made easier but only
"less hard."</TE>
<TE>   "American movies are now completely controlled by the presence of
marketable elements. For someone like me who's inspired to make
movies that've never been seen before, that makes it very hard."</TE>

<LD>The men and women--all presumably eligible singles--milled about
aimlessly in the dimly lighted club like teenagers at a middle school
dance. Some stayed anchored near the walls. Others, like Randy Pena,
boldly worked the room, stopping occasionally to ruffle the women
perched on the room's large leather couches with his unique brand of
wit.</LD>
<LD>   His black hair was in a stiff coiffure, and he wore a camera-ready
wardrobe of varied patterns. Pena was eager for an audience and spoke
without taking a breath. "I've been on all these reality shows," he
said to one new acquaintance. "I did 'Blind Date,' 'Rendez-View' and
'Fifth Wheel'.... I have a knack for these shows. I just have the
personality for it."</LD>
<LD>   It was a warm Friday afternoon outside the Highlands club in
Hollywood. Pena, who said he is 29 and works as an artist, was among
the first applicants at the open casting call for ABC's "The Bachelor
II." He hoped to win the show's title slot but appeared content to
chat up the female candidates and TV camera crews. "I'm a hopeless
romantic," he told one reporter. "And I love women."</LD>
<TE>   It was the first of five open calls to be held nationally in the
search for a man whom casting producer Hayley Goggin said should be
in "the top 1% of the species." Producers were also looking for 25
eligible women to vie to be this unknown man's girlfriend. More than
9,000 people have responded since April. If chosen, they must agree
to be filmed 24 hours a day, seven days a week for about six weeks.
During that time, the bachelor will date every candidate, then
publicly reject them one by one until he's chosen a girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   While the first wave of applicants waited outside, casting
producers readied staff for an expected onslaught of applicants.
(Ultimately, a modest crowd of 275 showed up over five hours.) "Just
make sure they're over 21," one casting producer said to a staff
member. "If they're under 21, give them my card," a male staff member
quipped. A doorman posted at the entrance checked identification.
Waiting candidates completed brief questionnaires that asked for
demographics, including job status, salary and education levels. One
female candidate, Rosh Shekarestan, a 25-year-old travel coordinator
for the Web site WeddingChannel.com, took a levelheaded approach to
the process. "It would be really silly for anyone to be really
invested in this," she said. "You have to keep in mind: This guy is
dating 24 other people at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   While the April finale of the first "Bachelor" hasn't led to
nuptials, 31-year-old Harvard grad Alex Michel chose to move to Los
Angeles from San Francisco to "explore" a relationship with
23-year-old event planner Amanda Marsh, who is moving from Kansas.</TE>

<TE>   The Great Fitzgerald</TE>
<TE>   As a student at Amherst College, director-novelist Henry Bromell
was obsessed with F. Scott Fitzgerald. He immersed himself in the
writer's rich prose and mythic history and made a summer pilgrimage
to his former homes in New York, France, Minnesota and Hollywood. The
trip produced an article for the school newspaper and little else for
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, however, Bromell's preoccupation with Fitzgerald comes
full circle with the Beverly Hills premiere of "Last Call," his
Showtime film about the writer's final 18 months, during which he
wrote "The Last Tycoon" in Hollywood. The film airs for the first
time Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's been a long journey," Bromell said by phone Friday.
Until now, he said, his Fitzgerald fascination "never seemed to have
any practical consequences." (That is, aside from inspiring Bromell's
own talent for fiction, which eventually earned short-story writing
awards and a spot on the bestseller list. This week, his critically
acclaimed novel "Little America" is being released in paperback by
Vintage Books.)</TE>
<TE>   Bromell's interest in directing a film about Fitzgerald emerged
about 11 years ago, when a friend recommended "Against a Current: As
I Remember F. Scott Fitzgerald" (Creative Arts Book Co., 1985), a
memoir by Fitzgerald's former secretary Frances Kroll Ring. Ring was
skeptical of Bromell's pitch to write a screenplay based on her book.
"I had to convince her I knew what I was doing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Bromell optioned the book for $500 a year, which he
paid dutifully until he found funding for the production. In 2000,
Showtime stepped in. However, Bromell said he shot the picture for
the big screen in hopes that it would make the leap from television.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Bromell said, his work with Ring brought him
amazingly close to Fitzgerald. While shooting the film, he got to
know the master writer intimately, from the brand of cigarettes he
smoked to his affection for fudge. "It was a little spooky at times."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So we're back at Dodger Stadium, L.A.'s longest-running live show,
longer running than the "The Lion King" or that "Vagina Monologues."
Guess live theater isn't what it used to be. About 7, the curtain
goes up. "Please rise for the national anthem," a voice says.</LD>
<LD>   "O Canada ... " the guy next to me sings.</LD>
<LD>   "O what?" says the little girl.</LD>
<TE>   "The true north strong and free," sings the Montreal fan.</TE>
<TE>   "O what?" asks the little girl again, astonished that no one else
has noticed that our national anthem has been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   She can't believe everyone's just standing there, pretending that
this is normal, to sing another country's fight song.</TE>
<TE>   "When did this happen?" she wonders. "Shouldn't there be some sort
of outcry?"</TE>
<TE>   "O, say can you see ... " the stadium singer begins, the second
part of her overture.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank goodness," the little girl sighs.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, we're back at Dodger Stadium, back in the hard blue seats
that never change--fortunately--back into a timeless world of
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "That's $39.50," says the woman behind the snack counter.</TE>
<TE>   OK, some stuff changes. The prices go up and up and up. And,
unbelievably, the snack bar lines are shorter.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, fans no longer need to stand in line for an inning just to
hand over 10 bucks for a hot dog and a Coke. It took 40 years to work
out some of the kinks, but Dodger Stadium is now running at full
speed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the beer still tastes as if it's been strained through
a Clydesdale. The condiment areas are still elbow-to-elbow-to-elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Even before a first pitch, the relish tray is nearly empty.</TE>
<TE>   And those ketchup dispensers? Still not as usable as the old
pump-action models. Bring back the old dispensers, the real fans
plead. Bring back the onion grinders, too.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the snack stand lines are shorter. It's a start.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen the lines this short," I tell my friend Steve.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, the lines seem better this year," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But are the Dodgers themselves? We're here to find out.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that?" asks the little girl. "Karros," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Go, Karros!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. Go, Karros. Go into retirement and free first base for
someone who doesn't ground to shortstop every time there's a runner
at first.</TE>
<TE>   "Go, Karros!" yells the little girl, exhibiting the kind of
loyalty only the very young can offer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the lowly Montreal Expos get off to a fast start, with
home runs in the second and the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers respond with all they've got. Nothing. The pitching
staff has been promising this season, but the Dodger hitters stand at
the plate as if waiting for a batting tee.</TE>
<TE>   Pitch after pitch, the Montreal hurler fools the Dodgers with
breaking stuff. I guess that's what you do against a struggling
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Bury them in breaking stuff and self-doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "Strike 3," signals the ump.</TE>
<TE>   O, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Over in Aisle 6, a balloon dances lightly on the Chavez Ravine
wind.</TE>
<TE>   Only, it may not be a real balloon. On second glance, it appears
to be one of those health aids that wise guys blow up at frat
parties.</TE>
<TE>   This one bounces like a tiny Latex dirigible from row to row as
squeamish wives look up, gasp, then have their husbands tap the
"balloon" out of their immediate view.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, it floats over the rail and down into the orange seats, off
to disturb and entertain others.</TE>
<TE>   In the other direction, over near Aisle 2, some young man is
trying to start "the wave."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone ready? OK, go!" he yells, then waves his arms like a
demented conductor.</TE>
<TE>   You've got to admire guys with a devotion to the wave. It shows a
certain amount of innate leadership ability.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, let's try that again," he yells as his first wave attempt
sputters.</TE>
<TE>   Down behind the plate, meanwhile, catcher Paul Lo Duca, has taken
a foul tip in the most private of private places.</TE>
<TE>   "Foul ball!" screams the umpire, the understatement of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened?" asks the little girl, a scrappy catcher herself.</TE>
<TE>   "He got hit," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Ouch," her little friend says.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, you'll never really know," I say.</TE>
<TE>   They say men never appreciate the pain of childbirth. Well, women
never appreciate the agony of a foul tip to the private place--a
surgeon's stitch to your soul.</TE>
<TE>   "Ouch," moans my friend Steve. "Ouch," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth inning, the Dodgers muster a run, then fall back to
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   So I start to think about what my wife said the other night about
"The Philadelphia Story," her favorite movie, in which Jimmy Stewart
steals Kate Hepburn from her stuffy fiance while Cary Grant sits by
and makes smart remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Great movie, Hepburn throwing her best curves. My wife says it
should be remade, with Hugh Grant, George Clooney and Debra Messing
(of "Will &amp; Grace"). Not bad, as casting goes. On the field, the
Dodger batters surrender without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, half the fans have abandoned their Dodgers, and I
start noticing that my No. 2 molar on the right side is tasting funny
and I should have it looked at soon.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, the Dodgers make a last-ditch effort to win as the
theater audience dwindles even more. The little girl puts her head on
my shoulder, glad anyway to be back at the ballpark, glad for the
good food and the company of strangers, 42,000 strong.</TE>
<TE>   It is inherently human to try to find joy where there otherwise
might be none. Tonight, the little girl finds joy on my fleshy
shoulder at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "For a catcher, you smell pretty good," I say as I whiff her
ketchuped hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," she says. "You smell good, too."</TE>

<LD>Don't Believe Your Eyes</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to size in the skies, don't believe your eyes. You
may be fooled by what you see. Planets in the night sky look pretty
similar to each other. And yet, in our solar system, the planets and
their moons come in different textures, colors and sizes. Spacecraft
have shown us what they look like up close. The variety is amazing.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes the moon and sun are in the sky at the same time. You
should never look directly at the sun, even with very dark
sunglasses. To scientists looking through special filters, though,
the sun looks about the same size as the moon. But the sun's diameter
is more than 400 times greater than that of our moon. Why do they
appear to be the same? It's because the sun is almost 93 million
miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth, and the moon is only
238,000 miles (384,467 kilometers) away.</LD>
<TE>   Try this experiment to see how distance makes things seem smaller.
Hold up your thumb in front of your face. Now find a building or tree
in the distance. Close one eye and move your thumb closer or farther
until it covers the object you're looking at. You know your thumb is
smaller than the other object, but it seems bigger because it's
closer to you. The moon is so much closer to us than the sun, it
looks like it's the same size (or even bigger).</TE>
<TE>   You can play the "Solar System Switch-a-Roo" game on the Space
Place Web site. Go to spaceplace.nasa.gov and click on "Do spacey
things." You can see how the planets and moons in our solar system
differ in size, texture and color. You'll see stormy surfaces,
volcanoes and craters. You'll notice shades of blue, white and even
orange.</TE>
<TE>   You'll also learn how the planets and their moons are all
different sizes. It's a fun way to learn about our solar system.</TE>

Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, under a contract with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>

<LD>Sylvia Singleton started her Washington-area tennis program five
years ago, offering lessons and classes for children 7 and older.
Soon parents asked whether she would make exceptions for some
6-year-olds. Next came requests for 5-year-olds, followed closely by
requests for 4-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   Now her lessons are open to children as young as 21/2. Singleton
estimates that 70% of her several hundred students from the
Washington area are younger than 7.</LD>
<LD>   "Word got out that I was teaching young kids, and now I'm teaching
mostly young kids," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Parents and sports organizers say demand for sports classes and
teams for children younger than 5 is exploding.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents say they aren't trying to make stars or prodigies of
their children, only to teach them when they're most open to new
ideas and are least self-conscious--as with piano lessons or another
language.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and psychologists also say the downward creep, at the
nexus of society's pursuits of health and achievement, has resulted
in some children being adept at a sport by 6 or 7--and other children
who feel hopelessly behind and demoralized at that age if they're
not.</TE>
<TE>   "Five is the general age for almost anything out there--that's
what people are used to. When we started this at 3, it was something
new, and the demand was definitely out there," said Jason Haley, a
sports specialist with Loudoun County, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton said starting tennis as young as possible helps keep
children from developing "mental hang-ups."</TE>
<TE>   Children "ages 2 and 3 are like sponges. They can really learn it.
At age 4, it's too late. They're already choking," she said. "When
you start young, it becomes like walking or talking, it's just the
way you are. If you start later, it takes longer for it to go into
your muscle memory."</TE>
<TE>   Singleton said she tailors lessons to each child, helping build
confidence. By age 6, Singleton said, many of her students can take
on teenagers and win.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Cheamitru, preschool supervisor for the Montgomery County,
Md., Recreation Department, said the growth of preschool sports has
paralleled new demand for all kinds of activities for that age group.
Piano and dance lessons have long enrolled very young children, but
they also have been flooded with new participants not long out of
diapers.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents who enroll young children in sports, dance and other
classes say they help teach coordination and concentration, skills
that help when children start kindergarten. They also hope to keep
their children from becoming reliant on television or video games for
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what my kids do later in life, but I don't want them
to be couch potatoes," Theresa Jaafari said as she stood with water
at the ready, watching her 3- and 5-year-old daughters practicing at
a recent Loudoun soccer class.</TE>
<TE>   At this age, Coach Virginia Young said, children are perfectly
capable of learning basic soccer skills. Even at 3 or 4, children can
see that some are naturally better at the skills than others. That
kind of competition, fostered in an environment in which children
learn about sportsmanship, can be healthy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents express ambivalence about the classes. They say they
worry about putting stress on their toddlers and have nervously read
studies that say children need time just to play. At the same time,
they are wary of stories such as the one told by Kathy Lague:</TE>
<TE>   The Sterling, Va., mother enrolled her daughter in a tap-dance
class for 5- to 8-year-olds when the girl asked for it--at 7. But
most of the other children were 5 or 6. They were smaller and cuter
in their costumes, not to mention more graceful, with several years
of dance classes under their belts. Discouraged, the girl quit.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't put your child into something when they're 3, forget
it, you're done," Lague said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said fear of falling behind isn't a good reason to
get children started young, especially because there's no evidence
that late starters cannot catch up, and there's evidence that early
starters burn out quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is parental anxiety--they fear the other kids will get
advanced. There's just no truth to that," said David Elkind, a
professor of child development at Tufts University and former
president of the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children.
Elkind said children get the exercise they need by playing on the
playground and have time to learn coordination and how to pay
attention to a teacher when they hit school.</TE>

<HD>Faiella's Show Is No Ordinary Thing</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer Betsyann Faiella's continuing Monday night engagement at the
Gardenia is titled "No Ordinary Thing: Excavating the Unusual in
Life, Love and Song." That's an appealing thought, with the sole
exception of the word "excavating," which would hardly seem to apply
to a program ranging in timeless fashion from Dave Frishberg and
Blossom Dearie to Henry Mancini and Rodgers &amp; Hart.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, there was nothing archeological about Faiella's
performance this week, which was very much present tense. Petite and
dark-haired, she enhanced her cool, concise vocals with expressive
eye movements, an engaging connection with her listeners and witty
between-songs patter.</LD>
<LD>   Faiella, who works days as a commercial producer, also has
released a Frank Sinatra tribute album, "Can I Be Frank?" And she
introduced her rendering of "All the Way" with the description of a
lusty fantasy involving a fur coat, diamond earrings and Ol' Blue
Eyes himself. "Remember," she said, "this is a fantasy."</LD>
<TE>   But the most appealing aspect of Faiella's program was the
inclusion of such superb classics as Mancini's "Two for the Road"
(with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse), Rodgers &amp; Hart's "It Never Entered
My Mind" (with unusual new lyrics by Annie Ross) and Rae &amp; DePaul's
"You Don't Know What Love Is" (intriguingly appended to Elvis
Costello's "Almost Blue").</TE>
<TE>   Add to that such witty numbers as Frishberg's "Another Song About
Paris," Leiber &amp; Stoller's sardonic "Humphrey Bogart" and Phillip
Namanworth's hilarious "Chopsticks Revisited," and the resulting mix
was a classic melange of contemporary cabaret at its best.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Betsyann Faiella performs Mondays through June 24 at the Gardenia,
7066 Santa Monica Blvd., L.A., 9 p.m. $10 cover, $10 minimum. (323)
467-7444.</TE>

<LD>   ABC, NPR, CNN Get Peabody Awards</LD>
<LD>   In a year marked by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the 61st
annual Peabody Awards recognized the coverage of ABC News and
National Pubic Radio for its more than 180 hours of related
programming. The NBC news series "Third Watch: In Their Own Words, "
a John Wells production in which police, fire and medical
professionals recounted personal experiences, was also singled out.</LD>
<TE>   CNN and Channel 4 International received an award for two
documentaries, "Beneath the Veil" and "Unholy War." Produced by Saira
Shah, they focused on the terror and violence in the lives of Afghan
women. Also honored by the Peabody board: "America: A Tribute to
Heroes," a star-studded fund-raiser produced by Joel Gallen that was
simulcast by more than 30 broadcast and cable networks.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Nightline" was singled out with an award acknowledging more
than 20 years of long-form news presentation. Other institutional
awards went to Boston's WGBH, a mainstay of pubic broadcasting, and
to Youth Radio, a Bay Area organization instructing teens on radio
production techniques.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Study Shows Gender, Political Bias in News</TE>
<TE>   The media watchdog group Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR)
released a study Tuesday showing that the sources interviewed on ABC,
CBS and NBC evening newscasts in 2001 were 92% white and 85% male.</TE>
<TE>   In cases where party affiliation was identifiable, the study found
sources were 75% Republican--although with Bush administration
officials out of the mix, the remaining partisan sources were almost
equally balanced. Indeed, President Bush alone accounted for 9% of
the totals, which varied relatively little by network. The results
also became more heavily Republican after the Sept. 11 attacks,
reflecting the newscasts' focus on government activities.</TE>
<TE>   An ABC News spokeswoman called the study unfair because the
networks have no choice in the race, gender or politics of those who
make news. The network already has an initiative to put on more
experts that accurately reflect the diversity of the country, she
added. CBS and NBC declined to comment.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Summit Addresses Troubled Ballet Scene</TE>
<TE>   Leading ballet troupes such as the San Francisco Ballet, the
National Ballet of Canada and the Stuttgart Ballet huddled in Toronto
over the weekend, discussing the fate of their beleaguered art.</TE>
<TE>   According to Toronto's National Post, attendees acknowledged that
the "Ballet Boom" of 25 years ago is a relic of the past . Without
glamorous superstar Soviet defectors such as Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail
Baryshnikov and Natalia Makarova, audiences are shrinking. Many of
the big companies, especially in North America, find it hard to
compete in a crowded entertainment market. And the economics of
financially strapped troupes make it almost impossible to take the
kind of artistic risks needed to keep the art form vibrant.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, it amazes me that anyone would want the job of artistic
director of a big ballet company," Grant Strate, first resident
choreographer of the National Ballet of Canada, said in his keynote
address. "It makes so many demands beyond the artistic. It's an
almost impossible job. It's like being a corporate CEO but without
the stock options and the company car."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Monday, the artistic directors mapped out
their goals: combating inaccurate stereotypes of ballet as
"conservative, frivolous and elitist" through outreach programs,
programming choices and presence on TV and the Web; speaking to
culturally diverse audiences by means of new works and new
technologies; and bridging the gap between North American and
European aesthetic standards by bringing the best works and companies
of one to the other.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The four surviving members of the Grateful Dead will reunite for
their first shows in seven years, Aug. 3 and 4 at the Alpine Valley
Music Theatre in East Troy, Wis. Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil
Lesh and Bob Weir, billed as the Other Ones, will headline a two-day
celebration of the Dead called Terrapin Station.... In a new spin on
corporate synergy, KCAL Channel 9 on Monday launched a new
advertising campaign touting its new sister station KCBS Channel
2--also owned by Viacom. Promos for KCBS newscasts and anchors
appeared during KCAL's airing of Monday's Lakers-Kings game....
Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow ("Shakespeare in Love") will
play American poet Sylvia Plath in a feature film from Focus, a new
specialty division of Universal Pictures. The picture will explore
the turbulent relationship between Plath, who committed suicide in
1963, and her poet-husband , the late Ted Hughes.... Julianne Moore
will receive the actor award at the 2002 Gotham Awards, given out by
the Independent Feature Project, on Sept. 26. The honors are given to
a New York actor who has made a significant contribution to the
city's film community.... U2 will follow up its Grammy-winning "All
That You Can't Leave Behind" album with a new studio effort slated
for fall release. The band is planning to promote the new disc with a
CBS prime-time broadcast of a concert at Slane Castle in its native
Ireland.... HBO will show an episode on June 23 of its sports comedy
"Arliss" featuring a cameo by veteran newscaster Jerry Dunphy, who
died Monday. The episode, it says, will be dedicated to him.</TE>

<HD>Celebrate Good Times With the Gang in 'All's Kool That Ends
Kool'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If "Shakespeare for Dummies" is too dense, here's a less taxing way
to dabble in the Bard: "All's Kool That Ends Kool," the latest in a
series of Troubadour Theater Company transmogrifications of
Shakespearean comedies, set to the strains of American pop groups.</LD>
<LD>   This one, at the alfresco Ford Amphitheatre for two more weekends
and other venues later, is rooted in the frivolity of "All's Well
That Ends Well" and the funky beat of Kool &amp; the Gang. Shakespeare
fans who don't know Kool will at least recognize the group's
unavoidable 1980 hit "Celebration," which, of course, pops up here
after all's well ends well.</LD>
<LD>   You won't have to worry about tangled plot twists or Elizabethan
language. All you have to do is sit, grin and occasionally guffaw as
the nonsense unfolds. If you get carried away, you may find yourself
boogieing under the stars.</LD>
<TE>   Director and star Matt Walker's only apparent mandate is to keep
'em laughing, and he generally succeeds. His performance as Bertram,
wearing what other cast members referred to as "a Shaun Cassidy wig"
and then "a Bobby Sherman wig," is a lark, combining elements of
stand-up comic, clown, and least important, actor.</TE>
<TE>   The woman whom Bertram scorns is played by the hilarious Beth
Kennedy, rigged up to look strikingly goofy before her big
transformation makes her alluring to the shallow Bertram after all.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Rusler's initially decrepit king and Lisa Valenzuela's
crafty countess are deft creations, and the few Shakespearean
passages that have survived intact are well spoken. A large chorus
line gets down in the dance numbers and springs upward in second-act
trampoline moves. No costume designer is credited, but the outfits
are outlandish and colorful. The drafting of a supposed audience
member into the action leads to a new round of laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Although connections between the songs and the action aren't
exactly airtight, the cast and the four-piece band on the side of the
stage cover the Kool repertoire well--though at such an unnecessarily
high decibel level that earplugs come in handy. Presumably the volume
will be turned down in later, indoor venues, where it often seems as
if the intensity level of Troubadour comedy is turned up.</TE>
<TE>   The only uncool thing about the production is the lack of
acknowledgement of Kool &amp; the Gang itself, in the Troubadour pages
within the program. Shakespeare gets no program mention either, but
at least an actor playing Shakespeare, who's sitting in the audience,
gets an introduction. The members of Kool &amp; the Gang, however, remain
anonymous; we never learn who wrote which songs.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Kool &amp; the Gang probably earned more money in one night, at
the peak of their fame, than Troubadour will earn in a decade. But
it's tacky to omit the band even from the list of people who get
"thanks" in the program.</TE>

<HD>A Threat to 'Enterprise' Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By almost any standard, the first year of "Enterprise's" mission to
explore intergalactic cultures would have to be deemed a success.
Well-written, boldly visualized and impeccably cast, it has become
UPN's second-most-watched program, attracting an average weekly
audience of 5.9 million viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's season finale (8 p.m.), however, is predicated on a
threat to that mission. Titled "Shockwave," the episode examines what
happens when the starship Enterprise's exhaust appears to trigger a
massive explosion while entering the atmosphere of a planet that
contains a mining colony. All 3,600 colonists are killed, and Capt.
Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) is overwhelmed with guilt. (Parallels
to 9/11 are unmistakable.)</LD>
<LD>   The Enterprise's work is promptly canceled, and crew members begin
to contemplate where they'll end up next in the mid-22nd century's
job market.</LD>
<TE>   "Enterprise" is a "Star Trek" prequel, and this episode--written
by executive producers and creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga,
and directed by Allan Kroeker--repeats an awful lot of the original
show's formula. Even so, one can't help but smile when the
covergirl-beautiful Vulcan sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock)
placidly utters the old Spock standby, "His responses have been
illogical," to describe Archer's dejected behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The season that gave us one of the cleverest episodes on any
channel--when the gym-trim, ultra-masculine chief engineer "Tripp"
Tucker (Connor Trinneer) found himself impregnated by a lovely
alien--ends in a cliffhanger. But not to worry. The mission continues
this fall.</TE>

<HD>'Friends' Delivers Big Ratings for NBC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC's "Must-See TV" past and present--"The Cosby Show's" reunion and
"Friends" season finale--paced the network to victory last week as
broadcasters race toward tonight's end of the May rating sweeps,
based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   With the birth of Rachel's baby, "Friends" delivered its biggest
audience ever other than a special post-Super Bowl episode in 1998,
while "Cosby" held its own against a programming arsenal Sunday that
included the payoff to CBS' "Survivor: Marquesas" (the NBC special
actually ranked first from 10 to 11 p.m., after the winner was
revealed), the last "The X-Files" and "The Practice's" two-hour
season finale. Buoyed by "Friends," which finishes its eighth year as
TV's most-watched program, NBC recorded its biggest Thursday-night
audience in two years.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers nevertheless seemed to experience a bit of nostalgia
overload last week, with modest ratings for other clip and reunion
shows, including specials devoted to "MASH," "The Mary Tyler Moore
Show" and "TV Guide's 50 Best Shows."</LD>
<TE>   ABC received a small boost from the three-part production
"Dinotopia," though viewing dropped each night.</TE>

<HD>Prosecution of Abbott Sought</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Public Citizen alleges that the company
withheld information concerning deaths linked to the diet drug
Meridia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer group Tuesday urged U.S. officials to bring criminal
charges against Abbott Laboratories, saying the company withheld
information from regulators regarding eight deaths in patients who
took the diet drug Meridia.</LD>
<LD>   Abbott said the allegations had no merit and said it remained
confident about Meridia's safety and effectiveness.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer group Public Citizen, which wants Meridia pulled from the
market, said it had obtained a report of a recent Food and Drug
Administration inspection of Abbott facilities in Abbott Park, Ill.</LD>
<TE>   The document indicated Abbott did not report one death associated
with Meridia and that records regarding seven other deaths were
inaccurate, unsupported or incomplete, according to Public Citizen.
Drug makers are required by law to report to the FDA serious events
in patients taking their products.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer group said portions of the FDA report were redacted
and that it was interpreting certain sections based on information
elsewhere in the report.</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen's charges "are without merit, are not factual and
have been intentionally written to alarm and mislead physicians and
patients," Dr. Eugene Sun, an Abbott vice president, said.</TE>
<TE>   Meridia, a prescription drug known generically as sibutramine, was
launched in the United States in 1998 to treat obesity. More than 8.5
million patients in more than 70 countries have used the drug, Abbott
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it remained confident in the safety and
effectiveness of Meridia, which Sun called an "important and safe
option for the treatment of obesity."</TE>
<TE>   An FDA spokeswoman acknowledged that the agency had inspected
Abbott facilities. "We have inspected and if there are problems we
will take the appropriate action," the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   John Wolfinger, an Abbott vice president for pharmaceutical
quality assurance, said, "The FDA's observations have been addressed
and do not impact the product's safety."</TE>
<TE>   The firm's statement said it was confident that all confirmed
deaths it was aware of were reported to proper authorities. Abbott
said the unreported death alleged by Public Citizen was described as
a "rumor" by the person who contacted the company. An Abbott
investigation was unable to substantiate the rumor, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   But Public Citizen said the FDA inspection, conducted in March and
April, "reveals an Abbott scheme to conceal important information
that could establish the causal role of sibutramine in the deaths of
specific patients using the drug."</TE>
<TE>   "Unless this and all other companies engaging in such activity are
promptly and vigorously criminally prosecuted, patients in this
country will be harmed by not having access to the full scope of
information about Meridia and other drugs," the group wrote in a
letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen has linked Meridia to 29 U.S. deaths and has called
for the drug to be pulled from the market. The group said clinical
trials showed some Meridia patients had elevated blood pressure and
experienced abnormal heart rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Meridia had global sales of $200million in 2001, a small fraction
of Abbott's total sales last year of $16.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott shares fell 38 cents to close at $46.63 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Seeking More Time From Its Lenders</HD>
<DH>Cable: Sources say the firm is working on financing options
to avoid Chapter 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK LAKE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp. asked banks for more
time and the ability to approach other lenders to line up credit it
needs to make debt payments and avoid bankruptcy, people familiar
with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia met Tuesday with the arrangers of $8.1 billion of bank
lines, including Bank of America Corp., Salomon Smith Barney Holdings
Inc. and First Union Securities Inc., the people said. Adelphia,
whose accounting is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and federal prosecutors in two states, also plans to
discuss getting other financing, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "The banks may give them some kind of relief but not without
demands," said investor Jerry Paul, who holds some of Adelphia's
bonds in the assets he helps manage at Quixote Capital Management. A
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is more likely, Paul said.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia's bank debt was considered in default when the company
missed deadlines on filing 2001 financial statements. A waiver from
the banks would keep the company from having to repay early the $7
billion it has borrowed on the credit lines and may allow it to tap
the remaining $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia already missed $45million in payments on other
obligations, and the company's shares face delisting by Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia didn't return
numerous calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares were halted for the fifth day on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Niraj Gupta, an analyst at Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney,
Adelphia's lead advisor, Tuesday lowered the rating on the company's
shares to "sell."</TE>
<TE>   The rating reduction reflects the growing risk of a bankruptcy
filing, Gupta wrote, and the "low likelihood" that the sixth-biggest
U.S. cable operator will persuade banks to waive the default on its
credit lines.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is talking with founder John Rigas and his family about
them moving almost $2 billion in assets to the company's balance
sheet, offsetting some of the $2.3 billion borrowed by them,
according to published reports.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-biggest issuer of junk bonds last week missed a
$23.4-million interest payment on 9.375% notes due in 2009 and a
$6.47-million dividend payment on 7.5% Series E convertible preferred
stock; it has 30 days to avoid a default.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a bondholder committee to make people realize that
someone is looking over their shoulder and watching every move they
make," said Tom Dinsmore, who manages about $190 million of
convertible bonds at Davis-Dinsmore Management Co. and sold his
Adelphia holding this year.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia suspended an audit by Deloitte &amp; Touche and is conducting
an investigation into issues raised during the preparation of its
annual report. The company has said it may restate three years of
financial results to reflect some of the loans it guaranteed to
partnerships controlled by the Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigas family owns about 20% of Adelphia's stock and controls
60% of its votes.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas, who quit as chairman and chief executive last week,
remains on the board, as do four other family members.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, which owns cable systems with more than 5.8 million
subscribers, said this month that it would look for buyers for
systems in Southern California, Florida, Virginia and the Southeast
to reduce debt.</TE>

<HD>Accountant Recounts Shredding Instructions</HD>
<DH>Courts: Doc-retention policy is at the center of
Andersen's trial on an obstruction of justice charge for destroying
Enron-related papers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>An Arthur Andersen partner auditing Enron Corp. told a co-worker last
fall that if he ever discussed destroying documents, his instructions
would stem from the firm's document-retention policy, an Andersen
executive testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Partner Thomas Bauer said "if he ever talked to us about getting
rid of documents, that it would always be along the lines of being in
compliance with the firm's retention policy," testified Patricia
Grutzmacher, an accountant on Andersen's Enron team.</LD>
<LD>   The document policy is at the center of Andersen's trial on an
obstruction of justice charge for destroying Enron audit documents.
Prosecutors contend that an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen staff
attorney Nancy Temple reminding the Houston office of the policy was
a coded message to begin shredding.</LD>
<TE>   The policy calls for employees to retain records needed to bolster
auditors' conclusions and the disposal of drafts, redundant files and
extraneous paper.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer has refused to testify, citing his right against
self-incrimination. However, other Andersen executives have testified
that they didn't interpret the e-mail to be a secret instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors apparently elicited Grutzmacher's testimony to support
their claim that the Temple e-mail was a signal to start shredding.
But as testimony ended Tuesday, her observations remained open to
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Matt Friedrich did not follow up by asking
whether Grutzmacher believed Bauer was telling her to interpret
"compliance" as a coded signal. Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin asked
Grutzmacher to clarify the comment during cross-examination, but
prosecutors' objections were sustained by U.S. District Judge Melinda
Harmon.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin expressed frustration about being blocked from asking
Grutzmacher about the conversation, saying, "We're supposed to be
trying to get the truth out."</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from Friedrich, Grutzmacher said Bauer had not
previously offered such an explanation. Grutzmacher said she could
not recall the date of the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she recalled another discussion with Bauer last fall
in which he asked her to comply with the policy.</TE>
<TE>   She also recounted an Oct. 23 meeting with David B. Duncan, the
partner who led the Enron audit team and is the government's key
witness. She quoted Duncan as saying: "I'm not telling you to go and
shred a bunch of documents or anything, but you need to make sure ...
you're in compliance" with Andersen policy. She said Duncan also
informed executives that the Securities and Exchange Commission had
initiated an inquiry into Enron's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from Hardin, Grutzmacher said she didn't leave
the meeting believing that she had been instructed to destroy
records.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that she told the FBI in an interview that she
didn't believe there was a connection between the SEC investigation
and instructions about the policy.</TE>
<TE>   But Grutzmacher also told prosecutors that at some point after the
Oct. 23 meeting, she met with Bauer and asked whether she should
prioritize organizing her files to comply with the policy, or crunch
numbers to determine Enron's earnings restatement. She said she left
with the impression that Bauer wanted her to prioritize the document
policy work.</TE>
<TE>   Grutzmacher later conceded to Hardin that she had no reason to
suspect impropriety when her superiors began citing the policy. "I
didn't have anything that [outsiders] would find troubling, or
anything to hide," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Andersen attorneys offered alternate
interpretations of notes and e-mails cited by prosecutors as evidence
that top executives were growing increasingly anxious last fall that
Enron's collapse would result in regulatory sanctions against their
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had introduced notes written by Temple on Oct. 9 in
which she concluded that an SEC investigation of Enron's meltdown was
"highly probable."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin tried to recast Temple's notes, saying the executives were
only mulling the scenarios that could arise if Andersen's Enron
auditors couldn't concur with the conclusions of the firm's
Professional Standards Group, a specialized unit of accounting
experts.</TE>
<TE>   In related developments Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Andersen was fined $250,000 by the Texas Board of Public
Accountancy for inflating the stock value of a Houston supermarket
chain and for failing to follow accounting rules in tracking the
inventory of another company.</TE>
<TE>   * Andersen was dismissed by the last remaining company of its 15
biggest public audit clients last year--energy wholesaler Aquila Inc.
The firm's disintegration continued with the announcement that 25
newly departed partners and 250 other professionals have formed a
consulting group.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said the splitting off of more
partners was a transaction the firm chose to make, rather than a
further setback in its efforts to stay in business. Chicago-based
Andersen reached agreements for the formal release of the Andersen
employees on May 10.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Spam Filter Blocks Its Notice of Rate Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Broadband offered high-speed Internet users an e-mail filter to
block spam--unwanted mass e-mail solicitations--and then discovered
it also blocked the company's notice of a rate increase.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Steve Kipp acknowledged the problem Monday after hearing
from customers who had read elsewhere that higher rates were on the
way.</LD>
<LD>   He said he didn't know how many customers were affected.</LD>
<TE>   "If there is a silver lining, it appears our spam filtering system
works so well that it even deletes mass e-mails from our own
company," Kipp said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times
reported that at least 64,000 Puget Sound-area customers with cable
Internet links to AT&amp;T Broadband's network would face rate increases
of 8% to 15% in June.</TE>
<TE>   The stories said customers were notified by e-mail, but some told
the company they did not receive those notices.</TE>
<TE>   The filtering problem was detected after some test e-mail messages
were sent in a check of the system, and the notices will be re-sent
once the glitch is fixed, Kipp said.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Buy Parent of Cal Fed</HD>
<DH>Banking: N.Y. firm would pay $5.8 billion for Golden State
Bancorp, expanding its presence in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. agreed Tuesday to buy the parent of San
Francisco-based savings and loan California Federal Bank for $5.8
billion, giving it 1.5 million new customers and ownership of a major
California branch-banking network.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup's $40.10-a-share cash and stock deal to acquire Cal Fed
parent Golden State Bancorp Inc. would give it 352 additional
branches, mostly in California, and $54 billion in assets. The deal
would almost double the number of New York-based Citigroup's U.S.
branches and combine the nation's largest financial institution with
the nation's third-largest thrift.</LD>
<LD>   "This gives Citigroup a 350-branch footprint in the sixth-largest
economy in the world," said Richard Eckert, research analyst with
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "It says if you want to be
a major U.S. player, you need to have a presence [in California]."</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup has just 82 branches in California and Nevada. If the
deal closes, Citigroup's deposit market share in California will jump
from 1.6%--10th in the state among banks and thrifts--to about 6%.</TE>
<TE>   "The acquisition of Golden State marks an important step in our
efforts to increase Citigroup's retail distribution franchise in the
U.S., and in particular significantly expand the scope and breadth of
our services in California," Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of
Citigroup, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Branch closings and layoffs among Cal Fed's 8,800 employees are
expected to be minimal because there isn't much overlap between the
two institutions, analysts said. Cal Fed branches probably will be
renamed to Citigroup's consumer banking brand, Citibank.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to make Citigroup, which also owns brokerage
Salomon Smith Barney and insurance operations, a major player in the
mortgage business in Southern California, because Cal Fed is one of
the top 10 mortgage servicers in the U.S. and one of the top 20
mortgage originators.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Fed is the nation's third- largest thrift behind Washington
Mutual Inc. and Oakland-based savings and loan Golden West Financial
Corp. Cal Fed has made gains transforming itself from a thrift to a
solid retail banking operation, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look what Citigroup got--the last independent and cost-effective
branch system in the state," said Mark Agah, analyst for RBC Capital
Markets in San Francisco. "[Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank of America
Corp.] are going to be looking over their shoulders. And no offense
to WaMu [Washington Mutual], but they aren't Citigroup."</TE>
<TE>   By increasing its presence in California, Citigroup also would
expand its access to the increasingly lucrative Latino market, said
Robert B. Willumstad, president of Citigroup and chairman and chief
executive of the firm's consumer unit. That's important, because last
year Citigroup bought Grupo Financiero Banamex, Mexico's
second-largest bank.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by regulators, the deal also will allow Citigroup to
cross-sell many of its banking products such as insurance to
California's banking consumers, many of them with various credit
cards, home equity lines and investments.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, Citigroup will pay about $16.40 in cash
and 0.5234 of a share of its stock for each share of Golden State, a
package worth $40.10 a share total at Citigroup's current stock
price.</TE>
<TE>   That's a 10% premium to Golden State's Tuesday closing price of
$36.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, which was a 52-week high.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State's stock has risen more than 12% since May 10, and is
up almost 40% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was announced after the stock market closed. In
after-hours trading, Citigroup shares fell to $44.35 after closing at
$45.26, down 59 cents on the NYSE. Golden State shares rose to $38.81
after hours, after gaining 66 cents in the regular session.</TE>
<TE>   A sale of Cal Fed has been expected for some time. Because the
thrift is owned by corporate raider Ron Perelman, known for building
and flipping bank franchises in Texas during the late 1980s, Cal Fed
has been rumored as a takeover target for the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Perelman and Cal Fed Chairman Gerald J. Ford own about 45% of
Golden State. The pair began investing in California in 1994 and they
bought Cal Fed in 1997. The next year they closed a $1.8-billion
merger with rival Glendale Federal Bank, creating the nation's No. 2
thrift.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal was the natural cumulation of Perelman and Ford's
roll-up strategy," analyst Eckert said.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, they are selling Cal Fed for "less than
trophy multiples," analysts said. The sale price is about 11.4 times
this year's earnings, below the 12 times to 13 times earnings other
thrifts have sold for, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Research Ombudsman at Goldman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Tuesday tapped E. Gerald Corrigan, former
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to prevent
conflicts of interest by the firm's research analysts.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman also said it expanded its board's audit and compensation
committees to "assure the integrity" of research generated by
analysts at the third-largest securities firm, as ranked by capital.</LD>
<LD>   The steps came as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to pay a $100-million
fine and reorganize its research division to settle allegations that
its analysts misled investors by promoting shares of companies to win
or retain investment banking business.</LD>
<TE>   Goldman said it was acting because it wanted "to help restore
confidence in our markets and institutions." Analysts must be
"rigorous in reaching and stating their own objective opinions,"
Corrigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman is on a list of major brokerages under investigation by
New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who brought the action against
Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Merrill, Goldman doesn't have brokers who work for small
investors. It caters primarily to institutions and individual clients
with $25 million or more to invest.</TE>
<TE>   The firm was the largest or second-largest arranger of stock sales
and mergers from 1999 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing is pretty consistent with what the attorney
general is getting from Merrill Lynch," said Bob Steel, a Goldman
vice chairman who oversees equities, fixed income, currency and
commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he thought Goldman would have to pay a fine similar
to Merrill's, Steel said he had "no opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Steel said analysts will continue to provide a needed service.</TE>
<TE>   "Research does a lot of really good things for investment banking.
Sometimes we get the initial public offering because analysts get to
the company first; sometimes we turn business down because analysts
tell us it's not a good company," Steel said. Corrigan "will meet
with the department and the individuals and give them a vehicle to
cry out if they feel things are not right."</TE>
<TE>   Corrigan, 60, who has worked at Goldman since 1994, will report to
Chairman Henry Paulson in the newly created position of investment
research ombudsman.</TE>

<HD>Music Giant EMI Reports Loss of $290 Million for Year, Cuts
Dividend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music company EMI Group said it lost about $290 million in the year
ended in March, largely because of disappointing results in its core
music division, and cut its dividend in half. The announcement caused
the music giant's shares to drop 7% in London trading.</LD>
<LD>   EMI, which is home to acts such as Kylie Minogue and Radiohead,
reported a net loss of $289.3 million for its fiscal year ended March
31, in contrast to a profit of $115.5 million a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The loss reflected restructuring costs of about $145 million and
almost $58 million arising from the release of singer Mariah Carey
from her contract this year.</LD>
<TE>   Its revenue fell 8% to $3.5 billion from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   EMI posted a sharp but expected 40% fall in adjusted pretax profit
and said its radical overhaul was going according to plan despite an
industry ravaged by an economic slowdown and piracy.</TE>
<TE>   EMI "faces so much of a struggle with piracy and they need to find
a way to protect themselves. Sales are falling and there are a number
of factors to take into consideration, such as the [retailer] HMV
float not going well," said Martin Dobson, head dealer at NatWest
Securities in London.</TE>
<TE>   In a drive to clear the decks and improve its chances of
discovering top acts, EMI unveiled an extensive overhaul in March,
cutting 1,800 jobs and scrapping 400 artists from its roster. EMI
said at the time it had not paid enough attention to what the
business was really about--generating big-name stars.</TE>
<TE>   Though a turnaround is expected to take some time, EMI said it
expected two or three of its albums to sell more than 5 million
copies each this year, although sales will remain flat.</TE>
<TE>   EMI Chairman Eric Nicoli said a strategic review that began six
months ago was on track and would address the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The recovery is well underway, and this is already a
fundamentally different company to the one that reported results last
year," he said.</TE>

<HD>FERC Probe Expands Into Phony Trading</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Widening their investigation, federal regulators on Tuesday ordered
about 150 energy firms to declare whether they engaged in phony
trades to bulk up their revenues, a practice officials say could have
been employed to drive Western energy prices higher.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it also is
interested in finding out how the sham trades may have affected daily
price and volume information reported by specialized publications and
news services that cover the energy industry.</LD>
<LD>   The trade press is widely relied on to provide an accurate
snapshot of the markets.</LD>
<TE>   At issue are so-called round-trip or wash trades, in which a
company sells electricity to another company and buys the same amount
back at the same price.</TE>
<TE>   Round-tripping is the latest questionable practice to surface as
regulators heighten their scrutiny of the energy industry after the
collapse of Enron Corp. The trades can be used to inflate energy
trading volumes, overall corporate revenues and potentially energy
prices.</TE>
<TE>   FERC asked the companies to supply detailed information, including
the names of traders who engaged in sham transactions. The firms must
respond by May 31.</TE>
<TE>   FERC previously ordered power sellers to state whether they
engaged in any of the power-trading ploys designed to manipulate the
California market that were revealed in recently released Enron
memos. Those responses are due today.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies have acknowledged that they engaged in phony
trades, to varying degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources Inc. said it used such trades in electricity and
natural gas to inflate its revenue by about 10% in the last three
years, and on Tuesday the Houston company and its parent, Reliant
Energy Inc., restated 2001 first-quarter revenue down by $1.2
billion. For Reliant Resources, that represented a 9.2% decrease in
revenue, and for Reliant Energy a 12.4% reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies said financial statements for 1999, 2000 and 2001
would be reissued to eliminate inflation caused by wash trades.</TE>
<TE>   CMS Energy Corp. also reported a significant amount of such
trading. Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Williams Cos. and Aquila
Inc. said their wash trading was very limited and did not affect
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is very funky," said a FERC official, who asked not to
be identified. "You could simply start trading and have an agreement
to trade at a higher and higher price."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a
broad investigation to determine whether companies used phony trading
to mislead investors about their prospects. The SEC is investigating
round-trip trades in several industries, said Charles Niemeier, a
senior enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   "We first found round-tripping transactions in the dot-com
companies, but no one industry has a monopoly," Niemeier said.</TE>
<TE>   "If wash sales are used as a way to inflate revenue for financial
reporting purposes, and as a result, investors are misled as to a
material issue, that would be a securities law violation," he added.
"If done intentionally, it would be fraud."</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the practice on energy markets remains unclear,
although it has the potential for harm.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if two companies agree to buy and sell at gradually
escalating prices, they could create the impression that the market
is headed up. The two companies would not make money on the wash
trades because they would be buying back the energy at the same
price. However, they then could sell power to other buyers at a
higher price, if their strategy succeeded in driving up the market.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this type of manipulative trading activity is but the
tip of the iceberg," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said such sham transactions provide
more evidence that FERC should retain price caps in Western
electricity markets and refund electricity overcharges and order the
renegotiation of California's long-term contracts with generators.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said FERC is "finally taking small steps and
asking some of the right questions as it pieces together the puzzle
about what happened in California."</TE>
<TE>   One of the leading energy trade publications said it has been
reporting about the practice for several months, and that its price
surveys were not distorted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident our indexes haven't been manipulated in any
significant way," said Brian Jordan, an editor with Platts. "We have
a very broad and deep survey, and that's the best protection against
manipulation."</TE>

<HD>Drexler to Step Down at Gap</HD>
<DH>Resignation comes as the ailing retailer refocuses on the
basics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millard "Mickey" Drexler, the legendary merchant who built Gap Inc.
from a single shop into the nation's largest chain of specialty
clothing stores, said Tuesday that he will step down as chief
executive of the struggling company.</LD>
<LD>   Drexler, 57, will leave the San Francisco-based company as soon as
a replacement as president and CEO is found, Gap Chairman Donald
Fisher announced after the board's quarterly meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts praised Drexler. "He's really what made the company what
it is," said Elizabeth Pierce, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan
Securities. "I was as shell-shocked by the announcement as the next
person."</LD>
<TE>   Drexler was hired by the Fisher family to run Gap in 1983, helping
to build the company into an empire of more than 4,200 stores
operating as Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic. Once an icon of the
casual crowd, Gap recently has been struggling after what analysts
say was too much expansion and an attempt to woo a younger, trendier
shopper.</TE>
<TE>   More than two years of declining sales have led to the company
losing more than half its stock value. To reverse flagging sales, the
firm had begun to refocus on basic apparel, including basic jeans,
khakis, white shirts and classic T-shirts that once held Gap in good
stead.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts describe Drexler, who had been with the company 19 years,
as a "brilliant merchant" who was tripped up by an attempt to make
Gap apparel more fashionable, an ill-fated strategy that forced the
company to compete with a growing number of retailers now targeting
the teen market.</TE>
<TE>   And as Gap steered off course, discounters such as Target and
Wal-Mart became more skilled at offering basic apparel at lower
prices.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Tuesday, Drexler said the "time is right"
for him to move on and for Gap to hire a new leader.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved being close to merchandise, customers and the
creative parts of our business," he said. "In a company the size of
ours, the broader demands of being CEO have pulled me away from the
things I'm most passionate about."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Drexler nor other company executives would comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   Drexler became CEO in 1995 and one of the nation's highest- paid
executives, earning more than $41.9 million in salary, bonuses and
options from 1998 to 2000. According to filings, on March 15 he owned
3% of the company, worth $420 million at Monday's closing.</TE>
<TE>   Gap shares fell 33 cents to $16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares fell further in after-hours trading when the retirement
was announced.</TE>
<TE>   Retail experts, meanwhile, scrambled to analyze what the departure
means for a company that some think has lost its identity.</TE>
<TE>   "[Drexler] has been trying to get out of neutral for a couple of
years now," said Candace Corlett, a partner with WSL Strategic
Retail, a retail consulting firm in New York.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether Gap will manage to win back the customers
it has lost, including many baby boomers who had helped build the
brand. Customers who wanted more classic looks seemed to disapprove
of Gap's investment in trendy offerings such as hip-huggers.</TE>
<TE>   In a bow to older customers and those with less-than-ideal bodies,
executives said in a recent conference call that the fit of its pants
now will be more "democratic," and pants will have more stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We've certainly turned off a number of our customers in the last
couple of years when they couldn't find what they wanted to find,"
Drexler said during a conference call Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Gap is one of a number of retailers that have felt the wrath of
older customers after going too far to lure young customers. Others
that have gone astray and then hastily regrouped--with varying
success--include Talbots, Ann Taylor and Nordstrom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty unfortunate that a chain has to reach the financial
desperation the Gap is in for it to wake up and realize there's a
huge audience with more discretionary income than people in their
teens and 20s and 30s, and it's the baby boomer audience," Corlett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's stock has lost 53% of its value over the last year, although
it is up 15% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Drexler won praise Tuesday for his overall performance at Gap.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really the vision behind creating the great basics they were
known for," analyst Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an absolutely gifted motivator," Corlett said. "His
philosophy was, 'It can always be better.' When the Gap was at its
peak, he still knew it could be better."</TE>
<TE>   In one move to right itself, Gap last month launched a new set of
television commercials, including one directed by the Coen brothers
and featuring Dennis Hopper and Christina Ricci. The 30-second films
are running this month during a string of popular programs.</TE>
<TE>   Gap also has trimmed its expansion plans to 170 to 190 store
openings this year, from an earlier goal of as many as 280 new
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives acknowledged to analysts last week that their
results had not yet caught up with their efforts to improve.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended May 2, earnings dropped 68% while sales
dropped 9% to $2.9 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year--a
key industry indicator--were down 17% for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company lost $8million, or a penny a share,
including special charges of $204 million. Drexler has called 2001
the company's "most difficult year ever."</TE>

<HD>Global's Creditors Seek Alternatives</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: Committee says it prefers a
restructuring of the fiber-optic network operator rather than an
offer from two Asian companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. creditors favor a plan to let the fiber-optic
network operator remain independent after emerging from bankruptcy,
rather than an offer from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and another Asian
company.</LD>
<LD>   "We're much more excited about the prospect of a stand-alone
restructuring than the Hutchison-ST Telemedia offer," said Edward
Weisfelner, a lawyer representing the creditors committee.</LD>
<LD>   The plan considered by creditors involves injecting $300 million
to $500 million into Global Crossing. Weisfelner declined to comment.
Global Crossing spokeswoman Cynthia Artin also declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Hutchison Whampoa, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia had until Tuesday to make a formal offer to
buy 79% of the company, which is based in Bermuda and run from
offices in Madison, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The companies may miss that deadline.</TE>
<TE>   If Hutchison and ST Telemedia miss the deadline, they may forfeit
the right to a breakup fee of $30million that an alternate buyer
would have to pay to scuttle their offer.</TE>
<TE>   The companies remained in discussions through late Tuesday,
representatives of Hutchison and ST Telemedia said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors
Jan. 28, listing $12.4 billion in debt and saying Hutchison and ST
Telemedia would pay $750 million for the stake. Creditors say the bid
is too low and prefer a higher offer or a plan to infuse cash into
Global Crossing in exchange for ownership of the restructured
company, a lawyer for the creditors said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 investors have expressed interest in Global
Crossing's assets, Chief Executive Officer John Legere said earlier
this month. Prospective bidders have until June 20 to submit an
offer.</TE>
<TE>   If more than one bid is received, Global Crossing's lawyers will
hold an auction July 8. The restructuring plan will be considered
along with any bids.</TE>
<TE>   "Any number of other bidders could turn the auction very
competitive," Weisfelner said. "We have a couple of very exciting
strategic bidders as well as some financial players."</TE>
<TE>   Private equity firms Texas Pacific Group and Gores Technology
Group also have considered bidding, people familiar with the
companies have said. Platinum Equity also has said it's interested in
all or part of the 27-country network.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies interested in Global Crossing include Verizon
Communications Inc., BT Group and Deutsche Telekom, according to an
e-mail sent to potential bidders by Global Crossing's lawyers and
published in the New York Times in April.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon spokesman Peter Thonis declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fiber Optek Interconnect Corp., a closely held telecommunications
company, on Monday disclosed details of its plan to reorganize Global
Crossing, creating a company with a book value of $9.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, secured creditors would receive $250 million in
cash and 28% of the company's equity.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison Group Managing Director Canning Fok said in an interview
last month that his company also may bid for Asia Global Crossing
Ltd. The company, 59%-owned by Global Crossing, hired Lazard Freres
to help raise money to stave off a cash crunch.</TE>

<HD>Gold Regains Its Appeal as Prices Reach Highs</HD>
<DH>Futures: Metal is up 13% this year amid global unease. Some
experts say rally could continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold prices and gold-mining stocks are hitting multiyear highs,
boosting interest in one of the most ignored market sectors of the
1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Amid continuing worries about terrorist activity worldwide and
general uncertainty about the economy and markets, jittery investors
in the United States and abroad have pushed gold prices to their
highest level in more than two years.</LD>
<LD>   Near-term gold futures in New York surged $5.10 an ounce Monday
and inched up 10 cents to close at $315.80 an ounce Tuesday, the
highest price since February 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Gold is up 13% year to date. Meanwhile, shares of most gold-mining
firms and mutual funds that focus on those stocks have racked up much
bigger gains. The average gold fund was up 59% this year through
Friday, according to Morningstar Inc. By contrast, the average
diversified U.S. stock fund was down 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Through a combination of stellar returns and investor inflows,
assets in gold-oriented stock mutual funds swelled to $3.14 billion
by the end of April from $1.93 billion at year end, according to fund
tracker Lipper Inc. in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   About $361 million of that growth has come from inflows, meaning
new cash invested minus redemptions, Lipper estimated. That's a hefty
sum for a small fund sector.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous gold rallies have fizzled over the last 20 years, and
gold remains one of the tiniest stock fund categories, representing
just 1% of total industry assets, Lipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold lost its classic "safe haven" status in the boom years of the
1990s, but its appeal has blossomed again. Some gold fund managers
say that with supplies low and international tensions high, the
sector's rally could continue.</TE>
<TE>   "People have discovered it's a good time to be diversified, with
3% to 5% of your portfolio in gold," said Frank Holmes, co-manager of
two of this year's hottest stock funds, U.S. Global Investors Gold
Shares, up 95.2% through Monday; and U.S. Global Investors World
Gold, up 88.4%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot of skepticism," Holmes said, "but investors
are starting to believe in this rally."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes said gold fund cash inflows have heated up in recent weeks
at San Antonio-based U.S. Global Investors Inc. Combined inflows into
the two funds have soared from about $10,000 a day in February to
about $1 million a day in the last two weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Message boards at Web sites such as Morningstar (www
.morningstar.com) and Yahoo's finance channel (www.yahoo.com) are
starting to buzz with gold chat.</TE>
<TE>   Said one recent Morningstar posting, "I first posted about gold
stocks in September. I got laughed off the board. I'd like to chat
with the doubters now."</TE>
<TE>   Another wondered, "Is it too late to profit from the gold bubble?"</TE>
<TE>   Fund managers say there are several reasons for the gold
rally--and several reasons it could continue.</TE>
<TE>   Shanquan Li, manager of the Oppenheimer Gold &amp; Special Minerals
Fund (up 48.1% year to date through Monday), said gold producers
aren't rushing to lock in current prices with long-term contracts,
signaling that they anticipate higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   Bullion also may be rising in anticipation of inflation eventually
reemerging in the U.S. as the economy recovers, Li said. As a
tangible asset, gold is viewed as a traditional hedge against
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   But the main reason is international chaos, Li said. Pakistan and
India could be on the brink of war, Israeli-Palestinian tensions
haven't dampened much if at all, and Vice President Dick Cheney and
other administration officials have warned that new terrorist attacks
in the U.S. are possible.</TE>
<TE>   "When people get scared, they often rush to gold," Li said.</TE>
<TE>   International developments will play a huge role in whether the
gold rally continues, Li said. "If nothing happens with India and
Pakistan or in the Middle East, eventually gold could stay flat or
fall back a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes agreed that geopolitics will be a key factor, noting that
if the U.S. increases its deficit spending in part to battle
terrorists, that could spur an inflationary cycle. The dollar's
recent weakness also is boosting gold, as foreign investors'
confidence in holding dollars may be waning.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese investors, in particular, have been stocking up on gold,
concerned about the softening U.S. dollar as well as their own
uncertain economy, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, gold traders believe global central bankers may abate
their selling of gold reserves, which surged in the 1990s and helped
depress the metal's price.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes said gold could hit $400 an ounce within the next 18
months. And because gold-mining stocks trade like options--typically
leveraged 3 or 4 to 1 against the price of gold bullion--that could
translate to a 75% to 100% gain for gold stocks from current levels,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investor skepticism abounds.</TE>
<TE>   Gold fund inflows "are not what you might expect given the recent
performance," said Bob Adler, head of AMG Data Services in Arcata,
Calif. Twenty years of laggard performance could be a big reason for
the tentative embrace, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some postings on Morningstar's site question the strategy of using
gold to guard against inflation. Inflation-protected Treasury
securities "have displaced precious metals as an inflation hedge,"
one said.</TE>
<TE>   A posting Tuesday on Yahoo's message board for Newmont Mining
suggested--perhaps lightheartedly--that the rally may have run its
course: "CNBC is going to cover gold stocks? If that's not a sign to
sell, I don't know what is. Run! Run away! Closing my long positions
now!"</TE>

<HD>Earnings Rise at Home Depot, Target and Staples in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Retail: Stores lowered expenses and inventories amid
concerns consumer spending may moderate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. on Tuesday reported robust earnings
for the fiscal first quarter but offered conservative outlooks that
disappointed investors.</LD>
<LD>   Staples, the No. 2 U.S. office-supplies retailer, also reported
strong profit growth, helped by the company reining in expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer, said profit
jumped 35% to $856 million, or 36cents a share, beating analysts'
expectations of 33 cents.</LD>
<TE>   But the company's shares fell more than 7% on concerns that it did
not raise its forecast for the current quarter or full year, as
second-ranked rival Lowe's Cos. did Monday, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial
average, fell $3.60 to $44.90. On Monday, the shares rose slightly
and some analysts raised their earnings estimates after Lowe's
reported a 54% jump in quarterly profit.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also noted that Home Depot's 5% growth in sales at stores
open at least a year missed some estimates and trailed Lowe's 7.5%
increase. Same-store sales are a key measure of retail performance.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot's total sales in the quarter ended May 5 increased 17%
to $14.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta-based retailer forecast a same-store sales increase of
2% to 4% for the second quarter, compared with Lowe's outlook of a 4%
to 6% gain.</TE>
<TE>   Discount chain Target said its profit climbed 36% to $345 million,
or 38 cents a share, on improved margins as well as higher sales of
household staples and trendy but cheap clothes at its Target discount
stores. The results beat the 36-cent-a-share average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. Profit also was
helped by its tight rein on inventories--which lessens the need for
deep markdowns--and expense controls, an analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   But shares of Minneapolis-based Target fell $1.16, or 2.7%, to
$41.54 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, the retailer said it backed
Wall Street forecasts for 2002 and its second quarter, which was a
disappointment for investors who expected more earnings optimism from
the company that also operates Marshall Field's and Mervyn's
department stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I think management is being cautious, and that is putting
pressure on the stock," Shelly Hale, retail analyst at Banc of
America Securities, said. "They see margin contraction for the second
half of the year and said sales have slowed recently."</TE>
<TE>   Target's revenue, including credit fees, increased 15% to
$9.6billion, while sales at stores open at least a year were up 5.2%.
Total retail sales rose 14% to $9.34 billion, including a 19% rise in
the Target division, while credit revenue climbed 41% to $280
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Target discount stores gained shoppers from Kmart Corp., which
filed for bankruptcy protection in January, by offering exclusive
products such as Michael Graves housewares, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell 0.9% at Mervyn's and declined 0.7% at Marshall
Field's.</TE>
<TE>   Staples said profit rose 65% to $65 million, or 14 cents a share,
3cents better than analysts' expectations, even as sales rose just
2.6% to $2.74 billion. Same-store sales were flat.</TE>
<TE>   The latest results exclude a one-time tax benefit charge of $29
million, or 6 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Staples boosted sales of its private-label products, which have
higher profit margins, and eliminated slow-selling products such as
$399 personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   The company said sales in consumables was strong but mitigated by
weakness in technology and furniture sales on continued lackluster
capital spending by businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Framingham, Mass.-based Staples rose $1.30, or 6.3%, to $21.88 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Among other retailers reporting Tuesday, Saks Inc. said it had a
first-quarter net loss after writing down the value of its Saks Fifth
Avenue chain of department stores, in line with new goodwill
accounting procedures, but its operating profit beat expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The loss--including the write-off of $45.6 million, or 31 cents a
share, and other one-time items--was $25.4 million, or 17 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Saks earned $21.9 million, or 15cents a share, on an operating
basis, up 24% from a year ago and 2cents better than analysts'
average estimate. Sales fell 2.6% to $1.43billion.</TE>
<TE>   Also:* Borders Group Inc., the second-largest U.S. bookstore
chain, reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $3.9 million, or 5
cents a share, compared with a net loss of $18.9million, or 23 cents,
in the year-earlier period. Sales increased 3% to $751.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   * AutoZone Inc., the largest U.S. auto-parts retailer, said fiscal
third-quarter profit rose 61% to $102.3million, or 96 cents a share,
as sales rose 7.4% to $1.22 billion.</TE>

<HD>No Money From Deal for Investors</HD>
<DH>Securities: Evidence produced by the New York investigation
could help individuals win damages through claims or suits against
Merrill Lynch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Individual investors got no money from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s
settlement Tuesday with the New York attorney general, nor an
admission of wrongdoing to help them recover losses on technology
stocks recommended by Merrill analysts. But their arbitration claims
and class-action lawsuits still may yield huge damages, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill's payment of $48 million to New York and $52 million to
other states is a fine, not restitution for investors, although New
York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said he supports investor lawsuits and
believes evidence turned up by his investigation will help them.
Still, Spitzer made it clear investors will have to fight their own
battles if they want to prove they lost money by relying on Merrill
research that allegedly was compromised by analysts' conflicts of
interest.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill is already facing dozens of class-action lawsuits and
arbitration claims filed by investors who blame Merrill research for
their losses on Internet stocks. Plaintiffs lawyers said Spitzer's
evidence, especially Merrill e-mails in which analysts privately
derided stocks they had recommended publicly, gives them ammunition
to help them pursue damages that could run into the billions of
dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Jacob Zamansky, a New York lawyer who already has won
$400,000 from Merrill Lynch in one Internet stock-related case, said
he believed that apologies to investors and other statements by
Merrill Chairman David Komansky and other executives constitute an
admission that the company violated industry standards and its own
policies regarding research analysts. He said he'll try to introduce
the statements as evidence against Merrill in future proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "Those statements, together with the e-mails that are really the
smoking guns, should help investors in these arbitrations and should
also open up class actions," with judges deciding to grant plaintiffs
broad power to look for more incriminating behavior on the part of
brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   But some expressed anger that, as Spitzer himself put it, they
"will not have in their back pocket an acknowledgement of wrongdoing
that is binding in court."</TE>
<TE>   The Public Investors Arbitration Bar Assn., an association of
plaintiffs lawyers in securities cases, urged Spitzer not to settle
without an admission of wrongdoing by Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   And Mark E. Maddox, a former Indiana securities commissioner who
now represents private parties against securities firms, said the
lack of an admission will make it harder for him to represent the
dozens of clients who have contacted him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish Spitzer would have had the guts to push for an
admission in this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said Tuesday that wringing an outright confession from
Merrill would have been a "death warrant" for the firm. Merrill
President Stan O'Neal said there was nothing in the settlement that
would hamper the firm's ability to defend itself and that he expected
his firm to prevail in the investor litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill investors who believe they were wronged have two ways to
try to recover damages: by hiring lawyers to file individual
arbitration claims or by joining in federal class-action lawsuits
seeking to represent the entire group of investors who lost money.
The first tactic has the potential for greater recoveries but
generally is available only to investors who lost large sums of
money.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's investigators accused Merrill analysts of providing
false or misleading assessments on Internet stocks to curry favor
with the companies and thus help drum up investment banking work for
the firm--and big bonuses for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement announced Tuesday will allow analysts to continue
working alongside investment bankers in some situations but is
supposed to eliminate any input from investment bankers in setting
analyst compensation, which is to be based solely on how good their
recommendations prove to be.</TE>
<TE>   Some attorneys said they believed that was enough for the New York
attorney general to have achieved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was just too complicated to try to figure out exactly
how much money should go to which [investors]," said attorney Steven
J. Toll, who has five potential class actions pending in New York
federal court against Merrill and its Internet analysts and another
against competitor Salomon Smith Barney for similar alleged analyst
conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Each of those cases focuses on analysts' recommendations on a
single company, and each involves losses that run "into the hundreds
of millions of dollars," Toll said. Overall, Merrill's potential
liability "is clearly billions of dollars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in the Internet cases will face a series of hurdles
thrown up by Merrill Lynch, which contends that many of the
derogatory comments about companies were made by junior analysts who
didn't make actual stock recommendations or were made after Merrill
downgraded the stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill is expected to question whether investors really relied on
its recommendations during the general Internet frenzy of the late
1990s, and to suggest that a host of factors it had no control over
contributed to the Internet bubble and its eventual popping.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office had threatened to bring criminal charges against
Merrill Lynch. In the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy case, Merrill
initially paid $30 million to settle a criminal investigation, and
only much later came up with more than $400 million to settle its
civil liability.</TE>

<HD>Dutch File-Sharing Firm Kazaa to Fold</HD>
<DH>Internet: Company's demise in the face of copyright suits
may have no effect on network, which it says it has sold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazaa BV, creator of a popular but controversial online file-sharing
network, is folding in the face of a copyright-infringement lawsuit
brought by leading record and film companies.</LD>
<LD>   But the collapse of the company won't slow the torrent of file
sharing online, and it may have no effect at all on the Kazaa
network, which bills itself as the world's most popular file-sharing
network. That's because Kazaa BV says it has sold the network to
another company that the record and film companies have yet to sue.</LD>
<LD>   The Dutch company asked the plaintiffs in the case, which include
the seven major Hollywood studios, five major record companies and
music publishers, for "their terms of surrender." The company
maintains that it has not violated copyrights by letting its users
copy music and movies freely from one another's computers, but its
lawyers said in court papers filed Friday that Kazaa can't afford to
defend itself against the lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   The move drew a skeptical response from the plaintiffs, who argued
that Kazaa's owners are trying to dodge liability through a corporate
"shell game." They called on the court to scrutinize Kazaa's
intention to default and ensure that the company provide key pieces
of evidence in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the record and film companies can't stop Kazaa BV
from withdrawing its defense and conceding defeat. The firm's motion
all but guarantees that it will be ordered to pay millions in
damages, which is likely to drive the two-person firm into
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Kazaa's lawyers accused the plaintiffs of driving the company out
of business with hardball legal tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot afford to respond to the multitude of motions,
pleadings, discovery requests and letters that plaintiffs drop on its
doorstep on a daily basis," the firm said in its filing. "Plaintiffs
have engaged in Rambo-style litigation, such as filing 88 pages of
pleadings and declarations to attempt to move the date of a status
conference."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for another defendant, Streamcast Networks Inc., which
launched the Morpheus file-sharing network, voiced a similar
complaint. Morpheus' main law firm, Palo Alto-based Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich &amp; Rosati, told the court it intends to withdraw from the
case because Streamcast can't afford to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Streamcast also is represented by the Electronic Frontier
Federation, a group that advocates civil liberties on the Internet.
Lawyers for the EFF could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs denied the accusation and said the defendants--and
Streamcast in particular--were trying to drag out the case.</TE>
<TE>   Legal fees are running high in the case not only because it's
extremely important to some of the world's largest media companies
but also because it involves several of California's biggest law
firms. Also, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson has set an
unusually rapid schedule for gathering evidence and going to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to reduce the legal bills, Streamcast's lawyers urged
the judge to limit the preliminary work to a pair of pretrial motions
to dismiss the core of the plaintiffs' case. The motions would decide
whether the defendants' version of file-sharing was legal.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs also want the core of the case decided without a
trial. They argue that "despite small differences in the software
architecture," the defendants' networks are functionally the same as
the service operated by Napster Inc., which an appeals court already
has ruled against.</TE>
<TE>   After the lawsuit was filed in October, Kazaa BV announced that it
had sold the Kazaa software and Web site to Sharman Networks, a
privately held firm based in Vanuatu, an island nation in the
Pacific. Kazaa BV continued to develop new versions of the
peer-to-peer technology underlying the Kazaa network, which it
licensed to Sharman, but Sharman officials say the network could
sustain itself without any intervention by Kazaa BV or Sharman.</TE>
<TE>   In a court filing Monday, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the two
principals in Kazaa BV, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, "received
substantial consideration for this sale [and] continue to be involved
in the operation of the current Kazaa service by Sharman Networks."</TE>

<HD>Panel Investigating Bell Labs Conduct</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An independent panel that includes a Nobel Prize-winning physicist is
examining accusations of scientific misconduct that have called into
question the validity of highly publicized experiments at Bell Labs.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member panel was formed last week after an outside
researcher contacted Lucent Technologies Inc. with information that
caused enough concern to warrant external review, a Lucent spokesman
said. Bell Labs is the research arm of New Jersey-based Lucent.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Bill Price said the accusations focused on data
published in five papers concerning molecular electronics,
superconductivity and molecular crystals.</LD>
<TE>   He would not give details of the accusations or say who brought
them to Lucent. "Our initial concern is with the validity of this
data," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent has contacted the journals that published the work in
question, which included a claim from the Bell Labs team last fall
that it had created a transistor from a single molecule.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists have been unable to reproduce the experiments and
have questioned the research results.</TE>
<TE>   Such skepticism is not unusual, and Lucent scientists have said
the technique for growing crystals is not easily mastered.</TE>
<TE>   Science Executive Editor Monica Bradford said Lucent has been open
about the inquiry and has promised to keep publications updated about
its results.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting to find out what the investigation shows," Bradford
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be upsetting if this would turn out to be a false lead,
because I think everybody was excited about the findings."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford University professor David Goldhaber-Gordon, also a
physicist, said the inability of other researchers to reproduce the
results was troubling, but he did not believe the inquiry would
necessarily indicate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not convinced it will all turn out to be fraudulent, and in
fact I'd be surprised if the ultimate story is as simple as that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel of inquiry is led by Malcolm R. Beasley, professor of
applied physics at Stanford. It also includes Herbert Kroemer, winner
of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall Again on Terror Alert</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Uneasiness wipes out early gains. Tech sector
sees biggest loss. Bond yields fall as investors seek safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing fear of terrorism cast a pall on Wall Street on Tuesday,
sending stocks sharply lower for a second day. The market's
uneasiness wiped out early gains prompted by better-than-expected
retail earnings and a settlement between Merrill Lynch and the New
York attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the pullback, although expected after last week's
big rally, widened late in the trading day after the FBI warned New
York law enforcement officials of an uncorroborated threat of
terrorism involving such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty and the
Brooklyn Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   "It's more of the geopolitical fears," said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co. "Most of the corporate news is
positive. The retail stores beat expectations, and so the consumer is
still in the market. But there's a lot of rhetoric about the next
terrorism attack. When it will be, and where?"</LD>
<TE>   The technology sector registered the biggest drop, having enjoyed
the biggest surge last week. The Nasdaq composite index fell 37.41
points, or 2.2%, to 1,664.18.</TE>
<TE>   The market's other major indexes also slid. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 123.79 points, or 1.2%, to 10,105.71, and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank 12 points, or 1.1%, to 1,079.88.
Losers led winners by almost 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was light but ahead of Monday's slow pace.</TE>
<TE>   The major indexes have now shed half of last week's gains. On
Monday, stocks fell after the FBI said suicide bombings in the United
States were inevitable and Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday
warned that terrorism threats should be taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Tuesday's fresh FBI warnings of possible terror
attacks in New York, new reports of mail laced with anthrax--this
time at the International Monetary Fund--were a worry but not a major
catalyst in the day's declines, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "The mounting anxiety of terror attacks and the uneven economic
recovery have been responsible for a rather-be-safe-than-sorry mode,"
said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields fell for a second day as investors continued to seek
safety in government securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note slipped to 5.15% from 5.20% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, meanwhile, fell to another five-month low against the
surging yen amid signs of an economic upturn in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil dropped $1 to $27.33 a barrel in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Merrill Lynch rose 47 cents to $43.85 after settling charges by
New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer that it misled investors with its
stock ratings to garner lucrative investment banking fees. But
Merrill couldn't hold on to early-day gains of more than $2 a share,
and its competitors lost ground, with Goldman Sachs falling $1.04 to
$79.20 and Morgan Stanley declining 96 cents to $48.39.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailing shares fell, despite a string of better-than-expected
first-quarter earnings that included those of Home Depot and Target.
Dow member Home Depot sank $3.60, or 7.4%, to $44.90. Analysts
expressed disappointment that the firm didn't raise its 2002 profit
forecast. Target fell $1.16 to $41.54.</TE>
<TE>   * Technology gave back some gains from last week when good news,
such as better-than-expected earnings from Applied Materials and Dell
Computer, prompted buying. Applied Materials fell 47cents to $26.31,
and Dell, which also issued an upbeat outlook last week, lost 35
cents to $26.88.</TE>
<TE>   IBM fell $1 to $83.45, having last week rallied on promises to cut
costs. Microsoft dropped $1.82 to $52.19 after announcing it would
spend $2 billion over five years in an effort to boost sales of its
Xbox video game console.</TE>
<TE>   * Silver hit a 19-month high, up 6.5 cents to $4.83 an ounce in
New York. The gain came on signs of strengthening industrial demand
and as gold continues to advance.</TE>

<HD>NBC's Sassa to Focus on Business Development</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC is expected to announce this week a new role for Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast since May 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Sassa, whose future has been the subject of speculation for more
than a year, will focus on strategic and business development
initiatives, working directly for NBC Chairman and Chief Executive
Robert C. "Bob" Wright, according to sources close to the company.</LD>
<LD>   NBC declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The promotion is a vote of confidence in Jeff Zucker, who has been
president of NBC Entertainment since December 2000. Zucker, who has
reported to Sassa, will assume some of his boss' responsibilities
under the new arrangement, including the network's in-house studio
and syndication arms.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is the top-rated network with the young upscale viewers that
advertisers pay the most money to reach.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say Sassa's new status also underscores the continuing
power struggle and friction at the top of NBC between Wright and his
No. 2 executive, Andrew R. Lack. Lack was appointed president last
summer, without Wright's blessing, by Jack Welch, who was then chief
executive of NBC parent General Electric Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sassa has had a tense relationship with Lack, he remains
a close ally of Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Sassa is expected to play a key role in determining a future
course for NBC, which is the only major broadcast network that is not
part of one of the few international giants that control the media
business. ABC is owned by Walt Disney Co., and CBS is part of Viacom
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wright's biggest challenges is finding a way to maintain
NBC's growth when network television economics are eroding and media
consolidation has reduced the possible acquisition targets.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wright has given Lack, former president of NBC News, the
tasks of fixing the company's MSNBC news channel and integrating its
recent acquisition of Telemundo, sources said he will look to Sassa
to squeeze more value out of under-performing investments such as
Paxson Communications and ValueVision.</TE>
<TE>   NBC sources said Sassa, who is more comfortable with a balance
sheet than with a script, will be better suited to his new job than
he was to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming NBC's top entertainment executive, Sassa ran the
company's television station group.</TE>
<TE>   He worked briefly for financier Ron Perelman after a nine-year
stint at Turner Broadcasting System. He is credited with building Ted
Turner's family of channels, including TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network.</TE>

<HD>Liberty Satellite to Buy Astrolink Assets</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberty Satellite &amp; Technology Inc., controlled by John Malone's
Liberty Media Corp., plans to acquire the stakes of its partners in
the failed satellite venture Astrolink International.</LD>
<LD>   Letters of intent have been signed with Lockheed Martin Corp., TRW
Inc. and Italy's Telecom Italia to buy Astrolink's assets, the
company said. Liberty Satellite owns about 31.5% of Astrolink. Terms
weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Liberty Media will make a "capital contribution" to Liberty
Satellite in exchange for shares of the unit's Series B stock if the
sale is completed.</LD>
<TE>   The $3.7-billion Astrolink project collapsed after the companies
failed to attract new investors and declined to provide any more
financing for the venture. Last year, Lockheed took a $400-million
write-off of its investment in Astrolink, while TRW had a
$157-million loss.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Satellite shares fell 38cents, or 10%, to $3.50 in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>IRS to Offer Tax Credit to Hybrid Car Owners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service said it will extend a tax credit of up
to $2,000 to buyers of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, but only
Japanese auto makers are likely to benefit in the near future.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS said the credit will apply to original owners of vehicles
certified by the government as hybrids, which tether a regular
gasoline engine to an electric motor and battery pack. To qualify,
manufacturers have to pledge that the hybrid systems cost at least
$2,000 to build.</LD>
<LD>   But the IRS also said the credit, which would be deducted from the
buyer's gross income on a tax statement, will apply in full only to
hybrids bought by the end of 2003. In 2004, it will begin to be
phased out, with no credit offered after 2006.</LD>
<TE>   The only vehicles that probably would qualify today are Japanese
models--Honda Motor Co.'s Insight and Civic hybrids and Toyota Motor
Corp.'s Prius.</TE>

<HD>Icahn Offers to Buy Morton's for $56 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Financier Carl Icahn offered to buy Morton's Restaurant Group Inc.
for $56 million in cash, trumping an earlier offer from Castle Harlan
Inc. in the latest twist for control of the troubled restaurant
chain.</LD>
<LD>   Icahn, in a letter to Morton's, offered $13.50 a share for the
65-restaurant chain. That is 90 cents more than Castle Harlan's offer
of $12.60 a share, or $52.6 million, that the firm accepted in March.</LD>
<LD>   The counteroffer by the billionaire investor comes as at least one
investor group, BFMA Holding Corp., said it may mount a challenge to
Morton's deal to be bought by New York-based Castle Harlan.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, BFMA and Icahn teamed up to buy Morton's for $28.25 a
share, prompting the company to begin a search for buyers that
resulted in the Castle Harlan offer. This time, however, Icahn said
he would fund the offer himself.</TE>
<TE>   Morton's stock closed down 23 cents at $15 on the NYSE, or 19%
higher than Castle Harlan's offer price.</TE>

<LD>Schering-Plough Corp. must pay a record $500-million fine to settle
complaints by U.S. regulators about production flaws that delayed its
new allergy drug, Clarinex, now that a federal judge has approved the
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which announced the agreement Friday, must pay $250
million to the U.S. Treasury by May 30 and an additional $250 million
within a year. The 45-page consent decree U.S. District Judge Joel
Pisano signed requires Schering-Plough to pay up to $175 million if
it fails to comply with the timetables in the agreement.</LD>

<LD>Aquila Inc., the No. 4 U.S. utility owner and an energy trader, may
sell $1 billion in assets, twice as much as planned, after Moody's
Investors Service said it might cut the firm's credit rating to junk.</LD>
<LD>   The company has saved $101million after trimming 650 jobs and some
executive incentives, and more cost cuts are planned, Chief Executive
Robert Green said. Rising debt, falling earnings and increased risk
from energy trading prompted the credit review, Moody's said.</LD>
<LD>   Aquila, whose stock has tumbled 61% in the last year, and rivals
such as Dynegy Inc., Williams Cos. and El Paso Corp. are selling
billions in assets to bolster their balance sheets.</LD>
<TE>   Executives declined to reaffirm a 2002 earnings forecast of $2.20
to $2.30 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said it placed Aquila under review because first-quarter
earnings fell 40% from a year earlier. It also cited higher debt and
increased risk from energy trading.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kansas City, Mo.-based Aquila rose 11 cents to $14.80 in
NYSE trading.</TE>

<LD>* Albertson's Inc. raised its first-quarter profit outlook, saying a
restructuring aimed at fending off competition from Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. was paying off sooner than anticipated. Albertson's said it
expects to post a profit of 55 cents to 58 cents, exceeding analyst
estimates of 53 cents and the company's earlier projection of
50cents.</LD>

lubricants--and passenger car motor oil. It said it would continue to
cooperate fully with the FTC's review of the $1.8-billion takeover.</LD>

<LD>Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar unit canceled plans to add the F-Type sports
car to its lineup, a sign that Ford's financial losses are forcing
cutbacks in product plans, industry analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The two-seater was an updated version of the 1960s Jaguar E-Type
roadster. The company said in January 2001 that it would build the
car within three years and that it would cost less than a $75,000
Jaguar XK8 coupe.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nucor Corp., the nation's second-largest steelmaker, said it has
signed an exclusive agreement with Birmingham Steel Corp. to buy the
financially strapped Alabama steel producer for $615 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   In February, Nucor made an unsolicited offer to pay $500 million
in cash for most of Birmingham Steel's assets. The sweetened offer
was disclosed in papers filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Nucor won't complete the deal unless Birmingham Steel files for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate the threat of lawsuits
over three plants the company has sold or closed, said J. Daniel
Garrett, chief financial officer of Birmingham Steel.</LD>
<TE>   Nucor officials confirmed that the bankruptcy provision was
included in the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Nucor shares rose $1.72, or 2.8%, to close at $63.52 on the NYSE.
Birmingham Steel shares fell 26 cents to 37 cents in over-the-counter
bulletin board trading.</TE>

<LD>Motorola Inc. expects to meet second-quarter sales and loss forecasts
it gave last month, Chief Executive Christopher Galvin said. The
company expects sales of $6.3billion to $6.4billion and a loss of 4
cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   The second-biggest mobile phone maker will continue to cut costs
so it can break even with fewer sales, Galvin said without
elaborating. The firm will start reporting "clean quarters" after it
finishes recording reorganization expenses in three to five months,
Chief Financial Officer David Devonshire said. Shares of Schaumburg,
Ill.-based Motorola fell 40 cents to $16.40 on the NYSE. They have
risen 9.2% this year.</LD>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. blamed a clerical error for

the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices,
did not disclose that Thomas Donohue also serves as a director for
Union Pacific Corp., of which Philip Anschutz is vice chairman.
Anschutz is Qwest's largest shareholder.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest also omitted Donohue's memberships on the boards of XM
Satellite Radio Holdings  Inc. and Sunrise Assisted Living Inc. A
Qwest spokesman said a reporter informed him that the omissions
occurred on the 2001 and 2002 proxies and the company's Web site. He
said it was a clerical error.</LD>

<LD>CMGI Inc., whose vastly depreciated Internet holdings have made it

another quarterly loss and lowered its forecast for the rest of the

million, down from $289 million a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   CMGI said it is unlikely to meet stated fourth-quarter targets of
$205million to $215million in revenue and $22million to $27million in
losses before one-time items. As a result, CMGI will miss its
full-year targets of $825million in revenue and a loss of $165million

<LD>Citing customer complaints, Yahoo Inc. will soon drop a fee it began
charging in October to people who want to place enhanced personal
advertisements on its online dating service. The Sunnyvale, Calif.,
Web portal will continue to charge a separate $19.95 monthly fee to
people who want to respond to ads.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo's decision to drop the $4.95 fee counters the trend among
Internet firms of charging for services that used to be free. Yahoo
has unveiled paid services in the last year to try to reduce its
dependence on revenue from banner advertising, a market that's in a
severe slump.</LD>

<HD>Web Royalty Rates Rejected</HD>
<DH>Internet: Library of Congress' decision offers hope for
online radio broadcasters that rates will better reflect the
marketplace than those proposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Library of Congress on Tuesday rejected a proposed royalty rate
for online music broadcasts that threatened to drive many Internet
radio stations out of business.</LD>
<LD>   However, the order by Librarian James H. Billington didn't
indicate whether the final rate would be higher or lower than the
hotly disputed proposal from a panel of arbitrators. It said only
that a final determination was due by June 20.</LD>
<LD>   Still, many Webcasters viewed the ruling as a sign that their
protests had been heard.</LD>
<TE>   "Today's decision by the librarian offers hope that the final
royalty will be more in line with marketplace economics than was the
arbitrators' proposal," said Jonathan Potter, director of the Digital
Media Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Record labels and recording artists, meanwhile, continued to argue
that Webcasters shouldn't be allowed to build businesses around music
without paying fairly for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The recording artist is not interested in Webcasters paying a
nominal royalty while all of their other bills are paid in full, at
the same time the recording artist is being devastated by rampant
Internet piracy," said Jay Rosenthal, who represents the Recording
Artists Coalition. "Figure out how to incorporate a viable artist
royalty in the Webcasting business plan, or look for a new business.
The day of the free ride is over."</TE>
<TE>   John Simson, executive director of SoundExchange--the licensing
and royalties arm of the Recording Industry Assn. of America--said
the ruling may spur labels, artists and Webcasters to strike a deal
finally on royalties. A likely middle ground is having online
broadcasters pay a percentage of their revenues to labels and
performers, just as broadcasters pay to music publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Although it seems simple in concept, tying royalties to revenues
is tricky in practice. A key issue for major Webcasters with multiple
sources of income, such as AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online, is
which revenues to consider.</TE>
<TE>   One alternative favored by some labels and artists is charging
Webcasters a percentage of their expenses, such as the fees they pay
for Internet service and computers. Another possibility is developing
a multitiered approach that offers lower rates to small, independent
Net stations.</TE>
<TE>   These smaller stations have been the focus of the Webcasters'
lobbying efforts, which caught the media spotlight and won sympathy
on Capitol Hill. Twenty members of Congress wrote to Billington on
April 22, urging him to reject the panel's proposal in favor of a
lower royalty rate and a percentage-of-revenue option.</TE>
<TE>   The librarian of Congress spent the last three months reviewing
the arbitration panel's royalty rates, which were lower than the
record companies sought but significantly higher than the Webcasters
proposed. The panel recommended charging commercial Internet-only
stations 0.14 of a cent per song, and over-the-air stations 0.07 of a
cent per song if they "simulcast" their programs on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Those fees would have to be paid for each person who tunes into a
Webcast, which meant a Web-only station broadcasting 15 songs per
hour would have owed more than $180 per listener per year.</TE>
<TE>   For a popular outlet such as KNAC, the highest-rated Internet-only
station in a recent survey by MeasureCast Inc., the annual bill would
have been about $100,000.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom, MCI Tracking Stocks Will Be Eliminated</HD>
<DH>Restructuring: Firm says ending dividend, moving to one
class of common shares will reduce debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone company, said
Tuesday that it will eliminate its WorldCom Group and MCI Group
tracking stocks, saving $284million annually by dropping the MCI
dividend.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based company, which has a new chief executive
and is trying to cut its debt, said the widely expected move will be
effective July 12.</LD>
<LD>   "By eliminating our tracking stocks we will build on our cash
position and simplify our corporate structure, benefiting the
investment community," WorldCom Chief Executive John Sidgmore said.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom had created the tracking stocks just a year ago, when it
wanted to separate its once-booming data business from its sluggish
long-distance telephone operations. Tracking stocks reflect just a
portion of a company's business.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of WorldCom Group track its main data and Internet
business, while shares of MCI Group reflect its residential
long-distance telephone business. Since its creation on June 8, 2001,
the MCI tracking stock has lost 89% of its value. The WorldCom Group
tracking stock has shed 92%.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the tracking stocks didn't have the desired effect,"
said independent telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan. "Putting
the stocks back together again is not going to be a magic bullet.
Just the act alone is not going to save them.... But if it's a first
shot in a new strategy that makes sense and that everybody buys into,
then it could be the start, but right now it could go either way,"
Kagan said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said each outstanding share of MCI Group common stock
will be converted into 1.3594 shares of WorldCom Group common stock.
Notice of the conversion will be mailed today to MCI group common
stockholders of record as of Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends on shares of MCI Group common stock will cease to be
paid as of the conversion date, the company said. However, holders of
record of MCI Group common stock at the close of business June 30
will be paid the previously declared quarterly dividend of 60 cents a
share, payable July 15.</TE>
<TE>   When the move is completed, WorldCom will have one class of stock,
with the ticker symbol WCOM.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is seeking to cut costs as it negotiates $5 billion in
bank loans and tries to stave off a cash crunch. Former CEO Bernard
Ebbers was recently ousted.</TE>
<TE>   In after-hours trading, WorldCom Group stock rose as much as
7cents to $1.49. In regular trading, before the announcement, the
shares fell 7 cents to $1.42.</TE>
<TE>   MCI shares fell 14 cents to $2.05 in regular trading.</TE>

<HD>Buffett Issue to Carry Negative Interest</HD>
<DH>Securities: Investors would, in effect, pay for the right
to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Tuesday that it planned
to sell the first-ever securities with a negative interest rate.</LD>
<LD>   The $250-million offering would make investors pay the billionaire
for the ability to buy his company's stock in the future.</LD>
<LD>   The Omaha-based holding company, whose insurance businesses
provide money for Buffett to invest, said it plans to privately offer
a security called a "Squarz," which consists of a senior note and a
warrant to buy Berkshire Class A or Class B shares.</LD>
<TE>   The sale is expected by early today, people familiar with the
matter said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very interesting piece of paper," said Tom Dinsmore,
chairman of Davis-Dinsmore Management Co. in Morristown, N.J., which
runs $200 million of convertible bond funds. "Anyone interested in
Berkshire Hathaway equity would be interested."</TE>
<TE>   "In a post-Enron environment, investors are looking for
high-quality paper," said Jeff Seidel, global head of convertible
research at Credit Suisse First Boston, referring to the energy
trader now in Chapter 11 proceedings. "This is an aggressive
structure. But there is a lot to be said for high-quality issuance in
this market, and Warren Buffett might be the kind of person who can
get something like this done."</TE>
<TE>   The securities would allow purchasers who are confident that
Berkshire shares will rise to buy those shares at some future date at
a set price.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire shares have risen 4,000-fold from May 1965, when Buffett
took over an old textile firm making jacket linings. If you bought
$250 of the shares at that time, at the closing price of $18, they
would be worth more than $1million today.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine last year put Buffett's net worth at $33.2
billion, making him the second-richest American after Microsoft Corp.
Chairman Bill Gates.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire's Class A shares closed Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange at $77,900, up $300. Its Class B shares closed on the Big
Board at $2,580, up $3.</TE>
<TE>   The five-year convertible securities are expected to carry a
coupon of negative 0.5% to negative 1% and be convertible into
Berkshire shares at a 12% to 15% premium over the shares' Tuesday
closing price, people familiar with the sale said. Conversion is at
the investors' discretion.</TE>
<TE>   "This is classic Buffett," Seidel said. "Warren Buffett has
written that zero-coupon bonds have tremendous tax advantages for
Berkshire Hathaway. This seems to be the logical next step."</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire cannot buy back the securities from investors, but
investors may sell them back to Berkshire after one, two, three and
four years, people familiar with the deal said.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence you're paying [about] negative three-quarters of a
point for the option to buy the stock," said Adrian Miller, director
of convertible research at Salomon Smith Barney. The bet would pay
off if the stock in the next few years were to rise above the
securities' conversion value.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire said it will use net proceeds from the sale for general
corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The company is one of only eight to hold "triple-A" credit ratings
from Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. is arranging the sale, people familiar with
the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE Reports 2%</TE>
<TE>   Drop in Short Interest</TE>
<TE>   Some stock market bears may have turned nervous in recent weeks
about the potential for a sustained rally in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange said Tuesday that "short
interest"--the number of NYSE-listed shares borrowed and sold,
usually in a bet on lower prices--declined as of mid-May from the
record set in mid-April.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE said total short interest fell nearly 2% to 6.703 billion
shares as of May 15, down from the all-time high 6.835 billion April
15.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first monthly decrease in shorted shares since January.</TE>
<TE>   The number of NYSE shorted shares has rocketed since the bear
market began in spring 2000. NYSE short interest in March 2000 was
4.1 billion shares. The total rose to 5.6 billion by mid-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Short sellers profit if the market price of the shares they have
shorted falls. They then can buy the shares in the market to close
out their loan and pocket the difference between their sale price and
the repurchase price.</TE>
<TE>   But if a shorted stock's market price rises, a short seller faces
potentially unlimited losses. So short sellers often opt to pare
their bearish bets when stocks rally, rather than risk mounting
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tumbled 5.5% between
mid-March and mid-April and continued to slide into early May,
bottoming May 7. Stocks resurged last week, with the S&amp;P rising 4.9%.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE short interest as of May 15 accounted for 1.9% of the total
number of shares outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   The American Stock Exchange said short interest in its market rose
to 484 million shares as of May 15 from 471 million as of mid-April.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tropic of Hockey: My Search For The Game In Unlikely
Places"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Dave Bidini</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: The Lyons Press</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Dave Bidini is just your average musician who decided to
write books. He has been able to combine his love of travel with his
colorful writing style. After writing his first book "On a Cold Road"
in 1998, which created a buzz in Canada in the late 1990s, Bidini
returned to playing rhythm guitar for his Canadian rock band. But
while on tour in the Deep South, Bidini was outside Athens, Ga., when
he got the idea of writing about hockey played in unusual places.</TE>
<TE>   Bidini is not a great hockey player, with his most recent playing
experience coming against musicians around Toronto, but he gives a
fresh look at places where hockey is still a sport and not
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Bidini ended up finding people playing the sport in unexpected
places, from the eighth floor of a shopping mall in Hong Kong to the
desert of the United Arab Emirates. Bidini's humor makes every story
enjoyable. You can't help but laugh out loud reading the chapter
titled "Bobby Clarke's Teeth" about his trip to China. Bidini does a
good job of describing the word game he played with the few players
who spoke English. The Chinese players surprised Bidini with their
knowledge of the Montreal Canadiens, Steve Yzerman and the old
Russian Army team. Bidini ended up learning the hard way not to
underestimate a couple of elderly Chinese men on the ice. In his last
game with his new Chinese friends, Bidini suffered a five-inch welt
when an older Chinese player knocked out his wind with a stick to his
ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Bidini found a new location to play, he looked for
anything tied to traditional hockey.</TE>
<TE>   One of his most favorite things to learn were the names of some of
the players he found playing in the tropics of hockey.</TE>
<TE>   How could you not like Precious and Jewel Rabena, two sisters on a
girls' Mega Wingers team in Manila? Or Brambillo, a Finnish player he
found competing in a tournament in Dubai?</TE>

<LD>Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News, on the Detroit Red Wing
fans' tradition of throwing octopuses onto the ice: "Here is the
story. It seems that when it all started in the 1950s, eight
[playoff] victories were needed to win a Stanley Cup. And an octopus
has eight legs ...</LD>
<LD>   "I suppose the spider was not chosen because, like the hockey
puck, it is hard to see and the point, such as it is, would not be as
easily made. You can never be too obvious in Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a bag-of-bolts kind of town, and subtlety is about as
welcome as a Toyota."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the Laker record for points scored in a
playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's next? Mike Tyson was on the cover of last week's Sports
Illustrated, and Jay Leno says, "He's been arrested. He's been in
prison. Don King allegedly took all of his money. Now he's going
through a divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid to see what happens when the Sports Illustrated cover
jinx sets in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor taste: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Maybe you heard
that PETA is pressuring the NCAA to stop using leather basketballs in
its tournaments because 'it's hard to put a price on a cow's life.'</TE>
<TE>   "Remember that while sitting in a fast-food drive-through. But
we'll let Charles Barkley field this one: 'Animals are only good to
be eaten and tested to cure people.' Thanks, Chuck."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Satisfied: Retiring NFL receiver Cris Carter on critics who
suggest his career was incomplete because he and the Minnesota
Vikings never won a Super Bowl:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like because I didn't win a championship that I was
not successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Andre Rison who won a championship with Green Bay. Are
you saying his career is more successful than mine?</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Alvin Harper, who won a couple of Super Bowls with the
Dallas Cowboys. Are you saying his career is as successful as mine? I
wouldn't say that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's already over: In a column for America Online, Norman Chad
says the East will be outclassed by the West in the NBA Finals:</TE>
<TE>   "It will be as anticlimactic as the second day of a Madonna
marriage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No way, Jose: Randy Hill of Foxsports.com, on Jose Canseco's claim
of rampant steroid use in baseball:</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-five percent just seems cuckoo.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the literature, steroid use eventually shuts down
natural production of testosterone. And, if baseball players cheat on
their wives as often as Jose's book may claim, where is this sex
drive coming from?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not exactly thrilled about this book's potential. What I'd
like to see is Canseco vs. [Albert] Belle on Celebrity Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Lakers scored 153 in defeating Denver in 1985.
The NBA record is 157 by Boston against New York in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A golf ball thief had a six-month jail sentence
overturned Monday in London when a judge ruled the punishment was
disproportionate to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   John Collinson was jailed last month after he and a helper were
caught with 1,158 balls dredged from the bottom of a lake on the
Whetstone Golf Club.</TE>

<HD>What Shaq Really Means Takes a Spell to Decipher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaq tells us, "There is only one way to beat us. It starts with C
and ends with T," and frankly, I'd like to know what that is so maybe
the problem can be corrected.</LD>
<LD>   Up to this point he's given us only one clue, telling reporters it
would be wrong to suggest the word, CheaT.</LD>
<LD>   So I'm thinking CaT, and hoping we don't have a Terry Bradshaw
situation here with Shaq.</LD>
<TE>   I've got to be honest, though, for the longest time I've thought
the only thing that could keep the Lakers from winning another
championship was a room full of cats. You go into someone's house who
owns cats, and you know what happens: Your eyes water; you sneeze;
and if they had found a bag of cats under the Lakers' bench in Arco
Arena, that would have explained Derek Fisher's blurry-eyed
one-for-nine shooting performance the other night.</TE>
<TE>   If folks in Sacramento are willing to poison Kobe, you have to
believe no cat is safe in Sacramento if it can be used to destroy
Fisher's shooting touch. At the risk of turning Kobe's stomach again,
maybe that was a cat hamburger he was eating.</TE>
<TE>   I called Arco Arena to check, and the operator said they don't
allow animals inside. I said, "You let Kings' fans in," and for some
reason we were disconnected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I COUNTED 75 words in a dictionary that begin with C and end with
T, and you never know what Shaq's thinking, but I don't think the
state of ConnecticuT, a CamshafT or a CaricaturisT is the key to
beating the Lakers. A CarroT by itself, obviously isn't going to hurt
the Lakers, and even if it was Carrot Top, I'd like to think Shaq
would put him out of his misery.</TE>
<TE>   The Zen Master might know a CachepoT is a jar to hold plants, and
mind you, I'm not suggesting any specific plant or weed here, but I'm
guessing Shaq wouldn't know a cachepot from a CormoranT (you're going
to have to look it up--I know I did).</TE>
<TE>   If cowbells don't unnerve the guys, I don't think a ClarinetisT
has a prayer, and while a CrackpoT makes sense, as far as I know USC
Athletic Director Mike Garrett wasn't in Sacramento over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   I know what you're thinking, it has to be a ColumnisT, and if the
Lakers lose this thing I've got no problem if everyone wants to blame
Plaschke.</TE>
<TE>   That's bill.plaschke@latimes.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY HUNCH, however, is the word Shaq was trying to spell is
ClairvoyanT.</TE>
<TE>   You see it's pretty well known the NBA likes to fix things, you
know such as the NBA draft, the NBA Finals and getting Phil and
Jeanie together. That's why I'm pretty happy with the turn of events
in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq probably mistook the referees' decision to call the game in
favor of Sacramento and allow the Kings a better chance to win Monday
night as the NBA's way of looking down the road and fixing it so the
Kings play either the Celtics or Nets.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's CommandanT, David Stern, however, is known for being a
visionary, and if the fix was in, I think he was telling us he's come
to the conclusion the Lakers are so good the Kings have no chance of
advancing in this series.</TE>
<TE>   The important thing now is giving NBC an extra game or two before
the Lakers wrap it up. A Lakers' sweep--with the Finals not starting
until June--would have hurt the league in advertising dollars and
entertainment momentum.</TE>
<TE>   So I agree with Shaq, I don't think CheaT is the right word here.
I think the NBA already knows who will be wearing the CoroneT at
season's end, and Shaq was saying the only way it's not going to be
the Lakers is if the NBA has another team in mind.</TE>
<TE>   What Shaq has to remember is we're talking prime-time TV from here
on in, and the NBA's not going to try to catch America's attention
with a bunch of whiners from a Cow Town.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SEAHAWKS will pay Ryan Leaf $525,000 to sit on the bench.
Think about that today as you go to work, and wonder when you'll get
your next raise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOTE TO former L.A. mayor Richard Riordan: As you know by now,
your team finished first in the golf tournament recently at Lakeside
County Club, but because you left early you don't really know why
you're receiving a chipped trophy. L.A. Coliseum General Manager Pat
Lynch, a teammate of yours, received the chipped trophy but switched
his with yours. Just thought you ought to know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NEWSPAPER noted Tuesday morning I was "on assignment" and
unable to write Monday because I had to play golf at Riviera. I can't
tell you what a chore it was playing in the L.A. Sports &amp;
Entertainment Commission tournament with Rick Baedeker (Hollywood
Park), Patrick O'Neal (Fox Sports Net) and Sherwood Chillingworth
(Oak Tree). You want to play golf with someone named "Sherwood?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is a bright light on a late-night radio show on 1150, and
his wife is actress Rebecca De Mornay. I asked, of course. He said he
saw "Risky Business," before he met De Mornay, so at one time we had
something in common.</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker wanted to bet who could hit the longest drive, so I took
his money. I wish Hollywood Park was that obliging about making me
rich.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, the LASEC honored Pam Shriver, because she's old,
continuing a tradition started last year when it honored Al Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIMES REPORTER Gary Klein noted Tuesday Kevin Brown will pitch
against Randy Johnson on Sunday, calling it "one of baseball's
marquee pitching matchups." Don't you have to have two great pitchers
to call it something like that?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jim:  "I'd like you to
know, Mr. Smarty Pants, that we have indoor plumbing, electricity and
even cable TV in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   How 'bout refrigeration to keep your meat fresh?</TE>

<HD>Hahn Warns Secession Could Hurt Public Safety</HD>
<DH>Finances: Mayor says L.A. breakup would jeopardize
construction of fire and police stations. Valley city advocates
dispute claim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of a key vote over San Fernando Valley secession, Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn warned Tuesday that breaking apart the
city could compromise public safety by jeopardizing the construction
of new bond-financed fire and police stations voters approved this
spring.</LD>
<LD>   The comments from Hahn, a leading secession opponent, came as
advocates and critics wrestled with new estimates of the Valley's
financial health and the payments it will be obligated to make to Los
Angeles if voters back the idea.</LD>
<LD>   That report by Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local
Agency Formation Commission, concluded that the Valley generates $98
million more in tax revenue than the city spends there. The city
should also get $30 million in the loss of property transfer tax, he
wrote.</LD>
<TE>   To make Los Angeles whole for the loss of the Valley, the
departing city would therefore have to pay $128 million a year, a
sharp increase from the previously estimated $55 million, Calemine
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers set the stage for today's expected LAFCO vote on
whether to authorize a November ballot measure to determine the
Valley's fate. Hahn has urged the commission to delay its vote.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the mayor said LAFCO has not provided a mechanism for
a new city to issue bonds already approved by the voters of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hahn, without the transfer of bonding capability,
money from Proposition Q, a $600-million bond measure that passed in
March, could not be used to finance the construction of a new police
station and a bomb squad facility in the Valley, as planned. Seven
Valley fire stations slated to be replaced with money from
Proposition F, which voters passed in 2000, would face a similar
fate.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Valley is unable to issue debt to build these kinds of
public safety facilities, who suffers?" Hahn asked during a morning
news conference held in the city's emergency operations center, four
floors under City Hall. "The people in the Valley do."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said upgrading the city's public safety facilities is
critical, noting that federal officials have recently warned about
the possibility of another terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Put simply, secession hurts public safety, it hurts emergency
preparedness, it threatens the safety of people all over Los
Angeles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Faughnan, senior deputy county counsel for the commission,
confirmed that under the current proposal, a new Valley city would
not have the capability to issue general obligation bonds previously
approved by voters of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't carry over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates said they were not concerned, in part because
they did not support the way Proposition Q was going to be spent.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we become our own city, we'll pass our own bonds, thank you
very much, and we'll base it on our own needs," said Jeff Brain,
president of the pro-secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hahn said a Valley city might not have the credit rating
to issue bonds, citing a May 16 report by the bond-rating agency
Fitch Ratings that stated the financial health of a Valley city would
be difficult to immediately ascertain. Secession supporters disputed
the report, and said they believe a Valley city would be able to
issue bonds right away.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been consulting with bond-rating services that have
indicated to us that we are an extremely profitable city and will
have no trouble in raising money through bonds or other
indebtedness," said Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   With both sides focused on today's LAFCO meeting, Calemine's
estimates emboldened advocates and critics alike. Secession backers
said the new figures suggested that the Valley city would be
financially healthy, with a more robust reserve fund than previously
expected. By the end of the third year, the reserve would be 14% of
the budget, wrote Calemine, who has been supportive of efforts to
bring secession to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more viable than when we just had [projected] budget
figures," Calemine said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn questioned Calemine's calculations and urged the
commission to delay a vote on whether to put cityhood on the ballot
until the report can be reviewed. He predicted that residents in both
parts of the city will face tax increases and service cuts if Los
Angeles is divided.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that LAFCO is hellbent on providing a report that
is favorable for Valley cityhood, without regard of the cost to the
taxpayers, either in the new city or the remaining city," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   And the mayor argued that LAFCO may face a legal challenge if it
does not reconsider its findings before authorizing a ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are failing to meet the standards that are set by state
law, I think they're open to a lawsuit," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO members defended their work.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're doing a good job," said commission Chairman Henri
F. Pellissier. "We're following the law."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine refused to respond to the mayor's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a politician and I do not respond to what politicians
say," he said. "I'm just a staff member trying to get my job done."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-page resolution Calemine submitted to the commission
Tuesday for adoption stated that the split will not economically harm
Los Angeles and will result in creation of a new city capable of
providing efficient services.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the amount the Valley would pay Los Angeles to
make up for revenue lost in the split would start at $128 million the
first year and decline by 5% each year for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have said the city should be paid at least
$153 million based on centralized expenses it would still have to
cover after a breakup. But Calemine rejected the argument, saying Los
Angeles should be able to reduce expenses if it has to serve
one-third fewer people.</TE>
<TE>   He also recommended that the new city begin operating July 1,
2003, rather than Jan. 1, as sought by secessionists. A one-year
transition period would be set, during which the new Valley city
would continue to contract for most services.</TE>

<LD>Dear Valley Diary:</LD>
<LD>   Day One</LD>
<LD>   I pull off the freeway at Laurel Canyon Boulevard, looking for a
strong cup of joe and an angry spouse. The San Fernando Valley wants
out of a stormy marriage with Los Angeles, and the whole thing could
be sealed in November.</LD>
<TE>   You don't care about us, the Valley cries.</TE>
<TE>   You don't listen when we talk.</TE>
<TE>   You take our hard-earned money and blow it on that tawdry Downtown
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what really irks me?" asked a friend from Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   You tell some Westside snob you're from the Valley, or you give
them a phone number that begins 818, and you can see something
growing in their eyes. Pity, contempt, superiority.</TE>
<TE>   As if these snobs live in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   I turn west on Ventura Boulevard and stop at Peet's Coffee, where
I see one of those L.A. people I have always wanted to be. Some guy
in dress-down comfort, nowhere to go, sitting on a bench like work
hasn't been invented yet.</TE>
<TE>   But Cameron Lowe, 37, does have a job. He's a director, he says.
TV commercials, actually.</TE>
<TE>   And documentaries, of course. He's doing a documentary on his
father's band, a Valley-based '60s crew that recently reunited.</TE>
<TE>   The Electric Prunes.</TE>
<TE>   In this sunstruck moment, I love the Valley like never before.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Lowe about secession, the subject that surely must
infiltrate his every waking thought, if not his dreams.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who talks about it."</TE>
<TE>   What about the lousy services? I ask, telling Lowe about secession
leaders and their wounded cries of taxation without representation,
trees that aren't trimmed, cops who never show.</TE>
<TE>   He shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with my trash or the water service," Lowe
says. "And I've never had to call the police."</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, he says, this stretch of Studio City looks pretty
good to him. "It's got some character" and is more neighborhoody than
a lot of places over the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line, everything's fine in his world, and he sees no need
to change the name of it.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Diary:</TE>
<TE>   Does the very community that secessionists seek to create already
exist?</TE>
<TE>   Is the secession plan nothing more than pointless doodling by a
few doddering old men with nothing better to do?</TE>
<TE>   Given the depth of real problems like transportation and housing,
not to mention the uncertain economy, can anyone be expected to take
this thing seriously?</TE>
<TE>   There have been times when I thought you could take all the people
who were worked into a lather about secession and fit them into a
7-Eleven on Chandler. I went to Galpin Ford for the historic meeting
on the naming of the new city, and only 100 people showed up, which
means that approximately 1,349,900 stayed home.</TE>
<TE>   I thank Lowe for his thoughts, wish him luck with the documentary
on the Electric Prunes, and go inside Peet's, where I find two women
named Susan and Laurie who have roughly the same take as Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's silly," says Susan, who does not know a single
person who speaks passionately about secession one way or the other.</TE>
<TE>   That would include the mayor, whose uninspired defense of the
city's borders ranks alongside Mexican Gen. Andres Pico's surrender
of California to Lt. Col. John C. Fremont at the Universal City Red

<TE>   Lucky for Hahn the other side has no Gen. Patton in its ranks.

<TE>   In the course of my conversation at Peet's, I learn that Laurie

the mere mention of the Valley. They changed their tune when they had

<TE>   Studio City was the answer, and now they're big Valley defenders
who just don't see a need to change the city limits or the name of

<TE>   What do you mean?</TE>
<TE>   "Studio City and Sherman Oaks are fine, but I wouldn't live in
Canoga Park or Woodland Hills. My husband [who works in Beverly

<TE>   Secession is going to die.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley doesn't think collectively, it thinks in pieces, and
people move in small circles that occasionally overlap but seldom
intersect, as someone once wrote.</TE>
<TE>   I climb up Coldwater Canyon, turn right on Mulholland, and drive
to an overlook where I get a great view of all this contented
isolation, and a good cell phone signal, too. The phone rings now and
it's the Valley's porn industry people getting back to me, eager to
put their own spin on the breakup.</TE>

<HD>Marines Reject Use of El Toro for Training</HD>
<DH>Military: The decision not to relocate recruits from the
San Diego base to the Orange County site disappoints county
officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>To the joy of officials in San Diego and to the disappointment of
those in Orange County, the Marine Corps announced Tuesday that it is
dropping the idea of moving its West Coast basic training camp from
San Diego to El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   Marine Commandant Gen. James Jones, in a letter to members of
Congress, said that the "urban setting" of the Marines' former base
at El Toro makes it unsuitable as a site for firing ranges.</LD>
<LD>   "Accordingly," Jones wrote, "the Marine Corps will not pursue the
potential relocation of [the recruit depot] to El Toro, and has
advised the Navy secretariat of my concurrence in their efforts to
rapidly dispose of this property."</LD>
<TE>   Closed as part of the post-Cold War military cutback, the El Toro
base is being returned to civilian use. A coalition of Orange County
officials waged an eight-year battle to turn the base into a civilian
airport; county voters turned down that idea in March--opening a
wide-ranging discussion about the property's future. Jones asked his
subordinates to study whether El Toro might be an alternative to San
Diego--able to accommodate the firing ranges and 54-hour field
exercise called the Crucible, both key parts of the grueling 13-week
Marine training program.</TE>
<TE>   At 388 acres, the San Diego base is too small to accommodate those
aspects of training. As a result, the Marines must send recruits to
Camp Pendleton, 40 miles north, for four weeks. The San Diego base is
also affected by jet noise from adjacent Lindbergh Field, the city's
overcrowded airport.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in 1923, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego is one of
two Marine Corps training bases nationally, training more than 21,000
recruits annually from west of the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) called the decision "good for San
Diego, good for the Marine Corps, and good for America."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Byron Wear said that "no one could be more pleased
than I.... This historic site lives proudly in the hearts of Marines
throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad
called the decision a blow to the county. The supervisors had voted,
5 to 0, to invite the Marine Corps to return to El Toro, which was
once a Marine air station.</TE>
<TE>   "Our county is so patriotic. This is quite a loss to Orange
County," Coad said. "But the Marines made their decision based on
study, and that's the way it goes. We still have the red carpet out
for our nation's military, if they want to move back here."</TE>
<TE>   After Navy Secretary Gordon England announced his decision last
month to declare 3,700 acres of the El Toro property as surplus and
return ownership to civilian authorities, Jones said he wanted the
Marine Corps to study whether a portion of the site could be retained
for a recruit training depot.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-San Diego) had suggested that the
Marine facility in San Diego could be used to help expand Lindbergh
Field. But airport planners said the property is too small and oddly
shaped to alleviate the airport's main problem: the lack of a second
runway.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was initially interested in El Toro because it has thousands
of housing units. The San Diego base has little housing, and the
local civilian rental market is one of the country's most expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Marines appear to be staying in San Diego, Jones made
a note at the bottom of his letter to Rep. Hunter: "I'll need your
help re housing in San Diego."</TE>

<HD>Downtown Plan Faces County Suit</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Saying the undertaking would sap needed
revenue, supervisors OK suing the city. Stadium proposal could be
affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to sue the
city government for approving a massive downtown redevelopment
district that would play a key role in plans to build a $450-million
football stadium near Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, which the county's lawyer said would be prepared and
filed as soon as possible, puts top city and county officials in
conflict over the best use of the downtown area and over the tax
revenue generated by those neighborhoods. County supervisors said
they would not follow through on their litigation threat if the city
rescinded approval of the redevelopment area.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn denounced the supervisors' vote.</LD>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a former city councilman, said
city officials were using the redevelopment area to steer money to
wealthy businessmen trying to build a football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to thwarting the stadium proponents' mechanism to
condemn and acquire land for the 20-acre project, the lawsuit could
block efforts to create thousands of homes and jobs in 180 blighted
city blocks, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors, however, complained that the redevelopment area is a
tax giveaway that will deprive the county of money for programs such
as cash-strapped public hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "The low-income housing part of this is used as a fig leaf to
camouflage a subsidy for high-income developers," Yaroslavsky said.
"This is the oldest game in the book, and we're not going to sit back
and take it."</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors voted 5 to 0 in closed session to
authorize the suit unless the city rescinds the $2.4-billion
redevelopment plan. County Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman said county
attorneys will draft a complaint "right away."</TE>
<TE>   The City Center plan, approved earlier this month by the City
Council, is supposed to create up to 12,900 new homes, thousands of
jobs, and millions of square feet of commercial and economic
development.</TE>
<TE>   The 879-acre district includes the South Park, historic downtown
and City Market neighborhoods. If the district stands, the city's
Community Redevelopment Agency will receive 60% of future property
tax revenue on the condition that it invest the money in the
district. Twenty percent would go into a housing trust fund, and the
remaining 20% would go to the normal taxing entities: the city,
county, Los Angeles Unified School District and community college
district.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said that over the next 45 years, the plan would sap
the county of more than $250 million in new property tax
revenue--enough to fund 14 hospital beds annually--from land that
they maintain should have not been included in the district. The land
is primarily 30 acres of parking lots near Staples Center that are
slated to be turned into a $1-billion sports and entertainment
district.</TE>
<TE>   Some supervisors also argued that the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum, in Exposition Park, was a better facility for a new NFL
team. The supervisors have partial control over the Coliseum through
their seats on the Coliseum Commission, but the NFL has previously
rejected bringing football back to that stadium.</TE>
<TE>   County officials met Monday with Mayor Hahn, Councilwoman Jan
Perry and others about their concerns. Hahn's office said the mayor
was willing to negotiate but was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why taxpayers are fed up with government," he said
through a spokeswoman. "On the advice of its lawyers, the county is
attempting to use taxpayers' dollars to prevent the city from
creating new affordable housing, services for the homeless and
economic development in a part of the city that has one of the
greatest needs."</TE>
<TE>   However, Supervisor Gloria Molina said it is impossible to
negotiate with a plan already in place. "We weren't negotiating from
an equal basis. The only way we can negotiate is for him to rescind
the [redevelopment district], which he refused to do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry called the vote "unfortunate," but said she hopes the county
and the city can work out their differences.</TE>
<TE>   CRA spokeswoman Kiara Harris agreed. "The agency hopes to continue
to work with the county to find a solution that will be acceptable
for all parties involved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, other city officials said the move shows that the
fast-tracked plan did not receive enough scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "This is further evidence that the council acted too quickly to do
too much with too little input from the public and other government
agencies," said Councilman Jack Weiss, one of three council members
opposed to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "As I understand it, the stated purpose of redevelopment is to
help the less fortunate," he said. "It would be cruel irony if
redevelopment here were being used to benefit the haves at the
expense of the truly needy in our society who are the recipients of
public [aid from] the county."</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment plan--similar to one used to create Staples
Center--is considered key to building the 64,000-seat football
stadium in South Park.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA is the only city agency that has the power of eminent
domain. It also could float up to $100 million in low-interest
municipal bonds to pay for land that would be repaid by the stadium
developers. Both moves are necessary to make the stadium viable.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group and one of
four stadium principals, had said previously that the agency is the
"one entity in the city that is going to play a key role" in making
the proposal work. AEG was founded by Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, L.A. Avengers owner Casey Wasserman, supermarket mogul
Ron Burkle and developer Ed Roski hope to reach agreements with the
city, the National Football League and a team within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke declined to comment Tuesday on the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   And CRA officials declined to comment on how the lawsuit would
affect implementation of the City Center plan.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking generally, however, deputy administrator Don Spivack has
said that progress on such areas can be adversely affected by
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we get sued," he said before the vote, "there are limits on
what we can do. We're not necessarily stopped from doing any work."</TE>
<TE>   However, "it is generally most prudent to not undertake certain
activities that are irreversible, like acquiring property from funds
that may not have been received or finally certified," he said.</TE>

<HD>5 N. Korean Defectors Are Reportedly on Way to Asylum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>LOS ANGELES TIMES</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Five North Korean defectors who were arrested earlier this month at a
Japanese consulate in China were reported to be on their way to
asylum in South Korea today, apparently resolving an incident that
has undermined Chinese-Japanese relations.</LD>
<LD>   The face-saving deal was announced today by the Philippines, which
said it was awaiting the arrival of the defectors, who would be
stopping in Manila tonight on their way to South Korea. South Korean
and Japanese officials had no immediate comment on the reported deal.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the North Korean family has been a subject of keen
international interest ever since its members' arrest May 8 at the
Japanese consulate in Shenyang, where they had attempted to seek
diplomatic asylum. Dramatic footage of the group, including two women
and a 2-year-old girl, being dragged away by Chinese police was
widely televised and prompted an outcry in Japan and South Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Japan accused the Chinese of violating international law by
arresting the defectors at a diplomatic compound, but China produced
evidence that Japanese diplomats in China had approved the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The incident highlights the plight of more than 100,000 North
Koreans who have escaped the famine and political repression in their
country but must live as fugitives in China, which refuses to accord
them refugee status. Although this particular group requested asylum
in the United States, most defectors who are taken in go to South
Korea. So far this year, South Korea has resettled more than 300
defectors.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that the defectors should not be sent back to
North Korea but should be dealt with in a humanitarian manner," Kim
Euy Taek, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said
today. He would not confirm, however, that the latest five were on
their way to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Ebdalin, foreign undersecretary of the Philippines, today
told reporters in Manila that the defectors "will be transiting
through Manila en route to South Korea, all five of them."</TE>
<TE>   The group includes a husband and wife, their 2-year-old daughter,
Kim Han Mee--whose image during the arrest was repeatedly
televised--her grandmother and an uncle. They have relatives in South
Korea, including a cousin, Jang Gil Su, a teenage North Korean
defector who published a well-known book about the dangers the family
faced in North Korea and during the flight to China.</TE>
<TE>   According to Japanese media, the family was to leave China this
afternoon and arrive in the Philippines tonight, on the way to an
arrival in South Korea early Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Refugee activists believe that the increased defections from North
Korea through China are similar to the events of 1989, when East
Germans fled to the West through Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   During the World Cup soccer games, jointly held in South Korea and
Japan next month, activists are planning more asylum bids at several
embassies in Asia.</TE>

<LD>MEXICO</LD>
<LD>   Mexico has proposed a plan to reduce its water debt to the U.S.,
and officials say they won't have to institute strict conservation
measures to make the payments.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal calls for Mexico to increase its annual water payment
to the U.S. from about 15.2 billion cubic feet to about 24 billion
cubic feet a year for the next five years.</LD>
<TE>   That would reduce the debt to 24 billion cubic feet. The
government provided no details of how it would pay off the rest of
the debt.</TE>

<LD>   A senior Communist official accused President Bush of pandering to
exiles from Cuba in Miami by continuing hard-line policies against
the island as a payoff for help in the 2000 election.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's speeches Monday in favor of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba
were "a gesture of thanks" for the exiles' support of him and his
brother Jeb, who is seeking reelection as Florida's governor,
National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon said.</LD>

summer, but its navy, air force and special forces will continue in
the U.S.-led campaign.</LD>

<HD>Fighting Claims 9 Lives in Colombia</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Residents flee as a raid to root out rebels in
Medellin's slums sparks gun battles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MEDELLIN, Colombia</DL>
<LD>MEDELLIN, Colombia -- At least nine people were killed, including two
children, when gun battles erupted Tuesday between government troops
and Marxist rebels on the streets of Colombia's third-largest city,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The hours-long daylight clashes sent dozens of screaming
residents, many waving white flags, running for cover as hundreds of
heavily armed soldiers and police backed by armored vehicles chased
rebels in a crowded hillside slum in Medellin.</LD>
<LD>   Colombia's drug-fueled war claims 3,500 lives a year, but the
fighting rarely enters major cities as it did Tuesday, five days
before presidential elections in which the front-runner is a Medellin
native and anti-rebel hard-liner.</LD>
<TE>   In a stinging report Tuesday about another deadly clash, the
United Nations accused Colombia's government and military of failing
to prevent clashes between leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary
gunmen that killed more than 100 people May 2 in Bellavista.</TE>
<TE>   The Medellin fighting, which broke out after a dawn government
sweep to root out rebels, was one of the worst urban clashes in years
in Colombia's nearly 40-year war.</TE>
<TE>   At least 37 people--including troops, police, civilians and
guerrilla members--were wounded, said Alejandro Usuga, Medellin's
civil defense chief.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether government troops were among
the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Under Operation Marshall, about 900 soldiers and police with
assault rifles and bulletproof vests entered the San Javier slum and
other working-class areas in Medellin early Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   By noon, the streets had become a battleground in which panicked
residents, including entire families, were caught in the cross-fire.
Security forces crouched in narrow alleys and fired assault rifles at
rooftops and apartment buildings. The army said the raid was meant to
root out guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and
other rebel groups. The military said that 15 suspected rebels were
arrested.</TE>

<HD>EU Finalizes Exile of 12 Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Militants: They are to go to six nations. The 13th won't
leave Cyprus yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LARNACA, Cyprus</DL>
<LD>The European Union finalized a deal Tuesday to accept most of the 13
Palestinian militants involved in the siege of Bethlehem's Church of
the Nativity. The men have been eating three meals a day and passing
time watching satellite TV at a Cyprus beach hotel for the last two
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve are expected to fly today to six EU nations that have
agreed to offer them a home for at least a year. Abdallah Daud Kader,
the militant whom Israel considers the most dangerous, said he's
looking forward to a new life and reuniting with his family in
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Cyprus, a Mediterranean island state expected to join the EU by
January 2004, had reluctantly given temporary refuge to the
militants, whom Israel has accused of being terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   Under the EU deal given final approval Tuesday, Spain and Italy
will each take three militants, Greece and Ireland will each take
two, and Portugal and Belgium will each accept one. The 15-nation EU
said one militant would remain behind until an EU country could be
found to take him in.</TE>
<TE>   "The most dangerous one is staying in Cyprus," one diplomat said.
He was believed to be referring to Daud, who was in charge of
Palestinian intelligence in Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   The EU offered to take in the militants to end the 39-day standoff
that began after Palestinian militants escaped Israeli troops by
fleeing into the church.</TE>
<TE>   An EU statement said the 12 would stay in their host nations for
up to a year and would not be allowed to travel to other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Since May 10, the Palestinians have been living at the Flamingo
Beach Hotel in the resort of Larnaca under the round-the-clock watch
of Cypriot anti-terrorism police.</TE>

<HD>Separatist Is Shot Dead in Kashmir</HD>
<DH>Himalayas: Identity of attackers is unknown. Victim had
promoted dialogue with India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>A prominent separatist in Kashmir who sought dialogue with India and
opposed violence was shot to death Tuesday in front of 5,000 people
at a ceremony here to commemorate another assassinated independence
leader.</LD>
<LD>   The slaying of Abdul Ghani Lone, 70, came at a time of increasing
tensions between India and Pakistan, nuclear powers that have fought
two wars over the divided Himalayan region.</LD>
<LD>   The two countries exchanged heavy fire Tuesday across their border
in disputed Kashmir for the fifth day, killing nine people as Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee began a three-day visit to the
region, where a raid on an army camp last week stoked tensions.</LD>
<TE>   The two masked men who killed Lone escaped, and there was no
immediate claim of responsibility for his death.</TE>
<TE>   The killing came a day after Lone gave a lecture in which he said
he was ''not averse to talking with India or anyone else, and
Kashmir, like any mature political struggle, should be innovative in
its strategy.''</TE>
<TE>   The assassination was not the first attack on Lone. He had been
attacked last month by a Hindu nationalist and had said that India's
government tried to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   He also had been at odds with other separatists who do not favor
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Lone's son blamed his father's death on neighboring Pakistan and
its Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, which India says has
sponsored Islamic militant groups that have crossed into Kashmir and
supplanted local separatist groups.</TE>
<TE>   ''Pakistan and ISI killed him,'' Sajjad Lone told Associated Press
Television Network. He gave no explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning what it
called "coldblooded murder" and described the slaying as "yet another
incident in the continuing reign of terror unleashed by the occupying
forces in Indian-held Kashmir."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Lone and his father, a leading peace activist, have
urged the Pakistani-based Islamic militants who have fought Indian
forces in Kashmir for 12 years to give war-shattered residents a
chance to find a nonviolent way of expressing their desires for
self-government.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering at which the elder Lone was slain was to commemorate
the assassination 12 years ago of Kashmir's highest religious leader,
Mohammed Farooq.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Plays Tough in Battle With Ultra-Orthodox Parties</HD>
<DH>Israel: Prime minister wins kudos for firing four ministers
and standing up to two coalition partners who opposed budget cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon continued to play hardball
Tuesday with two ultra-Orthodox parties a day after he fired their
Cabinet ministers for helping to defeat the government's economic
austerity plan in parliament.</LD>
<LD>   While speculation mounted that the infighting might lead to the
government's collapse and early elections, Sharon said he would not
back down in his confrontation with Shas and United Torah Judaism.
Both parties voted against the economic plan, saying it would hurt
the poor.</LD>
<LD>   The former general ordered his aides not to return telephone calls
from leaders of either party. He vowed that negotiations with them
would begin only after he puts his budget cuts before the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, again today. No changes will be made in the
proposal before the vote, Sharon said.</LD>
<TE>   "He's playing chicken, and he wants to show them that he's a good
player," said Gideon Doron, a political scientist at Tel Aviv
University and a specialist on the Israeli political system.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's tough stance diverted attention from what Israeli
political analysts described as the debacle he suffered Monday night
when he failed to win approval for his economic plan despite leading
the broadest coalition government in Israeli history.</TE>
<TE>   An infuriated Sharon withdrew to his offices at the Knesset after
the plan lost by three votes. There he told his aides that "no one
spits in my face," Israeli television reported, and he fired off the
letters of dismissal to four Shas ministers.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, as the Shas ministers huddled with their spiritual
leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, to map out a strategy, Sharon was winning
praise for standing up to them. Ultra-Orthodox parties have caused
the collapse of both left- and right-wing governments on several
occasions, usually over budget allocations. Their ability to extract
funding for religious schools and subsidies for ultra-Orthodox
families is widely resented by many secular Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   When the previous prime minister, Ehud Barak of the Labor Party,
swept to power in 1999, tens of thousands of his supporters gathered
at a rally in Tel Aviv to protest against Shas as he contemplated
bringing the group into his coalition. Ultimately, Barak did turn to
Shas to form his Cabinet. In his short and turbulent time in office,
he gave in to their demands several times in hopes of holding his
coalition together.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's decision to fire the ministers, then, was seen as bold,
especially after last week, when he stood up to his party's central
committee in defending an eventual Palestinian state. The panel
nonetheless rejected the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "For the second time in less than 10 days, Sharon made a dignified
decision which does not necessarily dovetail with political
considerations," wrote the daily newspaper Maariv in its lead
editorial Tuesday. "He sent a clear message to his Shas partners, who
dared to undermine the economic plan which is essential to saving the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Pundits and pollsters said voters will be watching closely to see
whether Sharon ultimately makes concessions to keep Shas in the
government.</TE>
<TE>   "If he stands firm, he should gain points with the public," said
pollster Rafi Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said Sharon's decision in March to launch a massive military
sweep through the West Bank, plus his confrontation May 12 with
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before their Likud Party
Central Committee over the question of Palestinian statehood, boosted
his popularity.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone survey conducted by Smith's firm Monday before the
Knesset vote, Sharon received high marks from Israelis for
leadership. Asked whether they preferred Sharon or Netanyahu as
Likud's next candidate for prime minister, "the general population
prefers Sharon over Netanyahu by a margin of 55% to 22%," Smith said.
"It is one of the biggest margins our polls have given him over
Netanyahu."</TE>
<TE>   That margin, Smith said, is likely to increase if Sharon faces
down Shas or even decides to call elections. But if he opts for early
elections, his support could melt away if there is a new surge of
terrorist attacks or the economy's downward trend spins out of
control between the dissolution of the Knesset and the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that things are very fragile," Smith said. "So
early elections would be a risk."</TE>
<TE>   A second vote on the budget plan is expected to come just hours
before the dismissals of the four ministers take effect tonight. A
fifth Shas minister, who was not fired because he is not a Knesset
member, resigned in solidarity. Sharon also dismissed three Shas and
two United Torah Judaism deputy ministers.</TE>
<TE>   If the ultra-Orthodox ministers abstain from the balloting on the
economic plan rather than vote against it, Sharon is expected to
rescind the dismissals and his coalition would remain intact,
analysts said. But if they again vote no and quit the government,
Sharon will be left with just 60 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's gamble is that Shas, the third-largest party in the
Knesset, will relent rather than face early elections. Polls show it
probably would lose five or more of the 17 seats it holds if
elections were held in the next six months.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon jettisons the ultra- Orthodox parties, he probably will
try to bring the anti-Orthodox Shinui Party, the ultranationalist
National Union Party or both into the government. In a smaller
coalition, the center-left Labor Party would gain leverage as the
largest partner in a group including Labor, Likud and several smaller
right-wing parties.</TE>

<HD>Report Cites Victories in Battle Against Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Survey: U.S. points to significant number of arrests, along
with progress in getting 'state sponsors' to change, but it still
warns of dangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In its first official survey since Sept. 11 of the worldwide
terrorism threat, the State Department reported Tuesday that U.S.-led
efforts have made significant progress in capturing terrorists and
persuading some "rogue" nations to change their behavior.</LD>
<LD>   But the report also joined a growing chorus of alerts--including
one Tuesday from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld--by warning
that an array of extremist groups are racing to acquire the world's
deadliest germs, toxins and bomb materiel for use in future attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In testimony Tuesday, Rumsfeld told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that terrorist acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction is virtually unavoidable.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to recognize that terrorist networks have relationships
with terrorist states that have weapons of mass destruction, and that
they inevitably are going to get their hands on them and they would
not hesitate one minute to use them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's annual assessment carries particular weight
this year because it comes eight months after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks--which killed more than 3,000 people, had a sweeping impact
on economies worldwide and sparked the Bush administration's war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A striking aspect of the report, titled "Patterns of Global
Terrorism," is its good news. Although terrorist leader Osama bin
Laden may still be at large, the international pursuit of his Al
Qaeda network has arrested about 1,600 suspected operatives in 95
countries, according to the survey. This includes arrests in at least
two dozen nations where his militants were not known until recently
to operate.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier U.S. projections estimated that Al Qaeda had a presence in
at least 50 nations and perhaps up to 70.</TE>
<TE>   More than $116 million linked to terrorists has been blocked by
more than 50 countries worldwide, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Also, five of the seven nations listed by the State Department as
"state sponsors" of terrorism have begun to modify their behavior,
marking the most significant progress in a decade or more among so
many countries, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All seven "clearly heard the president's message" after Sept. 11
that nations either stood with the international counterterrorism
coalition or with the terrorists, asserts the U.S. report.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that Sudan and Libya are actively trying to "get
out of the business" of terrorism by participating in the global
campaign. Iran, Syria and North Korea have taken tentative steps "to
cooperate with the international community," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department maintains that Cuba and Iraq were found to
have made no such efforts. Indeed, the report charges that since
Sept. 11, Iraq has increased its support of militant groups and
terrorist activities. The regime of President Saddam Hussein also was
the only Arab or Muslim country not to condemn the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   None of the seven countries has done enough to be taken off the
terrorism sponsors' list or to have punitive U.S. economic sanctions
lifted, the survey says.</TE>
<TE>   "While some of these countries appear to be reconsidering their
present course, none has yet taken all the necessary actions to
divest itself fully of ties to terrorism," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan was judged to have done the most by arresting Al Qaeda
suspects and entering discussions with the United States on
terrorism. Some terrorists, however, still rely on Sudan as a haven,
the report notes.</TE>
<TE>   Libya is trying to recast itself as a peacemaker, the State
Department says, but has failed to meet a key U.S. demand that it
acknowledge its role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 or pay
compensation to the victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has reduced its involvement in some terrorist activities and
has worked with the United States on issues involving Afghanistan in
the wake of the U.S.-led military campaign there, the report finds.</TE>
<TE>   But the survey says that Iran remains the most active state
sponsor of international terrorism. Its intelligence service and
Revolutionary Guards were involved in planning terrorist acts in the
Middle East and supporting extremist groups, particularly radical
Palestinians, the report charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Although some within Iran would like to end this support,
hard-liners who hold the reins of power continue to thwart any
efforts to moderate these policies," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Summing up the findings, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said,
"The world's resolve to defeat [terrorism] has never been greater.</TE>
<TE>   "Country by country, region by region, coalition members have
strengthened law enforcement and intelligence cooperation," he said.
"We have tightened border controls and made it harder for terrorists
to travel, to communicate and therefore to plot. One by one, we are
severing the financial bloodlines of terrorism organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Powell called attention to the report's warnings that
extremist groups increasingly are focused on gaining access to the
world's deadliest weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists are trying every way they can to get their hands on
weapons of mass destruction, whether radiological, chemical,
biological or nuclear," Powell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden once said that obtaining weapons of mass destruction was
a "religious duty," the report notes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the carnage of Sept. 11, the number of terrorist attacks
globally last year was down from 426 in 2000 to 346. And more than
half of the year's attacks were on an oil pipeline in Colombia--not
in the volatile Middle East or troubled South Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 casualties accounted for 90% of the deaths worldwide
from the year's terrorism attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting Sept. 11, the terrorism-related death toll of
Americans declined from 19 in 2000 to eight last year.</TE>

<HD>Beware the Soccer Hooligans</HD>
<DH>In Japan, where fans chant politely and opposing
cheerleaders bow to each other, the specter of unruly Cup enthusiasts
strikes fear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Schools plan to close, families will keep their children indoors, and
barbers are considering lockdowns so their scissors don't become
deadly weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The prospect of thousands of large, loud, drunk, foreign,
out-of-control soccer rowdies invading this peaceful country at the
end of the month for the World Cup has Japanese bolting their doors
and bracing for the worst.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no interest in soccer, but I'm worried sick about
hooligans," said Mikako Murata, a 29-year-old homemaker living in
Tokyo. "I'm thinking about retreating from Tokyo to my parents' house
in the hinterlands."</LD>
<TE>   Japan, a nation where people leave little to chance, has gone into
anti-hooligan overdrive. In the four years since the last World Cup
was held in France, delegations have scoured the soccer universe for
tips on fighting the barbarian hordes Japan expects will arrive to
watch the biggest sporting event on Earth. Japan is co-hosting the
World Cup with South Korea in June, with matches held throughout both
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on a special national anti-hooligan budget of $35.6
million, thousands of Japanese police have fanned out to warn
businesses of the danger of hooligans, pronounced "fuurigans" in
Japanese, in the process terrifying many shopkeepers by showing them
footage of foreign soccer fans attacking police, burning shops and
brawling.</TE>
<TE>   One of the ingenious weapons in Japan's arsenal is something
reminiscent of the Middle Ages--a sort of pole-mounted wire noose to
encircle foreign ankles.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to defeat taller opponents would be to trip them up
and then subdue them on the ground," police informed Japanese
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Another technology is more evocative of the Roman Colosseum: nets.
Police have unveiled special guns that cast large webs over intended
targets. A test in December successfully entangled actors posing as
the foreign menace at a distance of 16 feet.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, authorities have enlisted "hooligan helpers" in
areas around the 10 stadiums where matches will be held to warn of
troublemakers, beefed up K9 units and bought new plexiglass riot
shields. If those precautions don't work, they've also programmed
giant trucks with huge digital signs that read in several languages:
"We are the police. Calm down."</TE>
<TE>   In Miyagi prefecture, a largely rural area that will be the site
of three matches, a local assemblyman warns of foreigners selling
cocaine and heroin, burning parked cars and paralyzing traffic
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We must also brace against unwanted babies being conceived by
foreigners who rape our women," said Takayoshi Konno, a member of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. "Clearly we must prepare for the
worst."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly some Japanese concern is warranted, given past
soccer-related trouble in Europe and Latin America, where pitched
fighting has erupted inside stadiums coupled with violence and
vandalism nearby. But Japan's reaction has arguably bordered on the
extreme, prompting foreign governments to mount a calming campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The British Embassy in Tokyo has set up Web sites, organized
traveling road shows of sports club members and journalists to
explain British sports traditions, and brought two ministers over
from London to address the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the media whip up fears of a modern-day invasion of the
Huns, most Japanese seem a bit vague about exactly what a hooligan
looks like.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really sure," homemaker Murata said. "They're probably
not American, although some of those New York Yankee fans might come
pretty close. They're probably bald, fat and drunk, with tattoos."</TE>
<TE>   One problem foreign embassies are grappling with is that even
behavior considered normal by ordinary sports enthusiasts abroad--a
bit of yelling and carrying on--can seem menacing in a nation where
fans chant politely to the beat of brass bands, opposing cheerleaders
bow respectfully to each other and fans cart off their own litter.</TE>
<TE>   The subtext for much of the anxiety, sociologists say, is Japan's
often-complex view of foreigners, its relatively low tolerance for
disorder and ongoing strains in its relationship with the outside
world.</TE>
<TE>   For most of its history, Japan could control its contacts with
foreigners, as seen by its insistence during centuries past that
traders and emissaries stay in small areas around Nagasaki and
Yokohama.</TE>
<TE>   While Japan these days is an increasingly open society, there's
still a tendency, particularly among older, more conservative people
to blame ills on outsiders, said Ryogo Mabuchi, a sociologist with
Nara University.</TE>
<TE>   "The crime rate among foreigners living in Japan is actually much
lower than among Japanese," he said. "That's a fact. But many
Japanese still have a biased image."</TE>
<TE>   Globalization and cheap imports have also spurred anti-foreign
sentiments among farmers and other workers worried about their
livelihoods. Overseas practices increasingly dictate how Japanese
society is structured, its workers paid and its industries
reorganized, undermining centuries-old traditions.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the size issue. Police are concerned about the
bulk of the potential troublemakers, resulting in a buying spree of
oversized handcuffs and much public fretting that judo and jujitsu
skills will be ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese youths are bigger these days, but still nothing compared
to Europeans," Masatsugu Oi, part of the special World Cup security
division in the city of Sapporo, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   As fears have spread like a wave through a stadium, some Japanese
have decided their best defense is to flee as quickly as possible.
Car dealers near the Sapporo Dome even plan to drive their fleets
away for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   "Headquarters said we should be all right, but we just can't
afford to be optimistic," said Wataru Saito, branch manager at
Sapporo Nissan, a dealership near the Dome.</TE>
<TE>   One plan is to deprive the marauders of ammunition. Residents have
been instructed to remove flowerpots, bricks, bottles and anything
else that might become hooligan missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Another would limit the elixir that fuels much wanton destruction:
beer. While brewers Asahi, Sapporo and Kirin may secretly hope for a
monthlong binge to spur flagging sales, stadiums plan to limit sales
of beer to the first half of the matches and serve it only in paper
cups. Drinking establishments are also on alert.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't let people drink here if they were at the matches," said
Seiichi Kawai, manager of a beer hall in the city of Sendai. "That
said, we haven't had any experience dealing with foreign hooligans,
so we're still not real sure how to handle all this."</TE>
<TE>   For most Japanese, there's only one real source of all things
hooligan--jolly England--with Battleground No. 1 seen as the June 7
game in Sapporo between England and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Argentine player Aldo Duscher break the left foot of
star English player David Beckham in April--enough of a reason for a
good bash for some avid sports fans--there was also Argentine Diego
Maradona's incredible goal in 1986 that prevented England from
advancing, not to mention the Falklands War. Also on the radar screen
are games involving the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   The close association between England and trouble in many Japanese
minds, reinforced by the media and fanned by the police, has kicked
the British government into overdrive amid fears that billions in
trade, investment and tourism could go up in a cloud of beer breath.
Its goal: Preserve the image of the "British gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese like hosting international sporting events, but most
of these have involved the Olympic crowd attended by the likes of
Princess Anne," said Jonathan Watts, the Japan correspondent for
Britain's Guardian newspaper and an avid soccer fan. "Now they're
going to see what real in-your-face working-class Britain is like."</TE>
<TE>   It is argued repeatedly that most English sports fans are quite
well-behaved. And just in case, London says it will confiscate the
passports of 900 known sports ruffians five days before the beginning
of the World Cup to prevent them from traveling--under the Football
Disorder Act, legislation that provides police powers not even
available in cases of known pedophiles, armed robbers or terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident this will stop the hard-core troublemakers from
coming in," an embassy spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's National Criminal Intelligence Service is also passing
on tips and posting undercover hooligan spotters at airport
immigration halls and Japanese stadium gates.</TE>
<TE>   British diplomats hope to educate everyday fans so they won't
scare their Japanese hosts. "You are an ambassador for your country,"
a Foreign Office Web site says. "Loud and boisterous behavior in
public is less accepted than in the UK.... Don't take your shirt off
in public places--if you have tattoos, do what you can to keep them
out of sight."</TE>
<TE>   At the other extreme, Britain has sought to intimidate
troublemakers by outlining Japan's detention laws, under which
offenders can be held for up to three weeks without charges before
facing courts with a 97% conviction rate.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be a question of saying, 'You're a naughty boy, get on
the plane, go back home to England,'" warned Dennis McShane of the
British Foreign Office. "They will see the next World Cup in four
years' time eating a bowl of rice in a Japanese prison."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's greatest protection against the rowdy foreign masses,
however, is arguably one that's served it well at least as far back
as the Mongols' attempted invasion in the 13th century: its island
status and distance from other civilizations.</TE>
<TE>   The average fan from Germany, the Netherlands, Brazil or Britain
needs to travel upward of 12,000 miles round trip and spend as much
as $7,000 to attend these games. The result, organizers estimate, is
that fewer than 10,000 British fans will make the trip, compared with
the 25,000 who crossed the English Channel to attend the World Cup in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone is looking at the soccer ball's dark
patches. A local soccer booster club in Osaka hopes to counteract the
stereotype that all foreigners are potential hooligans. The group is
printing up 1,000 T-shirts that say: "I am not a hooligan" in
Japanese, said club member Takamasa Tamura. Foreigners will be asked
to wear them so Japanese will rest easier, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if all else fails, some towns are hoping to appeal to the
hooligans' softer side. As a sideline to the main show, they are
offering the foreigners tea ceremonies, lessons in flower-arranging
and guided tours of historical sites.</TE>

<HD>Sounding Out Russia on Hussein</HD>
<DH>Policy: U.S. has hinted that it is willing to assure that
Moscow's interests won't be compromised if Putin were to back an
ouster of the Iraqi leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Can the United States get Russia on board for a war against Iraq if
U.N. sanctions fail to drive President Saddam Hussein from power?</LD>
<LD>   That is one of the intriguing questions to be raised when
President Bush meets with President Vladimir V. Putin in a four-day
summit starting Thursday. The U.S. and Russia are trying out a new,
closer strategic relationship, and American officials are eager to
see just how cooperative Moscow will be in dealing with countries
such as Iraq and Iran.</LD>
<LD>   A senior U.S. diplomat, who recently briefed journalists about the
summit, indicated that the Bush administration is willing to make any
military action against Iraq, a traditional Russian ally,
significantly more palatable to Putin by offering assurances that
Russian economic interests will not be harmed.</LD>
<TE>   In particular, he hinted that the U.S. would look favorably on a
post-Hussein regime honoring Iraq's $8 billion in debts to Russia as
well as keeping in place lucrative oil contracts and equipment sales
that the Persian Gulf nation has awarded Russian companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are things we are prepared to talk about, shall we say, in
a positive spirit, if it helps us get to the common goal of denying
Saddam Hussein the ability to develop weapons of mass destruction,"
the diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russia has been Hussein's main ally in the many U.N.
Security Council debates on Iraq over the last decade, the deepening
friendship between Moscow and Washington since the war on terrorism
began last fall could herald a shift in Russia's perception of its
own interests, the diplomat suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it is foreordained that we will have a parting of
the ways if pressure fails and military options have to be
considered," he said. "I think the Russians, if Saddam blows his last
chance, are prepared to say, 'We tried, but there is nothing more we
can do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Russian-Iraqi Ties</TE>
<TE>   The Russian-Iraqi business relationship is no small matter here.
Some experts estimate its long-term value at $40 billion, or about
two-thirds of Russia's national budget for this year. Just this week,
there were appeals from the Russian oil industry for Putin to
"protect" Iraq from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said
Monday that Iraq would be on the agenda of the Bush-Putin meeting but
indicated that the discussion would not necessarily be about military
action.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the president hasn't made any decisions on what to do about
the status quo in Iraq, just that the status quo is unacceptable, I
think he will want to consult with Putin on exactly that point," Rice
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is likely to lay out the U.S. case for ousting Hussein and
argue that Russia would be better off with a successor regime in Iraq
that would not threaten other nations in the Persian Gulf region,
another U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   But this official said that some of the urgency of winning Russian
support has faded since it became clear that the U.S. is willing to
wait because of renewed efforts at the United Nations to impose a
return of weapons inspectors on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   John Tedstrom, a former National Security Council aide, said the
summit was a natural occasion for Bush to try to win support on Iraq.
Although the Russians have criticized American talk of a "regime
change," Putin shares Bush's concern about the threat of radical
Islam, Tedstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time, in a one-on-one, where you'd get the president
to say, 'We need to talk about this seriously, and we need to come
together and support our common interests,'" said Tedstrom, now at
the East West Institute, a think tank in New York</TE>
<TE>   Tedstrom predicted that Bush would seek an agreement in principle
on policy toward Iraq and that the president might ask for Russian
help in intelligence-sharing and overflight rights.</TE>
<TE>   Limits to Guarantees</TE>
<TE>   But Tedstrom doubted that the U.S. would go so far as to guarantee
that the successor regime would repay Iraq's debt to Russia. He said
the U.S. was more likely to promise help getting easier terms on
debts Russia owes the West.</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a former National Security Council aide now at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, said he believes Russian
opposition to ousting Hussein is already on the wane because of
Putin's inclination "not to oppose things he can't stop anyway."</TE>
<TE>   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov insisted before a
committee in parliament Tuesday that Moscow still opposes U.S.
military strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Putin is under pressure from his own business community to delay
any U.S.-led military action, said Andrei V. Ryabov, an analyst at
the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite possible, reasonable and logical that Russian oil
tycoons should ask President Putin to try and put in a word of
protection for Saddam," the analyst said, pointing out that the
international oil embargo on Iraq has helped keep oil prices from
falling.</TE>
<TE>   Russian oil tycoons understandably are skeptical of any Washington
promise to watch out for their economic interests, Ryabov said. "They
can't feel secure about any guarantees the U.S. administration may
give out now--before the operation starts."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the United States holds sway over the next Iraqi
government, it still might not be able to guarantee Russia's oil
activities in the Persian Gulf nation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is whether this [new] government would be stable
enough," Ryabov said. "There might be terrorists from all over the
world converging on Iraq, exploding oil rigs and committing all kinds
of sabotage."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Free Up $40 Million and Back Loans for Yugoslavia</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Powell says decision was based on Belgrade's
cooperation with war crimes court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>After a seven-week hiatus, the Bush administration announced Tuesday
that it would resume economic aid to Yugoslavia, saying the Balkan
nation had met U.S. requirements that it cooperate with the war
crimes tribunal in The Hague.</LD>
<LD>   The tribunal has demanded that the Yugoslav government arrest and
send to the Netherlands suspects who have been indicted for war
crimes committed during the last decade of wars in Croatia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main
Yugoslav republic.</LD>
<LD>   At stake for Yugoslavia, struggling to make the transition to a
market economy, is roughly $40 million in U.S. aid and crucial U.S.
backing to obtain loans from the World Bank and other international
lenders and investors.</LD>
<TE>   When American aid to a country is suspended, U.S. officials at
international lending institutions are required by law to vote
against loans to the nation from those organizations. The U.S. aid to
Yugoslavia was suspended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Western government in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
hopes that the U.S. decision will open the way for a stream of
international economic support.</TE>
<TE>   "Earlier this morning, I signed a certification required under
U.S. law that we have been receiving the necessary cooperation" from
Yugoslav authorities with the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said. His
announcement coincided with one in London that Britain was forgiving
$350 million in Yugoslav debt. Last week, presumably with the U.S.
decision already in the offing, the World Bank announced it would
give loans worth about $825 million over the next three years to the
Balkan nation.</TE>
<TE>   Present for Powell's announcement were Zoran Djindjic, the prime
minister of Serbia, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic.
The two had come to the U.S. to lobby for an end to the aid
suspension in light of their governments' efforts to transfer war
crimes suspects to The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   After Powell's announcement, prosecutors in The Hague criticized
the Yugoslav efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We find the level of cooperation to date with the tribunal by the
Belgrade authorities leaves a lot to be desired," said deputy
prosecutor Graham Blewitt. "We haven't seen one individual
apprehended by the Belgrade authorities. We hope that will occur."</TE>
<TE>   Although none of the Serbs indicted in war crimes cases were
arrested after the suspension of aid, the Yugoslav government
negotiated the surrender of six indictees and transferred five of
them to the Netherlands. In addition, the Yugoslav parliament passed
a law facilitating the transfer of others who could be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   All of those who have surrendered have pleaded not guilty. In the
latest plea, former Serbian rebel leader Milan Martic told the court
Tuesday that he was innocent of charges that he ordered rockets to be
launched on the Croatian capital, Zagreb.</TE>
<TE>   Although Yugoslavia has moved--albeit slowly--to comply with The
Hague, it has made clear that it is unlikely to arrest the two most
wanted war crimes suspects, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic. Karadzic is thought to be
outside Yugoslav jurisdiction; Mladic's whereabouts are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Though Powell praised the new Yugoslav laws as well as the
surrender of suspects, it was clear that the U.S. decision also was
based on Washington's desire to shore up the new government in
Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important step forward in relations between our two
countries," said Powell, adding that the U.S. planned to free
Yugoslav state assets that were frozen before the 1999 war between
the Balkan country and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic promised that police would proceed with the arrests of
those who have not yet surrendered. He later told Serbian state
television, "Our task is to remove all of the obstacles in the way of
our country taking its rightful place in Europe."</TE>

report.</TE>

<HD>Army's New Message to Attract Recruits: Uncle 'Sim' Wants
You</HD>
<DH>Technology: The service will unveil video games to woo a
media-savvy generation with a simulation of military life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America's youth would rather play video games than do push-ups in the
mud--a reality the Army wants to harness to its advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Eager to prove it's not your grandfather's military, the Army is
developing video games to recruit and build awareness among
Generation Y.</LD>
<LD>   Today at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, the
Army will unveil two games designed to appeal to a media-saturated,
tech-bombarded generation. One is a sanitized version of "Unreal
Tournament," a classic first-person shooting game known for its
graphic, nonstop killing. The other is a take on "The Sims," a
popular game that mimics life itself.</LD>
<TE>   But instead of dismembering mutants or pursuing romance, players
can work on their organizational skills, free hostages and rise to
the rank of first sergeant. The games are part of the Army of One
marketing campaign, which stresses professionalism and the importance
of the individual, themes marketers say resonate with youths.</TE>
<TE>   Though the military has long used realistic video games as
training tools, this is the first time the Army has relied on games
to reach out to the public. The intent of the free games--which will
be distributed starting in July at recruiting stations and on the
Army Web site--is to sell the soldiering life.</TE>
<TE>   Although interest in military careers rose after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, enlistments have changed little in recent years.
And it's getting tougher to attract and retain soldiers, in part
because there are fewer veterans to regale potential recruits with
tales of their military exploits.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to give them a synthetic experience of being in the
Army in game form," said Michael Zyda, director of the Naval
Postgraduate School's Modeling, Virtual Environments and Simulation
Institute in Monterey, which developed both games.</TE>
<TE>   "When I registered for the draft during the Vietnam War, I asked
veterans of the Korean War what it was like," he said. "They were
easy to find. Today, the Army is much smaller. There aren't as many
people around today to answer that question."</TE>
<TE>   The game project started two years ago, when the economy was
bursting at the seams and dot-coms beckoned young people with the
promise of riches and freewheeling offices in which they could
skateboard. The Army spent $5 million to develop video games to show
Army life. Like unscripted TV shows, the games show mostly action,
leaving out the boring parts.</TE>
<TE>   "Soldiers," for example, takes gamers from basic training to
career development. Spit-shining shoes and peeling potatoes are not
among the list of activities. Players going through sniper training
in the more action-oriented "Operations" game don't have to camp out
for hours waiting for terrorists to show up.</TE>
<TE>   The games depict an Army that is precise, organized and
technically advanced. Tactical missions and advanced weaponry are the
focus of the game's missions, not violence.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey this year by Northwestern University of 1,000 college
students, the No. 1 concern about joining the military was danger,
said Charles Moskos, professor of sociology at Northwestern and an
expert on public attitudes toward the military.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something recruiters just don't talk about," Moskos said.
"But being in the Army is as dangerous as being a taxicab driver,
which is considered to be one of the most hazardous occupations."</TE>
<TE>   Because of such concerns, the armed forces have a difficult time
replenishing their ranks. The military spends twice as much
recruiting each soldier today--about $10,000--as it did 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Army met its recruitment targets in three of the last
five years--about 80,000 a year--those goals are far lower than in
the past, Moskos said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the current global climate, America is "likely going to need
more people in the armed forces in the coming years," he said.
"That's when the recruitment shortfalls will come."</TE>
<TE>   Although store shelves are bulging with video games that have
military themes, some of which are so realistic they are used by the
military to train soldiers, commercial games such as "Halo" lack the
realism of being in the Army, Zyda said.</TE>
<TE>   Technical realism, in fact, is one of the biggest selling points
of the two new games.</TE>
<TE>   To make "Operations," developers rode tanks and Blackhawk
helicopters, parachuted from airplanes and shot rifles and machine
guns. They brought in soldiers from the Army's Special Forces to
critique scenes and levels. They scanned images of 12 weapons and
programmed their recoils, accuracies and bullet speeds into the game.
For "Soldiers," developers videotaped real soldiers and drill
sergeants.</TE>
<TE>   Will that be good enough?</TE>
<TE>   "It can't hurt," Moskos said. "But a video game isn't going to be
as good as real personal contact."</TE>
<TE>   Or like doing push-ups in the mud.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Fined $100 Million Over Bullish Stock Advice</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Brokerage admits no wrongdoing in settling
charges of conflict of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Brokerage giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed Tuesday to pay $100
million in fines to settle charges of tainted advice by its stock
analysts and said it would adopt reforms aimed at restoring the
credibility of Wall Street's investment guidance.</LD>
<LD>   The deal with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, reached after
weeks of negotiations that lasted until 2 a.m. Tuesday, should be a
template for industrywide change, Spitzer said.</LD>
<LD>   But the agreement doesn't require Merrill to admit wrongdoing and
provides no restitution for investors who believe they lost money
when they followed allegedly misleading stock advice. Investors will
have to sue Merrill on their own, Spitzer said.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some experts said the Merrill case is a landmark in
exposing for average investors the inherent conflicts of interest at
major brokerages. Critics have long contended that research analysts
face pressure to skew opinions of stocks simply to better the chances
that the subject companies would grant fee-rich investment banking
work to their brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Those conflicts were amplified in the stock market's boom years of
the late 1990s, but few questions were raised until the boom went
bust starting in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over the credibility of analysts' advice prompted
Congress to hold hearings on the issue a year ago. But it was
Spitzer's probe that triggered a firestorm in early April when he
released e-mails he obtained by subpoena, showing how Merrill
analysts in 2000 and 2001 privately denigrated many Internet stocks
even as they urged the public to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   Some stocks with "buy" ratings were referred to as "a piece of
crap" or worse in the e-mails. Many of the Internet shares have since
collapsed to penny prices, or zero, wiping out billions of dollars in
investors' wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill issued an apology Tuesday for the e-mails, some of which,
it said, "violated internal policies, failed to meet the high
standards that are our tradition and will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   In its settlement with Spitzer, the brokerage agreed to completely
separate analyst pay from investment banking, forbidding bankers from
having any input on analyst compensation; create a panel to review
and approve all stock ratings; increase disclosure about ratings; and
appoint a "compliance monitor" for one year.</TE>
<TE>   "The actions we are taking will ensure that analysts are
compensated only for activities intended to benefit investors,"
Merrill Chief Executive David Komansky said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said his office is continuing to investigate potential
conflicts of interest at other major Wall Street firms, and he called
on them--without naming names--to fall into line behind Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerages reportedly still under investigation include Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co., Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting its
own probe in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "To other investment houses that have received subpoenas," Spitzer
said at a news conference Tuesday, "I would suggest that you review
your e-mails, review your documents, and once you have conducted that
review ... come in and have a forthright conversation with us as we
continue to march forward and reform this industry."</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs, perhaps hoping to forestall reforms imposed from
the outside, on Tuesday named E. Gerald Corrigan, former president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as an in-house ombudsman to
protect analyst independence.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, asked about allowing Merrill to settle without admitting
wrongdoing, said, "It would in essence have been a death warrant for
the company to admit liability."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, investors who lost money following what they
believe were tainted stock tips have "a much stronger case today than
they did eight weeks ago," before he released the private e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said that he supported investors' efforts to obtain
restitution but that it must be done through the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said there was no assurance that any reforms
could guarantee that brokerage advice will be entirely objective. As
long as investment banking remains a major profit center for
securities firms, it is impossible to eliminate all potential
conflicts of interest, critics said.</TE>
<TE>   They noted that brokerages have perpetually insisted that their
analysts operated independent of investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics said the reforms would help to shine a bright
light on Wall Street practices and highlight the need for investors
to be more careful in taking advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not convinced that bolstering investor confidence in Wall
Street research really ought to be our goal," said Barbara Roper,
director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps bolstering a healthy skepticism about Wall Street
research is a better goal, and Mr. Spitzer has certainly accomplished
that," Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   The $100-million penalty--$48million to New York, the rest to the
49 other states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, if all
parties agree--rivals the largest fines assessed against brokerages
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It equals January's
$100-million settlement by Credit Suisse First Boston of SEC charges
that it mishandled initial public stock offerings. That was the
fifth-largest brokerage settlement in SEC history.</TE>
<TE>   The fine is less than one-fifth of Merrill's total net profit last
year of $573 million.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement quickly drew criticism from Washington, where
Spitzer was accused of trying to usurp the SEC's authority.</TE>
<TE>   The deal "raises an important issue as to whether the capital
markets will continue to be regulated by the SEC, or whether state
attorneys general and the trial lawyers will become the de facto
regulators of the securities market," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandstanding by ambitious and publicity-hungry officials will
not lead to healthy and responsible securities markets," Oxley said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, 42, is a Democrat who is seeking reelection and,
according to friends, is considering a future run for governor of New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said his office and the SEC are partners in their
investigations and that he had talked by telephone Tuesday morning
with SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   However, Spitzer said he considered his settlement with Merrill to
be "better, a little more complete" than recent reforms proposed by
the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and adopted by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   He called those rules "too porous and a bit meager" in addressing
the key issue of separating analyst compensation from a firm's
investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's enforcement director, said that
"while this settlement is an important milestone for investor
protection, it is not the finish line and will not preclude our own
efforts on behalf of the investing public."</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern University law professor David S. Ruder, a former SEC
chairman, said one of the most important reforms for investors will
be increased disclosure about analysts' ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, under Tuesday's deal, will announce when it discontinues
research coverage of a firm, state the reasons and disclose that its
previous rating is no longer valid.</TE>
<TE>   The change is meant to rectify situations in which a "buy"
recommendation might have lingered long after a company's stock had
crumbled and the brokerage had terminated research coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill also will disclose the percentage of its ratings that are
"buy," "hold" or "reduce" so investors can better gauge what analysts
mean when they say "buy."</TE>
<TE>   "The public was sort of left out of the code that sophisticated
investors knew, that there was seldom a 'sell' recommendation," Ruder
said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Secession Plan Appears Ballot-Bound</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: The LAFCO majority favors sending issue to
voters. Decision is expected today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The future of Los Angeles as the nation's second-largest city could
be put in the hands of voters today as a nine-member commission
prepares to authorize a ballot measure that would allow the San
Fernando Valley to break away from the city and form a major
metropolis.</LD>
<LD>   In interviews, a majority of the members of the Local Agency
Formation Commission said they intend to vote today to place the
secession measure on the Nov. 5 ballot, barring any last-minute
finding that a Valley city would be financially unhealthy or would
leave the remainder of Los Angeles in fiscal trouble.</LD>
<LD>   An updated report on the secession proposal concluded Tuesday that
the Valley would be required to pay the remaining city $128 million a
year to protect it against fi-nancial harm. That payment would drop
5% a year for 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   The report clears the final hurdle to today's LAFCO deliberations,
a watershed moment in the history of Los Angeles' secession
movements. For years, advocates of a municipal breakup have fought to
bring the idea to a city vote. More recently, even some critics of
secession have agreed that a vote is needed, if only to test Los
Angeles' willingness to reconsider itself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm likely to put it on the ballot," said county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, a LAFCO member. "I think it's time to let the people
decide. The burden now is on the opponents."</TE>
<TE>   Even Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, a LAFCO member and secession
foe, has told her council colleagues she believes the state-created
commission will schedule the citywide vote on Valley independence. If
it does, only a successful court challenge could block a breakup
election.</TE>
<TE>   With a staff of just seven employees, LAFCO is responsible for
analyzing cityhood applications to ensure they meet state legal
requirements that deal primarily with financial issues. It then
drafts the final plan for the ballot. That includes the proposed
city's boundaries, government structure, start-up revenues and
expenditures, as well as a selection of suggested names for the
municipality.</TE>
<TE>   Many on LAFCO Are</TE>
<TE>   Small-Town Officials</TE>
<TE>   And yet, despite the political reach of those decisions,
Yaroslavsky, Miscikowski and county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke are the only LAFCO members who represent large constituencies
as elected officials. The others are mostly small-town officials from
outlying areas of the county, appointed to LAFCO by a variety of
agencies. Among them are city council members from Diamond Bar and
Pico Rivera, a former Whittier school board member and a Santa
Clarita water board director.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, five said they are likely to vote for a secession
election. Three said they are undecided. Pico Rivera Councilwoman
Beatrice Proo did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen anything to keep me from supporting it," LAFCO
Chairman Henri F. Pellissier said. "I don't see anything in the
Valley proposal that doesn't say 'go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the anti-secession fight,
called on the commission Tuesday to delay its decision until next
week. Hahn said the public should be given more time to review recent
changes in the Valley cityhood report by LAFCO Executive Director
Larry Calemine. Commissioners did not indicate whether they would
grant a delay.</TE>
<TE>   Members Say Rhetoric</TE>
<TE>   Hasn't Swayed Them</TE>
<TE>   As secession has gained attention in recent months, commissioners
increasingly have been placed at the center of a sometimes
impassioned debate over Los Angeles' future. LAFCO also is set to
decide in the next two weeks whether to place secession proposals for
Hollywood and the harbor area on the November ballot. The
commissioners said they have not been offended by the criticism or
swayed by the political rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   For most, the secession study has taken chunks out of their lives,
forcing them to spend long hours reading dense, technical material
from demographers, financial experts and attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   James DiGiuseppe is a retired Municipal Court judge from Van Nuys
and one of two LAFCO members appointed to represent the public at
large rather than cities, special districts or Los Angeles County.
The Board of Supervisors named DiGiuseppe to the commission
specifically to represent the Valley. Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who
supports secession, asked him to serve.</TE>
<TE>   DiGiuseppe said he signed the Valley secession petition because he
wanted to see what a LAFCO evaluation would find.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's legal, I would vote in favor of it," DiGiuseppe said,
noting that Calemine has determined the plan meets all lawful
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his third four-year term on LAFCO, DiGiuseppe said not even
his judicial career prepared him for wading through the thousands of
pages of technical documents on dividing Los Angeles, its assets and
its liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Like other LAFCO members, DiGiuseppe said he has not been heavily
lobbied by either side. Commissioners said they have not been
contacted by Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Carol Herrera said the only feedback she has received
is a handful of letters from Valley residents who are opposed to
holding an election for a Valley city council on the same ballot as
secession itself. By law, the election of prospective city officers
must be held concurrently with a cityhood vote.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera, a former Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. supervisor and a Diamond
Bar City Council member for the last seven years, was appointed last
year to LAFCO by the League of California Cities. She also views the
Valley proposal favorably, although she hopes to resolve some
disagreements with Los Angeles officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley looks positive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Jerry Gladbach said he also will probably back an
election unless Calemine retreats from the position that a Valley
city would be financially viable.</TE>
<TE>   Gladbach, a retired engineer for the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power, has been an elected member of the Lake Castaic Water
Agency's board of directors since 1985. The agency is a water
wholesaler for Santa Clarita Valley. A committee representing special
districts appointed Gladbach to LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his ties to the DWP, Gladbach has been skeptical and
critical of Los Angeles officials' assertions that secession would
cause the city great harm.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s Numbers Inflated, Commissioner Says</TE>
<TE>   "I think their numbers are inflated and they haven't been
forthcoming," Gladbach said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he supports Calemine's proposal that the DWP continue
to serve a Valley city, at rates no higher than those charged Los
Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   Pellissier also is retired, having run a family real estate
development and property management firm in Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   He has served on LAFCO since 1980, and was first appointed during
his 12 years on the board of the Whittier Union High School District.
He is the other LAFCO member designated to represent the public at
large.</TE>
<TE>   Pellissier said he doesn't feel any pressure to decide one way or
the other on secession, but he believes it will end up on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we are going to settle this. The voters are going to
settle it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky, who served 19 years on the Los Angeles City Council,
is a Westside resident whose supervisorial district includes part of
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has received letters and e-mail from union leaders and
the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley urging him to oppose
a secession election. But he said he is inclined to favor the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel pressure to do this right and reach a fair and
judicious decision," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Burke also has raised many questions about the LAFCO studies, and
officially is undecided on a secession vote. Her supervisorial
district is anchored in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I do want to make sure the area that is left, that I represent,
is not unduly burdened, that it can continue to provide services,"
said Burke, who was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1992 and
has been on LAFCO for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Also undecided is Commissioner William Wentworth, an elected
member of the Walnut Valley Water District and former mayor of
Walnut. He is a retired medical representative for a pharmaceutical
company.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski Expected</TE>
<TE>   to Lead the Dissent</TE>
<TE>   Likely to lead the dissent at today's meeting is Miscikowski, who
has continued to express reservations about putting the secession
proposal on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski, who was elected in 1997 and whose council district
includes Sherman Oaks, Encino and part of Van Nuys, has repeatedly
spearheaded council decisions protesting the LAFCO study as flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, she voted to ask LAFCO not to put secession on the
ballot unless major revisions were made in the plan, which would
increase the so-called alimony the Valley would pay Los Angeles to
cover revenue losses.</TE>
<TE>   "LAFCO is not doing the job it needs to do on an analysis of
equity, fiscal viability and revenue neutrality," Miscikowski said.</TE>

<HD>After 20 Years, Man Held in Killing</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Suspect in the death of his first wife's lover is
found in Baldwin Park with a new identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Baldwin Park man suspected of killing his wife's lover 20 years
ago, fleeing to Mexico and then sneaking back to Los Angeles a few
years later to start a new life is behind bars, police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco Serrano Trujillo, 46, was eating a chicken dinner with
his new wife and teenage daughter about 7 p.m. Monday evening when
officers arrived at his bungalow in the 4300 block of Bogart Avenue
to arrest him in connection with the March 16, 1982, shooting death
of Evodio Espinosa.</LD>
<LD>   Trujillo, who had been living under the name Andres Briseno, put
down his eating utensils and quietly left with detectives, said Det.
Rick Swanston of the LAPD's West Valley Division.</LD>
<TE>   "He didn't appear to be all that surprised. In fact, he was calm,"
Swanston said. "He initially denied being Trujillo but eventually
admitted it."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe Trujillo, angered by a budding relationship
between his previous wife, whose name was not immediately available,
and Espinosa, killed him with a series of shots from a .22-caliber
revolver.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa, 23, was shot at a house he shared with Trujillo's
brother and five other adults in the 6400 block of Franrivers Avenue
in Canoga Park, now part of West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Police issued a warrant for Trujillo's arrest immediately after
the killing, but he disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, detectives worked the unsolved case by
regularly checking for clues that might lead them to Trujillo, from
driver's license renewals to property records to traffic citations
and arrests.</TE>
<TE>   They called family, friends and witnesses, hoping for a break,
Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, they received a tip that Trujillo was living in
Baldwin Park under the name of Briseno. Police discovered that
Trujillo was working as a truck driver and leading a comfortable
life.</TE>
<TE>   "It came out of the blue," said Det. Brad Roberts. "We got real
lucky with this one."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives watched Trujillo's activities for two days and compared
a recent California driver's license photo of Andres Briseno with a
20-year-old copy of a license issued to Trujillo, Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   Trujillo, who pleaded not guilty to murder during his arraignment
Tuesday in Van Nuys Superior Court, is being held without bail at the
Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Trujillo didn't completely erase the family name when
he assumed his new identity. He used Trujillo as part of his
16-year-old daughter's name in an effort to keep "a connection to his
long-standing family name," Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Trujillo has been working as a truck driver for Safety
West, a safety equipment company based in the City of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they are still trying to find Trujillo's first
wife, who left the area soon after the killing.</TE>
<TE>   His current spouse, Diana Briseno, who is pregnant, did not
display any emotion when her husband was arrested, Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, she and Trujillo met in Mexico in 1986. The
couple married, with Trujillo using a fake birth certificate, and
moved to Baldwin Park, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who answered the door at the family home Tuesday and
identified herself as Diana Briseno's niece said she was surprised by
the arrest but would not discuss it further.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the Baldwin Park neighborhood where Trujillo lived
described him as an honest, hard-working man who helped those in
need.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Trujillo owned three bungalow homes on the same lot.
His family lives in a rear unit and he rents out the others, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very helpful landlord," said Graciela Esparza, 47, a
tenant who has lived in one of the bungalows for about a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever anything was wrong with the house, he was available. I
had no idea."</TE>

<HD>Gay Priests Say It's Harder Now to Tell the Truth</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Some fear the church is making them scapegoats and

<LD>"Be honest with one another," Father Jim told his collegiate
congregation gathered in the chapel just off campus for the early
evening Mass. "Be open with one another. Live your baptismal truths."</LD>
<LD>   For 37 years, Father Jim has taught truth--the truth of God, the
truth of the Gospels, the truth proclaimed for two millenniums by the
Roman Catholic Church. But he could not tell the whole truth about
himself. The truth be known, Father Jim, 63 and graying, is gay.</LD>
<LD>   As the scandal over the sexual abuse of minors surges through the
Catholic church, Father Jim and thousands of other homosexual priests
say it is harder than ever to tell the truth. Catholic bishops and
prominent members of the laity, mulling reforms to stop molestation,
are bluntly suggesting the church has too many gay priests. That
issue is certain to linger in the background next month when the
nation's bishops convene in Dallas in an effort to come to grips with
the scandal.</LD>
<TE>   In a church where homosexuality in the priesthood has largely been
a don't-ask, don't-tell affair, many gay priests are wary, saddened
and angry--convinced they are being made the scapegoats for the
failure of bishops to properly address the sexual abuse problem in
the first place. Some are bracing themselves for what they fear could
be a kind of sexual inquisition, in which sexual orientation plays a
bigger role in whether a candidate is accepted by a seminary. Others
say they may leave the church in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Two statistics--not necessarily related--fuel the mounting debate
on gay priests: the fact that the majority of the church abuse
victims were adolescent boys, and the estimate by seminary deans and
other experts that at least one in five priests is homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several weeks, one American cardinal, Anthony
Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, said that homosexuals are not suited for
the priesthood, even if they have never committed a homosexual act.
Pope John Paul II's press secretary, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, was
quoted as saying that not only should homosexuals not be ordained,
but that the church should consider removing homosexuals who have
already been ordained. The Most Rev. Wilton D. Gregory, bishop of
Belleville, Ill., president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, spoke of "an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic
priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men." And Archbishop Julian
Herranz, head of the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of
Legislative Texts, described pedophilia as a "concrete form of
homosexuality."</TE>
<TE>   The statements followed an extraordinary meeting at the Vatican of
U.S. cardinals and John Paul and ranking Vatican cardinals on how to
address the sexual abuse crisis. They set off a debate that had long
simmered below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives hope that the sexual abuse crisis will mark the
beginning of the restoration of the priesthood to a holiness defined
by strict adherence to the church's moral teaching against homosexual
acts. Liberals see it as a time to openly acknowledge the
contributions of homosexual priests. Or, they fear, it could lead to
more secrecy and denial--and a decision by dedicated gay priests to
leave the church.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many of the nation's 46,000 Catholic priests are
homosexuals. At minimum, 20% of priests are believed to be
homosexually oriented, according to Father Donald Cozzens, author of
"The Changing Face of the Priesthood." Others say the number could be
as high as 50%. Former priest and researcher H.W. Richard Sipe
predicts that by 2010, homosexuals could well constitute a majority
of Catholic priests.</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons for the upswing, experts say, is the fact that
an estimated 25,000 men have left the priesthood since 1965, most in
order to marry. Moreover, it has long been assumed that some gay men
enter the priesthood in part to hide their sexual orientation: They
don't have to explain why they aren't married.</TE>
<TE>   Shortage of Priests</TE>
<TE>   Complicates Issue</TE>
<TE>   The fact that homosexuals represent a significant percentage of
priests at a time when the church is already trying to cope with a
shortage suggests that bishops will talk rather than act overtly on
the issue of sexual orientation when they meet next month.</TE>
<TE>   Many gay priests are convinced that their struggles with
homosexuality could be inspiring stories of redemption--if only they
had the confidence to tell them.</TE>
<TE>   "They're submarining ... and they've got their periscopes up,"
said Father Curtis Bryant, a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist in Los
Angeles. "They have so re-closeted themselves that you will not find
a Roman collar in West Hollywood. Everybody is running for cover."</TE>
<TE>   Gay priests like Father Jim, a university chaplain at a West Coast
university who asked that his last name and campus not be identified,
said his anger mounted at "the implied insult that because a priest
is gay he is acting immorally, unfaithfully and illegally."</TE>
<TE>   He said he will not publicly disclose his homosexuality, at least
for the moment. Much of his future--including his decision on whether
to leave the priesthood--will depend on what the bishops do at their
annual spring meeting. The meeting will attempt to set the first
national guidelines in all 194 American dioceses on dismissing any
priest found to have sexually abused a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "If a homophobic bias against the ordination of homosexual people
becomes canonical and sacramental policy, then thousands of us will
have to make a very big decision," Father Jim said. "It will be a
catastrophic loss to the church."</TE>
<TE>   In the current climate, expert opinions on the causes of the
sexual abuse of minors can easily get lost. The problem, according to
psychologists, is arrested psychosexual development, which they say
transcends sexual orientation. Such sexual and emotional immaturity,
which can afflict an individual regardless of sexual orientation, can
lead to the sexual abuse of minors. Psychologists report that most
sexual abuse of minors involves heterosexual men who are related to
or are friends of their victims.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, when it comes to the church's scandal, the focus has
expanded to homosexual priests as well as the issue of celibacy.</TE>
<TE>   "By being gay," says Father Charles Dahlby, a conservative
Illinois priest, "you are already carrying a burden into the
priesthood. People who are gay don't accept celibacy easily.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is a good, holy priest and living a good holy life, he can
be a saint. It's a cross to bear," said Dahlby, who pastors two rural
parishes in Kinkaid and Pawnee. "But a large number of them aren't
living a pious life. The [sex scandal] is proof of that." He said
actively gay priests are threatening the holiness of the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal James Stafford, the former archbishop of Denver who is
now assigned to the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Council
for the Laity, made a similar point. Outside one Vatican meeting,
Stafford said it was a misnomer to call the U.S. church's crisis a
pedophilia scandal. Pedophilia refers to a sexual desire for
pre-pubescent children. "I think it's more of an acting out
homosexually," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cardinals made no explicit mention of homosexuality
in their final communique after the Vatican meeting, some observers
said the message between the lines was unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, they called for inspections--called apostolic
visitations--of U.S. Catholic seminaries to make certain that they
remain faithful to the church's teachings and moral theology, which
condemns homosexual acts. They also said there is a "need for a
deeper study of the criteria of suitability of candidates to the
priesthood," suggesting that the church needs to make sure that
candidates for the priesthood--regardless of their sexual
orientation--are emotionally mature and healthy, and capable of
living a celibate life. Some liberals worry that the language could
be interpreted by conservative bishops and seminaries to make it more
difficult for homosexuals to enter the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the Los Angeles Archdiocese, which has a reputation for
being relatively liberal under Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, gay priests
generally keep a low profile.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,200 priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese, only eight
regularly attend a support group for homosexual priests, according to
the priest who started it a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The lives of gay priests are often tightly compartmentalized. One
gay priest told The Times that he socializes with another gay priest
who has no idea that they have a mutual friend who is the first
priest's lover.</TE>
<TE>   Few dispute the fact that gay priests have been instrumental in
the church's ministries. Gay priests say they can bring unique
insights and sensitivities to the task, in part because they know
what it is to be marginalized. They say that helps them relate to the
poor, people of color and immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Father Jim, the campus chaplain, says it is enough for him to know
that his own struggles have made him an "authentic" priest who can
minister to their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "They trust me. They respect me. They admire me," he said. "I
don't assume that in any way they have to know my story intimately to
be positively affected by my story."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in an Irish-Catholic family, he had wanted to be a
priest since he was 14. He remembers priests who became his
models--bright, articulate, funny but "appropriately serious."</TE>
<TE>   When he was 12, another boy sexually molested him. He was
physically injured, and emotionally scarred for years.</TE>
<TE>   He jokes now that he thought everybody in his family had to be the
product of immaculate conception because sex was never talked about.
Even in seminary, he had no idea about his sexual orientation. "It
wasn't clear to me then and it wasn't even an issue [in seminary] we
really dealt with a whole lot," he says. "It was more a question of
just practicing celibacy."</TE>
<TE>   A week after ordination, he blacked out from drinking. He drank
"expensive stuff" when he could get it. He was afraid of his sexual
instincts. Eventually, they took him into the arms of other priests
as well as women. His alcoholism, he now says, was an effort to paper
over inner conflict about his sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   He describes himself as moving closer to full celibacy day by day.
On rare occasions, he is still intimate with another priest.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something very healthy about it and something about it
not in keeping with my professed celibacy, so I am living a
contradiction a little bit," he says, pausing to reflect. "It may not
be a little bit in some people's eyes. I feel the tension.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out of this incredibly repressed, depressed experience of
my earlier life, these occasional connections with this other person,
for me, I almost hear, you know, guns going off. It's an achievement
that I can actually connect with somebody and I can actually have a
physical, a sexual feeling, that does not divide me in two, that is
not traumatic."</TE>
<TE>   Priests' Intervention</TE>
<TE>   Led to Self-Discovery</TE>
<TE>   He traces his clarity to a Thanksgiving evening in Seattle 15
years ago. Father Jim had invited other priests to his parish's
rectory for the holiday meal. He had a lot to drink. After dinner,
the other priests inexplicably left early, leaving Father Jim by
himself. He felt alone and worthless--unaware that the priests had
left to put the finishing touches on their strategy: an
"intervention" that would result in sending Father Jim to an alcohol
recovery center.</TE>
<TE>   He left his rectory and began walking the streets aimlessly on a
drizzly night. Eventually, he found himself at St. Mark's Episcopal
Cathedral. He could hear the ethereal harmony of Gregorian chant
inside. Soaked, miserable and hung over, he shuffled through the
doors. Then, Father Jim--said by his church to be an icon of
Christ--made his way to a dark corner and slumped into a fetal
position.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I wanted something. I didn't know what I wanted, didn't
even know if I could ask God for it," he said. Soon, he said, he
stopped drinking, and came to terms with his sexuality in a manner he
compares to Lazarus coming out of his tomb.</TE>
<TE>   "I have grown over the years to recognize my orientation is
primarily homosexual because I pay more attention to my feelings," he
said. "All of this has given me a reality, an authenticity, that
people pick up on," he said. "They know I'm not giving them B.S."</TE>
<TE>   The point of his story, he said, is not the disclosure of his
sexual orientation but the authenticity that came with his struggle.
When it comes to authenticity, he said his parishioners don't
ask--and he doesn't have to tell.</TE>

<HD>Prom-Night High Ends in Death</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: A Foothill High School senior who took Ecstasy
with alcohol is taken off life support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cathy Isford wore a white, strapless dress and her dark, red hair up
in a twist for Foothill High School's senior prom Saturday. To cap
the special evening, she told her sister, she would take Ecstasy "one
more time."</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Isford lay in the intensive-care unit of a Santa Ana
hospital, her dress replaced with a blue medical gown. The mixture of
Ecstasy and alcohol sent her into a coma, the result of what medical
experts and educators describe as a frightening rite of passage
during prom season.</LD>
<LD>   Isford's family, friends and fiance cradled the 18-year-old in
their arms as doctors at Western Medical Center disconnected the
life-support system that had kept her breathing for two days. The
agonizing decision, her mother said, was made after doctors told her
Isford was brain-dead.</LD>
<TE>   "She was doing Ecstasy to make the event special," Pat Isford, 48,
said hours after her youngest child was pronounced dead. "It just
makes you realize that life's too short to waste on so-called whims
of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Isford had experimented with Ecstasy when she was younger,
but her family believed she had stopped about two years ago, after
meeting Rene Rojas, 26.</TE>
<TE>   The couple was engaged to marry next spring. Although they had met
at a rave party in San Bernardino, they stopped going to them because
of the widespread use of drugs, family members said.</TE>
<TE>   Isford planned to attend Cal State Fullerton and earn a teaching
degree. She was saving for college and her wedding by working in the
child-care center at a Linda Evans Fitness Center and as a
receptionist at her sister's car refurbishing business in Lake
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   A popular student, she was known for her paintings and drawings.
As an aide in the principal's office, she made school-wide
public-address announcements. In recent months, she had begun
volunteering as a teacher's aide at a nearby elementary school</TE>
<TE>   The week before the prom, she told several people that she planned
to take Ecstasy once more. Isford told her sister Star that she was
going to "roll one last time." Star and brother Josh both said they
warned her to be careful.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to have the best possible time she could have," Josh
Isford said. "I just said, 'Be careful and have a good time. It's
supposed to be one of the greatest nights of your life.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pictures taken at the prom show Isford and her fiance smiling and
dancing at Joe's Garage, a Tustin auto museum where Foothill High
School held its Knight Out on the Town prom.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the couple headed to an Embassy Suites hotel room in
Santa Ana for a party, Star Isford said, based on accounts from
friends who were in the room. Isford took two pills, mixing them with
wine, beer and rum, her sister said. She began complaining of a
terrible headache about an hour later. About 4 a.m., she collapsed in
her boyfriend's arms, Star Isford said, and her last words were, "My
head hurts really bad."</TE>
<TE>   Complete autopsy results are not expected for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Ecstasy, known as methylene dioxymethamphetamine or MDMA, is a
stimulant and hallucinogen that induces a high lasting up to six
hours. It can cause dramatic changes in heart rate and blood pressure
and lead to dehydration. It also has been shown to cause lasting
changes in the brain's chemical systems that control mood and memory.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Isford's relatives and friends grieved, they hoped that
her death would warn other teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that this is happening in America more than
parents would ever want to admit," said Tommy Tracy, 20, one of the
many friends who gathered at the family's home in Tustin. "You don't
realize it until it slaps you in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Drugs like Ecstasy have become more widely used partly because
teens can get high while appearing lucid. A federal study found that
from 1996 to 2000, emergency-room visits for Ecstasy rose nationwide
from 319 to 4,511.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids are going to get loaded that don't usually," said
Mike Darnold, director of community outreach for Positive Action
Center, a drug treatment center at Chapman Medical Center in Orange.
Schools across Southern California hold seminars for parents and
students about the dangerous consequences of drug and alcohol use at
prom.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill High Principal Al Marzilli said such presentations were
held before Saturday night. At the prom itself, 30 to 40 adult
chaperones helped to check purses and coats and search limousines for
drugs and alcohol. Marzilli shook hands with students as they arrived
and left, looking for any signs of intoxication. He remembers
greeting Isford and being introduced to her finance but said he saw
nothing unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really upsetting," he said. "You take all the precautions in
the world and do everything you can. And then something like this
happens. There just are no words."</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Got D.A.'s Charity Funds</HD>
<DH>Aid: Tony Rackauckas' foundation spent 71% of its income
dealing with state investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas and members of his
nonprofit charity for troubled youth spent most of its money on legal
fees while the charity was under investigation by the state attorney
general's office, county records show.</LD>
<LD>   The charity, named the Tony Rackauckas Foundation when it was
formed in 2000, said its mission was to raise money for counseling
and guidance programs for at-risk children ages 5 to 16. It was
disbanded last December as part of an agreement between Rackauckas
and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose office concluded that the charity
failed to properly "govern its operations" and "exercise proper care
in managing [its] assets."</LD>
<LD>   The attorney general's office investigated after some district
attorney's employees complained that investigators for the Orange
County district attorney's office were asked to conduct background
checks on prospective donors to the charity using county databases.
Criminal databases are to be used only for law enforcement purposes.
At the time, Rackauckas said his use of them was appropriate.</LD>
<TE>   The charity collected $58,000--all from members who sat on its
board of directors. County records show that 71% of the
money--$41,000--went to pay attorneys who represented the members who
were questioned under oath during the attorney general's charitable
trust investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Of the remainder, $4,365 went for plaques for board members,
$1,972 for an awards banquet, $888 for commission dinners and $750
for speaker fees. Another $2,570 was spent to form the organization.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave $6,455. Expense and income statements the
foundation filed with the county for 2000 and 2001 don't indicate
whether any of those leftover funds went to charitable causes or
what, if any, funds remain.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas spokeswoman Tori Richards said the investigation left
the foundation with no choice but to hire attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal challenges to the foundation have been
well-publicized," Richards said in a statement. "All of the
attorneys' fees expended by the foundation were necessary and
appropriate in light of these challenges."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear if the spending is in line with the agreement
Rackauckas reached with the attorney general's office. Lockyer
spokesman Nathan Barankin would say only that state law allows
charities to hire attorneys "to represent their interests."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one county supervisor called Tuesday for a clampdown on
the types of expenses that charities sanctioned by the county can
incur with donated funds.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he asked Rackauckas on Tuesday to
provide the board with an accounting of "every dollar spent" by the
foundation on legal fees. Supervisor Chuck Smith said he also wants
Rackauckas to account for the charity's expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "On its face, it raises questions," said Spitzer, who said he is
reserving judgment until he reviews Rackauckas' response.</TE>
<TE>   "We're graciously allowing [him] to use public resources for
legitimate charitable causes," he said. "The money was intended to go
for charitable causes. How was $41,000 in legal fees intended to help
a charitable cause?"</TE>
<TE>   Richards said Tuesday it was regrettable that Spitzer questioned
the expenditures before reviewing the financial breakdown that he
requested.</TE>
<TE>   Elected officials raising money through private foundations is
troubling, regardless of how the money is spent, said Robert Stern,
president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles and
co-author of the state's Political Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all sorts of problems with potential conflicts of
interest between the elected official and the donor," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had "less of a problem" with spending a group's money
on attorneys fees, as long as the legal issue was related to the
group's activities.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 charities are sanctioned by the county, including 24
charities that raise money for public libraries. The
charities--except for Rackauckas'--filed reports for review by
supervisors on March 5, the day Rackauckas faced reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 40 charities, only Rackauckas' was affiliated both with the
county and with a named elected official. It was renamed the District
Attorney Advisory Commission before it was dissolved. The charity's
affiliation with the county meant it had permission to use county
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Michael S. Carona operates the Mike Carona Foundation, but
it is independent of the county and doesn't file a county charity
statement. In September, supervisors adopted a number of changes to
the county's charity policy, prompted in part by questions about the
district attorney's charity. The amendments include barring charities
from using county logos or the name of the agency or department head.</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Probe Turns to Polygraph</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The FBI will ask at least 200 federal
workers to take the examinations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The decision by the FBI to administer polygraph tests to hundreds of
federal workers at two top military research facilities marks a new
effort by investigators to smoke out individuals who might have
information about last year's deadly anthrax attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Seven months after the first victim died from the bioterrorist
attack launched by mail, officials still have been unable to identify
a suspect through intensive scientific and other law enforcement
techniques.</LD>
<LD>   However, suspicion has focused on two military laboratories, at
least one of which has weapon-grade anthrax stocks available.
Scientists analyzing the genetic sequence of the spores used in the
attacks--which came from a strain known as Ames--said earlier this
month that they were able to rule out some laboratories as the source
of the spores that killed five people and sickened at least 13
others.</LD>
<TE>   Federal investigators characterize the unusual plan to begin
polygraph testing of large numbers of employees at Ft. Detrick in
Maryland and Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah next month as "another
step in the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   "What you've got is a universe of individuals who could have the
knowledge, ability and wherewithal to do this--and how do you
separate them? How we're doing that here is by asking them to submit
to voluntary polygraphs," said a federal law enforcement official who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials said Tuesday that they are continuing to cooperate
with federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect our folks to comply with the laws and share any
information that FBI is asking for," said Army spokeswoman Karen
Baker.</TE>
<TE>   About 600 employees at Dugway and Ft. Detrick are categorized as
research staff, including clerical and technical personnel, according
to military officials. Sources estimated that about 200 employees at
the high-security facilities would submit to polygraphs, but they
cautioned that the number could vary greatly and that the probe could
expand beyond those two facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, amid concerns about espionage breaches, the Energy
Department moved to polygraph an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 federal
employees at nuclear labs, expanding the use of wholesale polygraphs
for the first time outside the CIA and the National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   But after an uproar from nuclear scientists, the Energy Department
decided to conduct polygraphs on only about 800 scientists with
access to nuclear weapon secrets. Scientists had attacked the
reliability of the tests and argued that the dramatic expansion that
was originally planned by federal authorities would have damaged
careers and degraded years of loyal service by weapons scientists.</TE>
<TE>   In the anthrax investigation, microbiologists at laboratories
where the Ames strain is known to have been available have already
been questioned at length. But direct appeals for information from
research scientists, as well as from the general public in the
Trenton, N.J., area where the letters were mailed, have not led to a
prime suspect. A $2.5-million reward for information leading to the
capture of the anthrax killer remains unclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official who asked not to be identified said the mass
polygraph move was not generated by desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "Progress is being made. But without being able to get into
specifics, it's hard to bring that out and explain it to the public"
because of sensitivity about the ongoing investigation, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, John Martin, a former senior official at the Justice
Department who has dealt extensively with polygraphs, said the
decision to go to mass polygraphs "is a clear indication that they
are running out of investigative leads."</TE>
<TE>   "The broad net that is being thrown out, going after 200 suspects,
indicates that they have not narrowed the number down to five or 10,"
which in an ordinary criminal investigation would be a large number
to polygraph, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said the tactic is "very, very unusual. It will take a long
time to get through 200 people, and they're going to have to use a
large number of polygraph examiners." The complexity of the task--and
the fact that examiners will need to know the investigation in great
detail to be effective--will make zeroing in on a suspect even more
difficult, he said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials declined comment on the polygraph issue.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is it's a pending investigation, and we're
using the investigative tools available to us," said Chris Murray,
spokesman for the FBI's Washington field office, which is running the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   While members of the scientific community expressed skepticism
about polygraphs in general, they also acknowledged that the
scientific progress made in the case may provide investigators with
enough information to turn up individuals with "guilty knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants this cloud lifted more urgently that the people who
are involved in this field of research," said Steven Afterwood, an
analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Afterwood described the number of people capable of launching the
attack as small.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an open-ended community at all, and this
investigation has been a burden and an annoyance," he said. "The
problem is that the polygraphs may also be a wild goose chase. It
does have the signs of a kind of brute-force, try-anything approach,
but sometimes that's what you have to do."</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. appeals court held that New York state laws aimed at
preventing fraud in the sale of kosher food are unconstitutional
because they fuse state and religious functions.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding a July 2000
decision by a Brooklyn federal court, also found the statutes violate
a constitutional prohibition against laws that advance or inhibit
religion.</LD>
<TE>   The panel said New York statutes follow Orthodox Judaism rules
while discriminating against other branches of Judaism. "We find the
New York kosher fraud laws challenged here unconstitutional on their
face," the three-member panel said. "Even assuming the challenged
laws were enacted for a valid secular purpose, they violate the
Establishment Clause by fostering excessive state entanglement with
religion."</TE>

<LD>   A man convicted in Seattle's worst mass killing has been sentenced
to 13 consecutive life terms without possibility of parole.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan Fai "Willie" Mak, 41, was sentenced by King County Superior
Court Judge Laura C. Inveen after prosecutors decided to abandon
their efforts to have him once again sentenced to death.</LD>
<TE>   Mak was convicted in 1983 in the deaths of 14 people at the Wah
Mee gambling club. The victims were robbed, hog-tied and shot. A
federal judge overturned Mak's death sentence in 1991, saying he did
not receive adequate legal counsel during the sentencing phase of his
trial.</TE>

<HD>Bush Fled 'Harm's Way' With 9/11 Flights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush spoke publicly for the first time
Tuesday about his fears for himself and his family in the hours after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, telling a German television reporter
he was "trying to get out of harm's way" before returning to the
White House.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with ARD German Television, Bush said that in the
immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, "I was concerned about things like, is my wife safe? You
know, I was worried about that. I was worried about things such as my
parents. I was worried about my [twin] girls."</LD>
<LD>   Among the flying public grounded that day were the president's
parents, who found themselves stranded in Wisconsin. Bush was able to
reach his father, as well as First Lady Laura Bush, who was in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   But as he discussed his personal reactions, Bush also wanted there
to be no doubt about his focus on the task at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, you need to know about me that I was also
thinking clearly about how to respond," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush granted the interview as a prelude to his weeklong trip to
Europe, which begins today. After a stop in Berlin, he travels to
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Paris and Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's initial conduct on Sept. 11 came under scrutiny because he
did not immediately return to Washington. When the first airliner
crashed into the World Trade Center, he was in Sarasota, Fla., to
speak on education reform.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his entourage flew to two highly secure Air Force
bases--one in Louisiana, the other in Nebraska--before arriving in
Washington that evening.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I was trying to get out of harm's way," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned about threats on the president. We were worried
about future attacks, and there's a lot of belief that Flight 93 was
headed to the White House," Bush added, referring to the hijacked
commercial airliner that crashed in western Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>Ill. Gov. Ryan's Friend Indicted</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The suspect is accused of shaking down vendors
through the secretary of state's office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A close friend of Gov. George Ryan was indicted Tuesday on charges of
shaking down state vendors for $2.8 million and sharing the cash with
a powerful lobbyist and an unidentified state official.</LD>
<LD>   "For the better part of a decade, when it came to contracts and
leases with the secretary of state's office, the fix was in," U.S.
Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald told the media.</LD>
<LD>   He said the "fixer" was Lawrence Warner, 62, a longtime friend of
the governor. Warner had the run of the secretary of state's office
under Ryan, virtually deciding who got certain contracts and leases,
and going to the state official when he needed more authority,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Udstuen, 58, former lobbyist for the Illinois State Medical
Society, was also named in the indictment along with businessman Alan
Drazek, 61, a Ryan appointee to the Chicago transit board.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are the latest in the four-year federal investigation
of corruption in the secretary of state's office under Ryan, who was
elected governor in 1998. More than 40 people have been convicted,
many of them former secretary of state employees and campaign workers
under Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor has been charged with no wrongdoing thus
far, but his campaign and former campaign manager are under
indictment on charges of secretly using state funds and employees for
political work.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's office released a statement saying Ryan was
"saddened by today's indictment of his friend Larry Warner."
According to the indictment, Warner shook down state landlords and
vendors. It said he shared the money with the state official, then
passed a portion along to Drazek, who kept part, laundered the rest
and gave it to Udstuen.</TE>

<HD>Jury Sees FBI Training Video of Agent Accused of Corruption</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendant, who is charged with tipping off mob
informants, warns in the film against authorizing criminal activity.</DH>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Testimony ended Tuesday in the corruption trial of a decorated former
FBI agent accused of tipping off gangster informants to witnesses
against them, after jurors watched an FBI training film in which the
agent warns against authorizing criminal conduct.</LD>
<LD>   The trial of retired FBI agent John Connolly spanned three weeks
and offered a who's who of the Boston underworld, many of whom
testified as government witnesses. Among them was a hit man who
admits killing 20 people.</LD>
<LD>   Connolly, 61, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he
tipped off alleged mob bosses James "Whitey" Bulger and Stephen "The
Rifleman" Flemmi to witnesses linking them to murders.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted on all charges, Connolly could face up to 80 years in
prison. Closing arguments are expected to begin Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, a fugitive since 1995, is one of the FBI's most wanted
people and allegedly controlled organized crime in Boston after
helping the FBI topple the Italian Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly received commendations, including one from former FBI
Director William S. Sessions, for his handling of so-called
top-echelon informants such as Bulger and his top lieutenant, Flemmi.
But prosecutors alleged that Connolly gave his informants vital
information to avoid prosecution for criminal activities, including
murder, loan sharking, extortion and bribery.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, for example, prosecutors allege Connolly told Bulger that
a bookmaker was an FBI informant helping the agency locate two
fugitives in New York City. Prosecutors allege Bulger had the
bookmaker murdered so his associates would not be found.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington testified for the defense
and described Connolly's contributions against organized crime as
"very, very significant." Harrington knew Connolly's work from his
days as a U.S. attorney from 1977 to 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to develop high-echelon informants that served as the
basis for wiretaps and bugs that were very, very successful,"
Harrington testified Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But after Connolly retired in 1990 to take a job with a Boston
utility company, his prized recruits, Bulger and Flemmi, were no
longer used as informants, said Edward Quinn, a 30-year FBI veteran
who worked with Connolly.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said he made the decision, in part, because the informants'
information was "historical in nature" and could not be used to make
cases against other criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly's defense attorneys showed a 20-minute FBI training film
made in 1983 in which Connolly discusses his approach to handling
informants. He acknowledged that it is an FBI agent's duty to report
any information that links an informant to criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make sure you're not making promises to these people
to authorize criminal conduct," Connolly said in the film. "You
should be in the driver's seat with these people."</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, Connolly said, he did not want to know about
an informant's criminal activities. "Let some other agent make the
case," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hot Trend: A Home in the Woods</HD>
<DH>Fires: Western residents flock to forest living, often
disregarding the risks. Widespread drought means tragedy is
inevitable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART and TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PRESCOTT, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Cliff Fuhst says he's got wildfires figured out. He doesn't see the
point of clearing a 30-foot fire buffer around his home, which sits
half a mile from a national forest.</LD>
<LD>   His view: Why bother cutting trees and underbrush? Should a fire
rage near, there's nothing that would save his cedar-sided,
shake-roofed mountain cabin. So his two-story home remains surrounded
by towering pines.</LD>
<LD>   Fuhst, a builder of custom homes in this heavily wooded part of
north central Arizona, is living in a dangerous neighborhood and he
knows it. Thousands of his neighbors were evacuated last week during
a wildfire that destroyed five homes here.</LD>
<TE>   Americans such as Fuhst are increasingly flocking to the brink of
the wilderness to make their homes. There are now an estimated 12.2
million people living on the edge of Western forests, in harm's way
for wildfires. Whether from arrogance or ignorance, optimism or
denial, the rate of building at the forest fringe is growing 25%
faster than for construction elsewhere in the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Fire managers in mountain regions of the West agree that vast
tracts of combustible forests are not the place for subdivisions,
especially now that a prolonged drought has heightened fire danger
throughout the region. But there are few restrictions that discourage
or prevent homes from going up in the midst of trees--such as zoning
regulations, building codes or prohibitive insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   In a market-driven industry, developers are going to build where
the demand is highest. Contractors are going to build the home
customers ask for.</TE>
<TE>   Most people moving to the mountains, they say, have their hearts
set on a home built of wood. Builders fear they could lose business
if they push too hard to sell homebuyers higher-priced fire-resistant
building materials, such as clay roofing tiles and composite siding.</TE>
<TE>   "If the builder insists on it, he may end up losing the job
because the client can just go to another builder who won't insist on
it," said local builder Tom Haley.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, Americans live in regions at risk for
hurricanes, earthquakes or floods. But it is homeowners in areas
prone to wildfires who seem to ignore their peril.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like 100% of our customers don't mind taking the risk of
living in the middle of trees," said Dick Miller, a marketer for Sun
Pine Homes in Prescott, which is on the western edge of the world's
largest stand of ponderosa pines. "We've never had anyone say, 'I
want to live in the pines; build me a fireproof house.'"</TE>
<TE>   According to Bill Travis, a geography professor who studies land
use at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Americans have never
shied from settling in dangerous areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm impressed by the discounting of risk that pervades the
system. Individuals in society look for guides. People say, 'It can't
be dangerous here or there wouldn't be a house for me to buy,'"
Travis said. "They expect that some government entity would have
prevented the building."</TE>
<TE>   The conservation group Greater Yellowstone Coalition began
examining the issue of homes built in wooded areas after last
summer's devastating fires in Jackson, Wyo., that cost taxpayers $14
million to fight. The group found that there were almost no
restrictions on home building in forested areas, nor any prohibition
against shake roofs, which were the culprit in spreading that fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to make a case that people shouldn't move to those
areas," said Mark Haggerty, who studied the fire for the group. "If
you can identify private lands that are at high risk for catastrophic
fires, we would recommend that there not be any homes at all."</TE>
<TE>   The group advocates more local and county restrictions--either
limiting growth or requiring stricter building codes and use of
fireproof materials. Yet even as the Prescott fire was causing the
evacuation of 2,400 people from four subdivisions, city and county
officials had still not agreed on the adoption of fire safety
guidelines in what firefighters call the urban-wildland interface.</TE>
<TE>   Across the West, cities and counties are attempting to address the
problems. The issue is especially acute in Colorado, where 44 of 64
counties are heavily forested. Often the results of regulation are
mixed.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Boulder banned shake roofs in 1994 and was sued for
trade violations by the Canadian wood industry, which manufactures
cedar shingles. Pitkin County, home to Aspen and other mountain
skiing areas, likewise banned shake roofs and was also sued, this
time by the Washington State timber industry. Both lawsuits failed in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to try these tough regulations, but it's not an easy sell
when you go up against money," said Justin Dombrowski, the wildfire
management officer for the Boulder Fire Department. "We need to
educate planners and developers. We have many, many safety measures
for buildings in the city, but not up in the hills."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes fire rules conflict with other regulations. Boulder
County mandates that mountain homes maintain a cleared space to keep
fire at bay, which usually requires cutting trees. But the county
also has a rule that says trees must screen homes from each other.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get in a battle between aesthetics and fire safety, who
do you think wins?" asked Dombrowski.</TE>
<TE>   Even when fire restrictions are in place, Dombrowski said, they
only apply to new construction.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, nearly 2,000 fires have burned more than 200,000
acres in the West. David Theobald, a research scientist at Colorado
State University, maps housing density at the forest fringe for the
Colorado Forest Service. He says his research focuses on the forest
edge, so his estimated 12.2 million does not come close to including
all Westerners at risk of wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "It excludes all of Southern California and most of Arizona, for
example, where there is low shrub and chaparral," said Theobald.
"Those areas burn all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry neither penalizes these homeowners with
high premiums nor offers discounts for fireproofing. The reason, they
say, is statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers, in Colorado, for example, say that by far the biggest
loss is from hail, so they offer a discount for a hail-resistant roof
but not a fire-retardant one.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say this, but there aren't enough wildfires to generate
statistical data to justify rate changes," said Charlie Howard, the
Western fire underwriting superintendent for State Farm Insurance.
"We have good data about how car alarms reduce theft and how air bags
reduce injury, but wildfires are so unpredictable. Even though
intuitively we know fire-retardant roofs save homes, we can't prove
it statistically."</TE>
<TE>   But even economic disincentives are unlikely to stop the growth of
homes in the mountains, where people come for the tranquillity and
the beauty. And for the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't thought too much about fire, and I know it's an issue,"
said Beverly Brown, who moved into a wood-sided home in the Prescott
mountains last year. "But life is too short to worry about it. A
disaster could happen to anybody at any time. Whatever life brings is
what we get."</TE>

<HD>Bush Brothers Keenly Attentive to Cuban Americans</HD>
<DH>Politics: With reelection on their minds, they know the
2000 Florida tally shows that even a small percentage of voters can
be crucial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>If President Bush's hard-line, anti-Castro speech this week was a
naked play for the votes of Cuban Americans, a key Florida
constituency, he succeeded splendidly--at least among the customers
at Juan Sosa Jr.'s cigar store Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "People are talking about Monday's speech, and they're all with
Bush," said Sosa, owner of Aroma Cigars in the heart of Miami's Cuban
American exile community. "He's against lifting the embargo ... and
that's a good thing for the Cuban people. This should boost the
popularity of the president and of his brother," Republican Gov. Jeb
Bush, who is seeking reelection in November.</LD>
<LD>   In the autumn of 2000, all of America watched as the presidential
race was decided by a razor-thin margin in the Sunshine State, a
victory still disputed by many Democrats. According to some political
observers, that explains the assiduous attention paid this week by
the Bush brothers to Cuban Americans, who make up an estimated 8% of
Florida's electorate.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, President Bush staunchly rejected mounting pressure
from Congress to ease up on Fidel Castro's one-party regime, and he
flew to Miami to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with his brother during
ceremonies honoring Cuban Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this had nothing to do with foreign policy and everything
to do with domestic policy," said Terry McCoy, a professor of Latin
American studies and political science at the University of Florida
in Gainesville. "It was telling the Cuban Americans that they are
important and that this president is with them."</TE>
<TE>   It was also an opportunity for Jeb Bush, who wants to become the
first Republican governor in Florida to win a second term, to mix
with the Cuban American community. He hopscotched the airwaves Monday
from one Spanish-language radio and TV station to another, and
addressed the Independence Day ceremony in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "He's practically Cuban, just taller," state Rep. Marco Rubio, a
Miami Republican, told the Miami Herald.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential exit polls indicated that 80% of Cuban Americans
voted for George W. Bush over the Democratic candidate, then-Vice
President Al Gore, in November 2000. But with the final tally of the
Republican victory a scant 537 votes, the lesson was clear: Florida,
and any segment of its voters, shouldn't be taken for granted.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush brothers' stand on Cuba policy likely won't have any
measurable influence on Floridians of other ethnic backgrounds, McCoy
said. But the last presidential election showed how in this state, "a
relatively small percentage of votes, Cuban American or others, could
make a difference in the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "That gives the Cuban American vote even more leverage," McCoy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1960s, Cuban exiles and their offspring have been a
dependable vote bank for Republicans, but demographic changes in
Florida make hanging onto their allegiance even more crucial.
Advisors to President Bush, mapping strategy for the 2004 campaign,
are worried that the growing population of non-Cuban Latinos in
Florida--including Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans--might tilt
the electoral balance against them.</TE>
<TE>   Those other Latinos, whose numbers are growing much faster than
the Cubans', historically have tended to vote Democratic. In 1990,
Cubans constituted 43% of all Latinos in Florida, but their share has
shrunk to 31%. That makes retaining the loyalty of Cuban American
voters even more of a priority for the GOP, presidential advisors
say.</TE>
<TE>   Since Bush has been in the White House, he has visited Florida
nine times. He also appointed the first Cuban American Cabinet
member, Housing Secretary Mel Martinez. One newspaper columnist
disapprovingly judged the president's actions this week to be only
the latest attempt at currying political favor here.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a replay of countless speeches and proposals by American
politicians eager for Cuban votes," Max J. Castro wrote in the Miami
Herald. "It was a speech full of platitudes, kudos for Cuban
Americans and tough talk against Castro, but lacking any real
substance except more of the same failed, hard-line policy."</TE>
<TE>   Republican officials vigorously disagreed Tuesday. "What President
Bush did was clear up absolutely any confusion as to where his
administration is in regards to the Cuban embargo and Cuban
relations," said Towson Fraser, press secretary for the Florida
Republican Party in Tallahassee.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush's probable Democratic opponent in the fall is former
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who, while a Miamian, is loathed by many Cuban
Americans because of her role in sending a young Cuban shipwreck
survivor back to the island. The Miami relatives of the boy, Elian
Gonzalez, had choice seats at the Independence Day rally addressed by
the Bushes.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't think Jeb Bush would be concerned about the Cuban
American vote," McCoy said. "But he's not leaving anything to
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Although the growing ranks of other groups may threaten Cuban
Americans' clout at the ballot box, they remain Florida's wealthiest
and most influential Latino community by far. As a token of that
status, Armando Codina, Jeb Bush's former Miami real estate partner,
threw a private, $25,000-a-couple fund-raising dinner Monday for the
Republican Party of Florida that raked in a reported $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, [President Bush's visit] brought an opportunity to
raise money for his brother's campaign, and that's the impact you'll
see politically," said Ryan Banfill, communications director for the
Florida Democratic Party. "But when it comes to basic policy
statements, I don't think he broke new ground.... The speech he gave
was what we saw before: Cuba si, Castro no."</TE>

<HD>Student Guilty in Gallaudet Killings</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendant says black-gloved hands made him do
evil. One victim was beaten, one stabbed at the school for
hearing-impaired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A 22-year-old student who said images of black-gloved hands ordered
him to do evil things was convicted Tuesday of murdering two
classmates at Gallaudet University.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Mesa Jr., a hearing-impaired native of Guam, was found
guilty after a District of Columbia Superior Court jury deliberated
three hours.</LD>
<LD>   A sign language interpreter translated for him as the jury foreman
read guilty verdicts on each of the 15 counts.</LD>
<TE>   Mesa and the two victims had been classmates at Gallaudet, the
nation's premiere college for the hearing-impaired. Eric Plunkett,
19, of Burnsville, Minn., was killed in his dormitory room in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Benjamin Varner, 19, of San Antonio, was found in his
dorm room in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Mesa beat Plunkett to death and used a paring
knife to repeatedly stab Varner. He then robbed both men, using their
credit cards to go on a spending spree.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa, pleading insanity, testified about a pair of "black hands"
that told him to do evil things. He also said he was distanced from
his family while growing up because they did not know sign language.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution showed a videotaped confession from Mesa
describing the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa will be sentenced July 10 and faces the possibility of life
in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Plunkett and Varner were in the courtroom as the
verdicts were read and later shook hands with prosecutors.</TE>

<HD>GOP Sets '04 Convention for End of August</HD>
<DH>Politics: In an unusual twist, the Democrats say they may
start theirs at the same time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican Party on Tuesday set its 2004 national convention for
the end of August, raising the possibility that both major parties
could hold their nominating sessions at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The GOP said it would hold its convention Aug. 30 to Sept. 2.
Democrats said Monday they were considering moving their convention
from mid-July to an Aug. 30 start date.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the GOP announcement
means "it is a distinct possibility" the conventions could be at the
same time. Usually the parties hold them at different times with the
party in the White House going second.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very likely to move, and the 30th is a strong option, but
everything is on the table," Cardona said.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Racicot, the Republican National Committee chairman, said
that announcing the dates this far in advance will give cities that
want to play host to the conventions more planning time.</TE>
<TE>   The scheduling dance is aimed at getting the most mileage out of a
convention boost in the polls and making the best use of federal
campaign money that becomes available to both sides after nominees
are chosen.</TE>
<TE>   When they announced the July dates, the Democrats said five cities
were in the running as possible hosts: Baltimore, Boston, Detroit,
Miami and New York. Democrats meet today to discuss the potential
host cities.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have invited almost two dozen cities to bid.
Republicans get the cities' proposals in mid-June and say they expect
to announce a decision by New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties have an eye on the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens,
which start Aug. 13 and run just over two weeks. With the games'
ability to distract attention from politics, both parties want to
time their gatherings to reduce the effect on the jump in the polls
parties usually enjoy after their conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also worry about the financial effect of a July
convention. It would mean dipping into the party's share of federal
election outlays six weeks before the GOP holds its convention.</TE>

<HD>Robber Frees Hostages After 8-Hour Standoff</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gunman fires at police but then gives up at a Texas

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>A gunman shot his way into a credit union and held two employees
hostage for eight hours Tuesday before surrendering after what police
called a bungled robbery.</LD>
<LD>   The gunman at one point fired at police, but authorities did not
return fire.</LD>
<LD>   The two female hostages and the gunman left the San Antonio
Federal Credit Union branch together at midafternoon. The gunman gave
up without incident and the women were unharmed.</LD>
<TE>   The man was wearing camouflage and a bulletproof vest and had
apparently shot himself in the shoulder with one of his two guns
before surrendering. FBI spokesman Rene Salinas described him as a
"little mentally unstable."</TE>
<TE>   The gunman had blown a lock off the door and then shot out a
window to get inside Tuesday morning, police said. The employees hid
in a utility closet when they heard the shooting, Sgt. Gabe Trevino
said. They somehow were able to notify police.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Rethinks Misconduct Policy</HD>
<DH>Education: A decision to require corroboration before an
inquiry caused an uproar on campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Harvard faculty met Tuesday and unanimously approved a new
committee to study the university's overall sexual misconduct policy,
said Harvard Assistant Dean David Fithian.</LD>
<LD>   The action was taken to calm an uproar on the campus over a
faculty vote May 7 that had changed university policy.</LD>
<LD>   Under the old policy, the school would automatically look into any
claim of a peer dispute, including a sexual assault.</LD>
<TE>   The May 7 change requires anyone filing a complaint to provide
"sufficient independent corroboration" of misconduct before the
school will investigate.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy--believed by some to be the first such requirement
in the nation--sparked soul-searching among faculty who approved it,
a protest from angry students and women's groups, and fierce debate
over Harvard's responsibility to investigate difficult-to-prove
claims.</TE>
<TE>   The peer-dispute process is an option for students to mete out
internal punishments, whether for theft, sexual misconduct or
assault. Students can always take a claim to the police, regardless
of whether the university's Administrative Board takes up a case, or
students can opt for mediation.</TE>
<TE>   Everett Mendelsohn, a history of science professor, said it was
only after the May 7 vote that he and many colleagues realized what
they had done.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't put it down to any attempt to hoodwink us or fool us,"
he said. "I would put it down as a procedural mistake. You want to
keep things simple, but some things shouldn't be kept simple."</TE>
<TE>   A faculty committee studied the issue for months, concluding that
refusing to investigate cases that were bound to end without
resolution would save time and resources and ultimately benefit
students.</TE>
<TE>   But students accused the university of hustling the change through
without debate at a faculty meeting overshadowed by end-of-the-year
exams and the upcoming summer break.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Anadu, a junior computer science major, said she was
infuriated by the vote, particularly since students who had been
working on revamping the sexual assault policy had not been
consulted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just intellectually dishonest to state you're making a
change to benefit certain individuals who were never consulted or
thoroughly considered," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fithian said the controversy over the May 7 change was a function
of "unfortunate confusion" over the intentions of the committee that
originally recommended the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000-01 school year, the Administrative Board reviewed
seven cases of sexual misconduct. One case resulted in an expulsion
and two resulted in exoneration. Four ended without findings--the
kind of conclusion the board seeks to avoid, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the new policy are being watched closely by both
supporters and opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on
Education, said he knew of no other school that has adopted a rule of
this nature.</TE>
<TE>   "It's creative, innovative, and an attempt to try and insert a
degree of fairness in a process that is, because of the nature of
allegations of sexual assault, unduly complicated," he said. Wendy
Murphy, a Boston attorney who consulted with students who protested
the change last week, called it "the single most threatening idea
that I've heard in all my years."</TE>

<HD>Those Without Insurance Die Prematurely, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Health: Study concludes that the uninsured are treated
differently from those with medical coverage, with deadly
consequences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 18,000 working-age adults died prematurely in 2000 because
they lacked health insurance, according to a report released Tuesday
by the Institute of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   While previous studies have shown that the uninsured get less
medical care and generally are in poorer health than people with
insurance, this is the most comprehensive such report. It is also the
first to calculate how many deaths are hastened by the irregular
medical care, late-stage diagnoses of life-threatening conditions and
nonaggressive treatment common among those without health insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the popular view that patients needing emergency
medical care are treated equally regardless of their insurance
status, the report found that even uninsured auto-accident victims
and heart-attack patients received fewer hospital services and were
more likely to die than patients with insurance.</LD>
<TE>   "We assume that the uninsured manage to get the care they need,
but the evidence refutes that assumption," said Mary Sue Coleman,
president of the Iowa Health System and the University of Iowa and
co-chairwoman of the committee that wrote the report.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, uninsured adults aged 25 to 64 with a heart attack,
cancer, HIV infection or a traumatic injury are 25% more likely to
die prematurely than such patients with health insurance, according
to the report, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Medicine is a private research organization with
a mandate from the congressionally funded National Academy of
Sciences to provide advice on health-care policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this report will bring the health problems of the
uninsured back to center stage and back to the public policy arena,"
said Dr. John Z. Ayanian, associate professor of medicine and
health-care policy at Harvard Medical School and a member of the
report committee.</TE>
<TE>   The growing ranks of uninsured Americans, who now number about 40
million, and double-digit health-care inflation have garnered the
attention of policymakers. The Bush administration and many
congressional Republicans have proposed a federal tax credit to help
low-income families buy health insurance, while some Democrats favor
the expansion of already existing programs, such as Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   But competing political demands and a shrinking budget surplus
make government action unlikely any time soon, officials say. In this
election year, prospects are dim even for more limited health-care
proposals, such as a wildly popular Medicare prescription drug
benefit, according to congressional insiders. Bitter partisan
differences over how to help the unemployed buy health insurance--not
at all, in the end--delayed and almost doomed the recently passed
economic stimulus package.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Tuesday's report adds specific numbers and new authority to
the growing awareness that "there are significant health consequences
to going without health insurance," Ayanian said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, working with
the nonpartisan Urban Institute, has produced similar results and is
about halfway through a project to put dollar figures on the cost of
not being insured--in lost education, wages and taxes and in more
expensive acute care.</TE>
<TE>   "As a society, as a nation, we are paying for the lack of health
insurance," said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Medicine study identified several factors that it
said contribute to a shorter life expectancy for the uninsured:</TE>
<TE>   * Because the uninsured often lack an ongoing relationship with a
health-care provider, they are less likely to receive preventive care
and diagnostic tests.</TE>
<TE>   * As a result, life-threatening conditions, such as cancer, tend
to be diagnosed at a later stage, when prospects for recovery are
lower, and patients with such chronic conditions as diabetes, heart
disease and kidney failure are less likely to receive proper
monitoring and medications.</TE>
<TE>   * When admitted to the hospital, uninsured patients are likely to
receive poorer care, and their death rate compared with insured
patients may be even higher. Uninsured car accident victims in
Wisconsin were 37% more likely to die than those with private
insurance, and uninsured heart-attack patients are less likely to
receive angioplasty or undergo surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurance is most effective for individuals who are not yet
ill, the report concludes. But adults who already have chronic
conditions or are in late middle age and, therefore, are more likely
to need health care would benefit most from getting health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, new insurance coverage could help reduce some of the
racial and ethnic disparities in health-care delivery, Ayanian said.</TE>

<HD>Internet Is Blamed in Death of Altar Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DANBURY, Conn.</DL>
<LD>At her Catholic school, sixth-grader Christina Long received good
grades, led the cheerleading squad and was an altar girl. On the
Internet, she used provocative names in chat rooms and arranged
sexual liaisons, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems impossible to imagine, much less to reconcile," the Rev.
Albert Audette, pastor at St. Peter's Church, said after a memorial
service Tuesday at the church school that was closed to reporters.
"People make decisions we can't fathom."</LD>
<LD>   Police said 13-year-old Christina was strangled by a married
restaurant worker she met on the Internet. Her body was found early
Monday in a remote ravine.</LD>
<TE>   Saul Dos Reis, 25, an undocumented immigrant from Brazil,
confessed Sunday to the killing and led law officers to the body,
U.S. Atty. John Danaher III said.</TE>
<TE>   Classes were canceled Tuesday at St. Peter School so students and
parents could attend the memorial service and meet with grief
counselors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so devastated," former teacher Andrea Cappiello said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very good student and a very good cheerleader. She was
very spirited, just a doll," said Cappiello, who taught Christina's
fifth-grade English and religion classes.</TE>
<TE>   But the girl also had a tougher side, Cappiello said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was streetwise," she said. "It's clear she was very torn in
both directions."</TE>
<TE>   Dos Reis was arraigned Monday in U.S. District Court in
Bridgeport, Conn., on a charge of using an interstate device--the
Internet--to entice a child into sexual activity. He was ordered held
without bond. Police said that the teenager routinely had sex with
partners she met on the Internet and that she had been with Dos Reis
several times, the News-Times of Danbury reported.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found e-mail indicating that the two had agreed to
meet Friday night. Dos Reis told police he accidentally strangled
Christina while they were having sex in his car in a mall parking
lot, the News-Times reported.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Plan to Set Up Internet Domain for Children</HD>
<DH>Computers: The measure establishing a '.kids.us' address
would allow only Web sites appropriate for the 12-and-under crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved
an effort to create a kid-friendly Internet zone free of violence,
pornography and other adult material.</LD>
<LD>   The House approved a bill by a voice vote that would set up an
area within the United States' ".us" Internet domain allowing only
Web sites deemed appropriate for children 12 and younger. In the
Senate, similar legislation is expected from Sens. Byron L. Dorgan
(D-N.D.) and John Ensign (R-Nev.).</LD>
<LD>   Web sites bearing a ".kids.us" address would have to certify that
they do not contain sexually explicit material, hate speech, violence
or other material not suitable for minors.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike previous attempts to screen out online smut, the bill would
regulate content only on a corner of the Internet that falls directly
under U.S. government control. Better-known domains such as ".com"
and ".net," as well as the rest of the .us domain, would not be
subject to restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in Tennessee, Taiwan or Timbuktu, you can publish or
speak any content you want on the Internet," said Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.), who sponsored the bill with Rep. John Shimkus
(R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   The bill represents the latest attempt to keep children away from
the sexually explicit material easily available to anyone with a
computer and an Internet connection.</TE>
<TE>   An early attempt, the 1996 Communications Decency Act, was thrown
out by the Supreme Court as an infringement on free speech.</TE>
<TE>   A second, the 1998 Child Online Protection Act, remains sidelined
by a court injunction.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, lawmakers had hoped the international body that
controls domain-name policy would set up a .kids domain alongside
.com and other domains.</TE>
<TE>   After the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
passed on the idea in November 2000, Markey and Shimkus introduced a
bill to force ICANN to set up a .kids domain.</TE>
<TE>   But they backed off from that plan last fall after witnesses told
them it would be difficult to dictate policy to ICANN, which is not
under direct U.S. government control.</TE>
<TE>   The revised bill would place a .kids subdomain under the control
of NeuStar Inc., the Washington-based firm that won the contract to
manage the .us country-code domain last fall.</TE>
<TE>   NeuStar would be expected to police the subdomain to ensure that
it remained free of inappropriate content, and it would answer to the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Web sites in the domain would be prohibited from linking to other
sites outside the domain and could not set up chat rooms, instant
messaging or other interactive services unless they could certify
that they did not expose children to pedophiles or pose other risks.</TE>
<TE>   If privately held NeuStar were to lose money on the venture, it
could return control to the Commerce Department, which would seek
another operator for the service.</TE>

<HD>Jury Begins Deliberating '63 Church Bombing Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor says ex-Klansman 'mocked justice.'
Defense calls witnesses unreliable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Through seven days of testimony, Bobby Frank Cherry has sat
impassively in a courtroom as witnesses and prosecutors branded him a
vile symbol of the Old South--a racist, a murderer, a terrorist and a
man who had made a religion out of hating blacks.</LD>
<LD>   His granddaughter said she'd heard him boast of "blowing up a
bunch of niggers back in Birmingham." Other relatives said his
participation in an attack on a Baptist church 39 years ago that
killed four girls was common knowledge in the family. A video clip
played in court showed Cherry putting on brass knuckles at a civil
rights protest and punching a black man.</LD>
<LD>   For a week, Cherry, 71 and a former Marine demolition expert, has
seemed almost uninterested. He watched the video with no sign of
emotion and didn't pay much attention to the parade of witnesses
linking him to the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept.
15, 1963.</LD>
<TE>   Cherry, gray-haired, bespectacled and dressed in a dark suit, eyed
the jurors each time they filed back to their box after a recess but
otherwise appeared detached from the proceedings in a trial that has
mesmerized Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the prosecution and the defense gave their closing
arguments, and the jury began deliberating the four murder counts
that could send Cherry to prison for life. With four alternate jurors
excused, the final makeup of the panel was six men and six women.
Three of the men are black, the other nine jurors are white. The
panel deliberated about 2 1/2 hours before recessing for the night.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the trial has been a history lesson of the civil
rights movement, with references to the days when Gov. George C.
Wallace had promised Alabama would see "segregation today,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." The church bombing took
place five days after Birmingham's public schools were integrated.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, who belonged to one of the most violent wings of the Ku
Klux Klan, was questioned by FBI agents as a key suspect after the
bombing but was not indicted until two years ago. He testified before
the grand jury that indicted him but did not speak in his own defense
at the murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys say he is easily confused and did not provide much
help in preparing his defense. Last year, Cherry was diagnosed with
vascular dementia, a disorder that can cause losses of memory and
awareness.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry is the last of four suspects in the deadliest single attack
against the civil rights movement. Thomas Blanton Jr. was convicted
last year and is serving a life term, Robert "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss
was convicted in 1977 and died in prison, and Herman Cash died in
1984 without being charged. Testimony during Cherry's trial linked
all four as close associates.</TE>
<TE>   "For almost 39 years, this defendant has mocked justice,"
Assistant U.S. Atty. Don Cochran said in his summation Tuesday. "He
was the prime suspect from the start. The time for justice is here.
It's long overdue." Then he spoke the names of the victims as their
pictures flashed on a video screen: Addie Mae Collins, Carole
Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11.</TE>
<TE>   While prosecution witnesses filled a week of the court calendar,
Cherry's attorney, Mickey Johnson, wrapped up his rebuttal in a day,
calling only a handful of witnesses to speak of Cherry's redeeming
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Those few included two grandsons who had lived with Cherry and
said that they had never heard him refer to the bombing or his
membership in the Klu Klux Klan, and a friend of Cherry who said the
defendant had joined a multiracial church in 1997 and had once
counseled him against joining the Klan.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said in his closing that the statements incriminating
Cherry were inconsistent and that the witnesses who testified against
him were unreliable. Although not denying Cherry was a racist, he
said the defendant had undergone the same metamorphosis as Birmingham
itself from the 1960s to the 1990s, as evidenced by his church
membership.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal's Mansion May Pay Suit Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Francis George has proposed selling the landmark mansion
that archbishops here have called home for more than a century, with
some of the profits perhaps going to pay legal fees in the scandal
over sexual abuse by priests.</LD>
<LD>   George pitched the idea on the eve of meetings called at parishes
across the city, where Roman Catholics were invited to speak out on
what they feel about how the church has been handling the torrent of
revelations regarding abuse by priests--and the apparent attempts by
church leaders to cover it up.</LD>
<LD>   The three-story red-brick home sits on a sprawling half-block lot
in the Gold Coast, one of Chicago's most expensive neighborhoods.
With elaborate landscaping, detailed woodwork and 19 chimneys, it
could fetch upward of $20 million, real estate agents estimate.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of the church's growing legal fees and settlement costs,
George said: "If the money is needed, that would be a convenient
place to look for it."</TE>
<TE>   Long uncomfortable with the splendor of the mansion, according to
local church officials, George told archdiocese leaders that the main
reason they should consider selling is that they could use the money
for more important things, such as the operation of financially
strapped parishes--and to remind themselves of the priestly ideals of
simplicity and austerity.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you live in a way that appears simpler when living in that
house?" he asked a gathering earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Some Catholics for years have called on the archdiocese to sell
the property. In the 1970s and '80s, groups made concerted efforts to
persuade two of George's predecessors--Cardinal John Cody and
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin--to sell, even as others pleaded with them
to retain the property.</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting agendas are sure to surface again if the
archdiocese moves forward with what is, for the time being, only a
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists note that Pope John II once stayed there, as did
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. And they remind would-be buyers that
the city's Commission on Landmarks in 1975 designated the site one of
historic significance. That means the grounds and building could not
be dramatically altered without a green light from the commission.</TE>
<TE>   So any buyer would face difficulties in acquiring and reworking
the property. But there is an enormous potential payoff as well.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of other Chicago buildings that once were protected as
landmarks have convinced the commission to let them redevelop. Hugh
Hefner's first Playboy mansion, a building that dates to 1889, is now
a condominium complex.</TE>

<HD>White House OKs New Mining in Sensitive Ore. Habitat</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Mineral interests applaud, but conservationists
are outraged over reversal of a policy to protect the Siskiyou
region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Tuesday it will allow new mining to
resume on nearly 1 million acres of southwestern Oregon's Siskiyou
region, one of the most diverse ecological habitats in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to cancel a two-year moratorium on new claims opens
the area to more prospectors, many of whom build shacks on national
forest and Bureau of Land Management land and use giant,
gasoline-powered dredges to suck material from stream beds in search
of gold.</LD>
<LD>   In place of the moratorium, the administration proposed that
mining not be allowed on about 83,000 acres of national forest land
and 34,000 acres of BLM land--about one-tenth the size of the
original area.</LD>
<TE>   The news disturbed local conservationists and World Wildlife Fund
officials, who had urged the Clinton and Bush administrations to
designate a national monument in the area.</TE>
<TE>   It has 15 wild rivers tumbling through forested canyons and more
than 280 plants unknown anywhere else on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Just before leaving office in January 2001, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt announced the moratorium on new mining to limit damage
to the wilderness while the area was being considered for permanent
protection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the latest installment in the Bush administration's program
to cut, drill, dig, stomp and chomp our public lands," said Dave
Willis, a member of the board of the Siskiyou Project, a local
conservation group.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an attack on some of the best wild salmon and steelhead
habitat in the Lower 48 and one of the most botanically diverse
coniferous forests in North America."</TE>
<TE>   But the association that represents many of the several hundred
small-time miners who have staked claims on these federal lands
applauded the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a large number of people trying to make a living out of
mining done in the Siskiyou," said John Holleman, executive director
of Oregon Independent Miners.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly how much gold or other minerals the miners
have been extracting from these federal lands since miners do not
have to pay royalties to the federal government. While some miners
use suction dredgers to search for gold, others drill holes into the
sides of the mountains and use explosives. They then crush up the ore
to extract gold, silver and platinum, Holleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists say both types of mining are wreaking havoc.
"Free-flowing rivers, wild salmon, rare plants and globally
outstanding biological diversity are the true wealth of the Siskiyou
Wild Rivers area, not a few nuggets of gold," said Barbara Ullian,
conservation director of the Siskiyou Project.</TE>
<TE>   The region has a unique and ancient ecosystem, home to scores of
plants found nowhere else, and contains the highest concentration of
intact forests and large watersheds on the Pacific Coast.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Forest Service and BLM officials said their proposal to keep
some land off-limits to mining reflects the government's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We identified areas with special and unique resource values, and
our proposal is to withdraw those areas," said Karen Gillespie,
spokeswoman for the BLM's office in Medford, Ore. The Forest
Service's proposal would prohibit new mining claims in the stream
beds and quarter-mile buffer zones of 12 streams that are candidates
for protection as wild and scenic rivers, according to Mary Marrs, a
spokeswoman for the Siskiyou National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   New claims will also be denied in the areas of Dunn Creek and
Taylor Creek, which provide habitat for the threatened coho salmon,
she added.</TE>
<TE>   However, new mining claims would be allowed on many other rivers
and streams. BLM officials said that the agency's new regulations,
requiring miners to post bonds that will be used if they fail to
repair damage to the land, would protect the region.</TE>
<TE>   Those regulations are less stringent than a Clinton administration
proposal that would have, for the first time, given federal land
managers authority to reject individual claims if they were concerned
about the impact to the environmental, recreational or other uses of
the land. The Bush administration removed that provision from the
rules.</TE>

<HD>Pilots Told No Guns in Cockpit</HD>
<DH>Security: The White House believes sky marshals are better
matched against airline hijackers. Action sets up a conflict with
Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Tuesday denied airline pilots permission
to carry guns in the cockpit, angering pilots who had sought that
authority and setting up a fight with Congress over the issue.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing his decision at a Senate hearing on aviation
security, transportation security chief John W. Magaw said that armed
sky marshals were better suited to defend against would-be hijackers
and that pilots "really need to be in control of that aircraft."</LD>
<LD>   Pilots accused the administration of caving in to pressure from
the airlines, which oppose arming pilots.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional Republican leaders vowed to press ahead with
legislation that would allow pilots to carry weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The battle up on the Hill has really just begun," said Sam Mayer,
speaking for the Allied Pilots Assn., which represents pilots for
American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   A House committee this week is expected to approve a bill
permitting pilots to carry guns. Similar legislation has been
introduced in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is still considering whether to allow pilots to
carry nonlethal weapons, such as stun guns. United Airlines has
already ordered 1,300 Tasers.</TE>
<TE>   Magaw told the Senate Commerce and Transportation Committee that
air marshals would do "whatever they have to, to the point of giving
up their own life, to make sure" the cockpit remains protected.</TE>
<TE>   "The cockpit in the aircraft is for the pilots to maintain
positive control of that aircraft," said Magaw, a former Secret
Service director. "And the positive control to them ... is get it on
the ground as quickly as you can, regardless of what's happening back
there."</TE>
<TE>   New rules provide for reinforced cockpit doors to prevent would-be
hijackers from reaching the airplane's controls, and officials are
exploring the use of cameras so that pilots can monitor the passenger
cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to Magaw's statement, Duane Woerth, a Northwest
Airlines captain and president of the Air Line Pilots Assn., which
represents pilots for 42 airlines, said, "The government already has
told us that if terrorists take control of one of our cockpits, they
will send military aircraft to shoot down the airliner and all its
crew and passengers. In the face of such choices, we do not
understand why these same government officials refuse to give pilots
a last chance to prevent such a tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Mayer, an American Airlines captain, challenged Magaw's thinking,
noting that there are two pilots in the cockpit--one of whom could
remain at the controls while the other used a gun as a last line of
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never have enough air marshals to protect us," said Rep.
John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure aviation subcommittee and a sponsor of the legislation
to let pilots carry guns.</TE>
<TE>   The number of air marshals is a secret. But Transportation
Department Secretary Norman Y. Mineta told the committee, "We
continue working aggressively to put in place a robust federal air
marshal program and will remain exactly on track with the targets"
provided to Congress in a closed meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Dawn Deeks, a spokeswoman for the 50,000-member Assn. of Flight
Attendants, supported the administration's decision, saying that
firearms in the cockpit provide a false sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "A gun locked up behind a reinforced door does nothing to protect
people in the cabin," she said. Her group is seeking to give flight
attendants self-defense training and access to unspecified non-lethal
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta had previously expressed opposition to arming pilots, but
no official announcement was made until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, Mineta warned the senators that air passengers
would face longer lines and flight delays unless Congress approved
the administration's request for $4.4 billion to further increase
airport security.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, some members of Congress have signaled a hesitancy
to allocate the resources necessary to properly secure America's
aviation system," Mineta told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "They say that we cannot afford the security commitment that was
made some six months ago. The truth is, we cannot afford less than
the full $4.4 billion that the president proposed."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee
are proposing $400 million less than the administration wants,
contending that the new Transportation Security Administration has
failed to justify its proposed spending.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration should not expect the committee to recommend
large expenditures of public funds without justification--even for
crucial activities," a committee report said.</TE>
<TE>   The new agency is moving to hire 50,000 passenger and baggage
screeners and install explosive detection systems in commercial
airports by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta also was grilled about what warnings the administration
received--and what actions they took--before terrorists crashed
planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Steps could have been taken to strengthen airport security," Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) contended.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta defended the decision not to tell airlines about the August
arrest in Minnesota of Zacarias Moussaoui, a man the FBI has since
accused of being the intended 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said that a Sept. 5 FBI cable to the Federal Aviation
Administration noted that Moussaoui wanted to learn how to "take off
and land a 747."</TE>
<TE>   He said the cable "did not say that he only wanted to learn how to
take off."</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in the cable indicated that the suspect had ties to any
terrorist group," Mineta added.</TE>
<TE>   He said the FAA decided that the threat was too general and that
it would wait for further information from the FBI before notifying
airlines and airports.</TE>

<HD>Rendell Wins Democratic Nomination for Pa. Governor</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former Philadelphia mayor rolls to an easy win
over his conservative opponent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Running on his record as Philadelphia mayor, pro-business liberal Ed
Rendell soundly defeated conservative Robert Casey Jr. to win the
Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania governor Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In another closely watched primary that cost Pennsylvania one of
its Democratic congressmen, veteran Rep. John Murtha ousted Rep.
Frank Mascara in a district redrawn by Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   With 97% of precincts reporting, Rendell had 662,167 votes, or
56%, and Casey had 526,873 votes, or 44%. Rendell advanced to the
November general election against Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher, who was
unopposed in the GOP primary.</LD>
<TE>   "Last February, when I started out on this campaign, nobody
thought I had a chance to win because I was the Philadelphia
candidate," Rendell, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, told scores of cheering fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The experts said no Philadelphian could ever be elected governor
of this state. But the experts, as they often do, underrated the
people of Pennsylvania," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At his concession speech, Casey said it had been a tough campaign
and predicted Rendell would win this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania was one of three states that held primaries Tuesday.
The others were Arkansas and Oregon, where Democrats nominated a
former attorney general to succeed Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber.
Three Republicans sought their party's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's primary was the most expensive in Pennsylvania
history, with more than $32 million raised by the two Democrats. The
race was thrown open when GOP Gov. Mark Schweiker decided against
seeking a full term after taking over when Tom Ridge became homeland
security director.</TE>
<TE>   The vote concluded a campaign that presented voters with a clear
choice--Rendell and Casey offered stark contrasts in style,
background, ideology and priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rendell, the gregarious former mayor of Philadelphia, ran as an
economic centrist and a social liberal. He supports legalized
abortion and gun control. Casey, the reserved son of former
Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, ran as a social conservative and
economic liberal. Their differences were clear on several other
policy fronts. In his campaign, Rendell emphasized education and
creating jobs. Casey focused heavily on expanding prescription drug
coverage for seniors and providing health care to uninsured workers.</TE>
<TE>   The race proved unusually nasty from the outset. With Rendell
emphasizing his extensive political experience, Casey spent heavily
on ads attacking his opponent's record as mayor of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In the congressional primary, the GOP's redistricting plan placed
Mascara's home in the new 18th District, where he was encouraged by
fellow Democrats to campaign. But Mascara chose to run in the 12th
District against Murtha, a 14-term veteran with a substantial
fund-raising edge.</TE>
<TE>   With 89% of precincts reporting, Murtha had 53,315 votes, or 65%,
and Mascara had 28,771 votes, or 35%.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere:</TE>
<TE>   * In Arkansas, freshman Sen. Tim Hutchinson defeated conservative
state Rep. Jim Bob Duggar in the GOP primary and will face Democratic
Atty. Gen. Mark Pryor this fall. GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee easily
defeated his challenger and will take on Democrat Jimmie Lou Fisher,
who faced a little-known opponent. Huckabee's wife, Janet, was
unopposed in her bid to be nominated secretary of state, setting up
the historic prospect of a governor and spouse both running for
statewide elected office.</TE>
<TE>   * In Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, a former attorney general and state
Supreme Court justice, won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
over Bev Stein and Jim Hill. Kevin Mannix, Ron Saxton and Jack
Roberts battled for the GOP nomination.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Jurors Listen to Author Interview</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors rested their case against Michael Skakel on Tuesday,
playing a tape recording of the Kennedy relative's account of the
night he is accused of murdering 15-year-old Martha Moxley 26 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel's words echoed through the courtroom as a recording was
played of an interview he gave to final prosecution witness Richard
Hoffman.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel hired Hoffman in 1997 to collaborate on his memoirs, and on
the tape, the defendant talked about the October night when Moxley, a
neighbor, was killed.</LD>
<TE>   "In the Skakel household, Halloween was the best holiday of the
year," he said, describing the excitement he felt about "mayhem" he
would cause on "mischief night," the night before Halloween, with
fireworks and his slingshot loaded with apples and eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "Mischief night to me was what New Year's was to an alcoholic,"
Skakel said.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Skakel, now 41, said he had a crush on Moxley.</TE>
<TE>   He said earlier that evening he was drinking and smoking pot and
that he and Moxley had been in his father's car.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel said he drove a cousin home and when he came back, he could
not sleep so he went outside and tried to throw pebbles at Martha's
window.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Moxley comes by looking for Martha the next morning. I
thought, 'Oh my God, if I tell anybody I was out last night, they're
going to think I did it,'" he said in the recording.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Mickey Sherman is expected to focus on trying to
establish Moxley's time of death, which authorities at the time
placed in a wide, eight-hour window. He begins his closing arguments
today.</TE>
<TE>   The timeline of the murder is important because Skakel contends he
was in a car taking his cousin Jimmy Terrien home when Sherman claims
neighborhood dogs began barking and howling in agitation about 10
p.m. near where Moxley's body was found.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley's body was found on the lawn of her parents' 26-room home
in the affluent Connecticut town of Greenwich early Oct. 31, 1975.</TE>
<TE>   She had been bludgeoned to death with a broken golf club from a
set belonging to Skakel's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel could face life in prison if convicted. Skakel, a nephew of
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was
arrested in January 2000 after a grand jury investigated the murder.</TE>

<HD>House Votes to Accelerate Married Couples' Deduction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Tuesday overwhelmingly voted to begin raising the
standard tax deduction for married couples sooner than scheduled
under a tax-cut bill signed into law by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, approved by a vote of 409-1, would raise the standard
deduction for married couples from the current 167% of the amount
allowed single taxpayers, currently $4,700, to 170% over the next two
years.</LD>
<LD>   Under the $1.35-trillion 10-year tax cut signed into law last year
by Bush, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly
gradually rises starting in 2005 until it reaches the level of 200%
of the amount allowed single taxpayers in 2009.</LD>
<TE>   The House measure would give married couples who qualify an extra
tax break of $10 to $23 a year for two years, according to Democratic
aides. Republicans, who control the House, argued the bill would help
accelerate tax relief for married couples.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed Tuesday also consolidates two tax breaks for
employers who hire welfare recipients and other low-income workers.
The bill goes to the Democrat-led Senate, where it faces an uncertain
fate.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Landmarks Targeted in Terrorism Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Authorities in New York heightened security Tuesday around the Statue
of Liberty and other landmarks as top Bush administration officials
huddled in Washington to decide how to calm a nation made
increasingly anxious by alarms about more terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Their decision: Do nothing differently.</LD>
<LD>   After several consultations throughout the day, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, FBI Director Robert
S. Mueller III and other top aides to President Bush determined that
a new intelligence warning about a looming attack in New York was
uncorroborated and too general to warrant a full mobilization of the
nation's counter-terrorism apparatus.</LD>
<TE>   The "intel" was also too vague to justify elevating the nation's
new and very public barometer of terrorist threats, the Office of
Homeland Security's "security advisory system," administration
officials said. Other warnings over the last three weeks were also
considered too vague for a full mobilization.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the threat warning is at stage "yellow," the third
highest of five levels meant to indicate increasing danger of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow means a "significant risk of terrorist attacks," according
to the system initiated in March to help quantify the potential for
attack nationwide. The next highest level, orange, signifies a "high
risk" and would prompt additional precautionary measures at public
events. Red, the highest level of alert, would prompt the deployment
of specially trained counter-terrorism teams and the closing of
public and government facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the Bush administration determines which color is
appropriate, Susan Neely, chief spokeswoman for the Office of
Homeland Security, said the system is a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed not to deal with hypotheticals" when trying to
explain how officials arrive at a color, Neely said. "There is a
certain art to this."</TE>
<TE>   "Although the intelligence is active now, it is unsubstantiated
and uncorroborated, and it is unspecific as to time, date or method,"
Neely said of the warnings in recent weeks. "There would have to be
more specific information [about a terrorist attack] before we would
raise it to orange."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision to remain at the "yellow" level came as
counter-terrorism officials continued to sound warnings about the
possibility of more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the New York Police Department issued warnings about
the possibility of attacks in New York City, where residents are
still on edge from the Sept. 11 suicide hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States government has received unsubstantiated and
uncorroborated information that terrorists are considering attacks
against landmarks in New York City," the FBI said in a terse
statement. "While the FBI has no information as to time, date or
method of attack, out of an abundance of caution, information has
been transmitted to law enforcement in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat level for the city, state and nation remains
unchanged." The new alert follows a flurry of warnings in recent
weeks that Al Qaeda terrorists may attack banks and shopping malls,
especially in the Northeast, and that they have the capacity to
detonate radioactive "dirty bombs."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said terrorists
are certain to "get their hands on" biological, nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction. "They would not hesitate one minute in
using them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Mueller raised the fear level by saying he believed
it "inevitable" that terrorists would adopt the same tactics as those
in Israel, such as walking into crowded cafes and blowing up
themselves and those around them.</TE>
<TE>   New York police increased their presence at City Hall and the
Brooklyn Bridge, and warned of additional checkpoints throughout the
city during the Memorial Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard cutters will continue patrolling the waters around
Ellis Island and Liberty Island, where the Statue of Liberty stands,
officials said. Both islands were closed to visitors for 100 days
after Sept. 11, and the statue remains off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   New York Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that
city officials had received FBI warnings that terrorists had made
"general threats" against New York landmarks, but he said the city
was "prepared for any eventuality."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a news conference alongside New York Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg, Kelly said that the police force had stepped up security
ahead of Fleet Week 2002, a maritime celebration expected to draw
international battleships and nearly 6,000 naval personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The NYPD Harbor Unit deployed frogmen to check for submersed bombs
around the United Nations on the East River and along the Hudson
River where the ships will be moored.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said New York police were "doing the best that we reasonably
can do to prevent another incident and to respond if, God forbid,
there is one."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, authorities spent the day grappling with how to
react to the new intelligence information.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official who asked not to be identified said the New York
warning was prompted by intelligence provided by Al Qaeda detainees
in recent days that indicated an attack might be planned against the
Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks. As was
the case with other recent threats, sources said, the New York
intelligence was generated from interrogation of either detainees in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or from captured Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubeida,
or both.</TE>
<TE>   The new intelligence was "completely uncorroborated," the official
said. "But like all of the [intelligence] before this, we feel like
we should take everything very seriously, even if it's
uncorroborated."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official who also asked not to be identified
agreed with Neely that the department sees no need to raise the
threat level beyond the current yellow status.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the decision rests not with Ridge but with Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   "We are comfortable with the decision [to remain at yellow], as
comfortable as you can be at a time like this," the official said.
"You're never comfortable, you're never totally sure, you can't be,
but you do the best you can with the information you have."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the New York threat, FBI headquarters in Washington
decided not to put out a public alert--as it has in some cases, such
as the warnings about threats to banks--but instead passed on the
information to the FBI's counter-terrorism task force in New York.
The task force in turn relayed the information to the NYPD, which
alerted the public.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, lawmakers questioned Mueller and
Phoenix FBI agent Kenneth Williams, who wrote a memo last July
warning that Al Qaeda could be training at U.S. flight schools with
the intention of gaining access to planes and aviation facilities.</TE>
<TE>   At a closed-door meeting, members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee pressed Mueller on why Congress had not been told sooner
about the memo, and how the document had been handled in the chain of
command.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the American people have grave doubts about what's
going on with our intelligence agencies," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.)
told reporters afterward. He called for a prompt public hearing on
the intelligence failures of the FBI and the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) urged more congressional
oversight of the FBI and joined Specter in praising Williams. "We're
lucky to have someone like that in the FBI," Grassley said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Maggie Farley in New York and Nick Anderson in
Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Sue Over 2000 Fla. Vote</HD>
<DH>Election: The Justice Department targets three counties for
alleged voting rights violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department, in a surprise disclosure that trains the
spotlight once again on President Bush's victory in the 2000
election, said Tuesday that it will sue three Florida counties for
alleged voting rights violations stemming from the hotly contested
race.</LD>
<LD>   The department, which largely stayed out of the controversy
surrounding the November 2000 race, has quietly begun settlement
negotiations with the three counties, Assistant Atty. Gen. Ralph Boyd
told a Senate committee. He refused to name the counties that will be
sued, but Miami-Dade is believed to be one of them.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement talks could produce agreements in a matter of weeks
that would require the implementation of voting reforms to ensure
that federal laws are followed in elections, Justice Department
officials said. Traditionally, such consent decrees have often
included the imposition of federal monitors at local polling places.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuits will focus on allegations that minority voters were
intimidated at the polls, that people with limited English
proficiency were not given bilingual assistance, that "motor voter"
registration rolls were improperly purged and that disabled voters
were not provided proper access to polling places, among other
issues, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has also decided to bring similar lawsuits
against undisclosed cities in Missouri and Tennessee where voting
rights allegations surfaced, said Boyd, who heads the department's
civil rights division and personally authorized the upcoming
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But the Florida litigation will clearly have the most effect
nationwide. The uproar there over butterfly ballots, hanging chads
and other voting irregularities suspended the outcome of the election
between Bush and Al Gore. The White House hung in the balance for 36
days before a fractured Supreme Court decided to block further
recounts and Bush was declared the winner of both Florida and the
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's decision came as a jolt to state
officials in Florida, who said they had no inkling that federal
litigation was under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the president, told reporters he
did not know anything about the lawsuits and was unaware of any cases
in which voters were denied access to ballots. "I know there were
some accusations made and a lot of investigation," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The county attorney in Miami-Dade said it is one of the counties
in talks with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   County officials have discussed how they could help Haitian
Americans cast their ballots, attorney Robert Ginsburg told
Associated Press. "We've been talking to the Justice Department along
those lines and working with them to see what would make sense"</TE>
<TE>   Many people in Florida do not appear too eager to revisit the
controversy. "I thought the issues with the November 2000 election
were pretty well settled," said Kurt Browning, election supervisor in
Pasco County near Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   But civil rights groups, including the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People, have pushed to keep the alleged abuses
in the public eye, bringing lawsuits on behalf of disenfranchised
voters in seven counties: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Leon,
Miami-Dade, Orange and Volusia. The plaintiffs allege that unfair
voting practices in mainly black and Latino areas kept many of the
state's 2 million minority voters from casting ballots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pleasant surprise to us that the Justice Department is
finally moving to do something about these gross violations of the
Voting Rights Act," NAACP spokesman Hilary O. Shelton said in an
interview. "They can't do anything to undo the mistakes that were
made, but the least they can do is prevent them from ever happening
again."</TE>
<TE>   Shelton said the Justice Department's lawsuits, coming on the
heels of voting reforms enacted by Florida lawmakers to eliminate
punch-cards and hand-counted paper ballots--can go a long way toward
ensuring that minority voters are not intimidated at the polls,
election workers are properly trained and ballot instructions are
available in different languages.</TE>
<TE>   Both Republican and Democratic officials in Washington praised the
Justice Department's decision to bring the lawsuits, although former
Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile called it "a bittersweet
victory."</TE>
<TE>   Some civil rights leaders questioned why the Justice Department
waited 17 months to act. But aides to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said
the department had moved aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning under then-Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, federal voting rights
attorneys worked through about 11,000 complaints and zeroed in on 12
primary complaints, and Ashcroft's administration inherited the case
when he took office in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been saying all along that we had several open
investigations but wanted to proceed deliberately to investigate
this," according to a senior official in the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said some of the counties with which the department has been
negotiating have already acknowledged "certain deficiencies" in their
voting operations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Justice Department plans to bring suit even in
the event of a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope, my aspiration and my expectation is that in each of
those we'll reach an enforceable agreement prior to the filing of the
lawsuit," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   His disclosure about the Justice Department's plans came at a
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in response to a question from
Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), often mentioned as a prospective
candidate for the White House in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards wrote the Justice Department a letter several months ago
asking for an update on its investigation into the 2000 voting
irregularities, but he received only a "very general, non-specific
answer," said spokesman Michael Briggs.</TE>
<TE>   So Edwards decided to bring it up directly with Boyd at Tuesday's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need," Edwards told Boyd, "is to make sure that we take
steps quickly enough to ensure that the problems that occurred in the
last election don't occur in the next election."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards is still uncertain whether the Justice Department's
litigation will achieve that result, Briggs said. "He wants to see
more details before saying that this is a good result."</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, some political analysts said the rekindled
publicity over the 2000 election could hurt Jeb Bush's reelection bid
in November.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspicion in the African American community is that Jeb Bush
helped steal the election for his brother, and these kinds of
lawsuits will help mobilize that electorate in anger against Jeb in
November," said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at
Florida International University in Miami who studied the 2000 vote.</TE>
<TE>   In the two lawsuits planned in Missouri and Tennessee, Justice
Department officials refused to name the targeted cities.</TE>
<TE>   But in Missouri, where Ashcroft was voted out of office as senator
in the 2000 contest, controversy erupted after that election because
of accusations that nearly 1,400 ballots were illegally cast in St.
Louis and that Democrats had improperly kept polling places open an
extra three hours.</TE>
<TE>   And in Tennessee, at least 2,000 voters who thought they were
registered to vote under the state's motor-voter program discovered
that they were not.</TE>
<TE>   The state vowed to revamp the registration program in response to
an outpouring of complaints from residents.</TE>

<HD>This Old Park Is Almost Ready</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Renovation work continues on San Juan
Capistrano's 62-year-old Stone Field.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They have waited 15 years for their park to be put back together
again. Two more months won't matter.</LD>
<LD>   Stone Field, near San Juan Capistrano's historic mission, was
supposed to have been restored by June, but work will continue until
early August, disrupting the summer soccer season and a scheduled
July tournament with a team from Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   But for many who live near the field, the wait is worth it.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for it for so long," said Eleazar Gonzalez,
vice president of the San Juan Youth Soccer League. "Two months will
be like nothing. We're really excited and we can't wait to start
playing."</TE>
<TE>   The park is undergoing an $840,000 renovation. Much of the cost is
being underwritten by a grant from Mission Hospital Regional Medical
Center's charitable arm. The city and state also are providing funds.</TE>
<TE>   The 62-year-old field, once used for baseball games and occasional
Friday night bonfires by students at the old Capistrano Union High
School, has been neglected for 15 years. The rutted dirt field has
been home to the local youth soccer league for five years. Spectators
have made do with the crumbling stone bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   The league's 500 players, who range in age from 4 to 14, are not
members of the American Youth Soccer Organization. The AYSO's league
fees are double what the unaffiliated San Juan league charges each
child.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly completed renovation includes an
irrigation-and-drainage system, new turf, rebuilt stone bleachers,
new restrooms and office space, an electronic scoreboard and a picnic
area.</TE>
<TE>   The project was originally scheduled to be built in two parts,
with the first phase to be ready June 9.</TE>
<TE>   But once the city received additional funding for a second phase,
the grand reopening was pushed back to Aug. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In March, there was a two-week delay so workers could preserve a
200-year-old aqueduct that had once served the mission</TE>
<TE>   While the field is being refurbished, the league's players are
practicing at Acu Canyon Park and playing games at Cook Park Cordova,
a few miles from Stone Field.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said the international tournament, scheduled July 13-14,
will have to be postponed or canceled.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a need for additional study, the city's Airport Commission on
Tuesday postponed a decision on approving a city ordinance that would
restrict solicitors at Los Angeles International Airport to booths in
the facility's nine terminals.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners asked the city attorney's office to hire a private
litigator to review the ordinance, said Frank Mateljan, a spokesman
for City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo. The office, which spent nine months
drafting the proposal, has already signed off on it, Mateljan said.</LD>
<LD>   It's unclear how long the review will take. Airport officials had
hoped to have the ordinance, which must also be approved by the City
Council, in place by August--the airport's busiest travel month.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed law, patterned after a similar policy at Bay Area
airports, would require solicitors to apply for monthly permits that
would dictate booth locations, times and days that they can ask for
donations at the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   It's the latest attempt in a 28-year struggle by the airport
agency to control panhandlers, who officials say contribute to
congestion and present a safety hazard. Various regulations and laws
enacted by the city since 1974 have all been struck down in court.</TE>

<HD>County Cleared of Open Meeting Violation Claim</HD>
<DH>Government: District attorney says the Board of
Supervisors' closed session on a union's proposed ballot initiative
did not break the Brown Act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced its
conclusion Tuesday that county supervisors did not violate
California's open meeting law when they met in closed session late
last year and directed their attorney to scuttle a union's proposed
ballot initiative.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the Board of Supervisors dated Monday, Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley said that his office would not file a criminal or civil
complaint over the matter. "This wasn't even a close call," Cooley
said in an interview Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   He appeared before the supervisors to ask them to refrain from
cutting his budget by $8 million.</LD>
<TE>   At issue in the probe was a measure to raise the hourly wages of
home health workers from $6.75 to $11.50. With Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky dissenting, the Board of Supervisors on Dec. 18 directed
its attorney, County Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman, not to place the
measure on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Pellman called a majority of supervisors to tell
them he concluded he could not block the initiative. Supervisor
Gloria Molina then accused him of violating the Ralph M. Brown Act,
and the board discussed the matter twice more behind closed doors
before accidentally sending its minutes to The Times. The Brown Act
mandates that elected officials discuss matters before the public in
almost all circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The union representing the home health workers, Service Employees
International Union, Local 434B, asked the district attorney's office
to investigate the board's actions. In response to prosecutors'
decision not to file charges, the head of Local 434B issued a general
statement saying the union remained committed to providing senior
citizens and disabled people with quality health care.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors cheered the findings. "From the beginning, I felt we
had done nothing illegal or criminally wrong," Supervisor Don Knabe
said. "If anyone violated the Brown Act, it was Pellman."</TE>
<TE>   Molina agreed, saying that her earlier assertion that Pellman had
violated the Brown Act did not mean prosecutors needed to get
involved. "I don't think it [had] any criminal intentions," Molina
said, adding that supervisors have since passed new policies that
would prevent similar violations.</TE>
<TE>   The initial discussion among supervisors was on Dec. 18. Their
public agenda announced that they would privately discuss "initiation
of litigation." But supervisors ended up directing Pellman to block
the ballot measure in order to get sued.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Chasworth wrote in a formal rejection
notice that "this action and the attendant discussion were reasonably
related to the stated agenda description and thus "lawful."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Francke, an attorney with the California First Amendment
Coalition, said he was alarmed at that conclusion. "That seems to me
to be both disappointing and perverse," he said. "It seems to be
saying that a body can secretly authorize action invading the rights
of others in order to provoke litigation that is helpful to some arm
of government."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they also concluded that Pellman was not trying
to poll votes when he contacted supervisors the next day, but he was
informing them of his decision to certify the initiative. They
concluded the subsequent closed session discussions were also legal.</TE>
<TE>   David Demerjian, the head of the district attorney's public
integrity unit, said prosecutors relied on minutes of the closed
meetings, memos between supervisors' offices and other correspondence
in their probe. He said they also interviewed Pellman.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to supervisors, Cooley praised the board for taking
reforms last month "that go beyond the norm to assure Brown Act
compliance." Supervisors then agreed to post agendas and open to the
public meetings of their deputies--which the state attorney general
has already decided should be open meetings--and tape-record
closed-session meetings, among other steps.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley, who as district attorney has also pursued the Los Angeles
school board for Brown Act violations, bristled at suggestions that
he may go easier on supervisors, who control his budget. "There is
not one scintilla of politics in this," he said. "It is 100%
fact-based."</TE>
<TE>   The Times has sued the board for allegedly violating the Brown
Act. Susan Seager, the attorney handling that case, in a written
statement disagreed with the district attorney's findings and called
upon him to disclose the information he used in his investigation "so
that the public can scrutinize for itself the board's conduct in this
matter."</TE>

<HD>Caltech Art Proposal a Lightning Rod</HD>
<DH>Sculpture: Actually, the Serra work resembles a lightning
bolt. Foes say it would hinder Frisbee games, conceal muggers and
invite defacement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Caltech--a school with courses like Computation Theory and Neural
Systems--it might seem as if students and faculty are far too busy
studying the problems of the universe to get involved in the fate of
a simple sculpture. But not when it's "Vectors," the proposed
$2-million work by Richard Serra.</LD>
<LD>   For some, the piece--a series of zigzagging panels--is an exciting
new work by a preeminent artist. For others, it's a 240-foot obstacle
that will invite defacement and interrupt Frisbee games.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, said biology professor David Kremer at a meeting
Tuesday for students, faculty, staff and neighbors to discuss the
project, "Vectors" is "confrontational and controversial. That's the
most effective part of this piece. The discussion will be a
first-rate art lesson."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, "Vectors," part of a series based on walls rising out of
sloping hillsides that Serra has been assembling since 1970, seemed
to engender strong feelings among the 200 or so in attendance, only
two of whom spoke in support of the sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers offered colorful descriptions of the piece, which would
be constructed out of 3-inch-thick steel slabs and rise from ground
level to a height of 8 feet as it crisscrosses the sloping lawn
outside Beckman Institute: "a big hunk of rusting metal," "an
irresistible balance beam" and, anticipating the actions of
neighborhood dogs, "the largest fire hydrant in the city."</TE>
<TE>   They seemed to agree that the piece, while it might evoke many
things, is certainly not, in their view, representative of a vector.</TE>
<TE>   "'Vectors,' despite its scientific name, is a wall," said former
Caltech Provost Jack Roberts. "Walls are symbolic of suspicion,
mistrust, hiding, secrecy, a need for secrecy.... Caltech stands for
none of those things."</TE>
<TE>   An eight-member Institute Art Committee, composed of faculty and
staff members, last year chose Serra to construct a piece of
monumental art near its almost-complete Broad Center for Biological
Sciences, along Wilson Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltech master plan dictates that 1% of funds from
construction of buildings of a certain size be set aside for public
art, but only about 10% of the cost of the Serra sculpture will come
from that allocation. Caltech officials said the rest will be given
by private donors--including philanthropist Eli Broad, for whom the
Broad Center is named.</TE>
<TE>   The project still awaits final approval from Caltech President
David Baltimore and the Pasadena Arts Commission, expected to rule on
the design in July.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Sisk, a graduate student in chemistry, complained at the
meeting that "students were not contacted" in the design process and
said that "with very little effort" he had collected 315 signatures
on a petition condemning the sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "Students represent two-thirds of the campus," Sisk said. When
they aren't consulted about decisions, he said, "this ceases to
become a school and becomes a factory or corporation."</TE>
<TE>   Other attendees questioned the safety of such an installation,
which would bisect the lawn and prevent the kind of free-form Frisbee
games some Caltech students like to engage in. Some worried about
children who might play on or near the structure. One female graduate
student worried that the wall was tailor-made for a mugger to hide
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Walker Boland, a second-year graduate student in mechanical
engineering, had another concern. At a school where students are
renowned for a tendency to use their genius for sometimes nefarious
purposes, "normally sane people are already trying to think of ways
to deface" the sculpture, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "How many graduate students will have to go to jail?" she
wondered.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Rosenstone, a professor of history who has chaired the
Institute Art Committee for more than a decade, said it never
occurred to committee members when they were commissioning the piece
a year ago that it would provoke such an outcry in the Caltech
community.</TE>
<TE>   Once they saw the model a few weeks ago, Rosenstone said, "We
expected that there would be some questioning of and resistance to
the piece, both on artistic grounds and sight." The committee
scheduled the forum to address those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenstone said the Institute Art Committee, along with Caltech's
public relations office, would assemble notes and concerns voiced at
the meeting to give to Baltimore, who was unavailable for comment
Tuesday and could not make the meeting because of a scheduling
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Hall P. Daily, Caltech's assistant vice president and director of
government and community relations, said after the meeting that he
was heartened by the interest in the Serra sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a campus that is very heavily focused on science and
engineering, as its title suggests; after all, it's the California
Institute of Technology. I think it's very refreshing to see such
articulate and interested voices being raised on an issue of arts and
culture. It shows another side of Caltech."</TE>

<HD>Jailed Women Read, Write--and Rehabilitate</HD>
<DH>About 2,500 L.A. County inmates take classes daily. Some
earn vocational certificates; others just learn to read.</DH>

<LD>A simple metal cart--with books, laptop computers and lesson packets
stuffed onto shelves and a pencil sharpener and a white board hanging
from the sides--holds the tools Lynn Kaiser hopes will transform her
students' troubled lives.</LD>
<LD>   She shoves and drags the "mobile classroom" across her campus, the
concrete maze of women's dormitories at the county's Twin Towers
Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles. Her lessons attract
inmates trying to break the cycle of incarceration through education,
whether by learning to read or by earning a high school equivalency
certificate.</LD>
<LD>   As Kaiser wheels her cart through security checkpoints, she is a
bright spot of orange sweater and tweed pants against a backdrop of
blue inmate jumpsuits and drab sheriff's deputies' uniforms.</LD>
<TE>   "My students have all fallen through the cracks at some time in
their lives," she said. "It's my calling to help them and try to be a
person who brings some humanity to their lives."</TE>
<TE>   She teaches two classes a day, each a two-hour session for about
20 inmates in a dormitory day room, a fishbowl of an area that
resembles a college recreation room with its checkerboard-imprinted
tables and vending machine. Deputies at a central post in each
dormitory monitor the class as well as the glass-enclosed cells where
inmates chat or sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser is one of about 100 instructors in the Correctional
Education Division of the Hacienda La Puente School District, which
contracts with the county for the classes. The program offers
academic, behavioral and vocational classes to about 2,500 inmates a
day throughout the Los Angeles County Jail system. About half of the
students are at Twin Towers. When Kaiser enters their day rooms,
inmate pupils flock to her and select hand-held computers and
dictionaries as well as math and reading packets from her cart.
Kaiser gives new students a skills assessment test and tailors
packets to meet their needs.</TE>
<TE>   She calls students to her desk to work with them individually for
the majority of the session, tackling long division, antonyms and
basic grammar. Near the end of each class, Kaiser usually teaches a
group lesson on common challenges, such as fractions.</TE>
<TE>   Her goal is to prepare inmates, most of whom are dropouts, for the
high school equivalency exam. About five of her students pass the
test each month, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Monique Taylor, a 30-year-old from West L.A. who was convicted of
forging checks at her last job, hopes that Kaiser's classes will help
her pass the exam before her release from Twin Towers in July.</TE>
<TE>   "I did something so stupid, but God gave me this opportunity to
make myself a better person," said Taylor, looking up from a packet
of 12th-grade-level reading comprehension passages. "I'm going to
turn my life around. You will not see me back here."</TE>
<TE>   Helping inmates surmount obstacles to employment is essential to
reduce recidivism, said Jack Carey, facilities lieutenant at the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "We'd love to not have return
customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with academic classes like Kaiser's, inmates can choose from
such courses as animal grooming at Pitchess Detention Center in
Castaic and parenting classes at Biscailuz Recovery Center in Los
Angeles.Students who take vocational classes can earn certificates,
which the Sheriff's Department laminates so inmates can't alter them.
The certificates have helped them land jobs in masonry, plumbing and
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Discipline is not her biggest challenge, according to Kaiser, who
said she feels comfortable in the jail and has never been threatened.
Instead, she is bothered by all the distractions--medicine
distribution and messages from sheriff's deputies. Still, she has to
take precautions such as keeping all of her pens in a black leather
fanny pack and making sure she never lays them down, because sharp
objects are considered contraband.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my nature to let what's in my heart come out, but this has
made me a little more skeptical and a little less open," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Every day Kaiser sees another student leave without notice, some
released from jail or absent from class due to a court or Parole
Board appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates are in custody at county facilities for an average of 45
days, jail officials said. Most of the instructors use a curriculum
that students can complete within six months so that students with
longer-than-average sentences don't have to repeat lessons as often.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of a recent class, an intercom blasted another
interruption, naming a dozen inmates set to be released that day. One
pregnant woman in the class stood, gathered her materials, and said
goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "We do as much as we can in the amount of time given to us," said
Don Carmack, director of the Correctional Education Division. "We're
teaching them all like it's their last day here."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser, who used to be a fit model for a jeans manufacturer,
started working in the jails two years ago after teaching parolees
and high school students.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being aware of potential behavior problems, Kaiser said,
she watches for students who appear to be truly intent on learning.
"I'm always looking for the pearls," she said. "When I see my own
love of education coming out in these students, that's really
rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   Inmate Patricia Baldwin started writing poetry about her past
crack addiction after Kaiser taught her to use a dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   "She has opened up my mind to doing all kinds of things," said
Baldwin, 42, who is serving time for a string of crimes including
drug possession and prostitution. "This is the first time in my life
I've ever had the strength to finish anything worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the inmates are as focused, Kaiser said. Some take the
classes more to escape the monotony of incarceration than to better
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We're offering them the opportunities, but they have to be ready
for it," she said. "I'm hoping something I do or something I say
inspires them to ... redirect themselves in a positive way."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Board Says Yes to Courthouse, No to Jail Facility in
Laguna Niguel</HD>
<DH>Government: Board approves plan that could centralize
arraignments and housing of all inmates in county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Niguel will get the new courthouse it wanted but not the jail
it fought under a plan given preliminary approval Tuesday by Orange
County supervisors. The victory could lead to a new centralized
system in Santa Ana for arraigning and housing county inmates.</LD>
<LD>   The county needs the new courthouse and jail to relieve
overcrowding at other facilities and has been in negotiations since
1999. But Laguna Niguel officials opposed the jail, citing the
potential for escapes and the constant flow of sheriff's buses to and
from the facility.</LD>
<LD>   ''To us, the jail was a deal-breaker,'' said Cathryn DeYoung, a
Laguna Niguel City Council member. "Having most of the arraignments
and trials for all of south Orange County in what is basically a
residential area is not a compatible idea."</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the plan approved Tuesday calls for the county to develop
a centralized arraignment system that would avoid sending adult
inmates to any south Orange County court before the start of their
trials. If successful, the idea could be expanded for the entire
county.</TE>
<TE>   Early plans call for two small courtrooms to be attached to the
county's main jails and Intake Release Center in Santa Ana, court
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Centralizing arraignments has the support of the Sheriff's
Department, Superior Court Presiding Judge Frederick P. Horn, the
county's executive office and police chiefs, as well as Santa Ana and
Laguna Niguel, said Sheriff Mike Carona.</TE>
<TE>   Centralizing arraignments would eliminate the high costs and
security of transporting inmates early each day to the various branch
courthouses, Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson praised the plan and said it has won
approval of most of those in the county's justice community, except
for the local bar.</TE>

<LD>Laguna Niguel will get the new courthouse it wanted but not the jail
it fought under a plan given preliminary approval Tuesday by Orange

<LD>   The county needs the new courthouse and jail to relieve

<TE>   Early plans call for two small courtrooms to be attached to the
county's main jails and Intake Release Center in Santa Ana, court
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Centralizing arraignments has the support of the Sheriff's
Department, Superior Court Presiding Judge Frederick P. Horn, the
county's executive office and police chiefs, as well as Santa Ana and
Laguna Niguel, said Sheriff Mike Carona, who presented the plan to
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Slater, chief executive officer for the superior court, said
Horn wants arraignments centralized as a demonstration project for
the entire Harbor Justice Center area. That includes an area from
Costa Mesa south to San Clemente, and east to Anaheim Hills, Orange
and Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Centralizing arraignments would eliminate the high costs and
security of transporting inmates early each day to the various branch
courthouses, Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson praised the plan and said it has won
approval of most of those in the county's justice community, except
for the local bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I have plans to meet and speak with members of the bar in the
near future. But some have already told me they like the idea of
centralizing arraignments because they don't have to travel as far.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised the entire plan was discussed today, though,"
Wilson said. "We really don't have everything worked out."</TE>
<TE>   The South County courthouse in Laguna Niguel had become so
overcrowded that marshals used to have to chain defendants to metal
chairs in hallways. Jurors were squeezed into a once-condemned fire
station with a single working restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Jury trials have been moved to other courts, Slater said. "The
facility has just been severely overloaded. The building is
design-plagued and we also have had significant problems
accommodating people with disabilities. Plus all the support people,
like the public defenders are outside in trailers."</TE>
<TE>   Jury trials were shifted to the Harbor Justice Center in Newport
Beach, and family law and juvenile cases to the Lamoreaux Justice
Center in Orange. Large civil and criminal trials were moved to the
Santa Ana and Newport Beach courthouses, Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel has expressed interest in buying 22 county-owned
acres adjacent to the South County courthouse for a new civic center,
including a City Hall and other facilities. The City Council was to
hear a report by DeYoung at its regular meeting Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The council wants to become a partner in this and we will be
discussing it," DeYoung said. "Our interests are to put a City Hall
there and perhaps expand our library ....This [vote by supervisors]
really starts a long planning process for us."</TE>
<TE>   The county could use the money from the sale of the land to pay
for construction of the arraignment courts or to defray costs for the
new court facility in Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   The county has put aside $29 million for the new Laguna Niguel
courthouse, which would include courtrooms and court-related
departments, such as offices for prosecutors and public defenders.
Slater said the new facility is overdue.</TE>
<TE>   Projected growth throughout the county would require the
construction of 60 courtrooms over the next two to three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We have something like 750,000 population in South County and
they had only four courts. Nowhere in the country is there a
population [that is] that underserved," Slater said.</TE>

<HD>New Cal State Campus Unveils Project to Fund Its Own Growth</HD>
<DH>Education: Ventura County school, forced into the real
estate development business to support itself, begins the first phase
of a future mini-city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the tapping of hammers, California State University officials
Tuesday unveiled the first phase of a sprawling housing development
expected to fuel expansion of Ventura County's only four-year public
university over the next 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   The University Glen project, being built by Cal State Channel
Islands at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, will feature a mix
of apartments, townhouses and single-family homes, all available at a
discount to the university's faculty and staff.</LD>
<LD>   The first phase will consist of 207 units and serve as the
cornerstone of a mini-city expected to mushroom over the next five
years on the eastern edge of the Camarillo campus.</LD>
<TE>   The development "will be absolutely essential as we move to build
out the university in coming years," Cal State Channel Islands
President Richard Rush said after using an oversized pair of scissors
to cut a red ribbon stretched across the entryway to the housing
project.</TE>
<TE>   Behind him, along what will become Anacapa Island Drive, stood
dozens of wood-framed structures expected to be completed by the time
the university opens in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Four more phases will follow over the next five years, eventually
providing 900 housing units as part of a self-contained community
designed to sustain the college campus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to have affordable housing available so that this
university can recruit the very best faculty and staff from around
the world," Rush said. "This gives them an affordable option in a
very tight housing market."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the first phase, the college plans to offer 36
single-family homes--ranging from 1,689 square feet to 2,282 square
feet--for $229,000 to $307,000. The price of a typical Ventura County
home stands at $317,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the university will offer 71 townhouses, ranging from
1,300 square feet to 1,800 square feet, for sale or rent. Several
financing packages--including low-interest loans and 100%
financing--will be offered to help faculty and staff buy into the
project. Already, more than a dozen faculty and staff members are in
line to buy, and several other incoming faculty members have
expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest level is good and it's going to get better once
people see the finished product," said George Dutra, the university's
vice president for development.</TE>
<TE>   The houses are part of a larger development planned for the
campus. In June 2000, the CSU Channel Islands Site Authority approved
a master plan to guide creation of a range of income-generating
ventures designed to help the campus expand over the next quarter
century.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of those efforts is the community of 900 houses,
which will be crisscrossed with bike and pedestrian paths and will
feature a child-care center, an elementary school and a town square
complete with restaurants, bookstores and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, those projects are designed to generate the
millions of dollars needed to pay for new academic buildings and
programs for as many as 15,000 students eventually expected to attend
the university, which is under development at the former Camarillo
State Hospital site.</TE>
<TE>   Former Cal State University system trustee Jim Considine, who has
been on the Channel Islands Site Authority board since the beginning,
said the development deals were crucial to the university's future.</TE>
<TE>   Because of limited state funding, it became clear early that for
the university to expand, it would have to find ways to generate
money, Considine said.</TE>
<TE>   University officials say it's the first time ever that a
developing Cal State campus, and perhaps a new campus anywhere, has
been forced to fund its own growth by building money-making
facilities. Considine was on hand Tuesday to see the fruits of that
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gratifying to take a look at it now," he said. "There's
plenty more to do, but just to see it come this far is really
fantastic."</TE>

<HD>4 Found Guilty in Sales Scam</HD>

<LD>Four people were convicted Tuesday of fraud in the telemarketing of
securities for a company that falsely claimed to manufacture
high-quality latex gloves and condoms.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Kuykendoll, 53, of Thousand Oaks; Henry Perrin, 60, of Van
Nuys; and Sharman Walker, 49, and Anthony Durant, 43, both of Canoga
Park, were found guilty after a six-week trial in Los Angeles federal
court.</LD>
<LD>   The four worked on commission as telemarketers selling a private
stock offering on behalf of Woodland Hills-based Assured
International Inc. Investors were told they could double their money
because Assured was about to go public.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the company raked in nearly $1.4 million during
an 18-month period in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Assured's owner, Sam Harris, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
contempt charges earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers barred him from selling
stock early in 1998, and the Securities and Exchange Commission
obtained an injunction against Harris and Assured in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Assured continued to operate underground, using
apartments rented by Walker and Kuykendoll in Canoga Park and
Woodland Hills, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Attys. Michael M. Farhang and Douglas M. Fuchs, who
prosecuted the case, said a number of the scam's victims were elderly
people who had little or no investment experience. They said some
invested as much as $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The four defendants, who remain free on bail, are to be sentenced
Aug.12 by U.S. District Judge Audrey B. Collins.</TE>
<TE>   The case was investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service,
with help from the SEC.</TE>

<HD>Extradition Sought for Fugitive Priest</HD>

<LD>Glendale police have asked the district attorney's office to seek the
extradition of a fugitive priest from Sri Lanka, 11 years after the
man was charged with sexually abusing a teenage boy, prosecutors said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Father Tilak Jayawardene is believed to have returned to his
native Sri Lanka after he was asked to surrender to police in
December 1990, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said he recently wrote to church
officials in Sri Lanka, requesting that they return the priest to Los
Angeles. The cardinal said he wrote the letter after Glendale police
spoke to archdiocese officials about the case.</LD>
<TE>   Mahony said he also sent a copy of the letter to the Vatican. He
said Jayawardene's case illustrates how the sexual abuse of minors by
priests is a worldwide problem.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Moore, chief of the district attorney's extradition unit,
said Glendale police made the request to extradite the priest May 9,
after a reporter from The Times questioned police about their efforts
to locate the fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Police Sgt. Kim Lardie said she could not comment on the
department's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Jayawardene, who was ordained in Sri Lanka, had worked at
Incarnation Church in Glendale as associate pastor from 1987 to
December 1990, when he disappeared amid a police investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1991, he was charged with six counts of oral copulation
involving a 17-year-old boy. The alleged incidents occurred in 1990
between Oct. 23 and Nov. 5. Five of the alleged acts occurred in the
priest's bedroom at the Glendale Incarnation Church rectory, and the
sixth allegedly took place in the youth's home, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim, who reported the allegations to a teacher and
another priest, was working at the church and wanted to attend
seminary, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said a specially assigned prosecutor is reviewing the
extradition request, which is likely to be approved. "Sri Lanka
signed a new extradition treaty with the United States in 1999," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jayawardene disappeared after a police detective spoke to his
attorney in December 1990, officials said. The detective told the
attorney there was probable cause for an arrest and urged the priest
to surrender, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said local church officials do
not know the priest's whereabouts. He said the archdiocese knows of
no other victims.</TE>
<TE>   Father Gregory Coiro, a former archdiocese spokesman, said in 1991
that Jayawardene had "opted to leave the country.... Because he did
not belong to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, there was nothing the
archdiocese could do to make him stay."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials said Jayawardene was considered a "guest
priest" and remained under the authority of church officials in his
native land.</TE>
<TE>   "He was supposedly ordered to return to Sri Lanka by a bishop for
his religious order," said Mark Collier, a deputy district attorney
who was assigned the case at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles had informed Jayawardene's order of
the allegations, Collier said.</TE>

<HD>Citing Progress, Irvine Schools Chief to Quit</HD>
<DH>Education: Patricia Clark White says she has achieved goals
and wants more time with family. She'll leave amid budget woes and
labor tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Unified School District's superintendent told the board
Tuesday night that she will step down June 30.</LD>
<LD>   "We have made significant progress in reaching the vision that the
board and I set together from the outset and annually updated," said
Patricia Clark White, who has been the district's superintendent five
years.</LD>
<LD>   She said she has largely accomplished her goals for the district
and wants to spend more time with her family.</LD>
<TE>   Like districts across California, Irvine Unified has been plagued
by budget woes, mostly due to a $12.5-billion deficit in the state
budget that, among other things, has caused the district to close an
elementary school and issue preliminary layoff notices to 130
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 teachers packed Tuesday's school board meeting to
express dismay over the breakdown of contract negotiations. Some of
them interpreted White's retirement as a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful that now we can get somebody who cares about the
teachers and values what they're worth," said Eric Shulman, who
teaches math at University High School.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Caenn, president of the Irvine Teachers Assn., said she
wasn't surprised by White's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd been hearing rumors," said Caenn, whose group has called for
a no-confidence vote against White and the board.</TE>
<TE>   "White is a person who has done a great deal for education, but I
don't know that her heart is here in Irvine," she said.</TE>
<TE>   White said the timing of her retirement had nothing to do with the
union impasse. "After 21 years as a superintendent," she said, "it's
time to put my family first."</TE>

<HD>Cooley Labels Crime Lab Plans Inadequate</HD>
<DH>Forensics: The D.A. contends space and staff for DNA
testing will be lacking. Sheriff's and LAPD officials defend the
facility, scheduled to open in 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a $96-million regional crime lab are grossly inadequate and
threaten to expand a backlog of unsolved murder and sexual assault
cases, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley warned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley said the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department have not proposed enough staff or space to adequately test
forensic evidence at their state-funded joint crime lab, which is
scheduled to open on the Cal State Los Angeles campus in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   "This is D-day for the crime lab," Cooley said Tuesday. "They
either make a big mistake or they do it right."</LD>
<TE>   In a letter sent earlier this month to the crime lab's board of
directors, which includes Sheriff Lee Baca and LAPD interim Chief
Martin Pomeroy, Cooley criticized the plans and urged the agencies to
make changes so the facility is not "obsolete the day it opens."
Later this month, the board will meet to discuss those plans for the
use of staff and equipment at the new lab.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD and sheriff's officials defended their plans, saying that
they have prepared sufficiently for the new lab.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley faults the Los Angeles Police Department for not setting
aside sufficient space and staff for DNA testing, a mistake that he
said could hurt prosecutions of criminal cases and result in more
rapes and murders with no perpetrator apprehended. The district
attorney's office relies on testing of crime scene evidence for use
in trials.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're standing in court, with the whole world knowing about
DNA technology, and some agency hasn't gathered the forensics
evidence and had it tested in a timely manner, then the case will
probably fail," Cooley said. "DNA technology is the ultimate in crime
prevention, and if anyone doesn't appreciate that ... they are not
doing their job."</TE>
<TE>   According to the district attorney's office, the LAPD has
projected about 12,500 square feet and 34 employees for its DNA
section in the new lab, which will house separate facilities for the
LAPD and Sheriff's Department. But Cooley said the LAPD's DNA section
will need 72 criminalists to accommodate requests for testing and to
make a dent in the backlog of unsolved cases. The LAPD's current lab
near downtown Los Angeles now receives 60 to 80 requests for DNA
testing each month and already has an annual backlog of at least 400
unsolved cases, he said, and the needs will be even greater in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley also said the LAPD is trying to squeeze too many types of
testing into the new lab and should save space by keeping its blood
alcohol, narcotics and toxicology testing at its current facility.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Paul Enox, who heads the current crime lab, said he
gladly would have as many DNA criminalists as the city agrees to
provide. But in the past, he said, the city has not budgeted as many
criminalists as the LAPD has requested. "My plan is consistent with
what resources I have been able to get," Enox said.</TE>
<TE>   Enox said he also can run two or three different shifts of DNA
testing in the new building to save square footage. "I consider it to
be the DNA field of dreams," he said. "If they give them to me, I'll
find space for them."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said that the Sheriff's Department's plans for DNA testing
are on target, but that its projections for firearms analysis are
lacking. The department has only proposed 15 examiners and two
technicians and should have at least 26, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Harley Sagara, assistant director of the sheriff's crime lab,
which is now on Beverly Boulevard, said the department's proposals
are flexible and allow for future changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that we have planned sufficiently and we have growth
built into the plans," Sagara said. "If the need for more firearms
space is required, we could shrink other sections."</TE>
<TE>   The regional crime lab is designed to ease crowding at the current
labs, expand forensics testing, improve evidence collection and serve
as a training center for future criminalists.</TE>
<TE>   But since the county was awarded the $96 million in state funding
for the 213,000-square-foot building, the project has been delayed by
disagreements over how much personnel, equipment and space to share.</TE>
<TE>   Now the project is back on track, officials said, and is scheduled
to break ground in October 2003.</TE>

<HD>Marines Reject Use of El Toro for Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>To the joy of officials in San Diego and to the disappointment of
those in Orange County, the Marine Corps announced Tuesday that it is
dropping the idea of moving its West Coast basic training camp from
San Diego to El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   Marine Commandant Gen. James Jones, in a letter to members of
Congress, said that the "urban setting" of the Marines' former base
at El Toro makes it unsuitable as a site for firing ranges.</LD>
<LD>   "Accordingly," Jones wrote, "the Marine Corps will not pursue the
potential relocation of [the recruit depot] to El Toro, and has
advised the Navy secretariat of my concurrence in their efforts to
rapidly dispose of this property."</LD>
<TE>   Closed as part of the post-Cold War military cutback, the El Toro
base is being returned to civilian use. A coalition of Orange County
officials waged an eight-year battle to turn the base into a civilian
airport; county voters turned down that idea in March--opening a
wide-ranging discussion about the property's future. Jones asked his
subordinates to study whether El Toro might be an alternative to San
Diego--able to accommodate the firing ranges and 54-hour field
exercise called the Crucible, both key parts of the grueling 13-week
Marine training program.</TE>
<TE>   At 388 acres, the San Diego base is too small to accommodate those
aspects of training. As a result, the Marines must send recruits to
Camp Pendleton, 40 miles north, for four weeks. Opened in 1923, the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego is one of two Marine Corps
training bases nationally, training more than 21,000 recruits
annually from west of the Mississippi.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Beach Resident Finds an Easter Surprise: Rodent on a

<LD>Something you probably wouldn't want in your Easter basket: The
police log of the Coastline Pilot said that a "rat with an Easter egg
stuck on its head was reported in a resident's backyard" in Laguna
Beach. The rat, apparently conducting its own laboratory experiment,
had poked its noggin into an empty plastic egg and got it stuck
there. The egg was removed by animal control so the critter could
rejoin the rat race.</LD>
<LD>   And just when City Hall has been rehabbed! Did you read that Tom
Cruise is going to produce a remake of the sci-fi yarn "The War of
the Worlds"?</LD>
<LD>   In the 1953 movie version, Southern California is the first target
of the Martian invaders, prompting these snippets of dramatic
dialogue:</LD>
<TE>   * "We've got them between here and Fresno."</TE>
<TE>   * "Call Victorville and tell them we want the fastest planes
they've got."</TE>
<TE>   * "The target for the A-bomb is this nest of Martian machines in
the Puente Hills."</TE>
<TE>   * And, after the A-bomb fails: "They'll be moving on Los Angeles
now."</TE>
<TE>   City Hall is one of the casualties. No mention of the San Fernando
Valley is made in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's note: Licia Coceani of Marina del Rey noticed a sign at
a Flagstaff, Ariz., airport that seemed to indicate that arriving
passengers must parachute to earth (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   But can you wash him out of your hair? When she picked up a
prescription, Liz Noriega of Mission Viejo noticed that the last
portion of the "possible side effects" language had been omitted,
lending new meaning to the warning (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   "I am wondering if I should take this pill at all," Noriega
quipped. "Or, on the right terms, I might want to double it."</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration for generations to come: During his commencement
speech at USC, author David Halberstam recalled how Henry Ford II was
thrown out of Yale because he had someone else write one of his
papers. Ford, the grandson of the car company's founder, was invited
back to Yale to be awarded an honorary degree years later, Halberstam
said. Whereupon Ford held up his speech and chortled, "I didn't write
this either."</TE>

<TE>   * And, finally, no kidding, the Hugh M. Hefner Chair for the Study

<TE>   If the name fits: Ken Sunshine is a Hollywood publicist.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to Paul Harvey: I guess I should be flattered that your
writers are constantly lifting items from this column for your
syndicated broadcast, even though they never credit the source. But
you should remind them to at least copy correctly. The other day,
Jerry Feldner and other readers heard you mention the Beverly Hills
High student whose purple hair dye leaked onto his date's white dress
at a prom. Not quite! The student, quoted here, was merely
fantasizing his biggest prom fear. The dance hasn't been held yet.
I'll keep you posted.</TE>

<HD>Council Takes Middle Path on Development</HD>
<DH>Ventura: By 4-3 vote, a $26,000 study of ballot initiative
on proposed hillside project is rejected in favor of a simple
summary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not wishing to step into the political fray, a split Ventura City
Council rejected a plan to spend $26,000 to study a ballot initiative
that would allow further development of the city's hillsides.</LD>
<LD>   After two hours of debate, the council voted 4 to 3 to ask City
Atty. Robert Boehm to instead prepare a bare-bones summary of the
initiative.</LD>
<LD>   The council's debate centered on two questions: Should the city
fund studies based solely on the developer's information, risking the
appearance of partiality? Or should it do nothing, leaving voters to
rely on public discourse for their information? The council's action
landed it somewhere in between.</LD>
<TE>   "The council wants to reduce [the initiative] down to its
essential elements and describe those for members of the public,"
Boehm said. He said the summary, most likely in a question-and-answer
format, will be presented to the council July 1. Councilmen James
Friedman and Neal Andrews and Deputy Mayor Brian Brennan voted
against the action.</TE>
<TE>   The Open 80 ballot initiative, if adopted by voters, would allow
construction of 1,390 homes on hillsides north of downtown Ventura
and would set aside about 3,000 acres as permanent open space. The
area stretches roughly from Grant Park to just east of Arroyo Verde
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had a development agreement go before [Ventura
residents] to vote on," Mayor Ray DiGuilio said. "It's a legal,
binding contract," he said, one that circumvents the regular approval
process, which includes detailed analyses.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman James Monahan referred to it as "planning by ballot
box."</TE>
<TE>   A representative for the landowners has said that they are simply
fulfilling the mandate of Measure P, which essentially requires that
hillside development be approved by voters.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said the council should abide by the spirit of the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Measure P basically said, 'City Council, we want you to stay out
of this,'" Friedman said. "Let the landowners bring forward their
information and let the opponents bring forth their information and
let the voters decide directly."</TE>
<TE>   DiGuilio said he doubted that any limited studies the city might
do could change the minds of voters who have already staked out their
position, but that the council has a responsibility to inform the
public anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Under state election codes, the city is prohibited from spending
any money on a study that might be construed as either in favor of or
in opposition to an initiative. But it could have ordered studies on
how the project might affect traffic, the city's ability to attract
and retain businesses, and scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   Community Development Director Susan Daluddung told the council
that the studies, if the council had requested them, would have been
based on information furnished by the developer of the master plan.
Council members expressed concern that spending the $26,000 would not
be enough to get all their questions answered.</TE>
<TE>   "A cursory study does not do justice to what people need to see,"
Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a representative for the landowners said they have
gathered more than enough signatures to get the proposal on the
November ballot. Proponents are in the process of verifying the
signatures, he said, and will turn them over to the city clerk by
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Top Davis Aides Say They Were Misled on Oracle</HD>
<DH>Probe: Pair testify they were not advised of key facts or
concerns before they cleared the way for the costly software deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Top aides to Gov. Gray Davis testified Tuesday that they were either
misled by their underlings or couldn't recall details of events
leading up to the administration's decision to sign an embarrassing
$95-million software contract with Oracle Corp. and a Northrop
Grumman subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   Also Tuesday, Oracle avoided a legislative subpoena by agreeing
that five employees, including the son of state Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles), will testify early next month before the committee
investigating the software-licensing agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The Oracle deal gained notoriety after a highly critical state
audit reported that rather than saving the state money, the contract
might end up costing the state as much as $41 million. Since the
audit's release, Davis has suspended with full pay the head of the
Department of Information Technology, and forced two other aides to
quit. One of them, Arun Baheti, Davis' director of e-government,
accepted a $25,000 campaign donation from an Oracle lobbyist shortly
after the state struck the deal.</LD>
<TE>   In her testimony Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy said the
first she had heard that Baheti violated administration policy by
accepting the donation was when she read about it in newspapers this
month, even though the Davis campaign was aware of the incident last
June, when the donation arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats controlling the committee blocked state Sen. Ray Haynes
(R-Riverside) from pressing Kennedy about the donation and about the
governor's policy against government aides mixing politics and
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, the highest-ranking administration official to appear
before the legislative committee, told lawmakers she was presented
with and signed a so-called Governor's Action Request on May 31,
2001. That document, approved by several top administration
officials, opened the way for the state to enter into the deal with
Oracle on that date. Oracle set May 31 as the deadline for signing
the deal, hoping that it could reflect the contract on a quarterly
earnings statement.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said she signed the Governor's Action Request after being
assured that while it might not save the state more than $100
million, at least there would be some savings. But like other Davis
aides who have testified, Kennedy said in sworn testimony that she
never briefed the governor about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, she said, was "rather arcane."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said she was unaware of key facts, including the existence
of the Northrop subsidiary, Logicon, let alone that the company was
involved in the deal and stood to make $28 million once the state
agreed to a software-licensing agreement with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was she aware that while action requests are supposedly
confidential documents, a high-ranking official in the Department of
General Services provided an early draft of the request to Logicon,
and that the company may have helped write the document.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy signed the deal after Aileen Adams, Davis' secretary of
consumer affairs, called her multiple times May 31 seeking a meeting
that day. In her testimony, Adams, who also signed the action
request, said she first saw a draft of the document May 29.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said she mistakenly believed that the Department of
Information Technology, responsible for such contracts, had done a
"needs assessment," and that state departments could benefit from the
contract. She also said underlings who had reservations about the
deal had an obligation to tell her "anything negative."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, she heard no dissents. If she had known that
Department of Finance officials had concerns, she "would have headed
in a different direction."</TE>
<TE>   In more than fours hours of testimony, Adams repeatedly said she
couldn't recall an array of details ranging from when she signed the
request to whether she has an active license to practice law in
California.</TE>

<HD>Teen's One-Night Mistake Carried a High Price</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haven't all the words been written?</LD>
<LD>   Yes.</LD>
<LD>   Hasn't the river of tears flowed steadily from coast to coast for
the last generation or so?</LD>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Is there anything new to say about what can happen when a teenager
relies on drugs for the big buzz but ends up dead instead?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing all that, I make no pretense of having anything to add
about the death of 18-year-old Cathy Isford, the Foothill High School
senior who fell into a coma on prom night last Saturday after taking
Ecstasy, possibly in combination with other drugs.</TE>
<TE>   She was taken off life support Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't to say this young woman's death doesn't hurt. It hurts
not because I know her, but because she represents all those
teenagers who threaten their well-being every time they play with
fire. Most of the time, the fire doesn't catch them. When it does,
there's often no escape.</TE>
<TE>   This is no oldster's lecture to teenagers. My generation taught
its children everything. Ours would be the last to moralize about
drug use. To make matters worse, we continue it to this day by
drinking ourselves stupid and then complaining when youngsters do the
same.</TE>
<TE>   But if it sounds to teenagers like we're harping on them, it's
only because they mistake nagging for a plaintive cry.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to read about a 50-year-old's death. It's another
to read about an 18-year-old's that could have been prevented.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you have to be middle-aged to scream internally at a life
snuffed out over a one-night mistake. The irony of Isford's death is
that her older sister said she cautioned her sister after the younger
sibling said she was going to take the drugs to make the prom "a
perfect night."</TE>
<TE>   The cries of anguish from the Isford family and circle of friends
will reverberate for a lifetime over that poignant reminder.</TE>
<TE>   Every high school teacher and principal know about these risks.
They see the kids every day, perhaps more than the kids see their
parents.</TE>
<TE>   I asked one of them--an assistant principal at a different Orange
County high school--how he deals with the ever-present threat that
one of his students could end up like Isford. Does he put up an
emotional shield?</TE>
<TE>   "Not if you care for kids," he says, adding that he makes a point
of telephoning a student's parents if he suspects he or she might be
on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   This administrator knows all too well what is going on now at
Foothill. The grieving for Isford will continue, and for a while, her
schoolmates may be sobered to the real dangers out there.</TE>
<TE>   But he and I know such fears will pass. As all generations have
done, this one will continue to put itself at risk. And some will end
up on the roster of unlucky losers who instead of experiencing life
will lose it.</TE>
<TE>   It also hurts because these aren't bad kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the most wonderful kids I ever had the opportunity to
meet have found themselves going down that path," the assistant
principal says. "Despite being intelligent, active, athletes or
performers ... yet, there they were."</TE>
<TE>   Nor do these kids have death wishes. To the contrary, they think
they can handle anything. "If you ask the typical 16-year-old what
they want to do with their life, for a lot of them the time frame is
real short," the administrator says. "They're thinking about next

<TE>   I think he's tapped the source of my sadness over this girl I
didn't know. It's the death of someone who never saw it coming, who
never bothered to ask if the one-night high carried a price tag like
the one she paid.</TE>
<TE>   In that, she is no different from thousands of other teens.</TE>
<TE>   Because we can't stop them from feeling immortal, we can at least
let them know we curse the fates that claimed them. We can let them
know we don't just chalk up another death to simply being "one of
those things."</TE>
<TE>   In our apparent inability to prevent such tragedies, we can at
least let those left behind know we're hoping against hope they
somehow become smarter than we were.</TE>

<HD>Former Trainee Pastor Held on 18 Abuse Counts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former trainee pastor at a Long Beach Methodist church was arrested
in Northern California Tuesday, after the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office charged him with repeatedly molesting two boys
during the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Allen Carson-Hull, 57, of Los Altos was taken into custody
there about 9:45 a.m. and held on $900,000 bail at Santa Clara County
Jail, said Long Beach Police Det. Craig Newland.</LD>
<LD>   Carson-Hull is charged with 18 felony counts.</LD>
<TE>   Carson-Hull was a youth minister at Los Altos United Methodist
Church in Long Beach between 1974 and 1979, when he sexually
assaulted the boys dozens of times, Newland said.</TE>
<TE>   The minister and the boys, then between 11 and 14, participated in
the church's Methodist Youth Fellowship. A 39-year-old Southern
California man asked Long Beach police earlier this month about the
statute of limitations for such crimes, Newland said. The man told
police Carson-Hull had sexually assaulted him decades ago, the
detective said. The man also led police to a 38-year-old man now
living in Northern California, who then filed a report alleging that
Carson-Hull also had molested him, Newland said.</TE>
<TE>   "He provided the corroboration we needed to charge Carson-Hull
under the law," Newland said.</TE>
<TE>   In cases dating beyond the 10-year statute of limitations,
prosecutors must show serious sexual misconduct and corroboration of
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Carson-Hull was a probationary deacon, the first step
toward ordination as a minister, said the Rev. Jerry Larsen, senior
pastor of the 1,000-member church. "Because of the incidents here, he
was ordered to give up his orders and was fired," Larsen said. "The
boys' parents reported the incidents to the church, but they did not
want it reported to police."</TE>
<TE>   Larsen said his own tenure at the church in the 5900 block of East
Willow Street did not overlap with Carson-Hull's, but he knew him.
Newland said the allegations were made to the then-senior pastor by
the father of one alleged victim, and the church removed Carson-Hull
from the ministry and directed him to get counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, there wasn't a requirement for the clergy to report"
suspected sexual abuse, Newland said.</TE>
<TE>   State law now requires clergy to report suspicions of child abuse,
except when they receive the information in a confessional setting or
when adult victims inform clergy about incidents involving
themselves.</TE>

<HD>State Inflated Power Needs, Lawmaker Says</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Exaggerated demands by Cal-ISO, the senator
finds, resulted in extra electricity being sold at a loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state senator investigating California's electricity market accused
the state's grid-operating agency Tuesday of manipulating the market
itself, at taxpayer expense.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove), who has been investigating abuses
of California's power market in the last two years, accused the
California Independent System Operator of inflating demand for
electricity on dozens of occasions last fall. The final result, he
said, was that state taxpayers bought unnecessary power that often
had to be sold at a loss.</LD>
<LD>   Dunn pointed to an incident on Nov. 14 in which Cal-ISO workers
told state power buyers to falsely inflate the demand for electricity
in order to get Reliant Energy and Duke Energy to turn on power
plants at Ormond Beach and Morro Bay.</LD>
<TE>   The state arranged to buy electricity from those plants at
above-market prices, Dunn said, and later sold it at a loss because
it wasn't needed.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn acknowledged that Cal-ISO's motive wasn't profit--the
nonprofit agency maintains the flow of power on the grid serving
three-fourths of the state--but rather to keep electricity flowing to
utility customers despite the refusal of some power plant owners to
offer their electricity for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of resorting to manipulation to counteract the defiant
generators, Dunn said, Cal-ISO should have taken its concerns to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the nation's top regulator of
electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, FERC had ordered power plant owners in California to
stand ready to sell power to Cal-ISO. The order frustrated
generators, especially the owners of older power plants that take
many hours to warm up.</TE>
<TE>   If Cal-ISO could not have avoided blackouts without resorting to
manipulation, Dunn said, "the ultimate responsibility lay with FERC."</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate arbiter here is FERC," Dunn said. "When FERC won't
do its job, going to the California ratepayer and taxpayer and asking
them to pay more dollars, in my view, is not an acceptable
alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO officials defended their actions, saying they wanted to
guarantee adequate power supplies in the several days after the Nov.
14 weekend because a major transmission line was shut down for
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The Ormond Beach and Morro Bay plants sit on either side of that
line, said Cal-ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kahn, chairman of the Cal-ISO governing board, said, "We
did it to ensure reliability because we weren't sure we'd have enough
electricity on a certain line."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Dunn played a nine-minute tape of a Nov. 14
conversation between Cal-ISO and the state's power-buying operation,
which is part of the Department of Water Resources. State officials
had asked that they have attorneys present for the conversation and
that it be recorded.</TE>
<TE>   In the recording, Cal-ISO grid operations director Jim McIntosh
tells Water Resources employees that he wants them to "bring the
units on and hold minimum load."</TE>
<TE>   A Water Resources power buyer tells Cal-ISO employees that doing
what they ask will force the state to sell off electricity because
they've already arranged for enough power for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said he did not know the cost of complying with Cal-ISO's
request.</TE>
<TE>   But Duke spokesman Pat Mullen said the power from its inefficient,
47-year-old Morro Bay plant was purchased at the time for the cost of
production, $23.50 per megawatt-hour. Market prices at the time were
closer to $18 per megawatt-hour, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen denied that Duke ever violated a federal order to supply
electricity to Cal-ISO.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been cooperative in every instance when requested by the
ISO to bring a unit on line," he said, "even when it was questionable
whether we'd be paid."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A petition drive by water agencies and others to put a $3.4-billion
bond measure for water projects on the November ballot has succeeded,
the secretary of state's office announced.</LD>
<LD>   The bonds would provide money to improve the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, reduce the state's dependence on the Colorado River,
and boost desalination, among other projects.</LD>
<LD>   The California Chamber of Commerce and farmers groups have
criticized the amount as too small, and some environmentalists say
the measure includes projects that are damaging.</LD>

<HD>Apparent Gang-Related Attacks Leave One Dead, Three Wounded
in Oxnard</HD>

<LD>Hours after a 15-year-old Oxnard boy died from stab wounds suffered
in an earlier attack, three other youths were wounded Tuesday in an
apparent gang-related shooting on the city's south end.</LD>
<LD>   The sudden flash of violence had police scrambling to determine if
there was any connection between the two attacks, which occurred less
than 24 hours apart.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not sure if this has all been tied together or whether it's
just random gang violence," said Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez.
"These are senseless killings and injuries, and we don't want it in
our city."</LD>
<TE>   The three shooting victims were ambushed at about 5 p.m. outside a
Pleasant Valley Road apartment complex, police said. Witnesses said a
gunman stepped out of one of two cars, aimed his handgun and fired
five shots.</TE>
<TE>   All three of the male youths were hit in the legs, and none of the
injuries was believed to be life-threatening. Police identified two
of the victims as known gang members, ages 17 and 20. The third was
described as a 15-year-old and an unintended target.</TE>
<TE>   Officers fanned out across the neighborhood late Tuesday,
interviewing residents and searching for evidence. No arrests have
been made.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Marquez, an eighth-grader at Nueva Vista School, died about
10:30 a.m. at St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was being
treated for stab wounds suffered in an assault the night before,
authorities said. His mother, who spent the night at his bedside,
said he suffered two heart attacks in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in the 600 block of East Juniper Street contacted police
about 6:30 p.m. Monday after Marquez staggered down the street
calling for help before collapsing on a neighbor's lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew it was very serious," Sgt. Jim Seitz said. "He basically
lay down in a fetal position on the grass and waited for police to
arrive."</TE>
<TE>   Police interviewed Marquez twice--once at the scene and again at
the hospital--as he awaited surgery. But the youth was uncooperative
both times, Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea why this took place," he said.</TE>

<TE>   A longtime friend of Marquez's, who spoke on condition of

who saw him while he was tagging, or spray-painting graffiti, in an
area they controlled. Police said they were still learning about the
victim's background and could not confirm whether he was a gang
member.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Bryan, who lives near Juniper Street, said he saw two red cars
traveling side by side shortly before Marquez was stabbed, with the
occupants of each yelling obscenities in Spanish at one another.</TE>
<TE>   As the two cars approached the intersection at Juniper, one
swerved in front of the other, smashing into it and forcing its
driver to stop, Bryan said.</TE>
<TE>   A young man jumped out of the car that had been stopped and tried
to run away. An occupant of the other vehicle chased him down,
stabbed him and jumped back into the car, Bryan said. Both cars drove
away, leaving the wounded youth alone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez's parents and 14-year-old brother Adrian said they had no
reason to believe he was affiliated with a gang. They searched
through his bedroom but found no gang paraphernalia. Until recently,
they said, he played youth league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I have died, because I love my boy," said Javier
Marquez Sr. The teen's mother, Silvia Olguin, said she knew something
was wrong Monday, because her son usually comes home in the early
afternoon. When he failed to arrive by 6 p.m., she paged him but he
never called back.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital, she tried to ask her son about what happened. "I
asked him, 'Why they did this to you?' And he didn't tell me," she
said. "I talked with him all night trying to comfort him and make him
laugh."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the city was rocked by gang violence was in the fall
of 2000, when five shootings in less than a week prompted a citywide
police crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Serious offenses in Oxnard declined 7% last year from the year
before, while the number of homicides dropped from nine to six. Lopez
said Tuesday he was confident that his officers could keep this
week's violence from escalating.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Pressures County Supervisors to Approve Audit of
Budget Processes</HD>
<DH>Finances: Baca protests cuts in his allocation, saying his
department is regularly shortchanged. Auditors will examine agency
operating costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to have
an outside auditor inspect its own and the sheriff's budget processes
after Sheriff Lee Baca packed 1,000 supporters into a county budget
hearing to protest dramatic cuts in his department.</LD>
<LD>   Baca's appearance was a carefully orchestrated demonstration from
within his administrative office. Using his campaign funds, he
drummed up support at town hall meetings and by distributing mailers
and a video among deputies. Baca did not say how much money was used.</LD>
<LD>   If his demands are met, other agencies, such as the Department of
Health Services, would probably face more cuts. Health Services is
already poised to lay off more than 5,000 workers in the next 18
months, according to Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.</LD>
<TE>   The supervisors have told departments they are "taking a
share-the-burden approach" to the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   "Public safety should be our first priority. All other needs
should be considered later," Baca said in an interview after the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said that the supervisors regularly shortchange his
department in their budget process.</TE>
<TE>   After Baca addressed the supervisors, they unanimously ordered the
hiring of an outside accounting firm to decide whether the budget
process is fair to the county's public safety departments.</TE>
<TE>   Baca and union officials argue that the county has $800 million in
reserves which it could use to maintain services. But supervisors,
who have sparred with the sheriff all year over his litigation costs
and purchase of an airplane, have been reluctant to approve more
funding.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department, which has a $1.4-billion budget, will
receive nearly $50 million less, according to the county's proposal.
But Baca says his department would be forced to cut $100 million in
services because of new operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   The audit will examine the county's $16.2-billion budget over six
to nine months, focusing on the operating costs that Baca says the
county is unfairly forcing departments to absorb.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said the audit's findings may result in
an easier fight for Baca in future years, but won't be finished
before the budget is approved.</TE>
<TE>   "With all due respect, we have a decision to make on this budget
this summer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who said Tuesday that he would oppose
any budget for the Sheriff's Department that did not include
substantial new funds, said auditors should be able to give status
reports once they begin their work and may find ways to provide the
department with more money this year.</TE>
<TE>   But Antonovich acknowledged that the search for new funds may face
challenges as the state revises the amount of money the county will
receive.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has "put a budget together with chewing gum and
string until after the November election, when I expect us to receive
news of even less money from the state," Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Since budget problems are not new at the supervisors' hearings,
one of the challenges Baca said he faced was to reach the public and
let people know he needed their help. In his testimony, he said the
cuts would leave him unable to meet his obligations to protect the
public, but dropped attention-getting claims made last month that he
will not be able to buy all the bullets and gasoline he needs for his
department.</TE>
<TE>   The audience hissed and applauded throughout his testimony,
breaking the usually genteel decorum maintained during supervisors'
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "You can boo all you want, and we understand why you're here, so
just relax," Molina told the protesters. Los Angeles County Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley had threatened to pull out of his own presentation
to the supervisors regarding his budget if Baca's supporters made too
much noise.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview from his office before the budget hearing, Cooley
said that he would make a "calm and deliberate" presentation of his
office's request for $20 million to make up for the $8.4-million cut
and the loss of state grants, as well as to fund new programs.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said that the burdens of the budget cycle are all-consuming
for department chiefs and that he has been required to spend more
time on budget issues than any other topic since the beginning of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "And it only gains momentum as we go along," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley appeared with several aides and was not interrupted during
his testimony at the supervisors' hearing.</TE>

<HD>Board Names Next Long Beach Schools Chief</HD>
<DH>Education: Deputy Supt. Christopher Steinhauser will
replace Carl Cohn at the helm of the state's third-largest district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach Unified School District on Tuesday elevated
Christopher Steinhauser, its second in command, to become the next
superintendent of the 97,000-student system.</LD>
<LD>   Steinhauser, 43, will replace Carl Cohn, who served as
superintendent for 10 years and earned national recognition for
leading improvements in the district, which is the third largest in
the state, after Los Angeles and San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Cohn, 56, will retire in August and become a professor at the USC
Rossier School of Education, where he will train future school
superintendents.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to build upon the strengths that our present
superintendent and board have already established," Steinhauser said
Tuesday. "We're a leader in school reform."</TE>
<TE>   Steinhauser began his career as a teacher in Long Beach and moved
up through the ranks as a vice principal, principal, director of
special projects for the central office, and as an area
superintendent. In 1999 he was named deputy superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   He will inherit an ethnically diverse student population that is
45% Latino, 20% black, 18% white and 12% Asian.</TE>
<TE>   Although test scores have gone up significantly in the last three
years, Steinhauser faces challenges similar to those Cohn encountered
in 1992: budget cuts, overcrowding and continuing pressures to
improve academic performance.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhauser, who has two children in district schools, said he
will focus on helping students pass the new California high school
exit exam, as well as on building and modernizing schools with money
from a $290-million local bond issue that passed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing challenge will be getting through tough fiscal
times, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district has slowed spending, reduced central offices and
frozen the hiring of classified employees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to similar budget cuts 10 years ago, Steinhauser said
Tuesday: "We survived that storm, and we'll survive this one."</TE>
<TE>   Steinhauser earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Cal State
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He started his career in 1982, teaching third and fifth grades at
Roosevelt Elementary in Long Beach. He later became vice principal of
Burnett Elementary, then principal of Signal Hill Elementary, both in
the Long Beach district.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhauser's salary will be negotiated, but district officials
said they expect it will be less than Cohn's current $230,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhauser called Cohn a great mentor and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "I am truly indebted to him for all of the opportunities he's
given to me in my life," Steinhauser said.</TE>
<TE>   School Board President Bobbie Smith said the board is pleased to
welcome Steinhauser as superintendent, but added that it will miss
Cohn's innovative and creative leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn called Steinhauser an "outstanding hands-on leader" who will
work hard to continue to improve the district.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as that team stays together and as long as the board of
education stays together, I think you will have a lot of stability
and continuity in the superintendency," Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Cohn was one of two California educators to win the
2001 Harold W. McGraw Jr. Prize in education, one of the most
prestigious honors in the field. He was honored for his work in
promoting opportunities among minority students in a school district
that has its share of big-city problems, such as drugs, crime and
racial tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Under Cohn, the district has improved attendance, lowered
suspension and dropout rates, and increased the number of students
enrolled in college preparatory courses.</TE>
<TE>   When Cohn was 23, he abandoned plans to enter the priesthood and
became a teacher. He worked as a counselor, administrator and area
superintendent in Long Beach schools for more than 20 years before
becoming the district's first African American superintendent in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the district made national headlines when it became the
first public school district in the country to make uniforms
mandatory for its elementary and middle school students.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn also was instrumental in implementing a program that required
third-graders who needed help in reading to attend summer school, and
another that required failing eighth-graders to attend a year of
preparatory school before high school.</TE>
<TE>   Also under his leadership, Long Beach Unified launched
single-gender classes at a middle school.</TE>

<HD>Most of D.A.'s Charity Funds Went to Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Aid: Orange County prosecutor's foundation spent 71% of its
income dealing with state probe. Spokeswoman says the expenditure was
proper and necessary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas and members of his
nonprofit charity for troubled youth spent most of its money on legal
fees while the charity was under investigation by the state attorney
general's office, county records show.</LD>
<LD>   The charity, named the Tony Rackauckas Foundation when it was
formed in 2000, said its mission was to raise money for counseling
and guidance programs for at-risk children ages 5 to 16. It was
disbanded last December as part of an agreement between Rackauckas
and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose office concluded that the charity
failed to properly "govern its operations" and "exercise proper care
in managing [its] assets."</LD>
<LD>   The attorney general's office investigated after some district
attorney's employees complained that investigators for the Orange
County district attorney's office were asked to conduct background
checks on prospective donors to the charity using county databases.
Criminal databases are to be used only for law enforcement purposes.
At the time, Rackauckas said his use of them was appropriate.</LD>
<TE>   The charity collected $58,000--all from members who sat on its
board of directors. County records show that 71% of the
money--$41,000--went to pay attorneys who represented the members who
were questioned under oath during the attorney general's charitable
trust investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Of the remainder, $4,365 went for plaques for board members,
$1,972 for an awards banquet, $888 for commission dinners and $750
for speaker fees. Another $2,570 was spent to form the organization.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave $6,455. Expense and income statements the
foundation filed with the county for 2000 and 2001 don't indicate
whether any of those leftover funds went to charitable causes or
what, if any, funds remain.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas spokeswoman Tori Richards said the investigation left
the foundation with no choice but to hire attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal challenges to the foundation have been
well-publicized," Richards said in a statement. "All of the
attorneys' fees expended by the foundation were necessary and
appropriate in light of these challenges."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether the spending is in line with the agreement
Rackauckas reached with the attorney general's office. Lockyer
spokesman Nathan Barankin would say only that state law allows
charities to hire attorneys "to represent their interests."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one county supervisor called Tuesday for a clampdown on
the types of expenses that charities sanctioned by the county can
incur with donated funds.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said he asked Rackauckas on Tuesday to
provide the board with an accounting of "every dollar spent" by the
foundation on legal fees. Supervisor Chuck Smith said he also wants
Rackauckas to account for the charity's expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "On its face, it raises questions," said Spitzer, who said he is
reserving judgment until he reviews Rackauckas' response.</TE>
<TE>   "We're graciously allowing [him] to use public resources for
legitimate charitable causes," he said. "The money was intended to go
for charitable causes. How was $41,000 in legal fees intended to help
a charitable cause?"</TE>

<HD>County Faces Cuts Under Davis Budget</HD>
<DH>Government: Managers fear a possible loss of $26 million in
state funds. Health services for the poor would be hit the hardest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under Gov. Gray Davis' budget plan, Ventura County government would
lose $26 million in state revenue, with health and social services
for the mentally ill and poor facing the largest budget cuts,
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The reductions would come on top of a $17.6-million budget deficit
that prompted officials to begin belt-tightening months ago.</LD>
<LD>   If the final numbers are anywhere close to projections, hundreds
of county jobs would be slashed to close the gap, said County
Executive Officer Johnny Johnston.</LD>
<TE>   But Johnston cautioned that the state's budget negotiations are
just getting underway.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more draconian cuts proposed by Davis may be restored
by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is changing as we speak," Johnston told the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Budget managers have scrambled to tally the potential hit to
Ventura County since the governor released his revised budget plan
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said a weakened economy and lower tax receipts have left the
state with a $23.6-billion deficit, about one-third of the general
fund. He proposed a combination of tax increases, program reductions
and debt refinancing to close the hole. About $1.2 billion would come
in cuts to county-operated programs.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the biggest dollar loss would come in health
services for the poor. The county would lose $2 million from lower
Medi-Cal rates and more than $6 million in special funding it
receives to provide mental health services.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with cuts in administrative programs, the reductions
would leave the Health Care Agency with a $9.8-million revenue loss,
officials estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Social service programs would also see significant cuts from a 20%
reduction in state funding for administrative chores.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of an $8.9-million reduction could mean longer waits to
sign up for public aid, delays in investigating fraud against seniors
and higher caseloads for social workers, said Barbara Fitzgerald,
Human Services Agency director.</TE>
<TE>   If changes are not made, her agency may have to eliminate or scale
back some programs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care Agency chief Pierre Durand said the loss of mental
health funding could necessitate a restructuring of how those
services are delivered. But he said it is too early to make hard
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are watching carefully every step [in the Legislature]," he
said. "The loss is significant, but we hope that some will be put
back."</TE>
<TE>   Public safety programs would take a $1.8-million cut under the
Davis plan and another $6 million would come out of library funds and
general government programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature is expected to pass a final budget sometime next
month, in time for the beginning of the new fiscal year July 1. That
is when the effect on Ventura County can be better assessed, Johnston
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, however, the Board of Supervisors must begin its
own hearings on the county's $1.1-billion budget. Those hearings are
expected to begin June 17.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty at the state level will make the budget process even
more difficult, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to plan because we don't know for sure which programs
are going to be cut and which aren't," Supervisor Steve Bennett said.
"It really means you have to be preparing for the worst, but also you
have to maintain flexibility. So it's important to hold some money in
reserve because we don't know for sure where we're going to need it."</TE>

<HD>Mussina Puts Worries to Rest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least Mike Mussina had a little bit of time to prepare.</LD>
<LD>   Mussina, working on only three days' rest, gave up four hits in
62/3 innings and the New York Yankees defeated the Toronto Blue Jays,
4-1, Tuesday night at New York for their sixth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   "Finding out yesterday, I think, made it easier," Mussina said.
"If I had come in here and found out it was just three or four hours
instead of tomorrow, that would have made it tougher, I'm sure."</LD>
<TE>   Mussina (6-2) struck out five and walked three. He filled in for
left-hander David Wells, who sat out his turn because of a strained
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   With Orlando Hernandez scratched from Monday night's start and
Wells also out, Mussina volunteered for the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in and asked," Manager Joe Torre said, "and I told him
only if we scratched two starters. Of course, that is exactly what we
did."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was put on the disabled list Tuesday with an upper-back
strain.</TE>
<TE>   Although he expected "not to be as sharp" as usual, Mussina was
pleasantly surprised about how well his stuff worked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it falls into place for you and I think that's what
happened for me. I had really good off-speed stuff the last half of
the time I was in there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi and Rondell White hit solo homers for the Yankees,
giving them a major league-leading 74 in 43 games.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Boston 3--Magglio Ordonez had four hits at Boston, and
Dan Wright (5-4) pitched into the seventh inning for his second
consecutive strong outing.</TE>
<TE>   Ordonez and Frank Thomas each drove in two runs, and Paul Konerko
had three hits for Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, coming off his first career shutout Thursday against
Texas, gave up three runs and five hits in 61/3 innings. He struck
out a career-high seven.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Oliver (4-3) lost his second consecutive decision after
giving up five runs and nine hits in 41/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Texas 2--Torii Hunter homered, doubled and drove in
five runs at Minneapolis, and the Twins handed the Rangers their
fifth consecutive defeat.</TE>
<TE>   David Ortiz had four hits for the Twins, who improved to a major
league-best 17-6 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Milton (6-3), who gave up 11 runs in his last two starts,
struck out a season-high seven.</TE>
<TE>   Milton breezed through five innings before giving up a two-run
homer to Rafael Palmeiro in the sixth. Milton gave up seven hits and
two walks, and Mike Jackson pitched out of a jam in the seventh by
striking out Juan Gonzalez with two on and two out.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Cleveland 1--Mark Redman pitched the first complete
game of his career and Dmitri Young and Randall Simon hit consecutive
home runs at Detroit to give the Tigers their first five-game winning
streak in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Redman (1-5) gave up 10 hits in his 45th start. He gave up an
unearned run, struck out three and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 1, Seattle 0--Joe Kennedy (3-3) pitched a four-hitter at
Seattle for his first career shutout and Brent Abernathy hit a
run-scoring single in the top of the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners lost their third in a row, and the Devil Rays won
their third in a row for the first time since April 21-24.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Oakland 4--Chris Singleton and Gary Matthews Jr. had
run-scoring singles in the 14th inning for the Orioles at Oakland.</TE>

<HD>Hot Angels Have Win in Clutches</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anderson and Glaus get key hits in 5-1 victory
over Royals. With 20 wins in 23 games, Anaheim is only 21/2 behind
Seattle in AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garret Anderson stood flat-footed, looking at a third strike with a
runner on second base to end the first inning Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Troy Glaus' big swing and a miss to end the third was the kind
that creates dust clouds around home plate.</LD>
<LD>   Those snapshots, painful for each, were faded memories with the
game on the line in the seventh inning.</LD>
<TE>   Glaus lined a run-scoring single to left, Anderson clobbered the
next pitch into the right-field seats for a two-run homer, and those
were the moments to remember in the Angels' 5-1 victory over the
Kansas City Royals in front of 15,593 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We all believe in each other," outfielder Darin Erstad said. "We
are confident that someone will come through."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels may have been baffled through five innings by 21-year
old rookie Miguel Asencio, yet when crunch time came, it was the
Royals who got squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus and Anderson took their turns on the production line in the
seventh as the Angels broke a 1-1 tie. The reward was their 20th
victory in 23 games, which moved them within 21/2 games of
first-place Seattle in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals, American League bottom feeders, helped out with two
errors to start the seventh. But two of the Angels' most productive
players seized the day.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' long swing has left him contorted in embarrassing poises at
the plate at times. He has struck out at least 143 times in his first
three seasons and 37 times this season.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've seen this season from Troy is that he understands using
the whole field," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He may take a chance
with two outs and nobody on if he's looking for a particular pitch.
But with runners in scoring position, he is very comfortable with
using the whole field."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus found his comfort zone in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   An error by Royal third baseman Jose Randa put Jose Nieves on to
start the inning. Adam Kennedy bunted and catcher A.J. Hinch threw
the ball into center field, putting runners on first and second.
Erstad sacrificed, bringing Glaus to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   He lined a single to left to give the Angels a 2-1 lead. It gave
Glaus 41 runs batted in, second most in the league. That brought up
Anderson, hitting .172 in his last six games</TE>
<TE>   "Garret has been hitting a lot of balls well the last few games,"
Scioscia said. "He knows he doesn't have to press. He doesn't have to
carry this team."</TE>
<TE>   He did pick them up Tuesday, launching his seventh home run of the
season, which finally put a stake in the pesky Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Asencio had not pitched more than three innings in nine relief
appearances this season and had a 10.13 earned-run average before the
game. Neither of those things mattered, as he was sharp in his first
major league start. He did not give up a hit until Kennedy lined a
single into center field with two outs in the fifth. That brought
home Scott Spiezio, who had walked and taken second on a groundout.</TE>
<TE>   For four innings, the Angels were kids in class, being schooled by
Asencio, who mixed a mid-90s fastball with a wicked off-speed pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just trying to get some kind of read on him," Erstad
said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Aaron Sele, on the other hand, wobbled through 62/3
innings. He gave up eight hits and walked three batters but gave up
only one run.</TE>
<TE>   "I made the pitches when I had to," Sele said. "The guys played
great defense behind me."</TE>
<TE>   Sele was also bailed out by the Royals' aggressive baserunning.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, the Royals had runners on first and third, but
Carlos Beltran's hit-and-run grounder struck teammate Carlos Febles.
Instead of a run scoring, Febles was ruled out. Sele walked Mike
Sweeney to load the bases, then escaped when Randa lined out to
center.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals tried a hit-and-run again in the fifth and Sweeney
lined a pitch toward center field. But Kennedy broke to cover second
base and was in position to make the catch.</TE>
<TE>   Sele helped the Royals score in the second, his wild pitch
advancing two runners and setting up an RBI groundout by Raul Ibanez.</TE>

<HD>Injury Forces Eckstein to Sit</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel shortstop David Eckstein was a scratch Tuesday because of a
strained left knee that he suffered in Monday's 6-3 victory over the
Kansas City Royals. He was injured trying to avoid a tag at first
base in the fourth inning.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a stupid mistake," Eckstein said. "It feels OK. I mean I
played on it last night.</LD>
<LD>   "This is just precautionary. There was just a little swelling."</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Eckstein's knee was placed in a brace after being
examined by trainer Ned Bergert on Tuesday. He was to be examined by
Dr. Lewis Yocum during the game.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein has been the Angels' catalyst as the leadoff batter. He
is batting .275 and is second on the team with 33 runs scored. He
singled to start a three-run first inning Monday, was hit by a pitch
in the second and scored when Darin Erstad followed with a triple.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth, he had grounded to second baseman Carlos Febles,
whose throw was wild. Eckstein tried to duck under a tag of first
baseman Mike Sweeney and hit the bag awkwardly.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia downplayed the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he could have played tonight," Scioscia said. "But we
decided it would be better to give him a day of rest."</TE>
<TE>   But a moment later, Scioscia contradicted himself.</TE>
<TE>   "For him to not being in the lineup, it has to be something,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point: Eckstein fouled a pitch into his face against
Chicago on Friday, yet stayed in the game. He played in 153 of 162
games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "This [injury] isn't too bad," Eckstein said. "It was a little
stiff when I woke up this morning, but it loosened up as I walked
around. I got to the ballpark and expected to play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Eckstein out, Jose Nieves started at shortstop and second
baseman Adam Kennedy was moved into the leadoff spot Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time in his Angel career that the
free-swinging Kennedy was at the top of the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I had a hit the other time," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said he would change his approach some and take a few more
pitches, especially in his first at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels faced Miguel Asencio, who was making his first major
league start.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys will want to see what his delivery is like, how his
pitches move, so I'll take a few," Kennedy said, then smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Or I'll just hit the first pitch and [tick] off [No. 2 batter]
Darin."</TE>
<TE>   In his first at-bat, Kennedy worked the count to 2-2 before
popping up to shortstop Neifi Perez.</TE>

Angels are 15-3 in May and with eight games left could eclipse the
best May in club history. They went 18-7 during May in 1989. The best
month in club history was June 1998, when the Angels went 22-6.</TE>

<HD>Esparza Helps San Pedro Make It Three in a Row</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sophomore Ashley Esparza can pitch and hit, and on Tuesday in the
City Section softball championship game at UCLA, she showed she can
run, too.</LD>
<LD>   Esparza doubled and later scored on a wild pitch in the sixth
inning and pitched a two-hitter to give top-seeded San Pedro a 1-0
victory and its third consecutive City title over second-seeded
Carson, the Pirates' Marine League rival.</LD>
<LD>   It's the seventh title in 11 years and 10th overall for San Pedro
(26-2). Carson (24-6), in the finals for the fourth year in a row, is
still looking for its first.</LD>
<TE>   Carson's Arlene Alvarado had the only two hits off Esparza (21-2),
who led off the sixth with a double. She took third on a wild pitch
and, with two out, Carson's Danira Iolamo (14-4) pitched around
Stephanie Spychaj instead of intentionally walking her. Iolamo threw
a wild pitch on ball four to score Esparza.</TE>
<TE>   The run held up--barely. Carson had runners at third base three
times in the last four innings, with one out in the fourth, none out
in the fifth and two out in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Esparza got one of her six strikeouts, then a pop-up and grounder
in the fifth, and a strikeout in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The game was truly won in the fourth after three errors loaded the
bases, but senior first baseman Marissa Gonzalez made a back-handed
stab on a grounder headed toward right field. "Two runs, for sure,"
Pirate Coach Tony Dobra said. "It's [a play] we've got to make to be
a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Reseda Cleveland (12-11) beat Marshall (16-8), 5-0, in the
Invitational final.</TE>

<HD>Another Title for Leach, USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Leach didn't think he would last long enough to win another
national championship. On Tuesday, his USC Trojans gave him the
ultimate going-away gift.</LD>
<LD>   Led by another outstanding performance by freshman Prakash
Amritraj, USC won its 16th NCAA team title and first since 1994 with
a 4-1 upset of top-ranked and defending champion Georgia at the Texas
A&amp;M Tennis Center in College Station.</LD>
<LD>   Leach announced his retirement April 23 after 23 seasons as coach.
It became a motivating force for the Trojans, who defeated top-five
teams Baylor, Illinois and Tennessee to get to Tuesday's final.</LD>
<TE>   "Is this a dream or what?" Leach said. "I didn't think we'd even
have a chance. I was just happy to win one match."</TE>
<TE>   Amritraj, the son of former tennis pro Vijay Amritraj, clinched
the Trojans' victory for the third consecutive day. At the No. 3
singles position, he took the first set from Georgia's Bo Hodge and
rallied from a 5-3 deficit to win his match, 7-6 (3), 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest key from the start of the match was that I took it
one point at a time," Amritraj said. "My serve and volley game has
really been good, especially with these slow courts."</TE>
<TE>   Amritraj clinched the Trojans' victories over Illinois and
Tennessee with three-set victories over higher-ranked opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans (25-5), seeded 11th in the 64-team tournament, also
got singles victories from Daniel Langre and Ruben Torres at the Nos.
5-6 spots. Ryan Moore was leading his match at No. 2 when Amritraj
clinched.</TE>
<TE>   But it was surprising play in doubles that gave USC the initial
lead. The Trojans lost the doubles point in their last two matches
but won it against Georgia, getting victories from the pairings of
Amritraj and Langre and Teige Sullivan and Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (28-4) had won all 26 of its matches in which it won the
doubles point.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see the six guys on the other side," Amritraj said.
"Their shoulders slumped about four inches."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chad Cordero struck out the side in the ninth inning as No. 17 Cal
State Fullerton defeated UCLA, 7-6, in a makeup of an April 23 game
that the Bruins had successfully protested.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton had won the original game, 9-7, but UCLA protested the
Titans had batted out of order in the ninth inning.</TE>

<HD>Brewer 8-Ball Sinks Dodgers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>From the time their teams break camp in March to the time they clinch
a playoff spot or are eliminated from contention in August or
September, the same mantra is repeated in managers' offices
throughout the country: "Play for today. Don't worry about tomorrow."</LD>
<LD>   Had Jim Tracy heeded that advice, perhaps the Dodgers wouldn't
have been shell-shocked Tuesday night, when they blew a five-run lead
by allowing the worst team in baseball to score eight runs in the
seventh inning, as the Milwaukee Brewers scored a stunning 8-6
victory before 15,209 in Miller Park.</LD>
<LD>   Pinch-hitter Tyler Houston and left fielder Geoff Jenkins hit
three-run home runs off Dodger reliever Giovanni Carrara in the
seventh, obliterating a Dodger lead that was built on the strength of
struggling right fielder Shawn Green's two-homer game and sustained
by ace right-hander Kevin Brown's strong start.</LD>
<TE>   Houston and Jenkins both bat from the left side, and Carrara is
right-handed. Tracy, the Dodger manager, had one of baseball's most
effective left-handers in the bullpen in Omar Daal, who is 4-0 with a
1.03 earned-run average and has held opponents to a .127 average.</TE>
<TE>   But Daal didn't even begin warming up until Jenkins'
rally-capping, 430-foot bomb, his eighth career homer against the
Dodgers, landed in the upper deck in right field. The reason: Tracy
thought he might need Daal to pitch in long relief of struggling
right-hander Hideo Nomo today or injured left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "When you really think about it, I'm sitting here and kicking
myself for the fact that I didn't use [Daal] today," Tracy said. "
... When something like this comes up, it's very easy to second-guess
it. It didn't work out today."</TE>
<TE>   Victory seemed all but certain for the Dodgers after Green ripped
a 420-foot homer to right-center field in the third inning, ending a
string of 91 at-bats without a home run, Dave Roberts homered in the
fourth and Green homered again in the seventh for a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown appeared to tire in the seventh, giving up Jenkins'
leadoff double, Mark Loretta's bloop single, Luis Lopez's RBI
fielder's choice, which cut the lead to 5-1, and walking Paul Bako
with his 106th pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Houston was announced as a pinch-hitter, and Tracy summoned
Carrara, who entered with a 2.17 ERA in 20 appearances. Houston sent
a 1-0 pitch over the wall in right, trimming the Dodger lead to 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Sanchez flied to right, but former Dodger Eric Young drew a
walk. Jeffrey Hammonds lined a double to the gap in left-center, the
ball nicking off lunging outfielder Brian Jordan's glove, to score
Young for a 5-5 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup batter Richie Sexson, after fouling a ball into the upper
deck, drew a walk. Up stepped Jenkins, who has one hit in six career
at-bats against Daal, and still, Tracy stuck with Carrara.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Paul Quantrill was also an option, but Tracy thought
Carrara's cut fastballs, which are supposed to break onto the hands
of left-handed hitters, would be more effective against the low-ball
hitting Jenkins than Quantrill's sinking fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   But Carrara's next cutter didn't cut it. Jenkins smashed Carrara's
first pitch far over the wall in right for an 8-5 lead, capping the
Brewers' biggest inning of the season. It was also the most runs the
Dodgers have given up in an inning since the Cubs put up a pair of
eight-spots in the seventh and eighth innings of a 20-1 victory over
the Dodgers on May 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those days, when everything I threw up there, they
hit," Carrara said. "I didn't get tired. My arm felt great."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan homered in the eighth, trimming Milwaukee's lead to 8-6,
and the Dodgers put two on with one out in the ninth, but Paul Lo
Duca bounced into a game-ending, 5-4-3 double play.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't find a much harder game to lose than that," Green said.
"The last thought in your mind is that the win was in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The next thought in Dodger minds is tonight's game against the
Brewers, which takes on added significance.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see what we're made of [tonight]," Lo Duca said. "We need
to bounce back. I know it's early in the season, but we need to play
well [tonight], because these are the kinds of games that can send
you into a tailspin."</TE>

<HD>Tracy Trying to Take Pressure Off Izturis</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Third baseman Adrian Beltre's move from the seventh to second spot in
the order, and shortstop Cesar Izturis' demotion from second to
eighth, may be permanent, indicating a slight shift away from the
little-ball approach Manager Jim Tracy emphasized the first month and
a half of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The speedy Izturis energized the top of the order when he hit .280
in April, and he did a good job as a situational hitter, advancing
runners from second to third with grounders to the right side and
dropping six sacrifice bunts. But the 22-year-old is batting .206 (14
for 68) in May and is four for 27 in his last seven games.</LD>
<LD>   After suffering consecutive shutouts to the New York Mets last
week, Tracy benched Izturis for a game and moved Beltre to the second
spot. The Dodgers won three of their next four games with Beltre
batting second.</LD>
<TE>   When the Dodgers broke camp, they believed the slick-fielding
Izturis wouldn't be overwhelmed by the mental rigors of batting
second or leadoff, but Tracy said Tuesday that dropping him in the
order should alleviate some of the pressure he might be feeling.
Izturis, a switch-hitter, will still lead off against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not lose sight of the fact that this is a 22-year-old
shortstop, and we don't want him to overly worry about the offensive
part of the game," Tracy said. "He has a chance to be an exceptional
major league player, but this way we can bring him along accordingly,
just let him be a guy, let him contribute without force-feeding him
too much. ... What he does in the two hole, he can also do in the
eight hole."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre is hardly a prototypical No. 2 batter, though. He's more of
a free swinger who has a grand total of 12 sacrifice bunts in 3,281
professional at-bats, including one in 1,395 minor league at-bats.
Izturis has half that many this season.</TE>
<TE>   Though Beltre, who is batting .266, has stroked several
opposite-field hits, he failed to advance Dave Roberts from second in
the first inning Tuesday night, grounding out to shortstop.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Tracy said Nomo's rotation spot is secure from now, but if
the right-hander continues to struggle with his control, he will be
in danger of being replaced by Omar Daal. Nomo ranks third in the
National League with 34 walks, including 14 in his last three games,
but perhaps the impatient Brewers will help--they rank 13th in the
league in walks.</TE>

<HD>Barton Stays on the Path to Success</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Kicked off the team at Ocean View last season,
junior first baseman leads Marina into the Division II quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daric Barton was on the express route to stardom in April 2001 when a
phone call temporarily derailed his prospects.</LD>
<LD>   On the other end of the line was Steve Barrett, Barton's baseball
coach at Huntington Beach Ocean View High, and the news wasn't good.
The Seahawks were getting set to leave for a tournament in San Luis
Obispo, but Barton's presence wasn't requested.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, and one other thing. When the team returned, Barton would need
to turn in his uniform.</LD>
<TE>   The sophomore standout was dumbfounded. All he could figure was
that he was being punished for not giving his best effort during
summer ball, though Barrett had never mentioned anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bumming," Barton recalled earlier this week. "He said I was
uncoachable."</TE>
<TE>   Barrett declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding
Barton's departure from Ocean View, but the coach and player said
they have settled their differences since Barton transferred to
Huntington Beach Marina before this school year.</TE>
<TE>   Things may have turned out for the best. As a junior first
baseman, Barton has spearheaded Marina's transformation from Sunset
League doormat to playoff quarterfinalist.</TE>
<TE>   He is batting .473 with seven home runs and 22 runs batted in--all
team bests--even though he has drawn 24 walks.</TE>
<TE>   "He might be the best high school hitter in Orange County--a
left-hander who has a real compact swing with great bat speed,"
Barrett said. "He can really play."</TE>
<TE>   In the first round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs,
Barton stepped to the plate in the fourth inning with Marina trailing
La Verne Damien, 1-0, and crushed a home run that sparked a five-run
inning in an eventual 9-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't try for home runs; I try for line drives up the middle,"
Barton said. "[Against Damien] I tried to put the ball in play and,
luckily, it went over the fence."</TE>
<TE>   Barton impressed with his glove Tuesday in Marina's second-round
victory over fourth-seeded Santa Ana Foothill, turning a game-ending
double play that allowed pitcher Wes Etheridge to escape a two-on,
one-out jam. The host Vikings made four double plays in the 3-1
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way he's played for us all season," Marina Coach Paul
Renfrow said of Barton.</TE>
<TE>   Marina (20-10) will play Santa Barbara at home Friday in a
quarterfinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Success is nothing new for Barton, a 5-foot-11, 195-pounder.
Growing up, he traveled the country with youth coach Mark Ward
playing in numerous World Series. Ward, who is also Marina's
third-base coach, said he always made sure Barton was the team
captain because "kids really respect him. He's a good young man."</TE>
<TE>   Barton's only perceptible weakness is his tendency to slack off
during practice, which may have contributed to his situation at Ocean
View. Barton conceded his work ethic is a concern he's trying to
address as he prepares for the next level.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take it 120% during practice, but during the games I just
try to turn it on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No one can question Barton's heart once the first pitch is thrown.
He almost had to be physically dragged out of a game Marina
desperately needed to win during the last week of the regular season
after rolling his left ankle going back to first base on a pick-off
play.</TE>
<TE>   With his ankle still bothering him, Barton returned to the lineup
the next day and drew a couple of key walks as Marina defeated Los
Alamitos and Huntington Beach Edison in a two-game playoff for the
league's third-place entry.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings, who are making their first playoff appearance since
1997, needed to win their last four regular-season games just to have
a chance at the postseason. Barton's big bat was a primary reason
Marina will be able to consider the season a success.</TE>
<TE>   Said Renfrow: "He's just a constant factor."</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: Daric Barton isn't sure why he was no longer welcome
at Ocean View last year, but Marina is glad to have him and his
team-best .473 batting average.</CP>

<LD>Primarily a sprinter, Theresa's Pleasure had a significant route
victory while racing for owner Lester Smith and trainer Bob Baffert.
The daughter of Greenwood Star won the inaugural California Cup
Juvenile in 1990 at Santa Anita, running as the 13-10 favorite under
jockey Julio Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   Today at Hollywood Park, one of Theresa's Pleasure's daughters
will try to emulate her and, at the same time, do something her
mother never did.</LD>
<LD>   Unbeaten on dirt in two starts at six and seven furlongs,
Theresa's Year, whose father is Half a Year, will stretch out to
11/16 miles on the turf, a surface on which Theresa's Pleasure never
won.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Rafael Becerra, Theresa's Year won her debut at Santa
Anita on March 23, beating a field of California-bred maidens by 11/2
lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to run an additional eighth of a mile on April 28, she won
the $70,000 Lakeview Farm, one of 10 events on the California Gold
Rush card, by two lengths as the 3-1 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa's Year is expected to have nine opponents today in the
$51,000 optional claimer and will try to lead every step of the way
under jockey Tyler Baze.</TE>
<TE>   If she can't stay the distance, likely beneficiaries include Davis
Eyes, La Chapelle and Happy Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth, a $48,000 allowance at six furlongs,
drew a full field of 12 at Hollywood Park. Bear Fan was impressive
winning at first asking for trainer and co-owner Wesley Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. He is on top of the Hollywood Park
standings after four weeks with 22 victories, three more than Victor
Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Mike Mitchell. The trainer has begun Hollywood Park 0
for 16.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Standard Choice in the
first, using Kimora, Bright Sunday, Potrithreat and My Sweet Lucy in
the second, and Swiss Count, Bartending Mike and Give Away Joe in the
third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/49. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.60/$275.20. Total money bet: $346.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Stojakovic, Turkoglu Strive to Contribute</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>On one of the two practice courts inside the Kings' training facility
Tuesday, Peja Stojakovic jogged gingerly on his sprained right ankle.
On the other, Hedo Turkoglu worked out the kinks in his wonky jump
shot.</LD>
<LD>   While most of the Kings took a well-deserved rest after defeating
the Lakers in Game 2 on Monday, those two key players were hard at
work, hoping to find a way to help their team by the time Game 3
begins Friday at Staples Center. Turkoglu has been filling in for the
injured Stojakovic at small forward.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by the way he was moving, it could be a while longer
before Stojakovic is fit to play. Judging by the way the ball was
clanging off the rim, it could be a while before Turkoglu's shot is
sound.</LD>
<TE>   "He can't run at all," Coach Rick Adelman said of Stojakovic,
injured in Game 3 of the Kings' conference semifinal series against
the Dallas Mavericks. "When you see him moving freely, then he'll be
ready to play. He has gotten better the last two or three days. It
was good to see him out there doing the little he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Adelman could have said the same of Turkoglu, who has shot four
for 16 in the series (25%) and 29 for 83 in the playoffs (34.9%).</TE>
<TE>   What he did say was, "What would really help Hedo is if we have
better ball movement. If we could attack better, it would get him
more scoring opportunities. We told him, 'Don't worry about your
shots. Just play the game.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson, an energetic reserve guard, has given the Kings a
boost in each game against the Lakers. He had 21 points in 25 minutes
in Game 1 and 17 points in 23 minutes in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Give Bobby tremendous credit," Adelman said. "If he hadn't done
what he's done, we wouldn't have gotten through the Dallas series and
we wouldn't be tied, 1-1, against the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 1, Jackson's size presents matchup problems for the
Kings because he cannot guard Kobe Bryant or Rick Fox. It's also
difficult for Adelman to play Jackson and 6-1 Mike Bibby at the same
time for the same reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they're looking at a way to attack those two guys when
they're on the floor together," Adelman said of the Lakers.
"Sometimes it is difficult [to have Jackson and Bibby in the game at
the same time]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelman frowned and furrowed his brow when told Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal said after Game 2, "In order to beat us, you have to
beat us fair and square. There's only one way to beat us and it
starts with a 'C' and ends with a 'T'"</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else who heard or read O'Neal's comments, Adelman
believed O'Neal was saying the Kings had cheated by holding him and
flopping to the court at the first hint of contact.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around Shaq a little bit and I get the idea he says
things like that so people will write about it," Adelman said. "He
says, 'This will be good copy for three days.' If he's going to talk
about sending tapes to the league, saying the refs favored us in some
way, then there are tapes I can send in too."</TE>

<HD>Jackson: Bryant Back on His Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant received three liters of intravenous fluid before
Monday's Game 2 and looked drained at times, but he was full of
energy and encouragement on the Lakers' flight back to Los Angeles
after the game.</LD>
<LD>   "He was better than OK," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said about
Bryant, who suffered a bad case of food poisoning in Sacramento. "He
was actually kind of upbeat after the game.... He was supporting his
teammates, telling them not to get their heads down."</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, who scored 30 points in 44 minutes in Game 1, played 40
minutes Monday and finished with 22 points. But he clearly wasn't the
same player, missing 12 of 21 field-goal attempts and looking a step
slow on defense.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant is expected to be back at full strength for Friday's Game
3, which Jackson said will demand a better effort from the entire
team.</TE>
<TE>   "You still want to play a game where our efforts are worthy of the
importance of the game," said Jackson, who was disappointed with his
team's overall play Monday. "That's where we felt that we failed each
other. We didn't keep the ball moving and our offense flowing. There
was some inconsistency with players not really knowing or feeling how
they should play</TE>
<TE>   "We're not supporting each other with the same kind of intensity
on defense.... I don't like that [foul trouble] made everybody
hesitant when they came out to play in the third quarter. We weren't
the same when we had three starters with three fouls at the beginning
of the [second] half."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Jackson talks about Sacramento center Vlade Divac, a sly
smile takes over his face. Instead of being irate about Divac's
flopping ability, which consistently draws charging fouls on Laker
center Shaquille O'Neal, Jackson gave Divac some credit. Well, sort
of.</TE>
<TE>   "Vlade finds a way to do his antics at the right time to create
the right situation and even then, he doesn't get every call,"
Jackson said. "Vlade is very clever and one of the most intelligent
players in the game. But even so, Shaq has a lot of fun playing
against him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Laker who needs to find his shooting touch is point guard
Derek Fisher. In 10 playoff games, Fisher is shooting 32.6% from the
field and has made only two of 10 three-point attempts against the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "The only message I have for Fisher is that he has to get the
shots out of the offense," Jackson said. "He has to let them come to
him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers get offensive production from their second-line
players, headed by Devean George, Samaki Walker and Lindsey Hunter,
they are dangerous. But in Games 1 and 2, the three players have made
only nine of 27 field-goal attempts for 23 combined points.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Is Now Officially Upset</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Coach didn't like the way Game 2 was refereed. He
says O'Neal was taken out of his game by fouls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After he gave the Lakers a day off, Coach Phil Jackson took center
stage Tuesday and didn't disappoint.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes after watching tape of Sacramento's 96-90 Game 2 victory,
which tied the Western Conference finals at 1-1, Jackson immediately
questioned how the series is being officiated.</LD>
<LD>   "It was pretty obvious that Sacramento came out the aggressor, but
I don't know if that type of aggressiveness should be rewarded,"
Jackson said Tuesday at the Lakers' HealthSouth training facility in
El Segundo. "[Chris] Webber flailing around with his arms, hitting
guys in the face and head, is not right."</LD>
<TE>   Bernie Fryer, Joe DeRosa and Eddie F. Rush officiated Monday's
game, and even though Jackson didn't exactly say they were
responsible for the Lakers' first road playoff defeat in almost two
years, he came close.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give some latitude to referees being in an
environment like [Sacramento's Arco Arena]," Jackson said with a
mixture of sincerity and sarcasm. "There is always a question as to
what type of a group [of officials] that you send to a situation like
Sacramento, where it is a bandbox with intense pressures. I'm sure
we're going to see a stronger crew in L.A. where the noise and
pressure in our building is so much more intense than Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   After Game 2, many of the Lakers claimed that they were taken out
of their game because of the early fouls they were assessed.
Sacramento attempted 23 free throws in the first half compared with
five by the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   No one was more vocal than center Shaquille O'Neal, who finished
with 35 points and 12 rebounds despite playing most of the game in
foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a player on his way to a 50-point game, which he is very
capable of getting [based on] years against Sacramento," Jackson said
about O'Neal, who had 23 points and three fouls in the first half
Monday. "He was completely taken out of his game in the process of
making foul calls. We've talked about [picking up questionable
fouls], and he knows that it's going to happen and likely to happen
up there."</TE>
<TE>   What bothers Jackson is the perceived double standard for O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had five fouls called on us against Webber [in Game 2], who
was just posting up," Jackson said. "Shaq doesn't even get those
calls. What the league sends out as trailers on what they say will be
called in the playoffs are not even called against Shaq. The rules
get changed or requalified because of [Shaq]'s size, but that's no
excuse."</TE>
<TE>   But instead of making a video to point out the disparity, as some
NBA coaches have done, Jackson tries to get the Laker center to
understand that it's all part of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go in the video room with Shaq, I tell him, 'They are
going to call the game differently because of you and you're going to
have to withstand it. Take it and stand above it,'" Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the game in which Jackson wants to see improvement
when the Lakers will return to practice today is three-point
shooting. Los Angeles made only three of 19 attempts from behind the
arc in Game 2, but the misses don't upset the Laker coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-point shooting comes and goes. That's pretty natural,"
Jackson said. "I tell them that they cannot live by this shot. You
have to shoot it out of rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers launched three consecutive three-point attempts
on three trips down the court in the first quarter, Jackson called a
timeout and told his players that they could not win that way. But
his team kept shooting from long range until the Laker coaching staff
firmly told them at the start of the fourth quarter to back off.</TE>
<TE>   "Our three-point shooting was pathetic," Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>Celtics Bring Their 'D' Game</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Boston turns up its defensive tenacity and
defeats New Jersey, 93-86, to even series at a game apiece.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>All those free lanes, open layups, gone.</LD>
<LD>   All the movement, the cuts and screens, stopped with a thud, a
thump, a bash and crash.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Celtics decided to play defense Tuesday night at
Continental Airlines Arena. The Celtics became bullies, acted as if
they'd spent Monday lifting tonnage and eating spinach to get big,
strong and mean. These bullies, with their chests puffed out and
their elbows swinging, beat the New Jersey Nets, 93-86, to tie the
best-of-seven NBA Eastern Conference finals, 1-1. Game 3 is Saturday
at Boston's Fleet Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Celtics won even though shooting stars Paul Pierce and Antoine
Walker combined to go 14 of 52, even though this team that thrives on
the three-point shot was six of 23 from that range. The Celtics won
because, as Net Coach Byron Scott said, "They just seemed to want it
a little more than we did. They got more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics won because, after getting outrebounded by 11 in Game
1, they outrebounded the Nets, 60-50. The Celtics won because every
time the Nets got close, a Tony Battie or an Eric Williams or Walker
or Pierce refused to let the Nets make that one key basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics won because they kept the Nets from scoring for 16
consecutive possessions in the third quarter, because they kept the
Nets from making a field goal for 8:24, because they had an 18-1 run
that turned a one-point lead into an 18-point bulge. In that quarter,
they ran harder for every ball, fought harder for every rebound and
made every shot for New Jersey more difficult than the Nets could
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always a body where we wanted to go, always a hand in
our face," Net guard Jason Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd was the only Net who didn't need to re-examine his game. Kidd
had 23 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists for his second consecutive
triple-double, becoming the first player to do that in the playoffs
since the Lakers' Magic Johnson in 1984. But this is not a one-man
game.</TE>
<TE>   Where seven Nets scored in double figures Sunday, only one other
starter besides Kidd--Kenyon Martin (22 points)--and two
reserves--Aaron Williams (16) and Lucious Harris (11)--had double
digits on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It was his final assist, the one which gave Kidd his
triple-double, that was most spectacular and almost game-changing.</TE>
<TE>   On an inbounds play, Keith Van Horn got a finger on a Pierce pass.
Kidd stole the misdirected ball and made an eye-crossing
behind-the-back-pass to Van Horn, who scored a layup with 1:26 left.
It made the score, 88-83, in favor of Boston and brought the crowd to
its feet for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   But after stopping Boston on offense, the Nets' Williams and Kidd
missed. Celtic guard Kenny Anderson then took a curious, unnecessary
and off-balance jump shot that missed badly, but Kerry Kittles
clanked an open three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   And that was it.</TE>
<TE>   That final blooper left Kittles two of 11 from the field. Van Horn
was two of 12 and center Todd MacCulloch, who had 14 points Sunday,
was held without a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Celtics went and made it a perimeter-type game," Kidd said.
"They made us kick it out. They did their job, they got a game, now
they have home court. They beat us to every loose ball, they were
more aggressive than we were. It's pretty simple. That's why they won
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Walker finished with 26 points and 11 rebounds, although he took
32 shots to get those points.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a pretty game," Walker said. "Paul and I don't want to
make this a habit. But we can win ugly like this.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a coach [Jim O'Brien] who basically gives [Pierce] and I
the green light. Obviously we want to take good shots, but when
things aren't going well for us, we still are allowed to be
aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Said the Celtics' Anderson: "We played defense. That's our
statement. Defense. And now it's a series, isn't it?"</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO AT LAKERS Game 3: Friday, 6 p.m.,
Channel 4</KH>
<HD>New World Order</HD>
<DH>Once considered out of place in the NBA, international
players have moved into starring roles ... and more are on the way</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>No one calls them "foreigners" anymore. These days, they call them
Mr. Foreigner, as in "Buenos dias, Senor Gasol" and "Guten tag, Herr
Nowitzki."</LD>
<LD>   Or in their new language, NBA-speak, "Yo, Dirk, 'sup?" (Hello,
Dirk, how are you?)</LD>
<LD>   Not that it takes the new guys long to catch up in this day of the
Euro-dude, when hoopers keep disembarking at the international
terminal and unseating the locals in such burgs as Memphis, home of
the precocious Spanish 7-footer, Pau Gasol ... or San Antonio, home
of the phenomenal 19-year-old French point guard, Tony Parker ... or
Dallas, where the Mavericks have their own UN with a German (Dirk
Nowitzki), a Canadian (Steve Nash), a Chinese (Wang Zhi Zhi), a
Mexican (Eduardo Najera) and a Frenchman (Tariq Abdul-Wahad).</LD>
<TE>   Now, they're streaming in from Asia too. China has sent two big
centers, Dallas' Wang, a 7-footer, and Denver's 6-11, 290-pound Menk
Bateer, with the biggest, 7-5, 296-pound Yao Ming, slated to go at
the top of this spring's draft.</TE>
<TE>   The impact has been felt everywhere, as in this new hotbed of
Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean culture, Sacramento, where the Kings
have two Serbs and a Turk in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Once Americans considered foreign players geeks, sat them on
benches, targeted them ("Whenever one got in, it became a one-on-one
fest," says Dallas assistant coach Donnie Nelson) and, when the
players went home, said they were soft and didn't have it.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the foreign players arrive playing, and doing everything
else, like Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Kings' Predrag "Peja" Stojakovic, 25 and already an
All-Star, a well-known man about Sacramento who goes out to warm up
before games wearing his diamond earring.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's their hip-hop Turk, 23-year-old Hidayet "Hedo"
Turkoglu, who likes rap, has blond highlights in his hair and, while
undergoing surgery on his majestic nose last summer, had them trim it
down, Western style.</TE>
<TE>   This has been an education for the Kings' elder Serb, 34-year-old
Vlade Divac, one of the movement's godfathers, who arrived in a
different era, knowing no English, much less rap lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the NBA, as far as Europeans or international players,
they respect them now," Divac says. "I didn't have any respect from
anybody. I had to earn my way."</TE>
<TE>   Divac had to learn the game all over. Now, NBA executives, beating
the back roads of countries they hadn't heard of three years earlier,
consider the European leagues higher level than the NCAA, which is
why the Euro-dudes adjust so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest reason is, they've been playing pro ball," says
Indiana President Donnie Walsh. "Peja Stojakovic was playing pro
since he was 14. I worked out Stojakovic and he was a great player
when he was 18.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand, these kids are playing at the level
that's next to the NBA. It's a lot better than college. I don't mean
just a little, it's a lot better than college."</TE>
<TE>   Divac's generation, which included the high-strung Drazen
Petrovic, the gifted and massive Arvydas Sabonis, and the hard-nosed
Sarunas Marciulionis, is now fondly remembered as the first wave.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, one of the first overseas scouts, who got Marciulionis out
of the crumbling Soviet empire in 1989, and, 10 years later,
convinced his father, Don, to bet the Mavericks' house on Nowitzki,
calls the '80s and early '90s "the Jackie Robinson years."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign players were less like stars then, more like greenhorns,
getting their names changed by immigration officers on Ellis Island,
bull's-eye-wearing strangers in a strange land, calling one another
long distance daily out of frustration and loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there's not enough skepticism left to fill a thimble.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol was recently named rookie of the year, joined by Parker and
Utah's Russian forward, Andrei Kirilenko, on the all-rookie first
team. Yao may be joined in the lottery by Nickoloz Tskitishvili, a
19-year-old 7-foot Georgian who's supposed to be the next Gasol, and
Nene Hilario, a 6-10 Brazilian.</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, the world is round now. If you're tall enough and
good enough, it doesn't matter if you're in Paris, Lagos or Beijing,
the NBA is watching you.</TE>
<TE>   Give Us Your Tired,Poor and Especially Tall</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, a Soviet Union team, gearing up for the '84 Olympics,
toured the U.S., going 7-1 against colleges, losing only to Ralph
Sampson's Virginia team, opening eyes with a front line of three
7-footers, one the 18-year-old Sabonis.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Soviets wound up boycotting the '84 Games, that was
the last we saw of Sabonis, until he re-emerged in Seoul in 1988,
having torn his Achilles' tendon twice, without his old mobility but
with enough left to lead the Soviets to their upset of the last
college team the Americans sent.</TE>
<TE>   Sabonis was called a foreign Bill Walton, and Marciulionis, an
All-American-caliber player.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later at Barcelona, the original Dream Team represented
the U.S., with its walking pantheon of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson
and Larry Bird, hyping the already burgeoning growth of the game in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   And the hunt was on.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Phoenix drafted Georgu Glouchkov, a Bulgarian power
forward, in the seventh round. He impressed the Suns with his
appetite for fast food and was soon back home.</TE>
<TE>   In '86, Portland drafted Sabonis in the first round, although it
would be nine more years before the Trail Blazers would get him.</TE>
<TE>   Having noticed the treasure trove of European big men, 17 NBA
teams sent scouts to the 1988 European pre-Olympic tournament in
Rotterdam, compared to the zero who'd gone to the event in Paris in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   The supposed big noise was Stojko Vrankovic, a 7-2 Yugoslav, who'd
signed with the Boston Celtics and gone nowhere. But the new kid on
the block was the Yugos' young center, Divac, who would be a No. 1
pick the following spring.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, as part of perestroika, the Soviets dropped the bar on
letting their athletes play in the U.S. Donnie Nelson, working for
his father with the Golden State Warriors, flew to Moscow to sign
Marciulionis. No one was sure if it was real or propaganda, but at a
news conference arranged by the sympathetic chess master, Garry
Kasparov, Marciulionis and hockey star Viacheslav Fetisov announced
they'd go.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience was the new free press," Nelson says. "Kasparov made
this little speech, 'We're taking Gorbachev at his word.' Then for
three minutes, there was dead silence. It seemed like three days.</TE>
<TE>   "There were three guys sitting in the front row in military garb.
The first guy stands up, I hear the translation through my earpiece.
He says, 'What are you guys doing? You'll be locked up!'</TE>
<TE>   "The second guy stands up, says the same thing, 'You're selfish
athletes, you're not true Communists.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting to sweat. I was wondering if we were going to be
carted away.... Now the thing is over and we're walking out. But the
athletes are lagging behind. They're afraid to go out on the street.
They're afraid they might be made an example of.</TE>
<TE>   "Before we started, [Kasparov] said, 'By the end of the day,
you'll either be the wealthiest people in Russia or you'll be on your
way to Siberia.'"</TE>
<TE>   Compared to that, what terrors did the NBA hold in store?</TE>
<TE>   Marciulionis played seven seasons and was once runner-up for sixth
man of the year. Sabonis was one of the better centers, even old,
hulking and immobile as he was. Divac became an All-Star in his 12th
season and is now in his 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Petrovic, the most emotional and driven of the
first wave.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Drazen carried the biggest cross of anybody, of all the
guys who came over in the first wave," Nelson says. "Talk about
hunger; talk about wanting to prove their worth.</TE>
<TE>   "He started in Portland and there wasn't a fit. They had Clyde
[Drexler], Terry [Porter], Danny [Ainge]. Then he got traded to New
Jersey and whenever you're traded, you've got to start from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were very emotional years for all the guys. You've got the
responsibility for an entire continent on your back....</TE>
<TE>   "There was some hazing. Everybody has his own story. They do the
same thing to rookies, but now you've got a guy who talks funny,
dresses funny.... The thing we tried to do in Golden State was create
an environment where the guys would be accepted, but it wasn't like
that everywhere. There were certain guys who were left in the gym
with no ride. There was a lot of that."</TE>
<TE>   Divac, who was close to Petrovic, says they talked by phone "all
the time, trying to give each other support. He was in this
situation--I had people trying to help me. He had people on his team,
it was not that they didn't help him, but they didn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Traded to the Nets in his second season, Petrovic became a starter
in his third, averaging 20 points, then 22 the following season when
he was named to the All-NBA third team.</TE>
<TE>   He died that summer in an auto crash in Germany at 28. His jersey
hangs in the Nets' arena now, alongside those of Julius Erving and
Buck Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In Real Life, Vlade Has Problam-uhs</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1989, Divac, then 21, sat in the stands at the
NBA draft, having just arrived in this country, next to a woman who
translated for him, because his English vocabulary, he says,
consisted of "two words, hi and bye."</TE>
<TE>   He had been told he might go as high as No. 11 to Golden State and
probably before No. 20, but they were down to small forwards and big
guards and still no one wanted him.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19, Philadelphia, took Louisville forward Kenny Payne.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20, Chicago, which had already selected Stacey King and B.J.
Armstrong, took Georgia Southern forward Jeff Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21, Utah, took Blue Edwards of East Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   No. 22, Portland, took Byron Irvin of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23, Atlanta, took Roy Marble of Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24, Phoenix, took Anthony Cook of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   No. 25, Cleveland, took Seton Hall guard Johnny Morton.</TE>
<TE>   The tallest of them, Cook, was 6-8. Edwards, the
longest-surviving, would be out of the game by 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Divac was wondering, in Serbo-Croatian, what he was
doing here.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me I was going between 10 and 20," he says. "Then when
I didn't, I said, 'I'm going back home.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then they say Los Angeles Lakers [who took him at No. 26] and it
all flashed back to me, 'I'm going to be in the same dressing room
with Magic [Johnson] A.C. [Green], James [Worthy]. Wow!'"</TE>
<TE>   He was a local darling, with his tremendous gift for passing and
ballhandling. He got parts in TV serials and commercials (remember
Green asking him, "Problam-uh Vlade?").</TE>
<TE>   But this was the last of the hard-driving Pat Riley years and,
despite their reputation as a finesse team, the Lakers were
hard-driving and hard-nosed, new concepts for the easygoing Divac,
reared in the gentle zone-defense world of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   So, they all took their shots at bringing up Vlade.</TE>
<TE>   As maximum leader, Johnson took direct charge of the new project,
as one night in Divac's second season, when he made a mistake, and
Magic, on the floor, called him over, snarling, "C'mere!"</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the time Byron Scott, asked about Vlade, replied,
"Sometimes he comes to play and sometimes he doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Well, at least they cared.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," Divac says. "Was everybody, from Pat, from Magic,
from Jerry West. But I said, it's to help me. I looked at them as
people trying to help me....</TE>
<TE>   "It was Magic's way when somebody made mistake. It could have been
anyone named Vlade or Byron or James or A.C. I never took it
personal."</TE>
<TE>   He reached his Laker peak--16 points and 10.4 rebounds--in his
sixth season but after his seventh was traded to Charlotte as the
Lakers unloaded salary for Shaquille O'Neal. In return the Lakers got
the Hornets' No. 13 pick, Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Divac returned to the West Coast, signing a $62-million
deal with the Kings, who simply were looking for a 7-footer, as
opposed to working on any Serbian strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic, drafted in 1996, had arrived the season before, but
Divac naturally became his mentor. Two years later, the Kings drafted
Turkoglu, another prodigy, and now they were like their own little
ethnic neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's always easy being a rich emigre. A lot has happened
in the old Yugoslavia in recent years, most of it tragic.</TE>
<TE>   During the breakup of the country, Croatian friends--notably
Petrovic and Vrankovic--stopped talking to Divac, a Serb. Petrovic
died before they ever had a chance to make up.</TE>
<TE>   While the Kings played the Utah Jazz in a first-round series in
1999, NATO planes were bombing Serbia. The birth parents of Divac's
adopted child were killed by snipers.</TE>
<TE>   "I love basketball," he told Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly that
spring, "but it's just entertainment, just business."</TE>
<TE>   Compared to that, what problems does the NBA pose?</TE>
<TE>   There's peace back home now, as Divac knows, going back and forth
frequently, as he did over the All-Star break when the Kings were in
Washington and he hitched a ride on the Yugoslav version of Air Force
One, with President Vojislav Kostunica.</TE>
<TE>   Said Stojakovic, when Divac missed the first practice back in
Sacramento, "Yeah, he couldn't find another president to bring him
back so he had to ride commercial."</TE>
<TE>   You could ask Vlade Divac, it has been quite a ride, indeed.</TE>

<HD>Vikings' Carter Retires, Joins HBO as Analyst</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending the last four months assessing what he wanted to do
with his life, Minnesota Viking receiver Cris Carter has decided on
broadcasting rather than continue his football career.</LD>
<LD>   Carter announced Tuesday that he is retiring after 15 seasons in
the NFL and will join HBO's "Inside the NFL" as a studio analyst.</LD>
<LD>   Carter said on a conference call with reporters that he also had
an opportunity to become a game analyst for Fox, but said he prefers
studio work.</LD>
<TE>   Carter will join new "Inside the NFL" host Bob Costas and fellow
analysts Dan Marino and Cris Collinsworth on the weekly show. Carter
said the addition of Costas was a factor in his decision to go with
HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, 36, drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles out of Ohio State
in 1987, spent 12 seasons with the Vikings. He had 1,093 career
catches and 129 receiving touchdowns, second in both categories
behind Jerry Rice. He ranks third behind Rice and James Lofton with
13,833 yards receiving.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, a free agent, said he considered signing with Miami,
Cleveland or St. Louis. He might have signed with the Rams in early
March but said he was delayed in meetings in Cleveland and before he
could arrive in St. Louis, the Rams said they were no longer
interested.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said he wrote a letter of apology to Ram Coach Mike Martz,
explaining what happened, but did not get a response.</TE>

<HD>Stadium May Face Landmark Battle</HD>
<DH>Football: Coliseum and Rose Bowl say proposed downtown
facility would be dangerous to their existence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles County Supervisors backed a lawsuit Tuesday that could
hamper efforts to construct a $450-million downtown football stadium,
Coliseum and Rose Bowl representatives insisted their venues remain
viable options for relocation-minded NFL teams.</LD>
<LD>   And for the two Southern California landmarks, it's all about
survival.</LD>
<LD>   "A new stadium would be devastating to us and to the Rose Bowl,"
said Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum, which is managed in
part by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. "You build one
stadium and kill two others."</LD>
<TE>   Said Rose Bowl general manager Darryl Dunn: "Time has proven that
the Rose Bowl and Coliseum can coexist. A third stadium might
jeopardize that."</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl representatives released a poll last week asserting that
county residents favored the historic bowl to a downtown stadium by
almost 2 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Lynch distributed a report to Los Angeles City Council
members outlining the benefits of a renovated Coliseum and how the
$400-million project might be financed. That plan echoes the work
already underway by the Coliseum Commission, a group chaired by
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and charged with devising a way to best
position the stadium for an NFL return.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas also introduced a motion last week that would have
the Community Redevelopment Agency review various redevelopment
project areas to assess where the best location for an NFL stadium
would be in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum is a longshot to become a permanent home for an NFL
team, in large part because the league has essentially dismissed it
as an alternative. At an owners meeting in Houston last week, NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the 80-year-old stadium is not an
option.</TE>
<TE>   An NFL spokesman declined to elaborate on the subject Tuesday
except to point out no Coliseum proposal has been presented to the
league. The NFL has met with Rose Bowl officials and heard a
presentation from the coalition led by Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, which unveiled plans last week to build a privately
financed football stadium in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some see a new stadium as especially detrimental to the Rose Bowl:
It is more likely the Rose Bowl would lose UCLA football to a new
venue than the Coliseum would lose USC football.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said the best strategy for the Coliseum is to appeal to
individual NFL owners, who will be looking for the most lucrative
deal when they consider relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "For them, the best situation means a state-of-the-art stadium
with the best economic return," he said. "They couldn't care less
[where the stadium is located]."</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz proposal envisions construction of a $450-million
stadium adjacent to Staples Center. The group has billed the plan as
the last, best chance to bring pro football back to L.A. Already, the
group has been contacted by representatives of the San Diego Chargers
and Minnesota Vikings, both of whom are relocation candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Leiweke, a principal in the downtown stadium coalition,
compared the prospects of renovating the Coliseum to the difficulty
of rebuilding Chicago's Soldier Field, a project that will cost more
than $500 million--more than it would cost to build a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   There would be an NFL team in the Coliseum this fall if not for
the events of three years ago, when Houston businessman Bob McNair
bid $700 million to beat out two competing L.A. groups for the
league's 32nd franchise.</TE>
<TE>   That league executives apparently have soured on the Coliseum
raises questions about the already optimistic financing plan: The
$400-million renovation proposal hinges on a $150-million loan from
the league, money that also factors into the Anschutz plan.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said a Coliseum renovation could be financed the same way as
was proposed in 1999, including $80 million coming from personal-seat
licenses (PSLs), $74 million from an admission surcharge, and $35
million each by way of historical tax credits and redevelopment-zone
tax increments.</TE>
<TE>   "We need someone to stand behind us for our financing," Lynch
said. "It's true; we're well behind where they [the Anschutz
coalition] are. But that can change."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James Hahn, who supports the Anschutz proposal, did not
dismiss the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think you could make the Coliseum into a great venue for
professional football," Hahn said. "But I'm not going to put all of
L.A.'s eggs in that basket."</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to sue the city,
arguing that a redevelopment plan that would ease the way for stadium
construction ultimately strips tax revenue from the county.</TE>
<TE>   Some supervisors also voiced support for the Coliseum: ''Building
a multimillion-dollar football stadium downtown makes no economic
sense when you have ... the Coliseum," Supervisor Mike Antonovich
said.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism against the Coliseum includes the difficulty of dealing
with the Coliseum Commission and the red tape associated with
renovating a national historic landmark. Lynch said both of those
issues have improved over time. Other concerns are the safety of the
neighborhood and limited parking--fears that Lynch said are
exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   "[NFL owners and executives] toured the area last time around and
came away satisfied it was safe," Lynch said, adding that there are
roughly 23,000 parking spots within a half-mile radius of the
Coliseum--enough to satisfy the league's basic requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "What we hope is that the proper due diligence of the L.A. market
takes place," Lynch said. "If they do that, and still conclude that
the Coliseum is not a worthy project to continue, then so be it. At
least we've had our day."</TE>

<HD>O'Neill's Goal Is an Eye-Opener</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Forward is hit in face by a puck but scores in
overtime and Hurricanes defeat Maple Leafs, 2-1, to take lead in the
series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Jeff O'Neill didn't let a severely swollen right eye keep him from
giving the Carolina Hurricanes another overtime victory.</LD>
<LD>   After being hit by a puck below his right eye earlier in the game,
O'Neill instinctively knew where to go--to the net.</LD>
<LD>   And that's where he was, cruising in from the right circle, in
time to convert Ron Francis' kick-pass 6:01 into overtime, lifting
the Hurricanes to a 2-1 victory over Toronto in Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference finals on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   It was Carolina's second consecutive overtime victory, and gave
the Hurricanes a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series that resumes
Thursday at Toronto. All three games have been decided by 2-1 scores.</TE>
<TE>   Francis also scored for the Hurricanes, who improved to 5-1 in
overtime this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan McCabe scored for the Maple Leafs, who not only lost
high-scoring forward Alexander Mogilny to an undisclosed upper-body
injury, but were without Coach Pat Quinn because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Quinn was taken by ambulance to a hospital,
where he had tests for an undisclosed chest condition. Listed in
stable condition, Quinn remained hospitalized overnight as a
precaution and was expected to watch the game on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctor Darrell Ogilvie-Harris said Quinn could be released as
soon as this morning and, pending test results, could return to the
bench as soon as Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it helps that you're without your coach," center
Alyn McCauley said. "But I didn't feel like we were handicapped or
that it disrupted us behind the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn's longtime assistant, Rick Ley, coached his first playoff
game since leading the Vancouver Canucks to the Western Conference
semifinals in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped it would be a rallying point, not a distraction," said
Ley of Quinn's ailment. "I don't know, possibly it was a
distraction."</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny, who leads Toronto with eight playoff goals, was knocked
over by Sean Hill in the opening minute but returned for part of the
first period and all of the second. He didn't play after that.</TE>
<TE>   Francis sparked the game-winning play, getting around defender
Anders Eriksson at the Maple Leafs' blue line.</TE>
<TE>   He carried the puck to the net and, after having it tipped off his
stick by Tomas Kaberle, Francis kicked the puck ahead. The puck
dribbled to O'Neill, who shot over Curtis Joseph's right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "It obviously wasn't one of his prettier assists, but it just kind
of squirted free there," said O'Neill, who was struck by a puck fired
by McCabe in the first period. "It was just sitting right there, and
I just tried to shoot it as quick as I could. Fortunately it went
in."</TE>
<TE>   Francis laughed about the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't exactly picture perfect, but you talk about breaks and
needing them this time of year, that certainly was one for us,"
Francis said.</TE>

<HD>Durazo's Homer Backs Up Johnson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helped by an umpire's call that gave Erubiel Durazo a home run, the
Arizona Diamondbacks and Randy Johnson defeated the frustrated San
Francisco Giants, 9-4, Tuesday night at Phoenix in the first meeting
between the National League West rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson (8-1) struck out 10 to pass 3,500 for his career and
matched teammate Curt Schilling as the only eight-game winners in the
majors. First-place Arizona moved one game ahead of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Durazo tied the score, 3-3, with a disputed solo home run against
Livan Hernandez in the fifth. The ball was hit down the right-field
line, and first base umpire Larry Young called it a homer, despite
the protests of Hernandez and first baseman J.T. Snow, who argued the
ball was foul.</LD>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker and catcher Benito Santiago were ejected
by plate umpire Bill Hohn.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was tossed for the first time this season after David Bell
was out trying to steal second on a called third strike to Barry
Bonds to end the seventh inning. Santiago, who was three for three
with a double, was tossed after arguing balls and strikes to start
the Arizona seventh. The Diamondbacks scored four runs in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   With 3,507 strikeouts, Johnson needs two to pass Walter Johnson
for eighth on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 12-3, Chicago 1-4--Sammy Sosa hit his first homer in 10
games and the Cubs gained a doubleheader split at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Giles hit an inside-the-park home run, and Jimmy Anderson
(4-5) and Sean Lowe combined on a three-hitter to lead the Pirates in
the first game.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's major league-leading 16th homer, a three-run shot against
Josh Fogg (5-2) in the sixth inning, helped keep starter Juan Cruz
(1-7) from becoming the first Cub pitcher to begin a season 0-8.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Houston 1--Jason Simontacchi (2-0) pitched seven
strong innings at St. Louis and the Cardinals won for the 10th time
in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros have lost two in a row after winning seven in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Atlanta 4--Brad Wilkerson drove in the winning run
with a two-out dribbler in the bottom of the 10th inning.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal tied the score in the ninth on Jose Vidro's two-out
run-scoring single against John Smoltz.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Florida 1--Austin Kearns hit his first career grand
slam and the Reds took advantage of wildness by A.J. Burnett (5-4) at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Graves got Charles Johnson on a groundout to end the eighth
and finished for his 15th save in 19 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, New York 0--Vicente Padilla (6-3) pitched eight
shutout innings and Pat Burrell hit a three-run homer in the bottom
of the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies have won two in a row after losing six consecutive
games. The Mets have dropped two in a row after a five-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, San Diego 6--Larry Walker homered and drove in three
runs to rally the Rockies at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Walker hit a two-run single in the seventh inning and Todd Zeile
had a run-scoring single to put Colorado ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Helton and Todd Hollandsworth homered for the Rockies.</TE>

<LD>Unable to hit a curveball during his first three at-bats, Delmon
Young connected on an 0-2 curveball in the eighth inning, sending it
far over the left-field fence to give top-seeded Camarillo a 3-2
victory over host Rialto Eisenhower on Tuesday in a Southern Section
Division I second-round playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank god that's over," said Young, whose 16th home run of the
season landed across the street.</LD>
<LD>   Eisenhower pitchers Jose Pagan and Jesse Iglesias had neutralized
Young. He struck out in the first inning, grounded out with two
runners aboard in the third and flied out with the bases loaded in
the fifth. Then came the towering home run.</LD>
<TE>   "That ball just carried," said Camarillo shortstop Brad Boyer.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Sutton (13-0) pitched 21/3 innings of one-hit relief for
Camarillo (27-4), The Times' No. 3-ranked team. Sutton hit a home run
in the seventh inning to give the Scorpions a 2-1 lead. Eisenhower
(19-10) tied the score when Boyer slipped trying to field a routine
ground ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We almost lost the game a couple of times and we almost won the
game a couple of times," said Young.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim Loara scored three runs in its last at-bat, the final two
after a reversed call by the umpires and an error by Thousand Oaks,
to defeat the defending champion Lancers, 3-2, in a Southern Section
Division II second-round softball game Tuesday at Loara.</LD>
<LD>   The winning run came across when Loara's Ashley Fanna and Deandra
Jex were hit by pitches in consecutive at-bats with two out in the
bottom of the seventh, forcing home Lauren Lappin.</LD>
<LD>   Lappin reached base and drove in Loara's first run after grounding
into a force out. Coach Scott Weber of Loara (22-11) asked the field
umpire to check with the home plate umpire to see if the throw to
second was bobbled. After a brief conference, the runner, Kelly
Melone, was called safe.</LD>
<TE>   An error allowed a run to score and put runners on second and
third. Thousand Oaks pitcher Amanda Kilionski (14-4), who stranded a
total of seven runners in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, then
hit the next two batters.</TE>
<TE>   "That call changed the inning," said Thousand Oaks Coach Gary
Walin. "But we made some other mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers (21-9-1) took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a
two-run home run by Kilionski, a junior who sat out last season and
part of this season after transferring from Simi Valley High.</TE>

<TE>   City Section final--Granada Hills shot 319 for a two-day score of
623 and won its second consecutive title in a tournament that ended
in controversy when Steve Chung of Palisades was disqualified for
signing an incorrect scorecard during play at the Harding and Wilson
golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   Had Chung's score counted, Palisades would have won by two
strokes, but the Dolphins had to count an 82 by Mike Zweig and tied
Granada Hills, 623-623. Granada Hills won on a tiebreaker of back
nine scores, 154-156.</TE>
<TE>   Though USGA rules call for disqualification, Palisades Coach James
Paleno disputed the ruling because Chung did not keep his own score.
An official scorer walks with each group and records the scores.
Palisades players made a hasty exit after the ruling and refused to
accept second-place trophies.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Denny Bae of Fairfax shot one-under-par 143 to win the
individual title by three shots over defending champion Alex Paex of
Marshall.</TE>

doubles team of twins Edward and Edwin Mendoza each recorded
three-set sweeps to help the No. 2-seeded Warriors hang on for a
victory on games, 76-71, in a Southern Section Division II
quarterfinal match at Rio Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Rio Mesa (16-4) trailed, 7-5, going into the final round-robin
sets, but pulled into a 9-9 tie when No. 2 singles player Khai Nguyen
defeated Troy's No. 3 player, Jonathan Sujarit, 6-3. Rio Mesa's No. 2
doubles team of Casey Malone and Ryan Matsumori then won 6-3 to tie
the match.</TE>
<TE>   But Troy's 41-34 advantage in doubles games gave the Warriors
(25-1) their 20th consecutive victory. Troy will face Santa Barbara,
a 14-4 winner over Valencia, on Thursday.</TE>

<LD>A year ago this week, Mark Prior was preparing to pitch for USC in
the NCAA playoffs, a showcase he figured would go a long way toward
determining his status in the amateur draft.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, he'll be a long way from Dedeaux Field when he steps to
the mound for the Chicago Cubs before a sellout crowd at Wrigley
Field for his major league debut against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a whirlwind year," said Prior, who was selected No. 2
in the draft and signed a $10.5-million contract in August. "As a
teenager, when I realized I wanted to play professional baseball, I
hoped to get to the major leagues by 25 or 26. But to do it by the
time I'm 21? I don't think I dreamed about that."</LD>
<TE>   Prior, a 6-foot-5, 220-pound right-hander from San Diego, was
promoted to the big leagues after making nine starts in the minors.
Victory-starved Cub fans have been awaiting his arrival since the
Minnesota Twins shied away from Prior's expected price tag and
selected high school catcher Joe Mauer with the top pick in the
draft.</TE>
<TE>   Andy MacPhail, the Cub president and general manager, has voiced
concerns about the expectations put on Prior by the Chicago media and
fans. But MacPhail has been impressed with Prior's composure from the
day they met during contract negotiations last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "He handles himself like a 10-year veteran and he's only been in
professional baseball for a few months," MacPhail said. "You never
know in this game, but he hasn't given us any indication that he's
not going to be a very productive player for a very long period of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Prior, who transferred to USC from Vanderbilt before his sophomore
season, helped pitch the Trojans to consecutive College World Series
appearances and produced what many regard as the most dominating
college season ever in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He went 15-1 with a 1.69 earned-run average and recorded a Pacific
10 Conference-record 202 strikeouts and walked only 18 in 1382/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Mike Gillespie expects that Prior, like any player
making his major league debut, will be nervous. But not for long.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the same guy whether he's in the bullpen, in an intrasquad
game, pitching for Team USA or wherever," Gillespie said. "What has
always separated him is his command and composure. He's sort of
impervious to some of the other things that make a guy get out of his
element."</TE>
<TE>   Prior reported to the Cubs' major league spring training camp in
February after having not pitched in a game since last June.
Prolonged contract negotiations kept him off the field during the
summer and Prior spent the fall taking business classes at USC.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in Mesa, Ariz., hoping to make a good impression and
learn from veteran players without calling attention to himself or
his contract, the richest ever given to a draftee.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a side of me that was concerned because there could
have been a situation with a lot of negativity toward that issue,"
Prior said. "Once they saw that I was not a flashy guy, that I was
minding my own business and doing what I had to do to get my work in,
they started to respect that. It wasn't like, 'This kid is trying to
step on anyone's toes.'"</TE>
<TE>   Prior's performance and work ethic in spring training spurred Cub
Manager Don Baylor to say publicly that he wanted Prior to be part of
the rotation. The club, however, opted not to rush its top prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Prior was sent to West Tennessee, the Cubs' affiliate in the
double-A Southern League, where he went 4-1 with a 2.60 ERA in six
starts. He struck out 55 and walked 10 in 342/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In his first start for triple-A Iowa, he struck out the side in
the first inning on 10 pitches and finished with 10 strikeouts in
72/3 innings. He gave up one unearned run and three hits and also hit
two home runs. He was 1-1 with a 1.65 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 161/3
innings when the Cubs announced his promotion last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Prior worked out at Wrigley Field on Monday to become accustomed
to the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a couple good outings in spring training and that pretty
much gave me confidence that my stuff works," Prior said. "I'm going
to go out and take my bumps and bruises along the way but I think my
stuff is good enough physically and mentally."</TE>

<HD>Paraguay Plan Is Food for Thought</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paraguay's World Cup team has a strategy that could have spared Kobe
Bryant and the Lakers a good deal of intestinal pain this week in
Sacramento:</LD>
<LD>   Whenever in doubt, bring your own food with you.</LD>
<LD>   Paraguay team officials had supplies of meat, tea, maize and
cassava shipped to Asia to keep its players properly fed during the
tournament. Paraguay will play Spain, South Africa and Slovenia in
first-round matches in South Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Oscar Harrison, president of Paraguay's soccer federation, said
arrangements were made to ship Australian meat and yerba mate, a
Paraguayan tea-like drink, to Korea "so that the players feel at
ease, with a hot mate in hand. Also, our two cooks will have a load
of maize and cassava so that they can give the players typical
Paraguayan dishes."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said the team wanted to take local meat, but Paraguay's
beef industry is not completely free of foot-and-mouth disease.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, dog is not an option at the Paraguayan World Cup
training table.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England received a mixed bag of news Tuesday: Midfielder Kieron
Dyer was officially added to the team's 23-man roster, which was
announced after an England's unimpressive 1-1 tie with South Korea in
Seogwipo.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer, who plays for the English club Newcastle, had been
considered doubtful after sustaining a knee injury during Newcastle's
last regular-season match against Southampton earlier this month,
threatening to further weaken an England midfield already depleted by
injuries to captain David Beckham and Steven Gerrard. England is
hopeful Dyer and Beckham will be ready by the first week in June, but
Gerrard has already been ruled out of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Owen scored in the 25th minute for England, which had
control of the match until Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson made seven
halftime substitutions. Park Ji-Sung equalized for South Korea in the
52nd minute.</TE>
<TE>   Eriksson chose four players from English Premier League champion
Arsenal--goalkeeper David Seaman and defenders Sol Campbell, Ashley
Cole and Martin Keown. Beckham was one of four Manchester United
players on the roster, joined by defender Wes Brown and midfielders
Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexico formally submitted its 23-man roster for the World Cup and
as expected, defender Claudio Suarez was not included.</TE>
<TE>   Although Coach Javier Aguirre had announced a tentative roster
weeks ago, Suarez, sidelined since April 11 because of a broken leg,
had held out hope that he might be a late addition to the official
roster. Suarez, having made a world-record 170 appearances for
Mexico, has been a longtime anchor of the team's backline, but
Aguirre was not convinced Suarez would be at full strength by June.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez was replaced on the roster by Francisco Gabriel de Anda, a
defender for the Mexican club team Pachuca.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Roy Keane threatened to quit the Ireland team after a
run-in with a fellow player and team assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Keane later backed off from his threat. Ireland Coach Mick
McCarthy had already talked to Colin Healy and told him he was being
called up to replace Keane.</TE>
<TE>   Keane was reportedly angered because Ireland's three
goalkeepers--Shay Given, Dean Kiely and Alan Kelly--did not
participate in five-a-side practice, which led to an argument with
goalkeeper coach Packie Bonner and Kelly.</TE>

<HD>Soft Walls Are a Big Hit</HD>
<DH>SAFER technology cuts down on serious injuries during
practice by lessening the impact of a crash before it gets to drivers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The new "soft walls" installed in the four turns of Indianapolis
Motor Speedway are definitely not soft, say the drivers who
unfortunately served as guinea pigs, but they have lived up their
acronym: SAFER.</LD>
<LD>   The SAFER (Steel and Foam Energy Reduction) barriers were put in
place May 5 for the first day of practice for the Indianapolis 500
and were tested immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Robby McGehee spun, hit the wall twice and nearly flipped his car
on opening day, the car sustaining serious damage. Two days later,
rookie PJ Jones slammed into the wall, rear-end first, with such
impact that the front end of his car lifted nearly four feet in the
air.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Dismore, Alex Barron and Paul Tracy also had extremely hard
hits.</TE>
<TE>   All of the drivers walked away, though, hurting but not seriously
injured. None had head injuries, one of the major concerns in such
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not pleased about it, but I am a walking testament that the
SAFER wall worked," said McGehee, the 1999 rookie of the year who
returned to the speedway on crutches after suffering small fractures
in his upper spine and lower left leg. "I'm sore as hell, but the
fact that I hit the wall that hard and I don't have a head injury is
a testament that the SAFER wall worked. I think I would have a head
injury, for sure, without it."</TE>
<TE>   McGehee was traveling at close to 220 mph when his car broke loose
entering the third turn and spun backward into the newly installed
barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Barnhart, Indy Racing League vice president, said McGehee's
first hit had a force of 40 Gs, the second a force of 72 Gs.</TE>
<TE>   "Both numbers are far less than had been recorded in similar
accidents before the SAFER barrier was put in place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of the barriers, which cover 4,240 feet of Indianapolis
Motor Speedway's permanent outside wall around the 2.5-mile track, is
to absorb energy before it impacts the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to reduce the forces seen on the car to a range that
lessens the likelihood of the driver being injured," Barnhart said.
Jones, finally getting a chance at the 500 after years at other
series, vouched for that.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the new walls really helped my impact and I probably
wouldn't be in nearly as good of shape as I am right now without
them," said PJ, son of 1963 winner Parnelli Jones. "The speedway
really did something positive, putting that system in place. For all
I went through, I'm not in any pain and I don't actually feel hurt,
but I have some cracks in a vertebra that are going to take a short
time to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a shame. I can't really believe it. It's my first 500
and we were running so well. I felt like we had a car to win the
race."</TE>
<TE>   He might be right. Raul Boesel replaced Jones in John Menard's
backup No. 2 car and, with only two days of practice, put it on the
front row for Sunday's 500.</TE>
<TE>   Richie Hearn took over Dismore's repaired car and put it in the
field the first weekend of qualifying, then last weekend, Barron and
Tracy, in repaired cars, and Dismore, in another car, all qualified
for spots in the 33-car starting field.</TE>
<TE>   The new energy-absorbing barrier was developed jointly by the IRL
and the University of Nebraska's Midwest Roadside Safety Facility.
They began working together in 1998. NASCAR joined in the development
in 2000, after the barrier was designed for multiple impacts by
3,400-pound Winston Cup stock cars as well as 1,550-pound IRL
open-wheel cars.</TE>
<TE>   "NASCAR has not said it will use the barriers for the Brickyard
400 [at the speedway in August], but is taking a wait-and-see
attitude," said Fred Nation, IRL director of communications. "They
have participated in its development and seen our tests, but so far,
that's all."</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup driver Johnny Benson, who is also part owner of Berlin
Speedway in Marne, Mich., applauded the installation of the barriers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great that Indianapolis has taken us to the next step in
safety," he said. "As a driver, I'm glad NASCAR is right there
supporting them. This will help driver safety now and even more so in
the future as more tracks use this technology.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been lucky and never hit the wall at Indy, but it's a great
place for this technology to be introduced. It's a high-profile
racetrack and hopefully it will influence other tracks to do the same
thing with the new wall system."</TE>
<TE>   Crash tests were done with stock cars as well as IRL cars, the
test cars being towed on a pulley at speeds between 100 and 153 mph
and at angles of 20 to 251/2 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   McGehee and Jones hit the wall going about 220 at angles of almost
90 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Said John Rhode, associate professor of engineering at Nebraska,
"Looking at PJ's hit, it was kind of miraculous, really. He had an
impact change of 100 feet per second but it occurred over 120
milliseconds, which is a long time for that type of impact. It was a
hit that had a tremendous amount of energy that was dissipated with
moderate loads on the vehicle. We know we have to get the
decelerations diminished and that's what we're doing here."</TE>
<TE>   The barrier is constructed in 20-foot modules, each module
consisting of four rectangular steel tubes welded together to form a
unified element. The modules are connected with four steel splices.
Bundles of two-inch-thick sheets of yielding polystyrene are placed
between the concrete wall and the steel tubing modules every 10 feet.
Six or seven sheets of polystyrene are used in each bundle, depending
on the location of the module in the turn.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the prerequisites presented to us was to create a barrier
robust enough to absorb an incredible impact and yet maintain its
integrity so the event could continue with little or no delay for
repair," said Dean Sickling, director of the Nebraska facility.</TE>
<TE>   "The principle behind the wall is, it provides a continuous
barrier system that will remain parallel to the track and move back
as a unit as it dissipates energy. The need for that movement is to
prevent pocketing, which is where the barrier wraps around the front
of the car, which extremely increases deceleration."</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, the speedway installed an earlier version of
the barrier, but when Arie Luyendyk crashed into it during an
International Race of Champions it bounced his car back onto the
center of the track and scattered debris for 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk suffered a slight concussion, but he credited the barrier
with saving him from a more serious injury. However, the rebound
effect and the delay in cleaning up after the accident sent IRL
officials back to the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   The impacts this month caused hardly any damage to the polystyrene
sheets and other parts of the system.</TE>
<TE>   The barrier is painted white to match the speedway's traditional
wall color and is unobtrusive, even to the drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Ward, second-place finisher in the 1999 Indy 500, took a ride
around the track in a pace car before practice one day to inspect the
new barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I never noticed it again," he said. "It's white and
it blends right in."</TE>
<TE>   The SAFER walls are a continuation of the safety innovations and
improvements put in place by the IRL since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the technical staff, with Delphi Automotive Systems,
developed a yellow-light warning system that blinks in car cockpits
when a caution is called on the track. That same year, attenuators
were added to the backs of the Indy car transmissions to lessen
G-forces in rear impact crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Acting to prevent wheels from flying off the car in high-speed
accidents, a danger to both drivers and spectators, the IRL mandated
the use of multiple restraints attached at multiple points to a car's
chassis and suspension to minimize the possibility of wheel assembles
being detached.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, chassis manufacturers were required to design all-new
chassis with safety-inspired changes. Among them were increasing the
width of the cockpit opening to 19 inches, providing better head
protection through increased headrest thickness, adding additional
anti-intrusion barriers on the chassis sides to improve side-impact
performance, increasing the outer edges of side pods to reduce the
possibility of interlocking wheels, and introducing collapsible
steering wheels.</TE>
<TE>   This year, besides adding the SAFER barriers, the IRL has mandated
helmets for all over-the-wall personnel during races.</TE>
<TE>   "Safety in our sport in every area, whether it is the wall or any
other aspect of the car, is an ongoing development," Barnhart said.
"I think that is going to be the case with the wall, as well."</TE>

<LD>The Lakers accomplished what they wanted in splitting the first two
games of the series at Sacramento's Arco Arena and now they get a
couple of days of much-needed rest before Game 3, which will be
played Friday at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   In Sacramento's Game 2 victory Monday, the Lakers had a tough time
matching the Kings' energy level, especially on defense. Sacramento
was able to take advantage of a couple of matchups and played more
aggressively than the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings probably shouldn't count on having a 23-5 edge in free
throws in the first half of Game 3 as they did in Game 2 Monday.
Although the Lakers hurt themselves by missing numerous open shots,
Sacramento did a good job of attacking and playing help defense in
Game 2. That's the reason why they won.</LD>
<TE>   A breakdown of Game 3:</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--In Game 2, the Lakers allowed the officials to take
them out of the game. Once Shaquille O'Neal and his teammates decided
that the officiating wasn't fair, they lost some of their intensity.
The Lakers should have known better.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings held the Lakers to 90 points Monday, Sacramento
didn't completely shut down the Lakers. Except for a bad shooting
stretch at the start of the third quarter and some poor free-throw
shooting late in the fourth, O'Neal dominated the Kings. Chances are
he'll do more of the same Friday if he can stay out of foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry had a career playoff high with 20 rebounds in Game 2
but he wasn't much of a factor on offense. After a strong scoring
game to open the series, Horry didn't have the same drive Monday.
Instead of always looking to make a three-point shot, it may be time
for Horry to drive the lane and throw down a dunk. That would shake
up the Kings' clutching defense in the paint.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker perimeter players not only shot the ball poorly in Game
2, they also seemed a little sluggish on defense. Too often they got
caught in screens and were late to recover on jump shots. The
three-day rest between games should help players such as Derek
Fisher, Rick Fox and Horry, who spent a lot of energy on defense.</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--Jumping out to a double-digit lead late in the third
quarter carried the Kings in Game 2 because they certainly didn't
close strongly. Chris Webber and Hedo Turkoglu missed 10 of 13 free
throws and Sacramento scored only 20 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the Lakers went with their second unit, which features
Devean George and Samaki Walker, the Kings' all-around execution
improved. Webber and Vlade Divac were more effective inside, which
opened things up more for Sacramento's perimeter players.</TE>
<TE>   If Peja Stojakovic returns to Sacramento's lineup after missing
the first two games because of an ankle injury, the Kings will be
even deeper. Turkoglu is more comfortable coming off the bench, where
he probably will be matched against George instead of Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have gotten strong backcourt play from Mike Bibby and
Bobby Jackson, who have combined for 77 points in the series.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--In Game 2, the Kings were more effective when they took
a page out of the Laker book and collapsed to the middle on defense.
Perimeter players such as Doug Christie and Bibby backed off the
players they were defending to help on O'Neal inside. This tactic
worked because the Laker perimeter players missed their shots from
the outside and didn't move well without the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect Sacramento to have it that easy Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are not the best three-point shooting team in the
league, but they are not the worst either.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Fisher, Fox, Horry and George, who combined to miss 13 of
15 from behind the arc Monday, to shoot better on the Laker-friendly
Staples Center rims.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To live in Sacramento is to have a thick skin, a gracious heart and,
yes, a sense of humor. You can't survive here without them. Just like
you can't live here without being a yokel, right? Or a hayseed. A red
neck. And a member of many fan clubs, including:</LD>
<LD>   The Dukes of Hazzard, the Beverly Hillbillies and Conway Twitty.
Yessiree! We chew with our mouths open.</LD>
<LD>   We move our lips when we read. We laugh at knock-knock jokes.</LD>
<TE>   We just discovered that albums aren't called albums anymore. We
love the smell of manure in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   We all speak with a twang--even the Russian folk.</TE>
<TE>   And when Lakers' star Shaquille O'Neal claimed the only way to
beat his team "starts with a C and ends with a T," we collectively
said, hmmm ...</TE>
<TE>   Did he mean Cat? Doesn't that just sound like us? Or rather, isn't
that the image Los Angeles has of us? Yup.</TE>
<TE>   You heard that stuff all last weekend when the Lakers were in town
to start the Western Conference finals against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, you heard it before the series even started. Friday, I
was in the Southland and tuned into sports talk radio to catch the
Laker-King buzz.</TE>
<TE>   What came across were L.A. sports writers declaring that they
wouldn't fly here until game day to avoid spending one unnecessary
minute in "Cowtown."</TE>
<TE>   Some even invoked the word "cooties." Caller after caller made it
sound like the Lakers were traveling to an FFA show rather than a
basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   (Memo to L.A.: FFA means Future Farmers of America).</TE>
<TE>   Funny. Yeah L.A., we get it. We're inferior to you in every way
... or at least, it makes you feel good to think that. OK. Whatever.
While it's easy enough to fire back by trotting out the tired old
lines about you being shallow, self-centered and sun baked, we won't.</TE>
<TE>   We in Sacramento aren't like that.</TE>
<TE>   We love our city. We have thick skin, we can take a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Behind all that bravado, L.A. is scared of losing to Sacramento.
Watch for it: If the Kings win a game this weekend at Staples Center,
the Lakers' Hollywood facade will crumble and they'll do more crying
than they do on "The Young and the Restless."</TE>
<TE>   And that's another thing. We give L.A. its food and water. L.A.
gives us bad television, bad movies and bad attitude--and yet we
don't hold a grudge.</TE>
<TE>   We offer our own fig leaf. A cowbell. Just say the word and we'll
send you some.</TE>
<TE>   Take them and you know what you can do with them.</TE>
<TE>   Ring them the next time you're sucking exhaust fumes on the Harbor
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Ring them when your car is burglarized for the fifth time this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Ring them the next time you're accosted by drug-addled freaks
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Ring them when you pay six figures for an outhouse posing as a
real house.</TE>
<TE>   Ring them the next time you see silicone and plastic substituting
for a real body part.</TE>
<TE>   Then you'll discover what we know here in Sacramento--that a
cowbell sounds a lot nicer than a police car's wail or a building
burning to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Y'all come back now, ya hear?</TE>

<DH>Compared with U.S. tycoons, Castro is Mickey Mouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush was right to get himself all worked up this week about
happenings in the Caribbean. Only he picked the wrong target on the
wrong island.</LD>
<LD>   He should have been fuming about what's going on in Bermuda or
Barbados, not Cuba. That's where American values really are under
siege.</LD>
<LD>   Lately we've been hearing about the rush of U.S. companies trying
to weasel out of their taxes by moving the books offshore to the
Caribbean. Now we're learning more: The result of this exodus will be
to enrich a few corporate executives with huge bonuses and
stock-option payouts.</LD>
<TE>   We probably shouldn't be surprised. As we see with the accounting
scandals that have engulfed corporate America, there's no gimmick too
far-fetched or too offensive so long as a tycoon can pocket a bigger
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   They want to sell American-ness to the world while selling out at
home.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Cuba is hardly a nuisance at all. Friends, if we
can open an embassy in Hanoi and offer the handshake of open trade to
the communists there, must we maintain this goofy estrangement from
our Latin neighbor?</TE>
<TE>   "We care about the people!" Bush said in his speech about Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Really? Cubans who were children when the Iron Curtain descended
off Key West are now grandparents. I'm sure they're relieved to know
that the American president cares about them--if only they would
become brutish capitalists like the executives at Stanley tools.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 2002, you don't have to stand back very far from
the purple-blue waters of the Gulf Stream to wonder, what does the
U.S. stand for anyway?</TE>
<TE>   It's not principle, that's for sure. Unless the principle is
nothing more than: Do what you have to do to take care of yourself.</TE>
<TE>   So Bush travels to Florida and does what pandering politicians
have been doing for years: play to those one-issue Cuban American
voters who are still sore because their dictator, Fulgencio Batista,
was overthrown in January 1959 by a new one who proved more durable.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the White House is deafeningly silent when the
rapacious corner-cutters in the corporate suites say they are doing
only what they have to do, and can: Setting up phony corporate shells
in tax havens. Stuffing their wallets with millions, with tens of
millions, hundreds of millions in personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, you didn't hear George-of-Privilege speaking out for "the
people" on this one.</TE>
<TE>   With a straight face, hired flacks for these companies say it only
makes sense to pull out of the United States. It's for the sake of
shareholders, you see. But, sure enough, look close and you discover
that executives are going to make out even better--both in their
stock options and with those bonuses tied to how much they slash
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   What could be more perfect? Beg off from the basic tenet of
citizenship and reward the moral delinquents upstairs with millions
more for their good thinking.</TE>
<TE>   According to the New York Times, Chief Executive John M. Trani of
Stanley Works, the once-honorable tool company, stands to gain
$385million or so in stock option gains for depriving the U.S.
Treasury of $240million in corporate taxes. The report listed four
other CEOs who stand to gain millions more for doing the same, and
who can guess how many more will follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Stanley shareholders narrowly approved the
offshore incorporation, but the outcome was disputed. The company
says another vote will be held. Just three years ago, by the way,
Stanley settled charges quietly with the Federal Trade Commission
after being accused of selling products that were labeled "Made in
USA" but weren't.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Treasury Department said it was cracking down on
individuals who banked their fortunes offshore to escape the IRS. As
for businesses doing the same, however, the agency's assistant
secretary for tax policy, Mark Weinberger, was more sympathetic. The
government understands, he told Congress, that there are "aspects of
our tax system that are driving companies" to reincorporate
elsewhere. To wit, paying taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Well, that's a lot of thanks from the executives at Stanley and
these other all-American companies, huh? They don't want to give up
their good lives as U.S. residents. They're peddling the USA brand at
home and abroad. They expect to prosper globally thanks to the
stability of the U.S. and the might of its military and diplomacy.
They benefit from the strength of domestic institutions, like the
stock market, the Federal Reserve, the judiciary and the greenback.
They draw talent from U.S. universities.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Mr. President, there are renegades in the Caribbean.
Self-aggrandizers, they stubbornly refuse to live up to our nation's
great values.</TE>
<TE>   These are the ones who need a tongue-lashing from the bully
pulpit. After all, unlike Fidel Castro, they claim to believe in the
United States.</TE>

<HD>Boroughs Are as Bad as Secession</HD>
<DH>Already-adopted reforms should be given a chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dividing Los Angeles into boroughs, as some now are proposing, is no
better than secession for the city. During the most recent charter
reform process, a borough system was carefully considered and
rejected by both the elected and the appointed charter reform
commissions. A borough system would mean a loss of control for city
government over key choices for Los Angeles' future.</LD>
<LD>   We don't have details yet on the current proposal, but all the
borough plans studied during charter reform had three core features:
decentralizing decision-making over land use; allowing each borough
to keep a portion of its tax revenue; and allocating a portion of the
city's budget for each borough to spend. None of these changes would
be desirable.</LD>
<LD>   First, placing land-use choices, such as planning and zoning
variances, at the community level inherently would mean each area
would block uses that are essential for the city but undesirable in
any community. No borough would want the next jail or the next large
shopping mall or the next halfway house.</LD>
<TE>   During charter reform, the elected commission initially favored
giving neighborhood councils decision-making over land use. Many of
the commissioners who supported this, including me, changed their
minds because there was no acceptable answer to the reality that each
neighborhood would say that it did not want certain uses in its
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The new City Charter balanced the desire for decentralization with
the need for some choices to be made for the entire city. For
example, it created area planning commissions to replace one citywide
planning commission. Members of the area planning commissions must
come from that region of the city. This achieves many of the benefits
of boroughs but allows decisions by commissions to be overturned
where necessary by the City Council. Also, the new charter created a
system of neighborhood councils. These new reforms should be given a
chance to work before they are replaced by a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the proposals allowed each borough to keep a portion of
the tax revenue generated in its area. This is a core aspect that
offers an incentive for boroughs to allow development and, more
important, to address concerns that some areas of the city pay more
in taxes than they receive in services.</TE>
<TE>   It is a terrible idea, however, to allow areas to keep their tax
revenues because it would permit wealthier areas of the city to have
more to spend on government services than poorer areas. Historically
in Los Angeles, poorer, predominantly minority areas have received
less than their fair share of city services. Permitting boroughs to
keep a portion of their tax revenues would exacerbate and
institutionalize this inequality.</TE>
<TE>   Secession is favored primarily by white residents of the west San
Fernando Valley, who say they pay more in taxes than they receive in
services. This repeated justification for secession has not been
criticized nearly enough as pure selfishness; inevitably, in any
decent society, the affluent must help subsidize services for the
poor. The selfishness and unstated racism of secessionism--the desire
of some in the Valley to live in a majority-white city--should be
identified and criticized, not indulged through a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Third, supporters of a borough system propose allocating a portion
of the city's budget to each area to spend as it deems best. I
favored this during charter reform until I realized how little of the
city's budget involves discretionary spending choices. Most city
spending is committed to crucial tasks such as the airport, the
harbor, the Department of Water and Power, the police and fire
departments and basic public works projects. What's left would be an
insignificant amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   Although the motives of advocates of a borough system are noble,
the better approach is to defeat secession without adopting an
undesirable alternative. City government, of course, can be improved,
but neither secession nor a borough system is the way to do this.</TE>

<LD>Five members of the Los Angeles City Council are proposing a measure
for the November ballot that would create a commission to devise a
borough system for Los Angeles as an alternative to secession. Yet is
this really the time to be talking boroughs?</LD>
<LD>   With a likely secession election in November and a July deadline
for placing a borough measure on the ballot, a discussion of boroughs
raises a dizzying array of complex questions. Among them: Would a
borough system dilute minority political representation? Will there
be more politicians, bureaucracy and infighting?</LD>
<LD>   The theory behind a borough system is to preserve the existing
city while providing substantial political autonomy to various city
regions.   Clearly, charter reform was the most appropriate time to
consider such a complex proposal. The overriding purpose of the
two-year charter reform effort, passed in June of 1999, was to ward
off secession by making city government more responsive to local
communities.</LD>
<TE>   The creation of the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment to
oversee a system of neighborhood councils with advisory powers is
perhaps the most well known of the changes. However, for secession
groups such as Valley VOTE, the advisory nature of councils did not
go far enough in providing "local control."</TE>
<TE>   One of the ironies of recent calls for a borough system is that it
was the secessionists who, during charter reform, advocated a system
along the lines of what is now proposed. However, the idea was never
given serious consideration by either the elected or appointed
charter commissions and was opposed by the City Council, mayor and
downtown business groups.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason a discussion of boroughs seems misplaced is that
the city already has a form of boroughs. Perhaps the most
substantive, yet not well-known charter reform was the creation of
area planning commissions in seven regions throughout the city. True,
secessionists view these "planning boroughs" as institutionally weak.
Yet, at this stage, wouldn't it make more sense to discuss
strengthening existing institutions rather than creating new ones?</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the borough plan, which would need eight City Council
votes to be put on the ballot, also raises uncomfortable questions
for the council. It is hard to imagine members entrusting their
political futures to a commission that might significantly erode
their power or possibly legislate them into political obsolescence.</TE>
<TE>   A danger in placing a borough proposal on the same ballot as
secession is that it could undermine the legitimacy of the election.
If it was widely perceived that voter confusion caused both measures
to fail, such an outcome would enrage breakaway proponents. That
would virtually ensure future paralyzing and divisive battles over
secession.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where secessionist suburbs have been a fixture of the
political landscape since the 1920s, the possible silver lining of an
up-or-down vote on secession is that the issue finally can be put to
rest in a democratic fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Adding boroughs to the discussion at this stage of the game would
only further muddle an already confusing issue. Unless, of course,
creating confusion serves some other purpose--such as defeating
secession. In which case, the timing is perfect.</TE>

<HD>NATO, Russia Can Get Far With Small Steps</HD>
<DH>One way to pursue common interests would be sharing
anti-terrorism data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT E. HUNTER and SERGEY M. ROGOV</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago in Paris, NATO's leaders and Russia's president
ratified an agreement in which Russia was to have a role in
consultations, cooperation and even, on some issues, common action as
an equal with the allies. But that new relationship foundered during
the Kosovo conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Next week, allied leaders meet outside Rome with a new Russian
president to try again.</LD>
<LD>   Is there a difference this time? Or are we seeing just another
exercise in diplomacy designed to mollify Russia as NATO again
prepares to admit new members from Central Europe at its Prague
summit in November?</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, some things certainly are different. The old
Permanent Joint Council arrayed the 19 NATO allies on one side of the
table and the Russians on the other. Now all 20 will sit as equals,
without the stigma of "us" and "them." And the list of tasks to be
permanently on the agenda includes countering weapons of mass
destruction, which in 1997 was only a possible issue, and
another--terrorism--which had not even been thought of. Both now
matter deeply to the United States and the Western allies; Russia's
help can be crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the new NATO-Russia Council is surrounded by so-called
safeguards that make it not much better than the old council. NATO
allies have to agree before any item goes on the agenda; both NATO
and Russia retain the right to act separately on any item; any NATO
ally, on its own, can pull an item off the agenda. And, of course,
NATO retains the sole right to decide which nation it admits to
membership and how it structures and operates its military forces.</TE>
<TE>   But five years and a major rupture to the global system on Sept.
11 do make a difference. In that period, Russian and NATO soldiers
have worked together successfully in keeping the peace in Bosnia and
Kosovo. NATO military representatives finally are being received in
the Russian Defense Ministry. With Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic celebrating three years of NATO membership, other Central
European states feel more secure. And Russia, though still opposing
NATO expansion, is now resigned to it.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, in the wake of Sept. 11, Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin appears to have made a strategic choice to throw in
with the West. This raises the stakes for next week. Neither Russia
nor NATO can afford a second effort that goes off half-cocked,
perhaps this time destroyed by differences over the Middle East
(especially Iraq), the Caucasus or Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes also are raised for the possibilities. If NATO and
Russia focus just on the machinery of cooperation and possible common
action, they are likely to be caught up again in political
game-playing.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is for both sides to focus more on what they do than on
how they do it. This means not reaching for the moon at first: not
trying to define joint approaches to countering terrorism (when even
the NATO allies, much less the allies and Russia, do not agree on
what "international terrorism" is or what they should do about it)
and not trying to coalesce on a policy against Iraq, where the same
fault lines exist among the 20 countries.</TE>
<TE>   It also means not looking toward Russian membership in NATO any
time soon. Neither side wants that; what both should want is for
Russia to have a workable "alliance with the alliance."</TE>
<TE>   And it means starting small, one careful step at a time.
Possibilities include cooperating in civil emergency planning, where
NATO and Russia already have a good track record; conducting joint
military exercises, including in Russia; engaging Russian forces with
the existing Polish, German and Danish corps; creating a
Euro-Atlantic regional security strategy group, also involving
Central European states, to develop common planning, especially for
peacemaking and peacekeeping; stationing Russian officers at NATO
military headquarters and NATO officers at Russian headquarters;
creating a counter-terrorism information sharing center; and
expanding the Russian and Central European role in NATO training
efforts like the Marshall Center in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of this type of effort is not its modesty but its
practicality, its potential for building the mutual trust to turn
common interests into common action. This is the stuff that will
validate the grand hopes that have emerged in Russia's relations with
the West since Sept. 11. Done carefully, deliberately and with wisdom
about both problems and possibilities, this can lead to a dramatic
reshaping of Eurasian security.</TE>

<HD>Audit Reform's Hard Grind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors by now have plenty of reasons other than Enron to be
jittery about the truthfulness of corporate balance sheets. On
Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged five former
executives of Northern California high-tech firms Unify, Quintus and
Legato Systems with falsely inflating sales figures. It also charged
auditing firm Ernst &amp; Young with conflicts of interest involving the
joint development and sale of software with a company it was
auditing, PeopleSoft.</LD>
<LD>   These latest cases of potential corporate malfeasance should
prompt Congress to act, even as the auditing industry works
feverishly to stymie reform.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of Enron, federal regulators have opened 49
investigations into corporate financial reporting. But enforcement,
however belated, is not enough. Tougher rules and standards also need
to be put on the books.</LD>
<TE>   The House made a stab at reform in April, passing a bill by Rep.
Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) that would have the SEC create and oversee
a five-member auditing board. But under the rules, up to four members
could be from the accounting industry and the board probably would
have to rely on accounting firm assessments for funds. Far simpler
and tougher is legislation by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, that would provide for an
independent auditing board representing the public interest and
funded by Congress. Sarbanes' bill, strongly endorsed by respected
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, also would crack
down on accountants who left their positions to work for companies
they recently audited. It would require them to wait at least a year
before taking the new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   To hear the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
tell it, these modest reforms would be sugar in the gas tank of
capitalism. They would result in "serious, harmful consequences."
Reform opponents on the Banking Committee, led by Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas), succeeded in weighing down the bill with 123 killer
amendments. When Congress returns from the Memorial Day recess, it
should strip out the amendments and pass the original bill.</TE>
<TE>   This is a tough fight, a smaller version of the pitched battle
over campaign finance reform. Killer amendments are offered by
politicians who swear they really, truly support reform. The real
forces of reform then have to marshal their troops and return
straying votes to the fold. It may be a long grind, but it must
succeed. Otherwise, the accounting industry will remain accountable
mainly to itself. We know where that led.</TE>

<LD>There's a consensus forming in the state Legislature that the most
painful and damaging budget cut proposed by Gov. Gray Davis is the
$758 million that would come from Medi-Cal health insurance programs
for the working poor. But the hard truth is that most of Davis' cuts
may be unavoidable in light of the $23.6-billion budget shortfall.
That's why the Senate Budget Committee, which will begin hearings
Thursday on the governor's budget proposals, should be careful to
focus on restoring programs that in part can pay for themselves and
on paying for the restorations with new cuts or revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Here are three changes that make sense, ones that would help keep
counties solvent and create savings elsewhere in the budget:</LD>
<LD>   * Allow Medi-Cal patients to reapply for their health coverage
annually, as they do now, rather than four times a year, as Davis
proposes. The governor would use a bureaucratic device for reducing
the Medi-Cal rolls and sticking counties with the cost of caring for
indigent patients. The seriously mentally ill in particular would
lose coverage because they couldn't deal with repeated applications
for Medi-Cal. That would mean more people living on the streets,
untreated. The streamlined system went into effect in 2001 after hard
lobbying by advocates and editorial boards, including this one,
urging the change. It will be hard to restore if it is lost.</LD>
<TE>   * Trim the state prison budget. Davis' only reckless spending is a
$186-million increase in the state prison budget. Prison guards and
their union are among Davis' biggest campaign donors, but, according
to the governor's own officials, the state prison population
decreased by more than 4,600 last year alone. On Saturday, a Senate
subcommittee recommended taking $8million out of the prison budget
and using it to restore full funding for drug courts, a $15-million
program that saves taxpayers at least $43.4 million a year according
to the Davis administration's own count, by keeping people out of
jail and clean and by keeping their children out of expensive,
potentially traumatic foster-care group homes.</TE>
<TE>   * Support two proposals to keep people out of prisons. The first,
by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), would put 4,100 of the
75,000 people who violate parole each year through trivial,
nonviolent offenses on intense "supervision parole" rather than in
prison. Davis' own prisons department singled out the 4,100 as people
who posed the least risk to public safety, and the program would save
$18 million a year. A second proposal would restore the $14 million
that Davis eliminated from programs, such as the Village in Long
Beach, that employ health professionals and recovering addicts to
help people suffering from mental illness or addictions.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, more revenue would be needed to do these things, despite
their potential savings. Legislators may have to restore the annual
vehicle license renewal fee to the level it was at during the Pete
Wilson administration, and do it sooner than the middle of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Such steps would help keep the counties out of deeper fiscal
trouble. Retaining basic health-care improvements for the working
poor and mentally ill would help keep them out of emergency rooms
and, ultimately, off the streets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a little more than a year, comfortable commuters aboard the new
Gold Line train from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles will be able to
wave at the long line of drivers that daily snakes along the Pasadena
and Foothill freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Some residents were unhappy with the state Public Utilities
Commission's decision last week to approve the Gold Line without
substantial design changes. But the commissioners reasoned their way
to the right decision, one that could be a template for other lines
in the region's emerging light rail network.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-mile line's critics, concerned about the noise and safety
risk posed by 250 trains carrying 38,000 riders a day through dense
neighborhoods, had for years pushed officials to require the trains
to run in long trenches through Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   That requirement would have added as much as $100 million to the
Gold Line's cost and pushed the July 2003 start date back by as much
as a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the PUC, which oversees rail safety, voted 3 to 2 on
Thursday to proceed with the current railway design, which includes
the disputed street-level crossings, although the agency did impose
noise and speed reductions along some portions of the route.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Geoffrey Brown of San Francisco, a city that has long
had light rail and cable cars on congested streets, concluded that
"compared to other lines that I know, this will be a safe operation."
He has hit on a big part of the problem here. Los Angeles has so
little experience with commuter trains that many of us are more
afraid of the trains than of the speeding motorists, drunk drivers
and hit-and-run criminals who have become bread-and-butter fare for
the 11 o'clock news. Those fears threaten progress on other routes,
including the Exposition Line planned between Santa Monica and
downtown L.A</TE>
<TE>   Of course, trains can pose a danger to motorists and pedestrians,
and planners need to do all they can within reason to increase
safety. But the responsibility for many accidents rests with drivers
who recklessly try to beat trains to crossings and pedestrians who
walk on or across tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Design improvements at street crossings and an aggressive campaign
to boost public awareness of train safety have cut accidents 79% in
the last three years along the Blue Line, between Long Beach and Los
Angeles. Local and state transportation planners have learned hard
lessons from this experience, lessons they are applying to the Gold
Line.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cheney Says Bush Handled Hijack Warning Correctly," May 20: Isn't
it curious how things work in this administration? Questions are
being raised about the competence of that whole crowd in light of the
information it had about possible terrorist attacks, and now,
paraphrasing Vice President Dick Cheney, he's saying that we're about
to be attacked again, it's just a matter of time, it's almost
inevitable, and boy, we'd all better get behind our commander in
chief, because after all, this is war--not the time to criticize or
investigate, that's not patriotic, and besides, it wasn't our fault,
we didn't have enough specific information to act on. Give me a
break!</LD>
<LD>   Every time someone raises an issue the White House doesn't like,
just trot out the war banners and put on a verbal parade, scare the
hell out of them, let them think that the only thing that stands
between them and certain destruction is the Republican Party with its
guns, its morality and its resolve. Well, folks, it may be working
this time, but someday the people will notice that the emperor not
only doesn't have clothes, he doesn't have any brains either.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Extends Hand to Cubans," May 20: I was interested to hear
President Bush tell Cuba how its country should be run as a condition
for trade with the U.S. How is it that the same message has not been
sent to countries also known for human rights violations and
nondemocratic governments, i.e. Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, etc.,
with which we now trade?</LD>

open up to democracy. So shouldn't he want to embargo China for the

votes--and confirm his indifference to integrity.</TE>

<LD>The Times reports that the Gold Line light rail project has finally
been given approval to complete the street crossings remaining (May
17). I lived 30 feet from those tracks during the 1940s, when huge
numbers of trains regularly rumbled along, crossing gates were nearly
nonexistent and people still mostly managed not to get run over. I
can only shake my head at the fuss over quiet, two-car trains that
take 20 seconds to pass behind lowered gates. All the complaints and
threatened expenses just to safeguard people who are too stupid to
stop for lowered railroad-crossing gates.</LD>

<LD>Re "An Unholy Alliance in Support of Israel," Opinion, May 19: When
are people going to understand that it is not hateful when one has a
belief that is contrary to others? The Christians honestly believe in
their Gospel. They believe that in the final days Jesus will first
show himself to the Jews and then they will know he is the Messiah
and all will be well.</LD>
<LD>   Do I believe in that? No. But as a Jew, I'm not insulted by
another's belief. It's not going to happen, as far as I'm concerned,
and yet I appreciate the respect Christians have toward me. Let
Christians have their faith, and I will only judge people on how they
treat me as a person. A healthy alliance does exist when both groups
have the same interest at heart. If people are secure in their faith,
or lack of faith, they should have nothing to fear from opposite
beliefs.</LD>

<HD>Kaiser: Time Is Money in Call-Center Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a former Kaiser Permanente call-center employee, I found "Kaiser
Clerks Paid More for Helping Less" (May 17) quite interesting. I
worked in the Vallejo call center for nearly two years, primarily in
the obstetrics/gynecology specialty queue. Although the scripts we
were required to follow made transfers to nurses mandatory for most
symptomatic patients with ob/gyn concerns, I was constantly pressured
to keep my transfer rate below 35%, not 50%. The 35% rate was
consistently enforced for all employees, including evening and
weekend staff members, who could not book appointments because the
Kaiser facilities were closed. Management wanted us to send messages
to medical providers whenever possible, even when we knew that the
messages would not be answered for several days.</LD>
<LD>   Because I do not have a medical background, I worried a lot about
symptomatic patients and transferred them to a nurse if I had any
doubts about the best course of action. Although I managed to earn a
bonus every quarter, I finally decided that the job was causing more
stress than I wanted in part-time employment (I am a retired state
auditor). By the way, even though the bonus program has been stopped,
appointment clerks were still receiving management feedback on
call-handling time and transfer rates on May 10, my last day at
Kaiser.</LD>
<LD>   Ellen Weaver</LD>
<TE>   American Canyon, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Kaiser's "incentive" program for its message center
employees, I find myself stunned. Certainly Kaiser's policy of paying
a bonus to switchboard operators for keeping their interactions with
patients short cannot be faulted. After all, this is simply a way to
reward them for increasing their productivity by handling more calls
per shift. As long as this criterion is tempered by evaluating
patient satisfaction as well, I do not see a problem.</TE>
<TE>   However, paying bonuses for limiting patients' access to telephone
"triage" nurses or their ability to even schedule an appointment with
a doctor is as perverse an incentive as any I can think of. These
employees are not health-care professionals. There appears to be only
two ways to achieve these ends: dispense advice in lieu of
transferring the call to a trained nurse and convince callers they do
not need a doctor's appointment. Both of these approaches are, to put
it mildly, problematic.</TE>
<TE>   John S. Ford MD</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find it absolutely astounding that telephone clerks, in the name
of efficiency and subsequent bonuses, were making decisions on who
got to see a doctor or talk to a nurse! As a Kaiser Permanente
customer, this information is especially appalling since we have been
informed that, effective Jan. 1, our premiums will be increased by
25%. Lest the focus of the decision be foisted off on clerks, let's
not forget that evidently Kaiser executives failed to consider the
other overriding part of the service delivery formula, i.e., will
this action "improve quality of service"?</TE>

<HD>Borough Proposal Submitted to Council</HD>
<DH>Government: If approved, a charter amendment for the plan
would appear on the Nov. 5 ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK MCGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to create a borough system in Los Angeles was submitted
Tuesday to the City Council by five of its members. If approved by
the council, it would go to voters on Nov. 5, providing the city's
electorate with an alternative to an expected secession measure or
measures that same day.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal calls for a charter amendment that would create an
elected, 15-member commission to draft a plan within a year. That
commission would be required to divide the city into boroughs, each
of which would elect its own board to handle local budget and
planning decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The motion was introduced by Councilwomen Wendy Greuel and Janice
Hahn and seconded by council members Tom LaBonge, Jan Perry and
Dennis Zine.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a study," Greuel said. "This is a binding
reorganization that dramatically moves power away from City Hall and
to the local communities."</TE>
<TE>   Although she picked up some support from additional council
members, some secessionists viewed the motion as an attempt to derail
their efforts and some council members greeted the move skeptically.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had floated this two or three years ago, it might have
been taken seriously," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "To me it looks
like a blatant attempt to sidetrack a vote on secession."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Hahn said she supported a similar effort as a charter
reform commissioner in 1997. That proposal was set aside by the
charter panel in favor of other changes, including the creation of a
citywide neighborhood council network.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the key feature of the borough system would be to have
city departments coordinate with each borough to provide the level of
service they demand.</TE>
<TE>   "This takes all the negative aspects, all the uncertainties about
breaking the city up and says we can stay together and clearly we
heard from the public that they want a government that better serves
the constituents," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, Mayor James K. Hahn, was noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an interesting idea," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook.
"But what the mayor is focused on is the neighborhood councils.
That's his priority in terms of empowering neighborhoods and getting
communities involved in working with the city."</TE>
<TE>   The borough proposal would keep the neighborhood council system to
complement the borough boards. It also would, to the extent legal,
"increase community borough control over neighborhood public
schools," although it does not say how.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said she wants to hear more details
about how the borough system would work before she decides whether
she can support it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is innovative. It is attractive," said Miscikowski, who
opposes secession efforts by the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and
the harbor area. "I'm not so sure it can be precipitated quickly. I
think we need to give it a lot of thought."</TE>
<TE>   But some secessionists portrayed the proposal as a ploy to
undermine plans to break up the city. Gene La Pietra, president of
Hollywood Vote, likened the proposal to putting a ringer candidate on
the ballot to take votes from a legitimate contender.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cheap trick," he said. "Obviously, the intent is to
deprive the people of Los Angeles of an honest vote."</TE>
<TE>   After being introduced, the proposal was referred to two council
committees Tuesday. Those committees will consider the measure and
make recommendations to the full council, which has until late August
to act.</TE>

<HD>Walter Lord, 84; Wrote 'A Night to Remember' on  Sinking of
Titanic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Lord, pioneering author who popularized a "you are there"
documentary approach to history that twice landed his seminal work,
"A Night to Remember," about the sinking of the Titanic, on the
bestseller list, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Lord died Sunday at his New York City home after a long struggle
with Parkinson's disease. He had been using a wheelchair for several
years.</LD>
<LD>   The collision of the most luxurious and biggest ship yet built
with an iceberg in the North Atlantic on April 14, 1912, and the
subsequent disaster that cost more than 1,500 lives have been the
subject of half a dozen films, several plays, an opera, a musical and
more than 100 books, songs and poems.</LD>
<TE>   Lord happened on one of those books when he was 10 and grew up to
write the definitive volume that restored the tragedy to the cultural
memory after it had been all but forgotten through two world wars.</TE>
<TE>   His "A Night to Remember," published in 1955, has never been out
of print.</TE>
<TE>   It became a bestseller immediately upon publication and again in
1998 in the mania sparked by James Cameron's film "Titanic," on which
Lord served as advisor.</TE>
<TE>   When Cameron accepted two of the film's 11 awards, for best
picture and directing, he called the Oscar ceremony "a night to
remember" alluding to Lord's book.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a remarkable story," Lord told The Times in 1986, as
intrigued as ever with the ship whose remains had been discovered on
the ocean floor by Robert D. Ballard and his mini-submarine Alvin.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the largest ship, the biggest thing man had ever built,
the most luxurious ship, proclaimed unsinkable, filled with the most
glamorous people of the age, sinking on its first voyage, taking
1,500 lives. Who could believe it?"</TE>
<TE>   The slim book the boy found in his aunt's Maryland home in 1927
was one of the first published about the disaster: "The Loss of the
S.S. Titanic" by an English science teacher who had been a passenger
aboard the "unsinkable" White Star liner.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hooked," Lord told the Baltimore Sun four years ago,
brandishing the little volume he had kept for 70 years. "This is the
book that caused all of the trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed, Lord, the son of a Baltimore lawyer, drew pictures of
the Titanic in his preppy days, and for his senior speech offered an
evocative and vivid account of the ship's sinking that gave several
classmates nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   Lord studied American and modern European history at Princeton and
then attended Yale Law School until World War II intervened, sending
him to the Office of Strategic Services to assemble intelligence
reports.</TE>
<TE>   He completed his law degree after the war but instead of
practicing, became a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency, touting after-shave lotion, trucks and beer.</TE>
<TE>   His career as an author began with the same kind of opportune
discovery as his fascination with the sinking of the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   In a Manhattan bookstore, the young adman chanced upon an 1874
diary of a British officer who fought for the Confederacy during the
Civil War. Lord bought the diary for $2, edited it and republished it
with the title "The Freemantle Diary."</TE>
<TE>   An editor and friend soon suggested that Lord turn his absorption
with the Titanic into a book of his own. Lord began work on what he
considered "the most exciting news story that ever happened."</TE>
<TE>   His approach, now commonplace, was unusual half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   He tracked down 63 of the Titanic passengers and, like a reporter
covering some up-to-the-minute tragedy, interviewed them about what
he called "a night of horror that those who survived it would never
forget."</TE>
<TE>   Lord not only revived the Titanic disaster and gave it a new
status in history, but he also launched a technique of telling
history through the eyes of those who lived it.</TE>
<TE>   "History is a wonderful guide to human behavior," Lord told
Contemporary Authors, "and that is why people fascinate me so much.
If we study them carefully enough, maybe next time we'll be able to
recognize just a little bit sooner a hero or a villain, a leader or a
knave.... In 'A Night to Remember' I tried to get across the point
that wealth, position, rank and the like have very little to do with
whether a person is good or bad, quick or slow, brave or perhaps not
so brave. We get all that somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Lord's best-known book was made into a British film of the same
title in 1958, in a straightforward documentary style without the
intervening love story and other subplots of Cameron's "Titanic." A
1994 Times review noted that the well-drilled ensemble "reflects the
courage, cowardice, foolishness and Edwardian morality of the time
with believable accuracy."</TE>
<TE>   After perfecting his research method--favoring personal interviews
or diaries of actual witnesses more than official records and
reports--Lord expanded the technique further, even interviewing
Japanese pilots for his next book, "Day of Infamy," about the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "Interviewing the enemy--nobody had done that before," Evan
Thomas, Lord's friend and a Newsweek editor, told Associated Press on
Monday in announcing Lord's death.</TE>
<TE>   Lord continued personalizing history with "The Good Years" in
1960, a book about early 20th century America that was made into a
television special starring Henry Fonda.</TE>
<TE>   His following books included "A Time to Stand" in 1961, about the
Alamo; "Peary to the Pole" in 1963, about the admiral's exploratory
voyage; "The Past That Would Not Die" in 1965, about James Meredith's
integration of the University of Mississippi; "Incredible Victory" in
1967, about the Battle of Midway, which was the turning point in the
Pacific during World War II; "The Dawn's Early Light" in 1972, about
the British attacking Baltimore in the War of 1812; "Lonely Vigil" in
1977, about World War II coast watchers in the Pacific; and "The
Miracle of Dunkirk" in 1982, about the Allies' preservative retreat
from the Nazis in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   All of Lord's books became bestsellers, but none were as beloved
or remembered as his works on the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the historian published his final book, a second look at
the Titanic, "The Night Lives On."</TE>
<TE>   In that sequel, he reported what he had learned since writing the
first book, including debunking many myths about the big ship's
watery demise.</TE>
<TE>   He disputed, for example, the myth that the band supposedly sank
into the water playing "Nearer My God to Thee."</TE>
<TE>   More likely, he told The Times in 1986, they were playing a
popular light waltz because they were trying to cheer up the
passengers. And, despite what many like to believe, when the waters
rose, he said, they tossed their instruments and ran like everybody
else.</TE>
<TE>   Lord befriended many Titanic survivors, and they willed him
personal possessions that became greatly prized items in his vast
collection of the ship's memorabilia--such as the embroidered evening
slippers worn by the late Edith Russell when she stepped into a
lifeboat and the musical pig she used to entertain a surviving child.</TE>
<TE>   Lord's trove of Titanic memorabilia, including books, paintings,
photographs and items that were aboard the sinking ship, will be
given to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, who never married, had no immediate survivors.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Historical Society will host a memorial service for
him June 10.</TE>

<HD>Zypora Spaisman, 86; Fixture in New York's Yiddish Theater
Scene</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zypora Spaisman, 86, a fixture in New York's singular Yiddish theater
scene for half a century, died Saturday of cerebral trauma in a New
York hospital, said her son, Ben-Ami Spaisman.</LD>
<LD>   Born Zypora Tanenbaum in Lublin, Poland, she began acting in the
Polish State Theatre at age 10 and never stopped.</LD>
<LD>   After attending nursing school and marrying Joseph Spaisman, she
became a midwife.</LD>
<TE>   The couple fled Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 only to be
interned in a Russian labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   The midwife delivered more than 1,000 babies, and organized other
internees to perform Yiddish theater in the barracks.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaismans returned briefly to Poland, then moved to Paris and
Montreal before settling in New York City in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Spaisman immersed herself in the Folksbiene (People's Stage)
Yiddish Theatre, founded in 1915 and the oldest continuous theater of
its type in the world.</TE>
<TE>   She acted, raised money and served as artistic director,
single-handedly keeping the theater afloat for more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   But after an acrimonious separation over modernizing management,
Spaisman formed her own competing Yiddish Public Theatre in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Spaisman earned an Obie award, a Drama Desk award and a New York
City People's Choice award for her acting.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her extensive stage resume, she appeared in such
films as "Enemies: A Love Story," directed by Paul Mazursky and
starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver, in 1989.</TE>

<LD>   On a 6-1 vote, the bill, SB 1520 by Sen. Deborah Ortiz
(D-Sacramento), failed to get the eight votes needed to clear the
Senate Education Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz said she was disappointed that three of her Democratic
counterparts on the committee chose not to vote on the measure, which
had garnered strong opposition from the soda industry.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it lacks political courage," Ortiz said. "It's really bad
for us to be supporting, let alone encouraging, sodas in school."</TE>
<TE>   The measure sought to phase out soda sales during school hours
over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month Ortiz abandoned her plan to raise taxes on soda
to help fight childhood obesity after the proposal came under fire
from the state's business community and conservative lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said she has no plans, however, to drop her fight to improve
nutrition among California's youth and will introduce related
legislation next year. The state's schoolchildren, she contends,
consume more soda than water or milk, and one-third are overweight or
obese.</TE>

<HD>Report Warns of Beach Erosion</HD>
<DH>Environment: Surfrider Foundation predicts that the use of
sea walls and jetties will alter the coastline for the worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sea walls and other artificial barriers built to protect oceanfront
property against erosion are self-defeating and represent a major
threat to the state's shoreline, a new environmental report warned
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Surfrider Foundation predicted in its third annual State of
the Beach Report that if the use of sea walls, jetties and revetments
continues unchecked in California, many popular beaches will
eventually be stripped of their sand.</LD>
<LD>   "Armoring the coast does not work," said Chris Evans, executive
director of the Surfrider Foundation, which has 56 chapters across
the country. "No question about it, our beaches are disappearing."</LD>
<TE>   About a quarter of the coastline along a 535-mile stretch from San
Francisco to the Mexican border is now fortified against erosion,
according to the California Coastal Commission. The agency estimates
that about 10 miles of sea walls were added in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Almost the entire coast from Dana Point to San Clemente in Orange
County is armored, as well as 74% of northern Monterey Bay, 65% of
Ventura County's coastline and 45% in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say the proliferation of jetties, sea walls and
boulders placed at the base of oceanfront bluffs is altering the
character of the California coast for the worst. The structures can
destroy public access and deprive the state's beaches of their most
valuable asset by disrupting the natural forces that move sand along
the shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, critics say, the artificial barriers succumb to the
sea's constant pounding, providing only temporary relief to wealthy
property owners at the expense of the rest of the state's beachgoers.</TE>
<TE>   The problems have prompted some states to ban sea walls, while
others have imposed substantial restrictions. In California, such
erosion controls remain popular because state law requires their
approval if structures are threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, the California Resources Agency began
considering changes that could limit shoreline armoring. It was the
agency's first proposed revision of statewide coastal erosion
policies in 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The only long-term solution is some kind of managed retreat from
the beach," said Chad Nelsen, Surfrider's environmental director and
author of the beach report. "There are already places where the beach
is gone at high tide."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's yearly report evaluates the health of the
nation's coastline using several factors, including beach access,
water quality, erosion and surfing areas. The study involves 20
coastal states where Surfrider has chapters.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the hole in the ozone layer, we know that the California
coastline as well as the nation's coastline are in decline," Evans
said. "The report is an attempt to see how we are doing across time."</TE>
<TE>   Besides highlighting beach erosion, the foundation gave low marks
to California for coastal water quality, noting that state beaches
were closed or posted with pollution warnings 6,000 times in 2000,
almost double the incidents of the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Ocean testing in the state has revealed the continual presence of
pesticides and herbicides as well as human viruses, fecal coliform
and other disease-causing bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   The report stated that from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border
alone, there were 19 sewage outfalls that discharge about 1.2 billion
gallons of polluted water into the ocean every day.</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, Surfrider officials praised the California
Coastal Conservancy, which has spent more than $200 million since
1976 to protect and restore coastal resources.</TE>

<HD>Convention Center, Taxpayers Seeing Red</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hotel Seen as Convention Center Savior," May 20: So the
Convention Center is failing and a taxpayer-funded hotel is the
answer. Why stop there? If the plan is to entice visitors, why not
have taxpayers fund an improved public transit system--including
light rail--so visitors can spread their money all over? Why not have
taxpayers subsidize the cost of ticket prices at area theme parks to
make them more affordable?</LD>
<LD>   Or why not just give visitors taxpayer money to come? People
arriving at LAX would be asked if they're thinking about going to the
Convention Center. If they say yes, they're given $100. Or maybe
people would go to the Convention Center if there were a football
stadium nearby--oh, that sneaky plan is already in the works. Or
maybe they should go ahead and build the hotel but turn it into
classrooms. Visitors will just have to stay at the other hotels
downtown--the ones that were built without public money.</LD>
<LD>   Or, wait--here's the solution: Don't build the hotel to turn it
into classrooms; turn the Convention Center into classrooms. And
build the light rail system.</LD>

<TE>   When all of our children are in modern, well-staffed schools and
all of our citizens are in decent housing, then and only then should
the city use our borrowing power to help finance a new stadium and a
Los Angeles NFL team. If this is such a good deal, why don't the NFL
and the proposed franchise holders put their borrowing power behind
it?</TE>

<TE>   Regarding the proposed football stadium near Staples Center: I've
heard no mention of how people would get to these venues. Suppose
that a football game, an event at Staples Center and events at the
Music Center and the new Disney Concert Hall all occur on the same
night. Add to that all the workers who commute on the freeways. True,
a subway is available in some areas, but certainly not to many other
parts of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   We now have to allow one hour to get to the Music Center from West
L.A. (about 20 miles away). It's hard to imagine what the commute
time might be if and when this new stadium is built, but my guess is
that traffic congestion would be unimaginable.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recently I read about a survey that charted the expenditures of
Proposition K funds and concluded that, to date, the bond money,
which was voted by L.A. residents in 1996 for kids and family
recreation, has been unevenly distributed in the outlying City
Council districts as compared with the inner-city districts. I
thought the assessment simplistic, as we all know that the inner-city
neighborhoods are far more densely populated than the newer
neighborhoods, and it is unfair to expect the Proposition K grants to
make up for the "under-parked" inner city without condemning property
and displacing people.</TE>
<TE>   Now, to read that city leaders are considering "revitalizing"
blighted areas of downtown by building 12,900 housing units and up to
6.7million square feet of new commercial and industrial development,
including a hotel, and now a new football stadium, I wonder, what are
they thinking? Nowhere in the discussion have I heard about open
space and parks--those amenities that really do draw people together
and provide a respite from the noise, traffic and stress that
accompany "revitalization."</TE>

<HD>Daschle Joins Those Urging Independent 9/11 Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Congress: Chances for an outside review grow dim. Some
Democrats join Bush in saying congressional panels should conduct
probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) on Tuesday joined those
calling for an independent commission to investigate government
intelligence failures preceding Sept. 11, but it seems increasingly
unlikely that such a panel will get off the ground.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is resolutely opposed by President Bush and House
Republican leaders, who have the power to keep the proposal from
coming to a vote and who view it as a political ploy by ambitious
Democrats. "We must not allow the president to be undermined by those
who want his job," said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</LD>
<LD>   And even some Democrats oppose setting up an independent
commission, arguing that the sensitive probe should be left to the
House and Senate Intelligence committees. For months, these panels
have been conducting a joint inquiry into why government officials
were not better prepared for terrorist attacks and what can be
learned from the lapses.</LD>
<TE>   "Let them do their job," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D-Del.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate
Intelligence panel, said she feared an independent commission,
complete with public hearings and debate, would "add a lot of heat,
not necessarily light right now."</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing was Daschle, Bush's leading Democratic adversary in
Congress and a possible presidential contender in 2004. He joined a
growing phalanx of politicians and outside analysts in arguing that
only an independent commission can conduct an investigation broad and
nonpartisan enough to ensure improvements by intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's endorsement was especially important because, as
majority leader, he has the power to bring such a measure before the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   A Daschle aide said the proposal may be introduced as an amendment
to an emergency spending bill this week.</TE>
<TE>   The debate's differing voices provide a classic example of how in
Washington power struggles, views often are shaped by institutional
forces as well as partisan ones. Where you stand often depends on
where you sit, according to an old capital truism. Thus, the
Democrats most likely to oppose the idea of creating a new commission
are the ones--like Feinstein--who sit on the Intelligence committees
and have a stake in the ongoing probe.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Congress sets up an independent commission, one thing is
clear: Lawmakers are not going to keep quiet and abide by Bush's call
for an end to congressional second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the primary functions of a Congress is to second-guess,"
said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.).</TE>
<TE>   The joint inquiry by the House and Senate Intelligence panels of
whether the government may have ignored terrorist threats before
Sept. 11 began in February.</TE>
<TE>   The work has been beset by problems, including the resignation of
the former CIA official who had been hired to lead the probe. Also,
lawmakers leading the investigation have complained that the Justice
Department and CIA have been uncooperative.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, lawmakers emerged from a meeting with Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft expressing more confidence that the administration
would cooperate with their inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   House Intelligence Chairman Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) said he hoped
a public hearing would be held in about a month and that a report
would be produced in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The clamor for an independent review grew on Capitol Hill last
week after the revelation that Bush was told in early August that
associates of Osama bin Laden might be planning to hijack aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said the warnings were vague and seem
only in hindsight to have merited special attention.</TE>
<TE>   Those pushing for an independent commission include Sens. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), and House
Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say an independent panel would be free from the
election-year partisanship that threatens to undermine any
congressional investigation.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue that such a panel would be able to explore a
broader range of questions about such areas as immigration policy,
transportation security and other issues not addressed by the
House-Senate investigation, which is focused exclusively on
intelligence matters.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say an independent commission would duplicate or
impede the efforts of the inquiry, as well as threaten the secrecy of
sensitive intelligence matters.</TE>
<TE>   Republican lawmakers also argued that setting up a new panel would
be time-consuming, thwarting the public's need for a timely
examination of troubling security questions.</TE>
<TE>   "The public wants the answers tomorrow," said Sen. John Warner
(R-Va.).</TE>

<HD>Giving Credit to Those Who Influenced Ad Man</HD>

<LD>Nice tribute to a distinguished advertiser/business leader ("He
Totally Got It," May 9, by Reed Johnson), but the writer failed to
credit those before Jay Chiat who undoubtedly influenced him: the
founders and practically everyone at Doyle Dane Bernbach in the late
'50s and '60s--Carl Ally, Jack Tinker, Mary Wells Lawrence--as well
as West Coast-style originators such as Carson Roberts, the L.A.
office of Doyle Dane, and the whole creative revolution in
advertising of that era. It wasn't all "inane jingles by huge
conglomerates" until Chiat/Day came along. Jay Chiat would have been
the first to give credit to those whose influences made his success
possible.</LD>

<HD>Society's Troubling Double Standard</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandy Banks ("Whom Can You Trust," May 7) betrays society's
ambivalence and double standard when she portrays a relationship
between a (female) teacher and her (male) student as "a monthlong
affair" in the same breath as "priests molesting altar boys."</LD>
<LD>   Switch the terms around and you see just how bizarre is this
difference in terminology: teacher molesting her 16-year-old student,
priest having an affair with an altar boy. Our society needs to come
to terms (the pun is intended) with these issues. Unfortunately, our
emotions run far too high for objective consideration right now.</LD>

<LD>Zypora Spaisman, 86; Fixture in New York's Yiddish Theater Scene</LD>
<LD>   Zypora Spaisman, 86, a fixture in New York's singular Yiddish
theater scene for half a century, died Saturday of cerebral trauma in
a New York hospital, said her son, Ben-Ami Spaisman.</LD>
<LD>   Born Zypora Tanenbaum in Lublin, Poland, she began acting in the
Polish State Theatre at age 10 and never stopped.</LD>
<TE>   After attending nursing school and marrying Joseph Spaisman, she
became a midwife.</TE>
<TE>   The couple fled Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 only to be
interned in a Russian labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   The midwife delivered more than 1,000 babies, and organized other
internees to perform Yiddish theater in the barracks.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaismans returned briefly to Poland, then moved to Paris and
Montreal before settling in New York City in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Spaisman immersed herself in the Folksbiene (People's Stage)
Yiddish Theatre, founded in 1915 and the oldest continuous theater of
its type in the world.</TE>
<TE>   She acted, raised money and served as artistic director,
single-handedly keeping the theater afloat for more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   But after an acrimonious separation over modernizing management,
Spaisman formed her own competing Yiddish Public Theatre in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Spaisman earned an Obie award, a Drama Desk award and a New York
City People's Choice award for her acting.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her extensive stage resume, she appeared in such
films as "Enemies: A Love Story," directed by Paul Mazursky and
starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver, in 1989.</TE>

<TE>   Marc Lindenberg, 56; University Dean and Humanitarian Activist</TE>
<TE>   Marc Lindenberg, 56, dean of the University of Washington's Daniel
Evans School of Public Affairs and a noted humanitarian aid advocate,
died May 17 of lung cancer in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   As dean, Lindenberg started the university's first endowment and
recruited top scholars.</TE>
<TE>   He balanced his academic work with managerial posts in
nongovernmental organizations, and from 1992 to 1997 oversaw $400
million in relief and development programs in 36 countries for CARE
USA.</TE>
<TE>   He also was a board member of Oxfam America and the Desmond Tutu
Peace Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Lindenberg grew up in Pittsburgh and earned his bachelor's degree
in political science at Oberlin College in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his master's degree and doctorate at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Lindenberg taught at the University of Washington and the
University of Oregon in the early 1970s, and was assistant director
for the American Friends Service Committee Programs for Southeast
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the 1980s, Lindenberg was dean and professor at the
Central American Institute of Businessman Administration, founded in
conjunction with Harvard Business School, with campuses in Costa Rica
and Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   He later taught at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and
joined the University of Washington in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The university plans to launch a center for the study of
humanitarian action in his honor.</TE>

<TE>   Mel Zikes, 74; Former Sports Writer, Boating Columnist for The
Times</TE>
<TE>   Mel Zikes, 74, a former sports writer and boating enthusiast who
wrote a boating column for The Times four decades ago, died May6 of
heart failure in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville, said his wife,
Kathy.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Wichita, Kan., Zikes studied journalism at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he was a member of the Army's highly
decorated 101st Airborne Division, known as "the Screaming Eagles."
He was wounded during their assault on France.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Zikes wrote sports stories for newspapers in San
Antonio and San Diego and for magazines.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a Times sports column called "Waterways" from 1961 to
1962, about yacht races and developments in sail and motor boating.
Zikes later worked in public relations.</TE>
<TE>   An avid boater, Zikes competed in outboard championship races at
Lake Havasu and elsewhere around California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, he suffered a punctured lung and two fractured ribs when
he was thrown out of his speedboat in a turbulent wake at Lake
Havasu.</TE>
