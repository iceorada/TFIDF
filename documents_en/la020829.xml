<LD>MY SKY BLUE TRADES</LD>
<LD>   Growing Up Counter in a</LD>
<LD>   Contrary Time</LD>
<TE>   By Sven Birkerts</TE>
<TE>   Viking</TE>
<TE>   $24.95, 280 Pages</TE>
<TE>   Happily, Sven Birkerts' memoir, "My Sky Blue Trades," is not an
exercise in boomer nostalgia--though Birkerts, an essayist and
literary critic, did come of age in the turbulent '60s, did hitch his
way to Woodstock and did attend the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, where the confluence of liberal learning and liberal times
created countless ways to express one's disaffection with society.</TE>
<TE>   Birkerts flirted with hippiedom, but he didn't go much further
than blowing off classes, experimenting with hallucinogens and
bumming around Europe. (OK, he also met Wavy Gravy).</TE>
<TE>   Though his book is subtitled "Growing Up Counter in a Contrary
Time," don't mistake it for the confessions of an ex-radical. Rather,
what is most counter about Birkerts--and what comprises the pingpong
of his identity crisis--is his Latvian heritage on the one hand, the
deeply felt family history that made him feel like an outsider in the
Detroit suburbs where he grew up, and his resistance to the
middle-class values that made him an outsider at home.</TE>
<TE>   With "My Sky Blue Trades," Birkerts turns his critical skills--he
is a regular contributor to such publications as Harper's, the
Atlantic Monthly and the New York Review of Books and the author of
"The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic
Age"--onto his own life, delving not just into his past but that of
his parents and grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   He chooses what he pleases, concerned not too much with hard dates
and facts, and guided not so much by the critical events of his life
(although there are those too), as the sense of destiny that guided
"a good part of my adult life, especially through the long period of
my twenties."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how drained of significance his days seemed, Birkerts
knew there was a reason he was pushing a broom down a college
corridor or sorting titles in a bookstore. He knew he was going to be
a writer, but not before years of writerly aimlessness--sometimes
exuberant, sometimes benign.</TE>
<TE>   His college and post-college years are the most entertaining
portions of the book, with Birkerts dreaming of himself as the Henry
Miller of "Tropic of Cancer," describing his relationships with women
and the stabs at writing in shabby studio apartments.</TE>
<TE>   But such is Birkerts' reverence for the written word that he
sometimes overwrites. He doesn't just wake up, he drifts into "first
wakefulness." He recalls his discovery of rock 'n' roll at a time in
his life "when I was so focused on discerning what might be next,
that I registered the first tremors, the original signals of what
would be an eruption unlike anything I had known."</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Birkerts is properly cynical, after all these
years, about his self-mythologizing and his lack of commitment to the
rebellion of his times. "My sixties--my counterculture years--were
about striking poses, not striking," he writes. "I was full to the
brim with rage, but it was confused rage. I said it was against the
system, against the authority structure, but much more it was against
my father, the source, I thought, of my childhood estrangement from
everything I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, however, there were books, a constant safe haven for
his inner and outer turmoil and his lack of direction. Books (fiction
and poetry, mostly) became Birkerts' guardian, there to watch over
him during depressive intervals and to provide him with a livelihood,
time and again in his 20s, through a succession of bookstore jobs in
Ann Arbor and Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In "My Sky Blue Trades," we catch a glimpse of a writer attempting
to create a narrative of his life, and that Birkerts succeeds without
resorting to the tawdry or spectacular is a measure of his skill.</TE>

<HD>General Rides Again</HD>
<DH>A long-dormant Chinatown hangout rallies with an artsy
consciousness</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA LAMPRECHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I don't know what we're doing, but we're doing it," says architect
Mark McManus. "We're capitalists trying to preserve a soulful
enterprise."</LD>
<LD>   McManus is one of three partners who are reopening--and
re-conceiving--the much beloved but long-shut General Lee restaurant
on Gin Ling Way in Chinatown's Central Plaza. Though no longer owned
by the Lee family or anyone of Chinese heritage, the new incarnation
of the 140-year-old establishment still follows the Lee family
tradition of adapting the restaurant to the times. This General Lee
promises a novel aesthetic, a new menu and an even more ambitious
mission when it opens in October. (It may also have a new
name--permission to use "General Lee" is still being secured.)</LD>
<LD>   McManus stands in the 17-foot-high main space, where for the last
two decades the slatted bamboo screens on the tall south windows
filtered only a motionless light into the dark interior. Like a lot
of the regulars down here, he is dressed in forgettable clothes fit
for any kind of task. Here the task at hand is transforming the space
into a "public house." A bar-cafe. An artist's local and political
base.</LD>
<TE>   Today the bamboo screens are thrown back against the walls. The
air is bright with sawdust, the rotted interior replaced by
red-orange patterned plywood that runs floor to ceiling on the east
and west walls, identical to the building's unabashed exterior.
Beyond, a more intimate space with a low V-sloped ceiling houses the
bar, which is finished in the same red plywood. The only surviving
element from the past is the elegantly turned wood staircase leading
up to the studio and wood shop of home-grown, globally renowned
artist Jorge Pardo, partner number two.</TE>
<TE>   In the studio, the physics-educated, architecturally trained
McManus works with a handful of other artists, who help Pardo realize
his complicated sculptures and environments. The third partner is
Steve Hanson, co-owner of the art gallery China Art Objects, who
lives in Chinatown with his wife, artist Frances Stark. Founded in
January 1999, China Art Objects is one of the oldest "new" galleries
on nearby Chung King Road. Hanson's associations with Chinatown go
back to punk rock days in the 1980s. The new bar-cafe has won the
support of reigning Lee patriarch David Fon Lee, 81, building owner
and the restaurant's former proprietor, who perceives the trio as
kindred spirits in their boldness and savvy timing, given Chinatown's
resurgence. "They are risking, just as we risked coming here across
the water in a boat," he said. The project also has earned the
respect of neighboring business people, 23 of whom signed a petition
presented to the Community Redevelopment Agency supporting the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, a popular and well-known figure in Chinatown, said the family
restaurant dates back to a "2-by-4 shack" built in the 1860s by Lee's
Canton-born grandfather on the site of Old Chinatown at Union
Station. Later, they moved the business to a two-story building, with
a restaurant upstairs and an herb store downstairs.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1940s and '50s, the restaurant was run by four Lee
brothers, David, Norman, Merton and Walter. It had an ethnically
diverse but devoted clientele, Lee said, including "defense workers
needing a release at the end of the day, Gregory Peck, Otis Chandler,
news reporters"--one of whom suggested renaming it General Lee
because its original title, Man Jen Low ("Ten Thousand Treasures")
wasn't catchy. "People could remember General Lee's--it's like Prince
Romanov. There was no prince, either," Lee added.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing designer Rudi Gernreich designed the flamboyantly colored
waiters' uniforms which were displayed on the pages of Life magazine
in 1956 and were the envy of women diners who begged to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   When Chinatown began to languish in the mid-1980s, and David Lee's
son died in a car crash, he closed the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   None of the new partners have restaurateur bloodlines. Cuban-born
Pardo, 39, who graduated from Art Center College of Design's fine
arts program in 1988, holds an elite position in the international
art world. These days, his work is likely to be fabricated in Leeds
or Delft and exhibited in Tokyo or Rome. A huge new concrete house he
designed in Puerto Rico is nearly complete, its floor reminiscent of
the floor he designed with McManus' help for the Dia Center for the
Arts in New York in September 2000, an explosion of colorful ceramic
tiles patterned on fractal geometries.</TE>
<TE>   Pardo and his old friends, the architect and the art gallery
owner, are keeping their day jobs while they negotiate city
bureaucracy and the concerns of a community still smarting from
Chinatown's decline in the late 1970s, which was exacerbated by the
fallout of late-night revelers from the punk rock days of Madame
Wong's of the early '80s and then again by the 1992 riots. The
opening, originally slated for July, is now planned for October.</TE>
<TE>   The venue, which will host readings and lectures and offer the
requisite espresso and a select range of beers, will have all the
hallmarks of a Pardo museum installation. An array of Pardo lamps
will complement huge chandeliers of plastic, laminate and plywood
made in the studio, one of which quickly gained in-house repute for
its "Pabst Blue Ribbon" allusions, veering between tackiness and high
art. If this were a museum, such an installation might cost from
$20,000 to $100,000, Pardo said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the making of the bar might be considered a form of art,
given Pardo and McManus's belief in blurring boundaries or
confounding expectations about the everyday. With Pardo involved, the
endeavor also slyly suggests that anyone intentional and persistent
about a goal is making art, which makes anyone calling themselves
artists ... artists. "It may be a seminal piece," said Brian Butler,
owner of 1301 PE Gallery in West Hollywood and a representative of
Pardo's art, only partly tongue-in-cheek. "But at the end of the day,
people are going to ask, 'Is this a good place to have a drink? A
conversation? Can you hear each other talk?'"</TE>
<TE>   The project signals a maturation of the art community north of
downtown. Four years ago, the scene inserted itself as yet another
wash of cultural color into an urban fabric imbued with Italian
precedents and Vietnamese newcomers. Now the art "scene" is creating
its own traditions even as artists' and business owners' roles blur
and meld.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Joel Messler may be found instigating art at the
Diannepruess Gallery on nearby Chung King Road ... or tending bar at
Hop Louie's, the famous pagoda-shaped restaurant and watering hole in
Central Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The partners' purpose, however, isn't to link two communities. It
is to strengthen one: artists'. "Artists have to be a lot scrappier
here [in the U.S.]. They don't have the government subsidies or the
prestige they have in Europe. They have to be more entrepreneurial,"
McManus says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never going to be a bar bar," says Pardo. "I'm not sure that
people will know what they're going to get, and I'm not sure we know
what we're putting out.... Look, most artists are weasels. They'd
sell their mothers to be famous. Very few of them are interested in
actually making work, or in giving back to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in setting up an envelope of art culture here that
actually can be taken seriously, in setting up a consequent,
political base. There's a lot of money coming out of City Hall. Maybe
instead of morons deciding what should be public art, you have an
educated group of people who have an international understanding of
the art world. The kind of base we're trying to make doesn't exist
here."</TE>
<TE>   Pardo makes clear that the bar-cafe is entrepreneurial. "The only
way to survive and do what you want is to have the money to do it. If
this place is profitable, no one's in a position to edit the content
of what comes out of this place."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways the neighborhood camaraderie the new gathering place
proposes to enhance is already here informally. "What's really
happening down here in Chinatown is about daily life," said Messler
of the Diannepruess Gallery. "Sure, a lot of people come down here
once a month, but really it's about Frances Stark and Steve taking
their laundry basket and kitty litter downstairs [from their
apartment].... It's about people actually talking about things that
matter, about exchanging rather than guarding. I think General Lee's
will be a great venue for that."</TE>
<TE>   The art scene in Chinatown is about shaking things up, doing as
much as one can with as little as possible, said McManus. The
partners' investment was matched by an interest-free loan from the
Community Redevelopment Agency's Chinatown Project of $97,500, with
10% of the principal forgiven each year as long as the business is
profitable. According to project director Len Betz, the loan is part
of a current $1.9 million allotted to improve facades and buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The powerful Chinatown Community Advisory Committee, a
state-mandated group that advises the Chinatown Project, supports the
new incarnation of General Lee--with conditions the partners
volunteered, such as not having music or a happy hour that might
disrupt the community, said Don Toy, longtime CCAC member.</TE>
<TE>   The project is one example of how to use available city funds with
some imagination. Building owner-architect Roger Hong, son of Y.C.
Hong, the lawyer who helped create Chinatown's Central Plaza in the
late 1930s, is bringing in young Asian American tenants to propel a
different new Chinatown, one cut more to Hong's sense of refined
sensibilities and contemporary architectural trends in Asia, which in
turn are informed by a Modernism with a European pedigree.</TE>
<TE>   Two doors down from the General Lee site, the Via Cafe is to open
in September, proffering exotic teas and coffees. Ensuring that new
vision meant evicting Dorothy Lee, who has operated Imperial Dragon,
a clothing and object shop, since 1979. Chock-a-block with stuff, it
embodied an older paradigm of Chinatown. In contrast, Hong's other
tenants, such as Tokyo A Go-Go, which specializes in Japanese
streetwear, have a far sparser repertoire of edgier merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Via Cafe nor the General Lee project will be isolated
art objects. After all, one translation of Man Jen Low is "Ten
Thousand 10,000 treasures," but another translation could be read as
"Ten Thousand Realities," a phrase embracing not only the original
restaurant's virtually limitless menu, but the plethora of artistic
values and cultural visions of Chinatown as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tremendous reputation, but everyone gave up on it," Lee
said of his family business. "Now, on the outside, the restaurant is
a sunshine cloud of orange. For an old-fashioned man like me, it was
a shock, but you can't stop progress, you can't stop dreaming. If
they want to try, let them prove themselves. I wish them luck, with
all my heart. Make something of it."</TE>

<LD>Frank and Dino were missing, but other than that, the party at the
Cantoni contemporary design studio and showroom in Irvine had all the
elements of swank: chrome-based Bombo barstools, spun glass fiber
Galileo lamps, polished steel martini bars and triple-distilled gin.</LD>
<LD>   Company founder Michael Wilkov was host to 250 guests last week at
a benefit for Cure Autism Now. The gathering point for most attendees
was a massive martini station, which was situated next to the
smaller, take-home variety.</LD>
<LD>   Sleek, portable bars are becoming popular accessories as more
people are creating home entertainment areas, says Wilkov. At $2,600,
the Italian-made Sorrento bar, which is exclusive to Cantoni in
Southern California, costs less than a built-in wet bar and, at 4
1/2-feet wide, the half-circle silhouette fits economically into a
living or dining room.</LD>
<TE>   The bar is made of lightly stained sycamore veneer with a mix of
frise and birds-eye gloss grain patterns. Large pieces of stainless
steel and glass are incorporated into the design, creating a retro
feel.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom shelf serves as the main storage space, with a cutaway
shelf above it that offers headroom to tall bottles and decanters. A
contoured steel guardrail keeps shakers and measuring instruments in
place, and a frosted glass tabletop hides fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   The Cantoni showroom is at 8650 Research Drive, Irvine, (949)
585-9191; www.cantoni.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bottles Up</TE>
<TE>   The clear-glass bottle that contains Bafferts gin is more than a
premium martini necessity; it's a home-bar accessory if you listen to
loyalists who keep it on display long after the contents are gone.
The reason? Fluid design lines that flow in a never-ending,
never-beginning manner.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual shape was inspired by a ring that was admired by
Robert Reider, who owns the company. An Italian glass manufacturer
translated the ebb-and-flow look into a bottle that has people
turning it around in their hands in search of a straight edge.</TE>
<TE>   Hayman Distillers Ltd. in London bottles the triple-distilled gin,
which uses few botanicals and is light on juniper. The import is
distributed by Bishop Wines &amp; Spirits and is spreading across the
U.S. It's available at Albertsons and high-end liquor stores.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit the Design</TE>
<TE>   Discover Card is lightening the load for its users by offering a
compact version of its credit card that clips to a key chain or belt,
making it possible to leave wallets behind.</TE>
<TE>   The curvy new Discover 2GO card is smaller than a traditional
one--it's 3 inches wide and 1 3/4 inches long. And it's
kidney-shaped, so it fits in a palm and has a cool factor that the
rectangular ones lack, even when decorated in bright colors or
graphic designs.</TE>
<TE>   When needed, the card flips out of its black plastic case like a
pocketknife. When not being used, the case covers the cardholder's
name, signature and account number.</TE>
<TE>   A drawback in design is that the card, developed by Oberthur Card

<HD>A New Soap Star (for the Kitchen)</HD>
<DH>With shapely good looks, it's expected to go far</DH>

<LD>Grab the bottle, tip the bottle, pour the soap. For half a century
that was the undisturbed routine of using liquid dish
detergent--until designer Karim Rashid got his hands on it and turned
it upside-down. Or maybe that's right side up.</LD>
<LD>   Rashid's brave new 10-inch bottle for a Northern California-based
company called Method Home doesn't have an opening on top with the
kind of push-pull closure that every other kind of dish soap seems to
have. Instead it has a smooth, bulbous head, nipped waist and conical
body that, when squeezed, dispenses soap from the bottom.</LD>
<LD>   The prolific half-English, half-Egyptian Rashid is the industrial
design world's reigning "it" man, who's confident he can turn a soap
bottle into a design icon.</LD>
<TE>   "I always thought that innovation could be on the high end as well
as the low end," the 42-year-old Rashid says from his New York
studio. His previous works include the curvy Garbo trash can, Con
Edison manhole covers, Issey Miyake fragrance and toiletry bottles,
and polypropylene bowls for housewares company Umbra. Rashid's hefty
monograph "I Want to Change the World" (Universe) came out earlier
this year. "At the same time I was contacted to do [the soap bottle]
I was also asked to do a wine bottle and milk container for other
companies," he says, "so it's interesting that it's part of the
zeitgeist that these things are becoming a more important part of
life, and they need to be rethought and redesigned. I've spent my
life going to malls and places like Kmart, and you look at the amount
of tooling and investment and research and development that goes into
products, and you think, why can't the landscape have more beautiful
things? It could all be different tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Target is testing the soap (available in citrusy mandarin,
lavender, mint and cucumber fragrances) in its Chicago and San
Francisco stores, but a spokesman declined to release sales figures.
The Ralphs grocery store chain is reviewing the product, although
stores have been carrying Method's cleaning sprays since early this
year. For the last few weeks it's been on shelves at the Terence
Conran Shop in New York, an upscale modern home furnishings store
where buyer David Branham says he had to reorder the soap four days
after the initial 200 bottles hit the shelves: "My first response
when I heard about it," he says, "was that someone is going to have
to do something pretty revolutionary in order to get people to stop
and think anew about dish soap. Nobody thinks about it. You'd have to
do something really extraordinary to shake it up, and I think this
has done it."</TE>
<TE>   Method Home may be the only dish soap on which the designer is
credited with "bottle design." The shape resembles a blown-up version
of Rashid's pawn piece from his rubbery translucent plastic chess set
released last year. Rashid says he nicknamed his creation the "dish
butler" because "he sits proudly on your counter. It's the antithesis
of the '50s archetype of all those cleaning products because instead
of [turning it upside-down] you grab it and squeeze it, and that's
the beauty of what design can do. It seemed kind of obvious, and I
wonder why it hasn't been done before. With the old way you get all
the crud on the top and it looks terrible. So I think it turned out
really well."</TE>
<TE>   Although the designer has his share of detractors--some call his
work shallow, derivative and unimaginative--few would disagree that
his aggressive self-and mass-marketing tactics have helped push
industrial design and designers into the spotlight. He's not
alone--Michael Graves and Philippe Starck (and preceding them, Henry
Dreyfuss)--are among those who've made household items such as
toasters, chairs and dishes available to the masses via national
retailers. They've all helped propel a changing attitude among
consumers, manufacturers and retailers so that products as lowly as
dish soap should have a chance at being stylish.</TE>
<TE>   Redesigning the World</TE>
<TE>   What Rashid may lack in modesty he makes up for in unchecked
enthusiasm for his work and his single-minded determination to
redesign the world, which, in his opinion, desperately needs an
aesthetic realignment. That and his dedication to designing
inexpensive, mass-produced products are what prompted the founders of
Method Home to e-mail him cold about a year ago and ask him to help
create their new line of dish soap. He has since been named the
company's chief creative officer, and there are plans for more Rashid
products.</TE>
<TE>   "Karim has such a strong understanding of how to make little
objects with almost effortless design," says 29-year-old Eric Ryan,
co-founder and vice president of marketing for Pacific Heights-based
Method Home. "We told him this would be an opportunity to reinvent a
'50s icon, a dish soap container that sits on every kitchen sink
across America. There's a trend away from basin washing to doing one
pot at a time. So before you'd use the dish soap once a day, and now
we're using it 10 to 15 times."</TE>
<TE>   Rashid, who says he gets project requests at the rate of "a couple
a day," approached the offer with a wary eye, having been burned by
enthusiastic start-ups with flimsy financial backing. "But what
intrigued me about Method's e-mail," Rashid adds, "was that they're
interested in products that are accessible, that elevate some level
of our experience, and I'm obsessed with that kind of stuff. I also
like the fact that the products are eco-friendly."</TE>
<TE>   A Track Record</TE>
<TE>   It also helped that Ryan and 28-year-old Adam Lowry, the company's
co-founder and vice president of product development, had established
a track record for Method, founded in 1999. Their original product
line, currently in 2,000 stores nationwide, consists of spray
cleaners for kitchen, glass, bath, shower and other areas of the
home, packaged in clear spray trigger bottles distinguished by their
scents (lavender, bamboo, ylang ylang, cucumber and coral) and their
labels, which use contemporary color photographs. Although Method's
packaging puts it with a new breed of high-end boutique cleaners such
as Caldrea and Good Home Co. that offer aromatherapy fragrances,
milder solutions and sophisticated design, Method's prices are only a
smidgen above supermarket rates. The dish soap will retail from $4 to
$5 for 25 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and Lowry gave Rashid little guidance other than asking him
to create a shape that could be affordably produced. "We like to keep
things open with designers," says Ryan. "He's a brilliant man, he
spends over 200 days a year traveling; he's so wired in to movements
within society, so we had full faith in him."</TE>
<TE>   Before the ink dried on the contract, Rashid was already taking
pencil to sketch pad and furiously drawing away: "My approach is that
the minute someone mentions a project to me, I go crazy. I have to
slap myself and say, 'Wait until you have the contract!' But I'm
already designing it. I work like a maniac, and I have a tendency to
do way too much."</TE>
<TE>   He sketched some 40 designs, narrowed them down to 12 and handed
them off to his staff, which made them into 3-D models on a computer.
About a month after the designer put pen to paper, those ideas were
delivered to Method.</TE>
<TE>   Rashid says the likeness to his chess piece is "incidental. The
form for the bottle came out of holding the soap, and since the
bottom is the flat part, the top can be perfectly round....With a
rounded head and narrow body, it won't slip out of your hand."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and Lowry chose it "because it was the most different dish
soap out there." They soon discovered, however, that the design had a
"degree difficulty of 10," according to Ryan, "for, among other
things, custom engineering the bottom self-closing valve so that soap
doesn't drip onto the counter, finding a way to attach the clear
plastic "skirt" at the bottom to the rest of the bottle, and making
sure the plastic used was rigid enough to stand up but pliable enough
to be squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   A David Among Goliaths</TE>
<TE>   Although Method has developed an impressive track record for its
short time in the market, it is still a David next to Goliaths such
as Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble, which take up prime real
estate on store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "A small company will often look to designers who can give their
product a very high-profile, quality look right off the bat so they
don't get left in the dust," says Kiphra Nichols, head of the
industrial design department at the Rhode Island School of Design.
"It's an important strategy, especially if the designer has a track
record. Retailers are savvy, and they know these designers."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Rashid has done to raise the profile of industrial
designers, he's done it at the right time. This is the "golden age of
industrial design," says Martin Smith, chairman of the product design
department at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. "In the past
it was more about the engineering of a product, how it functioned.
But now, with almost all products, if you remove the cover, they're
all pretty much the same thing, only the design is different. The
contribution the designer makes has become recognized in business
schools. It's an integral part of a business strategy, which in turn
has produced more recognition and more work for designers."</TE>
<TE>   It's also produced a generation of young consumers who are not
just tuned into cutting-edge design, they expect it--from their MP3
players to their laptops to their sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think design in this country has become a really public
subject," says Rashid. "There's more of an appreciation for what we
do. But the [industrial] designer has kind of been abused and taken
advantage of in the last 50 years.... The designer is kind of like
the conductor of the orchestra, and the bass player is the engineer
and the violins are marketing, and you have to convince them all of
your ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, he's not daunted by the task: "Today, dish soap," he
says, "tomorrow, the entire house!"</TE>

<LD>Helping Kids Around the World</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that there is a place in New York City that is not in
the United States? It is the headquarters of the United Nations, and
all of its land and buildings are international territory. The United
Nations has 189 member countries from all over the world. Every
country, no matter how large or small, has one vote when
representatives meet in the General Assembly to discuss world
problems. Its purpose is to bring all of the nations in the world
together to work for peace and to help people live better lives by
doing away with poverty, disease and illiteracy (not knowing how to
read or write).</LD>
<LD>   One important topic of discussion at the U.N. is the well-being of
children around the world. On a regular basis, young people have been
invited to the U.N. to talk about what children need to live
healthier, happier lives.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. is not the only organization that helps children around
the world. Young people also help by collecting school supplies and
items that promote good health. One of these groups, Kids Can Free
the Children, started by teenager Craig Kielburger, has members in 35
countries working to help children.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about how organizations help children around
the world by watching the "Reading Rainbow" episode "Our Big Home: An
Earth Poem," airing Sept. 6 at 12:30 p.m. on KLCS-TV. In this
episode, you will learn about the U.N. and watch Craig and his
volunteers build a room onto a school in a remote area of Nicaragua
as they get to know some of the people who live there.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about the United Nations, visit the U.N.'s Web site
for kids at www.cyberschool bus.un.org/index.html. For more
information on "Kids Can Free the Children," visit
www.freethechildren.org.</TE>

<DH>Sam Maloof's furniture even gets presidential seal of
approval</DH>

<LD>Two rocking chairs make it clear that Sam Maloof's world is shaped by
his heart and his hands. The celebrated contemporary furniture
designer made each--by hand--to honor two women who mean so much to
him: Freda's Chair for his wife of 50 years until her death;
Beverly's Chair for the woman who fell in love first with a walnut
table then, a half-century later, married the man who made it.</LD>
<LD>   Maloof, whose sculptural wood furniture is so prized by
collectors, museum directors and even U.S. presidents that they wait
years for delivery, is the subject of a display at the Beverly Hills
Municipal Art Gallery. He brought the two rocking chairs from his
home to the gallery because they represent "the heart and soul of
what I do."</LD>
<LD>   Freda's Chair was made to "embrace" the woman Maloof married in
1948 when he was an overworked artist's assistant. Since the couple
didn't have money to buy furniture for their Ontario home, Maloof
made tables, chairs and a hi-fi cabinet with salvaged materials and
borrowed tools.</LD>
<TE>   Their living-dining room furniture was practical, attractive and
tactile, hallmarks of future pieces that would propel Maloof to the
top rung of American studio furniture makers and would make him the
only woodworker to date to be named a MacArthur Fellow. (Maloof was
intimidated by the academics, poets and scientists at the award
ceremony in 1985 until Freda reminded him that none of them could
make a chair.)</TE>
<TE>   Freda's rocking chair, which he made three decades ago, has a
solid walnut seat, curved back legs, sculptured arms and extended
rockers with hooks "so it won't tip over," says the designer. In the
early years, he sold some like it for $250; auction houses now sell
them for 100 times that amount. "I wouldn't part with this one for
all the money in the world," says Maloof, caressing the rocker's
backrest with his hands that are proportionately too large and too
thick for his medium frame.</TE>
<TE>   As with all of the 5,000 pieces Maloof has made by hand, function
and comfort are key. In his rocking chairs, which are his best-known
designs, armrests accept tired limbs in their natural relaxed
position, and form-fitting seats slope toward the back spindles to
provide comfortable support.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Maloof was making a rocking chair for John F.
Kennedy to ease the president's back pain, but it didn't arrive at
the White House before Kennedy's assassination. Ronald Reagan, Jimmy
Carter and Bill Clinton, however, have eased their burdens while
striking presidential poses in Maloof's rocking chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Taut and muscular and yet most elegant" is how Jonathan Leo
Fairbanks, emeritus curator of American decorative arts and
sculpture, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, describes Maloof's work.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly's Chair is carved from zircote wood and is four times
heavier than Freda's, but its thin-and-thick, turned wood and smaller
frame give this rocking chair a delicate appearance. "It's a sensuous
chair," says Maloof, 86, who is standing in front of the rocker and
moving his hand to imitate its gentle curves, from its graceful back,
down its flared arms to its extended legs. "It invites you to touch."</TE>
<TE>   Maloof and Beverly Wingate, who was a close friend to both the
designer and his first wife, were married in July last year. Maloof
presented the rocker to Beverly on Valentine's Day this year.</TE>
<TE>   When Beverly, 71, sits in her chair, she says, it becomes a part
of her. "And when I'm not in it, I look at it and it's beautiful,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly was one of a million people who saw Maloof's furniture in
a showcase house at the Los Angeles County Fair in 1954. She and her
first husband "didn't have a house or any money," but she had fallen
in love with "the most beautiful dining room table," and she wrote
the Maloofs a letter, promising to send $25 as often as possible. The
checks trickled in for years. "I think she still owes me money,"
jokes Maloof.</TE>
<TE>   Her table, which seats eight people, now shares space with the
designer's other pieces in their redwood home in Alta Loma.</TE>
<TE>   The house where he had lived with Freda from 1953 until her death
in 1998, and where they raised their two children, is nearby. Over
the years, Maloof added dozens of rooms to the original "dingbat"
structure. He also hand-carved a two-story spiral staircase and
installed triangular clerestory windows. Now listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, the 22-room house, which serves as a
museum for the family's collection of Native American art and
contemporary crafts, will be open for public tours in October.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the two dozen pieces of the designer's furniture on
display at the Beverly Hills gallery through Sept. 30 are paintings,
pottery, Native American blankets and other decorative pieces from
the Maloof household.</TE>
<TE>   It was curator Gere Kavanaugh's intention to have "a show about
Sam."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show the scope of Sam's aesthetic and not to do it as
a purist show as it was done at the Renwick Gallery" at the
Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., last fall, says
Kavanaugh, who also designed and installed the exhibit as well as
designed the gallery space itself.</TE>
<TE>   One pallet in the gallery holds pieces of hardwood, templates and
chairs in various stages of completion, all borrowed from Maloof's
studio. "Oh, so that's where that went," says the designer, reaching
to touch a slab of walnut that has the word "table," the name of its
future owner and its final dimensions written in white pencil.</TE>
<TE>   The self-taught woodworker maps out a design in his head, not on
paper. He then selects the wood and cuts the parts on a band saw. "I
started doing it this way because I didn't know you weren't supposed
to," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He spends some of his 12-hour workdays refining pieces with hand
tools or putting them together with his signature joinery. Three
assistants will do the finishing work on the 75 pieces he will
complete this year. (Maloof opposes mass production and has turned
down lucrative offers to sell his designs.)</TE>
<TE>   Although he could have retired decades ago, his heart is here. "I
still enjoy working in my shop," says Maloof, "where the smell of the
wood is pleasing and the look of the wood is so warm."</TE>
<TE>   "The Furniture of Sam Maloof" continues through Sept. 30 at the
Beverly Hills Municipal Art Gallery in City Hall, 450 N. Crescent
Drive. (310) 288-2220. For information on tours of the Maloof home

<HD>Old Enough to Vote but Not Smoke? Whatever</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting outside UCLA's campus bookstore, his left leg dangling over
the edge of a cement wall, Michael Cho is taking slow, pensive drags
off his Marlboro during a break from his job stocking textbooks.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-year-old art major, who began smoking as "a form of
venting," is old enough to vote, work and go to war. But if a bill
pending in the California Legislature gets an eleventh-hour burst of
energy, he would no longer be old enough to buy cigarettes. The bill
calls for raising the minimum legal age for purchasing cigarettes in
California from 18 to 21--the highest in the country. While 18
remains the standard in most states, Alabama, Alaska and Utah have
raised their minimums to 19.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed bill has smokers' rights groups up in arms, but Cho,
who read about the proposed bill in the campus newspaper a few months
ago and who is among those who would be affected by such a law,
doesn't seem to care.</LD>
<TE>   "I started smoking many years before I was 18, so I don't think it
will change things much,'' said Cho, who picked up the habit at 12,
frequently buying cigarettes from stores that paid no attention to
laws forbidding their sale to minors.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, now known as AB 1453, was introduced by state
Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) in June at the urging of
the California Medical Assn. and is currently being held in a Senate
appropriations committee. If it doesn't pass by Friday, when the
Legislature closes for the year, its sponsors say, it will be brought
before the Assembly again in January.</TE>
<TE>   The bill calls for fines for illegal sales, starting at $200 and
going up to $6,000. Even if the age is raised, there's no guarantee
young people won't be able to buy cigarettes: They can be purchased
online and bought through older friends and other means, teens say.
"Teenagers are already quite adept at getting fake IDs to get into
clubs," said Laura, a 22-year-old UCLA student who didn't want her
last name used. She tried her first cigarette at 14 and now smokes
half a pack a day.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't push a person to do something they don't want to do,"
said Daniela Perucca, a 27-year-old Italian now living in L.A. who
has been smoking since she was 16. "If you say, 'Don't smoke until
you're 21,' for sure they will try it."</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, where she started smoking, there's "no way" such a law
would pass. According to Perucca, "Everyone smokes in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., 23% of the population smokes. In California, 17% of
the population does. Whether raising the age at which people can buy
cigarettes will reduce that percentage further remains to be seen,
but activists on both sides of the debate have expressed doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton Glantz, a UC San Francisco professor of medicine and one
of the nation's most vociferous anti-smoking activists, calls the
proposed bill silly. Glantz played a large part in California's
adoption of the law against smoking in bars, workplaces and public
buildings. But the move to raise the age for buying cigarettes is off
the mark, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a waste of time because there's no evidence at all that
restricting access to cigarettes affects actual smoking," says
Glantz, who recently published a paper in Pediatrics magazine on
youth access laws. "They made it hard to buy cigarettes, but they
didn't affect actual smoking rates."</TE>
<TE>   Language attached to the bill maintains that "reducing the number
of older youth who smoke will help reduce sales of tobacco to even
younger children."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. surgeon general reports that smokers usually sample
cigarettes at the median age of 14 but don't begin to smoke daily
until 18.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government recognizes 18 as the age at which a person
becomes a legal adult. In California, an 18-year-old can drive, join
the Army, vote for president, get married, procure loans, sign
contracts and hold a job. But a person must be 21 to legally buy or
possess alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "If these kids are old enough to sign a legal document, aren't
they old enough to make their own life choices?" asks Samantha
Phillipe, president of Smokersclub.com and editor of the United Pro
Choice Smokers Rights Newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Coes, 19, vice president of the National Youth Rights
Assn. in Washington, D.C., said, "There are many 17-year-olds who are
more responsible than 28-year-olds and vice versa. We do not feel
that age should determine legislative policies."</TE>
<TE>   A study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found that
smoking among those older than 18 fell 55% between 1965 and 1999. And
"that was without any age restrictions," said Coes.</TE>
<TE>   The National Youth Right's Assn.'s solution to reduce smoking:
Target the tobacco companies and prevent them from advertising to
minors. But advocates of the bill don't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "[Teens] don't understand that by smoking, they're making a
decision that will shorten their lives," said Scott Svonkin, chief of
staff for Assemblyman Koretz, a sponsor of the pending bill. "They're
like, 'Why are they messing with us?' Government passes laws to
protect people every day. This is just another law to protect
people."</TE>

<LD>Nellie had more questions for her mother about Korean customs and
about her grandfather.</LD>
<LD>   "Katie Woo's grandmother lives with her family," she told her
mother after school one day. "Katie says her grandmother doesn't
speak any English. She says it is not fun to be around her."</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Connors, who was ironing, put her appliance in an upright
position.</LD>
<TE>   "And you're wondering about my father, aren't you?" She
sympathized.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "My father, your grandfather, speaks some English already. He
wants to take English classes at our community college after he gets
settled," Ok Cha (Jade Child) Connors assured her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "But Mom, is he real old and will he be kind of crabby like Mrs.
Woo?" Nellie wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   While Nellie and her mother put away the freshly pressed clothes,
Mrs. Connors reminded Nellie that Old Mrs. Woo was Katie's
great-grandmother and that she was quite ill. Grandfather Lee, on the
other hand was not yet 60 and in very good health. "But best of all,"
she said, "my father is very playful. He will teach you Korean games,
and he will want to learn some of our games. He likes to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Hearing this, Nellie perked up again and looked forward to the
arrival of her oe harabaji (grandfather). She thought about what
games she would teach him.</TE>
<TE>   She decided to start with the card game "Crazy Eights." She would
make some rice cakes for him, too. She also decided to make a
"Welcome" sign to hold up at the airport when Grandfather Lee arrived
from Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Connors said he would bring a large piece of heavy white
poster board from the office. He also offered to let Nellie use his
stencils for the lettering. Nellie got out her markers and started
her project.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: What does Nellie have in mind for her "Welcome" poster?</TE>
<TE>   Tori Smith is a freelance writer from Tucson. She is the aunt of
two Korean American children. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<LD>And you thought rockers didn't care: On Sept. 11, the Viper Room will
hold a rock 'n' roll candlelight vigil, with performances by Loaded
and an all-star band featuring Guns N' Roses' Slash, Duff McKagan and
Matt Sorum. Proceeds go to the West Hollywood Emergency Fund. Rock
on....Don't miss Andy Dick &amp; the Bitches of the Century tonight at
the Key Club. We know he won't ....I ninja'd my way into Kung Fu
Records to hang out with those merry pranksters the Vandals, whose
new record, "Internet Dating Super Studs" includes a sexy tribute to
soccer moms. Man, those guys need to be a comedy team. Oh wait, they
are....Witnessed the ADZ kick major booty at the Alter-Knit Lounge
last Thursday in celebration of its fifth album, "American Steel,"
and saw Texas Terri debut her latest dittie, "Dirty Action," at the
nearby King King....The glowstick crowd will protest at the Westwood
Federal Building at 3 p.m. on Sept. 6 against "The Rave Act," which,
if passed, gives Feds an all-access pass to bust dance clubs. That's
one way to get on the list. Heidi Siegmund Cuda</LD>

<DH>Falcon is the latest supper club with late-night food in an
intimate setting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last year, we've witnessed the birth of the hipster supper
club. Such hot spots as Lucky Duck, Belly and Firefly have made
late-night dining a staple of Hollywood club culture. With the
addition of Falcon, a tony new restaurant and nightclub on Sunset
Boulevard, it's clear that the postmodern supper club is here to
stay.</LD>
<LD>   The key to each of these spots is intimacy combined with
late-night dining. Guests can order food right up to last call,
adding an attractive element to the night owl looking for more than a
cocktail to wash down the evening. Of course, the environment has to
be just right, and that means elegance with a twist of cool. Falcon
has that in spades.</LD>
<LD>   The place is owned by Tommy Stoilkovich and Mike Garrett, who also
own Santa Monica venues Voda and Lounge 217. Like their other
ventures, Falcon soars in comfort, class and location. Located on
Sunset Boulevard between La Brea Avenue and Rock 'n' Roll Ralphs,
Falcon was created out of the ashes of Fritzi's Vienna Hofbrau--a
family-owned Hofbrau house that had been in business for four
decades.</LD>
<TE>   As a neighborhood local in the '90s, I used to walk past the
boarded-up spot and envision the possibilities. The Lava Lounge
around the corner was already a hit, and the mystique of the seedy
Saharan Hotel across the street only added to the potential. With its
surly Russian immigrants and black-clad rockers, the neighborhood was
ripe for something new. But Fritzi's owner was in no hurry to sell,
and it took years for Falcon to make its debut.</TE>
<TE>   It was worth the wait. Since its midsummer opening, Falcon has
been a hit. Named after Rudolph Valentino's Falcon's Lair estate, the
supper club makes good use of its 4,000 square feet with an open-air
patio that makes up a third of the club. Everything about Falcon
feels roomy and open, despite the popularity of the spot, which fills
up each night after 9 and stays full till closing. Like Jones in the
mid-'90s and its jumpin' neighbor North, Falcon is a "scene," a place
where people congregate to meet, mingle and stargaze.</TE>
<TE>   Like Belly, which offers a yummy tapas menu, Falcon satisfies
immediate urges with its New York-minute appetizers. Such simple
treats as warmed California almonds, sea-salt radishes and homemade
potato chips are served lickety-split, which is enticing to the
drive-by scenesters who club-hop.</TE>
<TE>   For most, however, it's easy to settle in for the night at Falcon.
Its whimsical American menu is one enticement and so is its look,
which is an interesting blend of new and old. Guests enter through a
white-hot corridor, and the first stop is the lounge area, where the
walls are covered in imported zebra wood and the floors are made from
ebony. Its faux-alpaca fur ottomans offer just the right cush for the
tush, and the overall feel is tropical and airy.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a 22-person dining room for private parties--always a
plus in Hollywood's celebrity-driven culture. The area does double
duty as a bar hangout when the diners clear out.</TE>
<TE>   A DJ booth is set up outside the private room and Falcon's DJs
keep the music smooth and seductive all night. Little separates
indoor from outdoor, as diners in the lounge enjoy seeing what's
shaking outside.</TE>
<TE>   Although the initial plans were to open Falcon quietly, word
spread quickly and now you'll find doormen at the gate, except on
Thursdays, when Club Make-Up door "gal" Cin works the velvet rope.</TE>
<TE>   Falcon, 7213 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 850-5350. 21 and
older, no cover. Dinner reservations recommended. Call for guest list
inquiries. Open nightly, 7 p.m.-2 a.m.</TE>

<LD>   Plums Cafe &amp; Catering: For breakfast, get a golden blackberry
scone or a blackberry muffin with cinnamon streusel topping. For

peaches for her peach ice cream Napoleon: peach ice cream, blackberry
compote and a little creme fraiche sandwiched between layers of
caramelized puff pastry--and lusciously spilling out a little too.
(Peach ice cream Napoleon, $8.) Lucques, 8474 Melrose Ave., West
Hollywood, (323) 655-6277.</LD>

Union St., No. 1, Pasadena, (626) 440-9800.</TE>

Beverly Hills, (310) 205-9424.</TE>

<LD>   Ex-Con/Writer Claims Credit for 'Sonny' Script</LD>
<LD>   "Sonny," Nicolas Cage's directorial debut, is hitting rough waters
even before its first public screening at the Deauville Film Festival
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Cage on Wednesday denied allegations that the film
failed to recognize one of the authors of the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   According to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court,
veteran TV writer Robert Dellinger ("Starsky and Hutch," "Kojak")
claims to have written substantial parts of the script while he and
John Carlen--the credited writer--were incarcerated in federal prison
on Terminal Island in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Charging copyright infringement and failure to identify him as
co-author, Dellinger, 72, is asking damages of more than $2 million

production company, Saturn Films; and a handful of other companies
associated with the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Cage's production company, Saturn Films, has engaged in no
wrongful conduct and they expect to be vindicated in court," said his
publicist, Annette Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   The film, about a male prostitute who wants to mend his ways,

<TE>   'Anna Nicole' Keeps Losing Ratings Weight</TE>
<TE>   E!'s "The Anna Nicole Show" may have made a big splash with its
premiere, but the series about plus-size model Anna Nicole Smith
continues to lose viewers precipitously, based on the latest Nielsen
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing of the most recent episode Sunday averaged 1.86 million
viewers, a drop of 55% from the more than 4.1 million who tuned in
for the show's premiere four weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side: The series is still outperforming E!'s average
rating in its time slot by a better than a 3-to-1 margin.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Internet Scam Stealing From Opera Fans</TE>
<TE>   An international scam has been uncovered in which 23 Internet
sites were passing themselves off as opera houses in Europe and
Australia. Customers who think they're buying tickets via credit
cards are actually channeling money into the pockets of thieves.</TE>
<TE>   The operators replicate official Web sites in almost every
detail--including theater layouts and restaurants--and use addresses
that are close to the original. A fake site might appear as
www.sydneyopera.org, for example, as opposed to the genuine
www.sydneyopera house.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Sydney Morning News reports that the ruse was exposed when a
would-be customer of the Sydney Opera House complained to the police.
When there was no record of his ticket transaction at the box office,
he was told that he'd reached a "dud site"--a "common complaint,"
according to the chief of the police department's computer crime
unit.</TE>
<TE>   His division contacted the FBI, which embarked on its own
investigation. No arrests have been made.</TE>

and England's foreign ventures during the Napoleonic Wars, for
Universal's Focus Pictures.... Tom Cruise, Billy Connolly and Tony
Goldwyn will play Army officers in Ed Zwick's "The Last Samurai," set
in Japan during the 1870s.</TE>

<CX>   Prison teaming--An Aug. 29 Morning Report item in Calendar about a
lawsuit filed by Robert Dellinger incorrectly stated that he and

incarcerated in Terminal Island prison during the 1970s. In fact,
Dellinger had been released and was returning to teach a creative

<HD>Twist of Fate for Collections Heading to the Bay</HD>
<DH>Art* Southeast Asian pieces and Japanese baskets from two
private collections represent the largest gift to San Francisco's
Asian Art Museum since the 1960s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five months before opening its new facility in San Francisco's civic
center, the Asian Art Museum has acquired nearly 1,000 works of art
as donations from two major private collections. The acquisitions,
announced Wednesday, consist of 832 Japanese bamboo baskets and
related works from the collection of L.A.-based Lloyd Cotsen and 167
pieces of Southeast Asian art from the Doris Duke Charitable
Foundation, in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The combined acquisition is the most significant gift of art to
the museum since industrialist Avery Brundage's founding donation of
nearly 8,000 objects in the early 1960s, museum officials said.
Having outgrown its home in Golden Gate Park, the museum will open on
Jan. 23 in the city's former Main Library with a holding of more than
15,000 objects spanning 6,000 years. Selections from the Cotsen and
Duke gifts, displayed on a rotating basis, will be a permanent
feature in the new galleries.</LD>
<LD>   Cotsen, the former chief executive and chairman of Neutrogena, is
a longtime collector of Japanese art, international folk art and
children's books who lives in Los Angeles. He said he considered
giving his bamboo basket collection to several museums but settled on
the Asian Art Museum because "they wanted it, actively pursued it and
would take all the baskets."</LD>
<TE>   His relationship with the San Francisco institution began in 2000,
when it presented "Bamboo Masterworks: Japanese Baskets From the
Lloyd Cotsen Collection," a traveling exhibition of 100 baskets,
included in his gift. The show appeared in Southern California last
fall at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, and it will wind up its
tour in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Assembled over the past 40 years, Cotsen's holding covers the Edo
period (1615-1868) to the present and encompasses a wide variety of
techniques and aesthetic effects. Most of the baskets were made to be
used in tea ceremonies, for flower arrangements or as charcoal
carriers, but Cotsen views them as art.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at them with a Western eye, as portable sculpture," he
said. "They appeal to me architecturally and spatially." One notable
example, "The Shimmering of Heated Air"--which represents candlelight
refracted through faceted crystal--was made in 1958 by Shono
Shounsai, the first artist working in bamboo to be designated a
Japanese Living National Treasure.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsen also gave the museum an endowment of an undisclosed sum to
ensure that his gift would be "a living collection," he said. The
funds will be used for publications, research and public programs on
Japanese bamboo basketry.</TE>
<TE>   The works donated by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation were
amassed by Doris Duke, the only child of James Buchanan Duke, a
founder of the American Tobacco Co. and Duke Energy Co. and a
benefactor of Duke University in North Carolina. Doris Duke, who died
in 1993, collected more than 400 rare sculptures, paintings,
manuscripts and ceramics from Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar), Cambodia
and Laos, along with 1,800 less valuable decorative and functional
items. The collection has been housed at Duke Gardens in
Hillsborough, N.J., but trustees of the foundation decided to
distribute it to museums and other public art institutions. Donations
to several museums are under discussion, but the Asian Art Museum is
the first to receive a gift.</TE>
<TE>   The donation includes 70 Thai paintings and manuscripts; Thai,
Burmese and Cambodian sculptures in bronze, stone and wood; and Thai
and Burmese furniture for temples and aristocratic homes. Among the
most spectacular pieces are a Cambodian bronze Buddha, made between
1100 and 1250, and an 11-foot-tall Burmese gilded throne from the
late 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   These works and many others will go on display when the museum
completes its move into the former Main Library, a 1917 Beaux
Arts-style building that has been renovated and adapted to meet the
needs of its new occupant. The $160.5-million project was designed by
Italian architect Gae Aulenti, best known for transforming a derelict
Paris train station into the Musee d'Orsay.</TE>

<LD>* Dixie Chicks, "Home," Open Wide/Monument. The Chicks aim for music
that offers a message as well as entertains, and the female country
trio blends those objectives engagingly. There is a modern
sensibility that runs through the album, chiefly in the way various
songs (a third of them written by the trio) reflect on the complexity
of relationships. The range is a little too scattered for the album
to have the searing impact of Willie Nelson's "Phases and Stages" or
Vince Gill's "The Key," two of country's best looks at romance. But
the song "Long Time Gone" confirms the Chicks' place in the Haggard,

<LD>New this week: John McKay's "Crush" begins as a captivating romantic
comedy and then, at the very moment it's most involving, takes a
wholly gratuitous and disastrous swerve and just keeps on going from
bad to worse. Left in the lurch are three skillful actresses--Andie
MacDowell, Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor--as a trio of
fortysomething single women in England who gather nearly every
weekend to commiserate with each other over their lucklessness in
love and sex. What a shame McKay went for melodrama instead of
continuing with an amusing yet also realistic account of how a
somewhat older woman and a younger man cope with the age difference,
which would be inconsequential were the man the older member of the
couple.</LD>

<HD>Hawaii Eyes Increase in Filming on Islands</HD>
<DH>Production* Marketing itself as 'Hollywood's tropical back
lot,' the state hopes for $100 million in 2002 movie, TV projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAYMES SONG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>From the current surfer movie "Blue Crush" to the upcoming James Bond
film "Die Another Day," this year has been one of the strongest ever
for Hawaii's film and TV industry.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been marketing ourselves as Hollywood's tropical back
lot," said Donne Dawson, manager of the Hawaii Film Office.</LD>
<LD>   Hawaii saw a record $136 million in movie and TV production
revenue in 2000, with projects including "Jurassic Park III,"
"Windtalkers" and "Pearl Harbor." It also has a steady diet of U.S.
and Japanese TV shows and commercials.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue dropped to an estimated $70 million in 2001--a year that
included Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes," filmed on the
Big Island. Dawson cited threatened strikes by writers and actors,
the poor economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as reasons for
the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   She said this year the industry is bouncing back and stands "a
very good chance of reaching at least the $100-million mark."</TE>
<TE>   Projects shot in 2002 include "Blue Crush"; the Bruce Willis
project "Tears of the Sun," set for release next year; and the
opening sequence of "Die Another Day," filmed at a Maui surfing spot.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming shoots include an action film starring the Rock (Dwayne
Johnson) entitled "Helldorado"; a thriller based on an Elmore Leonard
crime novel, "The Big Bounce"; and the "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"
reunion movie.</TE>
<TE>   At least two TV pilots are to begin filming next year: a police
drama, "The Break," and a crime series titled "808," Hawaii's area
code.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Wong, business representative for the International Alliance
of Theatrical Stage Employees, Local 665, said some of the increased
shooting in Hawaii is the result of post-Sept. 11 fears.</TE>
<TE>   "Actors and major producers are not wanting to leave the security
of the United States and go to countries that may have terrorist
activity, or having to fly 10 hours to a remote location," he said.
"So that helps keep them here at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the amenities: five-star hotels, people that speak
English, a safe environment where you're not worried about getting
mugged. All those things help."</TE>
<TE>   Wong also cited tax incentives that the state offers for
performing arts projects.</TE>

<LD>If there is an awards show that taps the pop culture pulse of youth,
it's the MTV Video Music Awards, which is gloriously gaudy,
irreverent, snarky and about as loud and fun as a staged television
special will allow.</LD>
<LD>   But tonight's edition (originating from Radio City Music Hall at 8
p.m.) may sneak in a little somber maturity, even with funny man
Jimmy Fallon as host.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band will bring a different kind
of backstreets to the channel's flagship awards show, which is
usually geared more toward teen tastes. Considering the Manhattan
setting, the looming anniversary of the terrorist attacks and the
fact that Springsteen's new album is a poignant, at times wrenching,
record of post-Sept. 11 America, there's a good chance the show's
usual vibe will be tamed down a bit.</LD>
<TE>   But for those looking for escapism, the night promises an
intriguing rock moment of a lighter variety: The Vines and the Hives,
two of the buzz bands that have kids talking about guitars instead of
turntables, will both perform, marking the first time they have
shared a stage. The Vines, an Australian band with chaotic intensity,
and the Hives, cocky Swedes with a playful sneer, may not be the
saviors of rock, but they sure are ... well, fun.</TE>

<HD>A Thing of the Past</HD>
<DH>Lenny Kravitz's concert in Irvine reveals, as usual, a
singer stuck in the '70s. It's time he adopted the present tense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the past 13 years, Lenny Kravitz has striven to maintain the core
values of classic rock for an audience that longs to keep the
Promethean flame of the late '60s and early '70s alive. His 1989
debut album, "Let Love Rule," paid gentle homage to his rock heroes
without overtly aping them, but over time the once-promising musician
has turned into a fake nostalgia act. He's an artist trapped in his
own frayed jeans and Foster Grants persona, recycling the same heavy
rock riffage and love themes so that the song always remains the
same.</LD>
<LD>   Kravitz's performance at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater on Tuesday
roamed through the L.A. native's long career, but as usual it was all
strictly 1973. This has always been Kravitz's shtick, and he's
cultivated it as artfully as Madonna has cultivated her career, with
careful fashion choices girding the musical presentation.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the stage looked like 1973, with a long wall of Vox
amplifiers in back and three musicians who seemed to have been
set-designed by Kravitz. Guitarist Craig Ross sported a mile-high
Afro and a denim jacket emblazoned with an American flag, while
bassist Jack Daley's stringy hair and leather jacket were very
MC5-chic.</LD>
<TE>   Opening with the dunderhead anthem "Rock and Roll Is King," the
singer-guitarist, resplendent in bell-bottoms, entreated the crowd to
bask in this bit of self-evident boosterism, and it worked. A nearly
sold-out audience, many of them old enough to trace Kravitz's ersatz
songs back to their original sources, greeted him like the authentic
rock god he longs to be.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Kravitz's most popular songs are constructed around big,
hulking guitar figures that telegraph the heaviosity to come, and
this show featured virtually all of these monster-truck hooks. "Fly
Away," "Are You Gonna Go My Way?" and Kravitz's wan version of the
Guess Who's "American Woman" all provided riff succor for this crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Kravitz's ballads were more satisfying. The grainy images of '60s
protests that played on a screen during "Let Love Rule" turned that
otherwise tender acoustic song into a trite flower-power flashback,
but it remains one of his most heartfelt compositions.</TE>
<TE>   "Stillness of Heart," like many of Kravitz's previous soul
ballads, is a conflation of some inchoate spiritual longing with
romantic love, and it seemed to bring out something genuine in the
singer Tuesday. A small piece of the facade cracked, allowing a
little genuine feeling to slip through. It was a reminder that
Kravitz is too talented to keep himself trapped in an "Almost Famous"
universe. Perhaps one day, when the bell-bottoms fade, he can start
writing in the present tense.</TE>
<TE>   Opener Pink's invigorating set wisely played to the Kravitz crowd.
Backed by a five-member band, the singer tossed in a Janis Joplin
medley among songs from her multi-platinum album "Miss- undaztood."
Strong of voice and armed with a clutch of smart dance songs, Pink
had no trouble getting across to a crowd that would rather listen to
Pink Floyd.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eminem's "The Eminem Show" has regained the top spot on the nation's
album sales chart, but its stay is likely to be short. The Dixie
Chicks' first album in three years, "Home," was released Tuesday, and
retailers expect it to enter at No. 1 next week.</LD>
<LD>   Like "Long Time Gone," the bestselling single from the album,
"Home" is a refreshing work that showcases the female trio's
traditional county roots rather than attempting to polish its sound
in hopes of greater crossover sales, a la Shania Twain and Faith
Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Written by Darrell Scott, "Long Time Gone" even takes a slap at
the soulless nature of so much country radio fare these days:</LD>
<TE>   They sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard</TE>
<TE>   They've got money, but they don't have Cash</TE>
<TE>   They have Junior, but they don't have Hank.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicks' last album, "Wide Open Spaces," sold 7.4 million
copies in the U.S., and early projections suggest that "Home" could
top 700,000 in its first week.</TE>
<TE>   If it does even better, it could end up with the second-highest
debut week of the year. Eminem's album sold 1.3 million in its first
full week in the stores, in May, while Nelly's "Nellyville" opened
with 714,000 sales during its first week, in June.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's album sold 172,000 more copies last week to regain the
No. 1 spot and bring the album's total to 5.2 million. Nelly's album
finished second by selling 162,000 copies, bringing its total to 2.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   The highest-ranking new arrival was rap duo Clipse's "Lord
Willin'," which finished No. 4, selling 122,000 copies in its first
week.</TE>
<TE>   The other spots in the Top 10 are held, in order, by Avril
Lavigne, Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, volume 10 of "Now That's
What I Call Music," Linkin Park, Toby Keith and Norah Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Three artists' new releases cracked the Top 20: Angie Martinez at
No. 11, Lee Ann Womack at No. 16 and Beenie Man at No. 18. Mana's new
album finished at No. 22, followed by a new Diamond Rio collection at
No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Several albums in the Top 40 have just passed the 1 million sales
plateau or are about to. They are Springsteen's "The Rising" (1.05
million), Jones' "Come Away With Me" (966,000), John Mayer's "Room
for Squares" (1.1 million) and Korn's "Untouchable" (965,000).</TE>
<TE>   On the singles sales chart, the Dixie Chicks' record is followed
by a remix version of Elvis Presley's 1968 record "A Little Less
Conversation" and Wyclef Jean's "Two Wrongs."</TE>

<LD>   The upward mobility of the Southland's Diavolo Dance Theater
represents a success story almost as remarkable as the troupe's
gymnastic prowess. From alternative spaces such as the studio theater
in Barnsdall Park and the small stage at Highways Performance Space
in Santa Monica, Jacques Heim's fearless ensemble has moved into
major venues across the country. There's even a rumor that a 2003
show is planned at the Los Angeles Music Center. In the meantime, a
debut in Cerritos allows Heim a big stage to showcase some of his
most startling collaborative pieces. Besides the premiere of
"Capture(d)," look for the dizzying two-part "Trajectoire" and the
revised "D2RI" and "D2RII." ("D2R" reportedly translates as "descent
to return," but don't ask what that means.) A special one-hour family
program is scheduled on Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Diavolo Dance Theater, Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts,
12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos, 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 2 p.m.
(special family show) and 8 p.m. $20 to $30. (562) 916-8500.</LD>

<TE>   No wonder the tech sector tanked. "feardotcom," a film in which
four people die within 48 hours of logging on to a particular Web
site, explores the Internet's (very) dark side. Stephen Dorff stars
as a police detective who teams with public health official Natscha
McElhone to solve the mystery in the thriller from director William
Malone ("House on Haunted Hill"). Stephen Rea also stars.</TE>
<TE>   "feardotcom," rated R for violence including grisly images of
torture, nudity and language, opens Friday in general release.</TE>

Neo-Expressionist dance drama (the fourth at various theaters this

"Edgewalkers," his 10-member company, Mizeranydance, explores the
19th century bigotry that still poisons contemporary life. Expect
Mizerany's modern dance--honed through years of working for Bella
Lewitzky, Loretta Livingston and John Malashock--to be embellished
with influences from cabaret and old-fashioned melodrama. Nudity is
also on the menu, so leave the children at home.</TE>

<HD>Lemonheads' Ex-Bassist Improvises on Screen</HD>
<DH>Jesse Peretz left the band to film commercials. Now his
second movie, after playing in New York and France, has opened in
L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When writer-director Jesse Peretz was an undergraduate at Harvard, he
was living what he calls a "total male fantasy," touring the world as
bass player for the Lemonheads between semesters.</LD>
<LD>   Then, just before the band signed to a major label, Peretz quit
the group to pursue his passion for filmmaking. "It just seemed so
much better to me to be a P.A. on a McDonald's commercial than to be
on a rock tour in Europe, as crazy as that may sound," he says of
being a production assistant.</LD>
<LD>   Now Peretz, 34, has numerous music videos and commercials to his
credit, and his second feature, "The Chateau," an
Americans-versus-French culture clash comedy, opened Friday in Los
Angeles. The largely improvised film, shot on digital video, stars
Paul Rudd and Romany Malco as non-French-speaking brothers who travel
to a small town in the French countryside after inheriting a chateau
from a great-uncle they never knew existed. Among the eccentric,
suspicious staff is a comely maid (Sylvie Testud) with a secret or
two.</LD>
<TE>   The idea for "The Chateau" was hatched over a dinner Peretz had
with writer Thomas Bidegain and producers Scott Macaulay and Robin
O'Hara. To take advantage of independent financing available at the
time for films shot on digital video, they came up with the premise,
which allowed them to do most of the shooting in a single location.
At the same time, Peretz, whose grandmother is French, had spent a
year and a half moving back and forth between New York and Paris,
writing a script that has not yet been filmed. "I think I was just
trying to act out a lot of my Francophile tendencies," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Those tendencies, he later realized, he had incorporated in
Graham, Rudd's character in "The Chateau," a dorky, rudderless
slacker who, until going to the chateau, hadn't left his American
university town. Peretz says Graham's "reaction to inheriting
something from a relative in France was like, 'This is the missing
link to my personality. I'm part-French and I never knew it.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Rudd, who shares a manager with Peretz, was first suggested
for the role, Peretz was skeptical. Peretz didn't "think of him as
funny. I think of him as a really handsome guy that plays the nice
dude" in movies like "Clueless," "The Object of My Affection" and
"The Cider House Rules." After taping Rudd's audition, Peretz was won
over. "He was so funny, and I really got woken up to another side of
his talent."</TE>
<TE>   Peretz met Malco when the latter was a craft service worker on one
of Peretz's commercial shoots, and they became fast friends. "I just
thought he was the funniest [guy] on Earth," says Peretz, who shot
some MTV spots with Malco and initially taped an audition with him
for a smaller part in The Chateau."</TE>
<TE>   The producers were so impressed that Peretz suggested that Malco,
an African American, play Rudd's adopted brother, which would
fitfully increase the gulf between the brothers as well as the
confusion of the servants.</TE>
<TE>   The actors improvised but used a detailed 20-page outline. "It
looked like a script with no dialogue," Peretz says. "It was very
clear to me what had to happen for each of the characters in each of
the scenes ... but what I didn't know was what they were going to
say."</TE>
<TE>   Rudd incorporated details from his own life--from Graham's
hometown, Lawrence, Kan. (where Rudd once lived), to the brothers'
last name, Granville (a Rudd family name). "It's definitely a
character," he says, "but I played up all of my own insecurities."
Peretz relished the mobility and intimacy of shooting with small
digital cameras, using two or three cameras for each take, but he
admits the primary motivation was financial.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was shot during 13 days in February 2000 in the town of
Pithiviers, an hour and a half south of Paris, with a budget
somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We shot seven scenes a day, and we would just be shooting all the
time, so the actors were constantly engaged," Peretz says.</TE>
<TE>   After a well-received screening at last year's Independent Feature
Project/West-Los Angeles Film Festival, IFC Films picked up "The
Chateau" for distribution. The film opened in New York on Aug. 9 and
grossed a respectable $16,000 on two screens its first weekend and a
little less than $11,000 in its second.</TE>

<TE>   Peretz knew he wanted to be a filmmaker at age 15, and he majored
in film and photography at Harvard, while performing in the
Lemonheads, the band he and high school pals Evan Dando and Ben Deily
had formed.</TE>
<TE>   After quitting the band, Peretz got his first real break filming a
set of MTV spots featuring a wacky cabdriver who pontificates on
current singers. The driver was played by Donal Logue ("Grounded for
Life"), Peretz's college buddy, who makes a funny cameo in "The
Chateau" as an obnoxious American who wants to buy the chateau and
turn it into a party pad.</TE>
<TE>   Peretz has traveled the world for the last 15 years on commercial
and music video shoots for artists who include Foo Fighters (he won a
Grammy for "Learn to Fly"), Juliana Hatfield, the Breeders, Nada
Surf, Shudder to Think--and, naturally, the Lemonheads. "I feel like
I've had a real dream life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He co-wrote his first feature, 1998's "First Love, Last Rites,"
based on an Ian McEwan short story, with David Ryan, an ex-drummer
from the second incarnation of the Lemonheads. The dour film, which
starred Giovanni Ribisi and Natasha Gregson Wagner as first-time
lovers in the Louisiana bayou, garnered some critical praise but was
little seen.</TE>
<TE>   Although his father, Martin Peretz, is editor in chief of the New
Republic, Jesse Peretz never felt pressure to follow in his
footsteps. "I think I consciously chose to go in a career direction
that was away from politics. But ... now in my life I feel starved
for people who can really talk politics." He doesn't share his
father's political views, "but I respect our differences," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Peretz is developing his next feature, "Superstar '81," a teen
romance set against the backdrop of the 1980s punk rock-skateboarding
scene and the infamous Laurel Canyon Wonderland murders. He also has
filmed a music video for a cut from Jimmy Fallon's new comedy CD.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chateau" was released in France earlier this year, and Peretz
was nervous about the French reaction. Happily, "people just kept
saying, 'You really hit the nail right on the head, and obviously you
are indulging in some of the stereotypes, but the stereotypes were
right on,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   Including the one that Americans speak only one language. Peretz
admits, "My French is still pathetic."</TE>

<HD>They Skewer Everything in Sight at Sakura House</HD>

<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sakura House. Could a Japanese restaurant have a more hackneyed name?
It's like being a Chinese restaurant called the Golden Pagoda.</LD>
<LD>   But the rest of its name--Sizzling Skewers of Kushiyaki--indicates
we're not in for sushi and tempura. In Japan, kushiyaki means seafood
grilled on skewers. This place gives the skewer treatment to
everything you can imagine, even eggs, nuts and chicken skin.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, it looks rather like a sushi parlor, with
unadorned white walls and a central work station surrounded by a
crescent-shaped counter. Instead of a cutting board, it has a grill
attended by an imperturbable kushiyaki chef in a happi coat. Sakura
House really is something like a sushi place too, though rather
quieter--the menu is mostly exquisite little mouthfuls, and you can
find yourself ordering item after item, with only the accumulating
empty skewers to remind you how much you've eaten.</LD>
<TE>   You start out with a little dish of cabbage and sliced carrot and
radish with some sweetish bean sauce. From this point, you can order
skewers from the a la carte menu (minimum three skewers per diner) or
from a whiteboard of specials, or get one of the four set dinners.
One good reason to consider the aki dinner: It includes soft-shell
crab.</TE>
<TE>   There are regular skewers and then there are maki skewers, which
are wrapped with a paper-thin sheet of pork before being grilled--it
shrink-wraps deliciously onto the skewer as it cooks. Most of the
maki skewers are vegetables. Okra-maki is sweet (and not gluey), the
string bean-maki is more flavorful than the asparagus, and garlic
sprout-maki is rather chewy, though it leaves a garlic greens
aftertaste. The best maki for my money is cherry tomatoes, three to a
skewer. Just let them rest a couple of minutes before biting into
them, or you'll get scalded.</TE>
<TE>   The maki-less skewers include some plain nude vegetables, such as
bell peppers and eggplant slices (which seem to have a bit of
teriyaki flavor), but this is where you find straight meat skewers,
such as shrimp, scallops or beef with garlic (lots of garlic). Garlic
lamb is two sweet little chops to a skewer. One of the best things
here is squid with shiso leaf--it looks like a skewer of bone-white
miniature truck tires with green axles--because of the refreshing
sweetness of shiso. On special I once found a skewer of bits of
chicken breast rolled up around garlic, shiso and a tiny bit of
salted plum.</TE>
<TE>   In the Japanese Dainties section of the menu, you find a range of
oddities from gizzards to a sort of garlicky frankfurter skewered
with onion. You can get hard-boiled quail eggs on a skewer, or ginkgo
nuts (they look like giant chartreuse ants' heads and have pleasant
mild nutty flavor, a little smoky from the grill). Chicken skin is a
narrow strip of skin accordion-pleated onto a skewer--in effect,
crackling made in an unaccustomedly neat, precise sort of way.</TE>
<TE>   I had come here several times before I got beyond the skewers, and
there turn out to be quite a few interesting items over there among
the salads and rice and noodle dishes. A salad of three kinds of
sweet, crunchy seaweed tossed with greens in sesame dressing. Rich,
sweet broiled eel served on rice. Custardy fried tofu in broth,
topped with finely grated radish.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally an interesting appetizer shows up on the whiteboard,
such as crispy chicken addiction: three big chunks of breaded chicken
breast fried very brown--definitely crisp--with a tiny lick of sweet
bean sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese restaurants are not really known for dessert, but Sakura
House breaks the stereotype here too. I've had a soft, eggy
cappuccino custard, an espresso ice cream with a powerful coffee
flavor and a green tea ice cream with a fruity sweetness like
cherries. They're so good I wish I'd tried the berry cobbler that was
on the whiteboard one night.</TE>
<TE>   Sakura House is at the tip of that long finger of Culver City that
wanders deep into Santa Monica, almost to Lincoln Boulevard. A word
about the parking lot it shares: I've seen a car parked blocking a
parked police car, that's how crowded it can get.</TE>
<TE>   Sakura House, 13362 Washington Blvd., Culver City. (310) 306-7010.
Dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m. Wednesdays through Mondays; closed Tuesdays
and the last Monday of every month. Beer, wine and sake (only served
cold). Parking lot. All major cards ($15 minimum). Dinner for two,
$16-$57. What to get: crispy chicken addiction, seaweed salad, aki
dinner, squid with shiso leaf, okra-maki, tomato-maki, broiled eel
over rice bowl, espresso ice cream, green tea ice cream.</TE>

<HD>A Wealth of Old and New at Eclectic Southland Markets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.L. Stanley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The region is rich with flea markets and swap meets from big to
small, some spilling out of fairgrounds, others barely filling corner
parking lots. Here's a rundown on some of the more eclectic.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Marketplace, Costa Mesa</LD>
<LD>   If you walked this entire weekend swap meet, you would cover about
four miles and see 1,100 vendors. Shoppers are likely to find classic
car shows and community blood drives keeping company with the leather
goods, clothing, bicycles, barbecues and golf equipment. An Artisans'
and Crafters' Corner was added in May for artisans from California
and Nevada. On display there are handmade dolls, travel photography,
ceramics and the like, along with vendors selling temporary tattoos
and musicians performing live.</LD>
<TE>   There's a popular produce section, with fresh flowers, baked
goods, dried fruits and meat. Nearly every holiday the swap meet has
an on-site celebration, with Halloween featuring costume contests,
pumpkin displays and candy giveaways. To encourage repeat visitors,
Marketplace started selling VIP passes ($10 for 10 admissions, and no
waiting in line).</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County Marketplace, 88 Fair Drive, on the Orange County
Fairgrounds, Costa Mesa. Saturdays and Sundays, 7 a.m.-4 p.m., except
during the Orange County Fair in July; $2 for adults, children under
12 free; free parking.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Indoor Swap Meet, Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   There's an extensive selection of trendy clothes, athletic shoes,
jewelry and watches, dolls and toys, candles, figurines and other
gifty items; almost everything is new. There's an incongruous mix of
booths like True Edge Security, which sells pepper spray, alarms,
MAC-10 replica BB guns and some wicked-looking knives, a
fortuneteller, a hair salon and a chiropractor, all sandwiched
between the socks and purses.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a first-come, first-served kind of place. It's open
Fridays through the weekend, and the goods just keep rolling out. In
other words, if you aren't there at dawn, it doesn't matter. Prices
rival those in the downtown L.A. garment and jewelry districts, and
services are cheap too.</TE>
<TE>   * Valley Indoor Swap Meet, 6701 Variel Ave., Woodland Hills.
Fridays-Sundays, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; free parking, free admission.</TE>
<TE>   Saugus Swap Meet, Saugus Speedway</TE>
<TE>   If you aren't there at dawn, it definitely does matter, if you
have any interest in collectibles or choice old stuff. Many items of
value are quickly snapped up because prices are reasonable. Saugus,
like many other small markets in the area, is a mix of old and new,
more heavily weighted to the new. The hottest toys--lately, those are
action figures and motorized scooters--always proliferate. There's a
tiny Tuesday version of this market that draws about 100 vendors and
has a country fair feeling. Admission is free, and bargaining is
rampant. The Sunday market has some 550 vendors--the new items are in
the front section, and the used goods are nearest the race track and
inside it.</TE>
<TE>   With fresh-cooked snacks and live music, this market, too, is
trying to be a weekend family destination.</TE>
<TE>   * Saugus Swap Meet, 22500 Soledad Canyon Road, Santa Clarita.
Every Tuesday and Sunday, 7 a.m.-3 p.m. Free parking; free admission
Tuesdays, $1.50 Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Melrose Trading Post, Fairfax High School</TE>
<TE>   This is the market for the dog-walking, cell-phone-talking, sexy,
hip and groovy crowd, whose teeny tiny bodies slip easily into the
vintage duds and previously worn, newly customized clothes that
populate many of the stalls.</TE>
<TE>   If it's antique furniture or Bakelite radios you're looking for,
you won't find them here. You will see much that's modern kitsch,
from the late 1950s to the '70s, as befits a Hollywood swinger pad.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be funky and little and low-slung," said dealer Joyce
Acosta, whose booth called funque- junque sells "fine junk" and
vintage clothes. "The things these shoppers perceive as necessary are
different than other flea market shoppers," said Acosta. Like the
pretty young thing who couldn't wrap her head around spending $30 on
a mahogany table at the market recently, but went directly to another
booth and plunked down $25 for a rhinestone tiara. Priorities,
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   * Melrose Trading Post, Fairfax High School, corner of Fairfax and
Melrose avenues in Hollywood. Every Sunday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Free
parking; $2 admission.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Community College</TE>
<TE>   Loyalists and dealers describe this as an overgrown yard sale, and
that's what makes it so appealing. It's traditionally been somewhat
of an undermined market, if such a thing exists in L.A. But with the
hipster influx into areas like Echo Park and Chinatown, the East
Valley is likely to become a regular foraging place for furnishings,
clothes and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   It's a steep hike to the community college hilltop campus, but
there's a nice Valley view and sweet deals awaiting. As with any
other market in town, competition from dealers can be fierce for true
antiques and collectibles. Sorting through much junk is required
here, but early arrivals are duly rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   * Glendale Community College, Mountain Street and Verdugo Road.
Third Sunday of every month. 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Free parking, free
admission.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs</TE>
<TE>   At the site of the former 1,000-car-capacity Santa Fe Springs
Drive-In, this swap meet is more than just a place to buy skateboard
parts, baby bunnies, Al Pacino-as-Scarface posters, condoms and
colored contact lenses.</TE>
<TE>   It's a full plate of Friday night entertainment, when there's live
music, a talent contest, clowns making balloon animals and giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   Weekends are good for serious shopping, and the kiddie rides are
always running, but Fridays are special. There's a community
atmosphere and lots of families at the L.A. area's only nighttime
swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   The carne asada vendor is one of the busiest in the place, with
good reason.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Fe Springs, you can eat, drink beer, shop and get your
eyebrows waxed, all in one place.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Fe Springs, 13963 Alondra Blvd., Santa Fe Springs.
Wednesdays, 7 a.m.-2 p.m.; Thursdays, 8 a.m.-1 p.m.; Fridays, 5-10
p.m.; Saturdays, 7 a.m.-4:30 p.m., Sundays, 7 a.m.-5 p.m. Free
parking, admission 50 cents to $1.</TE>
<TE>   Also Worth Considering:</TE>
<TE>   For the adventurous shopper: East L.A. Valley College, 1301
Avenida Caesar Chavez, Monterey Park; every Sunday, 8 a.m.-3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Vineland Swap Meet, 443 N. Vineland Ave., City of Industry. Open
daily, 6 a.m.-3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Alpine Village Swap Meet, 833 W. Torrance Blvd. Every Tuesday
through Sunday, 6 a.m.-3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Golden West College Swap Meet, Golden West Avenue between Edinger
Avenue and McFadden Street in Huntington Beach. Saturdays and
Sundays, 8 a.m.-3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   For the middling adventurous: Venice High School Flea Market,
13000 Venice Blvd., L.A. Second Saturday of every month, 9 a.m.-4
p.m.; Ventura Flea Market, Ventura County Fairgrounds. Held eight
times a year, with the next market set for Sept. 22, 9 a.m.-2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   For those who'd rather shoot fish in a barrel (and when money
isn't a consideration): Westwood Village Street Fair on Broxton
Avenue between Kinross and LeConte avenues, first Sunday of the
month, 9 a.m.-3 p.m.; Culver City, Veteran's Memorial Building, 4117
Overland Ave., third Sunday of the month, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Both markets
will close in October, then reopen in November.</TE>

<LD>Is a flea market a swap meet and visa versa? Not exactly, though many
people use the terms interchangeably. Flea markets, like at the Rose
Bowl and Long Beach, pride themselves on antiques and collectible
goods, whether that be Chippendale furniture, Deco lamps or metal
gasoline station signs. In recent years, items from the 1970s, '80s
and '90s--action figures and Beanie Babies to name a few--have
elbowed their way in, though it's the old stuff that is still the
main attraction.</LD>
<LD>   Swap meets, on the other hand, are all about the new stuff. Many
of the L.A. area's swap meets have space for used-goods vendors, but
not much. The current trend is to offer a wide variety of goods and
services, wrap it in a festival-like atmosphere, so that people will
spend considerable amounts of time and money there. Ferris wheels,
Santa Claus and pony rides are as common as the ubiquitous underwear
and car mat booths.</LD>

<LD>The concrete underfoot is already hot, and it's not yet 8 a.m. on a
Sunday morning. That the day is shaping up to be a scorcher doesn't
faze dozens of people waiting to get into Veterans Stadium in Long
Beach for the monthly flea market. Mostly hard-core shoppers, they
slathered on sunscreen before they left home and packed bottled water
along with their cash. Before the day is over, they will all walk
away with something--treasure, trash or just a good time.</LD>
<LD>   The flea market lies somewhere between cultural ritual and amusing
distraction, an open-air adventure at which the price of anything
from junk to kitsch to collectibles is up for negotiation. Think of a
flea market as a sort of archeological tour of yesterday's trends:
cowboy chic, stonewashed denims, milk glass, velvet paintings, poodle
skirts. It's also the perfect spot to study the contemporary
hunter-gatherer.</LD>
<LD>   As an entertainment franchise, a flea market is as undemanding as
it is unexpected. You can spend a lot or a little, meet someone whose
obsession for antique fishing gear rivals your own, see the
occasional celebrity, meander aimlessly for hours. And around here,
the treasure-hunting, bargain-snagging, people-watching experience
that is a flea market can be had for a few bucks any weekend of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   They used to be glorified yard sales, where people sold years of
accumulated junk off the tailgates of their cars to those determined
enough to root through it, hoping to find a Michelangelo hidden in a
trunk.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California flea market, circa 2002, doesn't look
anything like that anymore, and for that you can thank television,
EBay, Martha Stewart and a legion of cloned decorating mavens.</TE>
<TE>   "Antiques Roadshow" has, in effect, given flea markets a PBS stamp
of approval by establishing just what the dusty old contents of
grandma's attic are worth. And while EBay has become the selling
venue of choice for rare and high-end items, it's also become an
ongoing gauge for what people are willing to pay for Pez dispensers,
pedal cars and Vargas pinups.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart and those who have followed her home decor lead have
spurred interest in everything from architectural salvage to
refinish-it-yourself projects. "There are no dummies anymore," said
Jeff Remy, a Torrance-based dealer who sells antique furniture and
Lionel trains. "People know what they have and what things are
worth."</TE>
<TE>   Although some buyers complain that the truly fine items are gone,
others say the glut of information has brought long-hidden goodies
out of mothballs and put them back into circulation.</TE>
<TE>   "The merchandise is still out there, and plenty of it," said Harry
L. Rinker,  an antiques and collectibles expert based in Emmaus, Pa.,
and author of "Official Guide to Flea Market Prices." "Prices have
gone up, especially when a category gets hot. But they come back
down. Runs don't last that long."</TE>
<TE>   Although open-air markets trace their roots to medieval Europe,
with clothing and goods sold and traded (thus the fleas) in town
squares, they began in the States with the postwar boom of the '50s.
To put it simply, people bought stuff. Lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   But by the '60s and '70s, they started to purge. Yard sales became
communal ones, which ultimately grew into full-scale events. The
legendary monster that is the Rose Bowl flea market has been around
since the mid-'60s.</TE>
<TE>   What people seek out at flea markets reflects where they came
from, with many trying to buy back their childhoods, Rinker says.
That doesn't necessarily mean Depression glass. Chrome kitchen
canisters, sectional sofas and Flintstones tumblers are the current
flavors of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Business is brisk these days. At least one local market estimates
a 14% increase in attendance, and all the larger local markets have
long waiting lists for vendor spots. The National Flea Market Assn.
says there are a few key reasons for the current boom. When economic
times are tough, people are more apt to look for bargains. On the
other end of the social spectrum, shoppers with deep pockets want
something solid to invest in, and antiques can seem like a much
better bet than stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you're in the market for, here's a look at the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl</TE>
<TE>   The granddaddy of Los Angeles flea markets, with a staggering
2,200 vendors, is in Pasadena. "People trot out the serious stuff for
the Rose Bowl," said Virginia Murray, a Hollywood Hills-based
antiques dealer who frequently sells there.</TE>
<TE>   Money changes hands more consistently and quickly at the Rose Bowl
than at any other flea market in town, dealers say. Buying can be so
frenzied that dealers, pouncing on their fellow vendors' booths
between 6 and 7 a.m., turn the same items around for sale that day.
While people go to browse at many other markets, they go to the Rose
Bowl to buy.</TE>
<TE>   And with some haggling, you'll pay reasonably.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl market, which began in 1968, has become a regular
destination for L.A.'s interior designers, studio set dressers and
celebrities. This keeps prices up but also draws out unique items.</TE>
<TE>   Serious shoppers proceed directly to the "orange" section of the
Bowl's parking lot, where the choicest antiques are sold. The "white"
section, on the west side of the bridges, sports loads of used
Levi's, sneakers, vintage clothes and collectibles. Some shoppers
wear out before hitting that last lot and, unknowingly, miss out on
some of the best deals and some of the weirdest and wackiest doodads.</TE>
<TE>   Among the shopping-with-a-mission crowd on a recent Sunday were
Robin and Robert Gonzales, who just bought a Craftsman bungalow in
Pomona. Their haul included a dining room set, a coffee table, end
tables and a Chippendale chair with ottoman. How much had they spent?</TE>
<TE>   "We gave ourselves a budget, but that was gone in the first 15
minutes," said Robin Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   * Rose Bowl Flea Market, Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl Drive off of North
Arroyo Boulevard, Pasadena. Second Sunday of each month. Admission, 6
a.m.-7:30 a.m., $20; 7:30 a.m.-9 a.m., $10; 9 a.m.-3 p.m., $7.
Parking is free.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Outdoor Antique and Collectibles Market</TE>
<TE>   This 800-vendor flea market answers the masochistic question, "Why
do we trudge around on hot concrete, picking through booth after
dusty booth, until we're thoroughly sun-stroked, exhausted and
broke?" For the deal. Long Beach has embedded itself in the local
landscape as the best deal-making flea market around.</TE>
<TE>   "The customers demand it," said Craig Armenta, a dealer whose
booth is regularly stocked with antique light fixtures, toys and
pottery. "There are all price levels, but you'll find that people are
really willing to deal here."</TE>
<TE>   Value is relative. What's a particular item worth, you might ask a
dealer. "What's it worth to you?" is likely to be the reply.</TE>
<TE>   Everything starts at 5:30 a.m., and if you're a hard-core private
collector or a professional dealer, you'll be there at the kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Those who'd rather sleep in, though, needn't fret. The end of the
day--when dealers start to dread hauling back everything they haven't
sold--can be as fruitful as the start. Pickin's could be slim by
then, but that, too, is relative. Everyone else overlooked that
rather strange taxidermy mammal, but that doesn't mean it won't be
fabulous in your living room.</TE>
<TE>   Be aware, though, that most people pack up between 1 and 2 p.m.,
even though the market technically is open until 3.</TE>
<TE>   David Sokolowski of Hermosa Beach indulged his passion for antique
toys and gadgets on a recent Long Beach trip. He bought a two-seater
antique kids' wagon, a 1920s cigarette machine and some tin oil cans
and other car memorabilia to decorate his Corvette restoration
business. His tab: about $500.</TE>
<TE>   * Long Beach Outdoor Antique and Collectibles Market, Veterans
Stadium, Lakewood Boulevard and Conant Street. Third Sunday of each
month. Occasional special sale days, including Sept. 29. Early
admission: 5:30-6:30 a.m., $10; general admission, 6:30 a.m.-3 p.m.,
$5; children younger than 12 are free. Parking is free.</TE>
<TE>   The Outdoor Antique and Collectibles Market at Santa Monica
Airport</TE>
<TE>   It's a shabby-chic paradise, if you like that kind of thing, and
many shoppers at the Santa Monica Flea Market do. Rachel Ashwell, TV
host, author, founder of Shabby Chic stores, has been known to stalk
these aisles. People are willing to pay top dollar for their finds,
too. Exhibitors estimate they can command anywhere from 10% to 20%
more for items at this market than at any other market in town.</TE>
<TE>   "Very little dickering goes on," Remy said. "It's an affluent
crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Market owner Eleanor Hedge handpicks the vendors, operating
counter to the prevailing pay-your-money-and-get-a-space philosophy.
"You can't just get a space if you have some old stuff to sell,"
Hedge said. "It's an edited market." There is a waiting list to sell
there, but some dealers need not hold their breath. Said Hedge: "In a
hundred years, I'd never call some of these people." Ahem.</TE>
<TE>   Not so incidentally, it's the most expensive market space in town
at $100 for a standard 15-by-20-foot plot. A second parking lot
recently opened to accommodate more dealers (there are about 250
now), though Santa Monica could still fit into the pocket of
behemoths like Long Beach and the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The show has an abundance of jewelry, both new and antique,
architectural salvage items, European linens, furniture and
paintings. No sneakers, no jeans, no used appliances.</TE>
<TE>   William Berg, whose home and antiques shop is in Benicia, Calif.,
makes the 700-mile round trip once a month to sell at Santa Monica
because "it has panache that other shows in L.A. don't have," he
said. On a recent weekend, Berg sold two pieces of antique French
furniture, his specialty, at about $4,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Monica Airport Antiques and Collectibles Market, Airport
Avenue off South Bundy Drive. Fourth Sunday of each month. 6-8 a.m.,
early admission $7; 8 a.m.-3 p.m., $5. Parking is free.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena City College</TE>
<TE>   There's a bargain within a bargain at the college, and it's in the
lower-level parking lot, where more than 70 record vendors (records,
as in vinyl) hold court. Because many of the shoppers in this section
are looking only for vinyl, the antiques and collectibles dealers are
a more bargaining bunch than their counterparts on the upper two
parking lots (at Hill Avenue and Colorado Boulevard). Must move that
product, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Many dealers fight tooth and nail to get space in the upper lots,
believing that the lower one (on Bonnie Avenue) is akin to Siberia
for their goods. Truth is, the college has a lot of ground to cover,
and some shoppers run out of steam before getting to the lower level;
some don't even know it's there.</TE>
<TE>   This market, with 450 vendors, is strong on modern furniture and
accessories, products from the '50s and '60 especially. Ron Mabee, a
dealer from Covina who specializes in that period, was selling
briskly on a Sunday, with half his booth's furniture gone by noon.</TE>
<TE>   Perfection isn't always important. Lawrence Patino, who lives in
Temple City, snatched up a pair of '70s chairs--one cushion
missing--for $35. "I'm taking an upholstery class, and I'm going to
reupholster them," Patino explained. "Replacing that cushion will
only cost about five bucks."</TE>
<TE>   * Pasadena City College Flea Market, 1570 E. Colorado Blvd. First
Sunday of each month. 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Free. (Lower level: at Hill
Street and Bonnie Avenue.) Free parking in the structure on Del Mar
Boulevard or on the east side of the campus at Bonnie Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Roadium Open-Air Swap Meet in Gardena</TE>
<TE>   This Gardena market is heavily frequented by dealers, who cram the
place by 7 a.m. on Mondays. That's the best day of the week for
potential quality finds because the small-time vendors who sell used
goods there have been out picking and scavenging all weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Go during the early morning hours or don't bother, if you're
looking for antiques, oddities and collectibles. And if you're going
to play with that take-no-prisoners crowd, there's no room for
indecision. See it, grab it, own it. You will have paid only 50 cents
to get in; part with a few bucks and leave with an awesome gewgaw.</TE>
<TE>   The used-goods vendors take up only about one-third of the
Roadium's 15 acres. The other space is filled with new
products--fresh fruit and groceries, luggage, car accessories,
bedding, shoes, tools, kitchen appliances, CDs, jewelry, pots and
pans, cell phones and cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   It's truly an international marketplace, with Latino, Asian,
Eastern European and Caribbean vendors (36 countries are represented)
who buy in volume and sell at wholesale.</TE>
<TE>   "You can come here and open a bank account, get a second mortgage,
get all your household goods," said John Schoen, who has run the
market for a decade and is president of the National Flea Market
Assn. "It's the ultimate outdoor mall."</TE>
<TE>   South Bay residents Brian Miller and Ian Baronofsky regularly
troll for video game consoles and software, and on a recent Tuesday
morning, they were adding some select pieces to their collections.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to shop," said Baronofsky, who lives in Long Beach and
has a serious Atari habit. "And we have patience." Enough patience to
detangle a mess of cords to get to one joystick and enough savvy to
use their effort to get the price dropped to $1.</TE>
<TE>   The Roadium, operating at a former drive-in theater, aims to be a
one-stop shopping area for low-income families and for those who want
to skirt retail. (The top-selling items are women's clothes.) There's
live music on most holidays and activities for kids. Like many swap
meets in town, it's part utility, part community.</TE>
<TE>   * Roadium Open-Air Market, 2500 W. Redondo Beach Blvd., Gardena.
Daily except Christmas Day and New Year's Day. 7 a.m.-4 p.m.
Admission: 50 cents on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays; $1.25
on Wednesdays; $1.50 on Saturdays and Sundays. Parking is free.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The love lives of the young couples in Patrick Marber's "Closer" are
in a state of perpetual motion. The characters just can't leave well
enough alone in the bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   It's an intriguing spectacle, but it also appears a little rigged.
Some of the couplings and uncouplings feel like nothing more than the
playwright's attempt to keep the action churning.</LD>
<LD>   So it seemed at the Mark Taper Forum in 2000, and so it seems in
the Ella/jake production at the Evidence Room.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the play and Leslie Ferreira's staging generally avoid a
soap opera quality. The gaps in time between scenes maintain an
element of mystery, and the quick, short sentences that fly between
the characters are much more original than the cadences of the soaps.</TE>
<TE>   Obituary writer Dan (Scott Denny) is smitten by the stripper Alice
(Jennifer Christopher), whom he encounters at the scene of a traffic
accident. They move in together, and he's inspired to write a novel
based on her life. But when his photo is being taken for the book
jacket, he is smitten with the photographer Anna (Kate Whitney).</TE>
<TE>   In the play's funniest scene, Dan poses as Anna in a sex chat
room, and dermatologist Larry (Jim Round) gets so excited that he
arranges to meet the supposed woman the next day. In the play's most
farfetched scene, the doctor and the photographer actually meet and
launch a torrid romance that leads to marriage. Soon enough, the
couples have switched partners.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 play's most dated line is when Anna protests that she
couldn't have been in the chat room because she's a photographer and
therefore doesn't own a computer.</TE>
<TE>   The performances feel true, even as the characters lie, and the
moody projections by Maiko Nezu add depth to the generally bare
stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Closer," Evidence Room, 2220 Beverly Blvd., L.A.
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 8. $20. (323) 401-8071. Running
time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>These Images Really Leap Off the Page</HD>
<DH>The artistry and whimsy of pop-up books burst forth in two
exhibitions at the L.A. Central Library</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINNY CHIEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who needs words in a book when menacing dinosaurs, funny bugs and
Curious George spring forth from the pages?</LD>
<LD>   Pop-up books, those hand-held marvels of paper engineering, have
engaged readers for centuries with their whirl of foldouts, pull-tabs
and wheels.</LD>
<LD>   More than 300 works--many of which contain no text--are currently
on display in the main gallery of the Los Angeles Central Library.
The comprehensive exhibition takes viewers on a historical tour of
the innovative craft.</LD>
<TE>   "Pop Up! 500 Years of Movable Books" opens with a scholarly 1528
Italian cosmology that features a revolving disc or volvelle. But it
quickly moves to more lighthearted, colorful fare such as Jan
Pienkowski's "Haunted House," a book aimed at kids and the
best-selling pop-up of all time. An elaborate blue Martian with
octopus-like legs crashes through a bedroom window at one point in
the story.</TE>
<TE>   The tales of Little Red Riding Hood and Harry Potter also take
three-dimensional turns here.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all kids' stuff, though. Take, for example, Andy Warhol's
campy compilation of black-and-white photographs with a red can of
Hunt's tomato sauce rising from the binding. Another tongue-in-cheek
book, "Shame of Our Museums," includes cellophane panes that lift up
to reveal figures in their skivvies. Both are discreetly installed in
one corner of the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "The books really reach audiences across the board, no matter what
your age or background," co-curator Toria Aiken says. "Everyone has
flipped through one at some point in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   A smaller accompanying exhibition, "Leaping Off the Page: Building
of Pop-up Books," illustrates the painstaking creative process of
creating these books, which begins with a simple concept and develops
into a complex web of paper. Several collaborators (author,
illustrator, engineer) and hundreds of hand-finished procedures
(cutting, folding, gluing) may be needed to complete just one book.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of the people who actually assemble the books are
women because they tend to have smaller fingers and more dexterity,"
co-curator Devin Price explains. "Some of the books are amazingly
detailed, and you need a certain kind of skill in hand to work on
them."</TE>
<TE>   Among the most intricate are the "carousels," which fold out to
form dollhouse-like dioramas. Tykes and grown-ups may find themselves
immersed in "Botticelli's Bed &amp; Breakfast" by Pienkowski. The
whimsical book transforms into a boarding house inhabited by famous
figures in art history; your objective is to find them. (Hints:
Michelangelo's David, dressed in leaf-print boxers, brushes his teeth
in the bathroom, while Whistler's mother watches television in the
den.)</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the books in this exhibition are culled from the
extensive collection of Waldo Hunt, chairman emeritus of leading
pop-up producer Intervisual Books, who's been credited with
revitalizing the format 40 years ago. (The preeminent Children's Book
Fair held annually in Bologna, Italy, dubbed him "King of the Pop-up
Book.")</TE>
<TE>   The special collections library at UCLA contributed a few of the
older books.</TE>
<TE>   Movables were originally created to help explain the principles of
astronomy, anatomy and other sciences to adults. It's unclear as to
when the first one, um, popped up, but one of the earliest known
examples is a 13th century philosophical discourse with a revolving
disc that demonstrated the theories of a Catalan mystic. The books
weren't targeted toward children until the late 18th century, when
European publishers began making fairy-tale books with lift-up flaps.</TE>
<TE>   Pop-ups thrived in the decades that followed, but manufacturing
nearly ceased when World War II erupted. Germany and France, which
turned out the majority of movable works, devoted their resources to
the war and shelved creation of the laborious books. Bookmakers in
other countries, including Czechoslovakia and the United States, kept
the genre alive, but the books didn't regain popularity until Hunt
started producing them in '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Intervisual Books has since made more than 2,000 titles for
publishers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe it or not, I never even saw one pop-up book as a child,"
says Hunt, who decided to get into the business after picking up a
movable book by celebrated Czech artist Vojtech Kubasta. "I knew I
had stumbled on something special. You really do fall in love with
them. That element of surprise never fails to disappoint."</TE>

<LD>* The chef-owner of La Cachette came to Los Angeles in 1980 to be
executive chef at L'Orangerie before opening his own restaurant in
1994. He received the Outstanding American Chef award from the Grand
Master Chefs of America and is president of the Club Culinaire of
French Cuisine/California.</LD>
<LD>   Stewed Meat and Dove: I go to two French restaurants which are
completely different from each other. I go to L'Orangerie because I'm
still friends with Gerard [Ferry] and I go eat with him there. I
invite him to La Cachette and he invites me to L'Orangerie. At
L'Orangerie, they usually have chefs over there who cook kind of the
way I cook with lighter food without cream and butter and stuff like
that. I also go to Mimosa because Jean-Pierre [Bosc] is very good at
country French cooking like stew, dove and pasta with stewed meat.
He's one of the best in town for that.</LD>
<LD>   Giant Bowls of Soup: We go to a Japanese ramen place with the kids
on Sawtelle called Asashi. We have the gyozas and a salad with
cucumbers and chicken. And we have the soup with noodles, and it's
lightly spicy with lots of vegetables and not too many noodles. It's
light, very casual. The kids can make a mess and nobody bothers.</LD>
<TE>   Volleyball With Chefs: Usually on Sunday in July and August, we go
to the beach in the Marina or Malibu, and we play volleyball and we
bring sandwiches and stuff. We have a picnic and the kids can play on
the beach. We play volleyball with six to 10 people, always the same
people. They are chefs, people from the restaurant business, people
who sell wine and the manager of the Regency Club. Some of the
waiters from La Cachette come with us. If they are not mad at me,
they usually come.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Fondue: I like to go to Mammoth in the summer. But the
thing is, when I go to Mammoth I need two days off and that doesn't
happen very often. But when I go, outside of Bishop I like to go
fly-fishing. In the winter, we go skiing. Usually, we do a lot of
cooking in Mammoth. We went to a Swiss place one time to have a
cheese fondue. But there's not much stuff to do in Mammoth at night.</TE>
<TE>   On the Boardwalk: Saturday, I always work. But sometimes, I go
play paddle tennis in Venice and I go to work around 2 p.m. We used
to play a lot, but my back went out a year ago, so I play a little
less. We go roller-blading there on Sundays. We usually roller-blade
to Malibu and play volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   Just for the Kids: We shop a lot at Whole Foods, the one on
National, especially for meat, fish and vegetables for the house.
It's like Gelson's, but they have a lot of organic vegetables, fruits
and chicken. It's especially for the kids, because I don't eat at the
house that much. That's why my wife likes Whole Foods so much. They
have some great items like frozen shrimp, organic chicken and fresh
roasted turkey. But it's expensive, so it's all for the kids. My wife
and I eat at the restaurant most of the time, which is just as good.</TE>

<LD>   "Death of a Salesman" is one of those rare plays that can move
audiences to tears in productions of radically different sizes. The
staging at the Ahmanson Theatre in 2000 was thrilling because it was
so big. It was exciting to hear the hushed silence of so many people
hanging on Brian Dennehy's every word. Yet to see the same play in
the intimacy of the Interact Theatre offers equally compelling
rewards. To be just a few feet away from the hangdog face of Eddie
Jones' Willy Loman lets you look deeply into his eyes and witness the
regret behind his brusque vocal delivery. The actors' slashing
arguments make you feel like a visiting relative who arrived just as
the family was cracking up. Director Anita Khanzadian, abetted by
lighting designer J. Kent Inasy, respects the almost surreal quality
of these scenes. Besides Jones, the Lomans are Marilyn McIntyre as
the wife who walks the perilous line between cheerleader and
taskmaster, Don Fischer as the anguished wanderer Biff, and Thomas
Vincent Kelly as Happy, the son who still believes that the old
illusions can come true. Thomas Buderwitz's set suggests how shrunken
Willy's world feels.</LD>

<LD>   Meanie Gloomius Maximus is out to "un-fun-erate" little round
robot boy Olie's little round planet and give all its inhabitants the
blues.</LD>
<TE>   It's up to Olie, his 2-year-old sister Zowie, best friend Billy
and Mom, Dad, Pappy, dog Spot and Space Boy and Space Dog to make
things sunny again.</TE>
<TE>   In this mild conflict, swords are for tickling, bad guys are
targeted with laugh-inducing "silly ray" bubbles and even Gloomius,
voiced with glee by James Woods, turns out to have a "happy gear" in
this wonderfully imaginative 3-D cartoon, based on the much-lauded
computer-animated preschooler TV series.</TE>
<TE>   Series creator William Joyce, inspired by old-time cartoons and
movie and TV serials of the past, has ensured that gentle
delights--from Olie's teapot-shaped house to the animated furniture
and trees that sway with the quaint music--fill every nook of Olie's
sweet robot world. This first-time, full-length, feature-version of
the show has every bit as much cozy charm.</TE>
<TE>   A post-movie, educational "Dolphin Talk" cartoon and such bonus
games and activities as "Find Pappy's Teeth" and "Build-A-Bot" winds

<TE>   Crikey! In this new DVD-Video that comes out on Tuesday,
perpetually wired Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin meets his energetic
match in fellow Aussies, the wildly popular Wiggles, a kids' music
group with growing legions of preschool fans all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the Wiggles--Greg, Anthony, Jeff and Murray--get lost in
their Big Red Car out in the bush and Steve (whose little daughter
Bindi is clearly a big Wiggles fan) comes to the rescue, inviting
them to his home base, the Australian Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   There, Irwin, his wife, Terri, and Bindi play supporting players
to the Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy the Dinosaur and Wags
the Dog. Irwin introduces various koalas, kookaburras, emus, snakes,
tortoises, dingos and camels into the mix, and hand-feeds a cranky
croc; he and his family join the Wiggles in dances and wacky songs. A
sampling: "Wobbly Camel," "Snakes," "Do the Owl," "Feeding Time" and
"Kookaburra Choir."</TE>

<LD>"A Midsummer Night's Dream," Shakespeare's enchanted tale about
mismatched lovers and a fairyland quarrel spiced with magic gone awry
opens Monday at 6 p.m. at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum.</LD>
<LD>   Something of a tradition at the outdoor canyon venue, this forest
romp--with its fairy malice and mischief, hilarious bumbling rustics
and the comic, runaway romantic woes of four young mortals--is very
much at home in the theater's natural setting in the Topanga woods.</LD>
<LD>   Theatricum's final repertory offering of the season, "Midsummer"
shares the stage with the company's other well-received productions:
Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," Peter Hall's musical version
of George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and Jean Giradoux's fable "The
Madwoman of Chaillot."</LD>
<TE>   The Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum is at 1419 N. Topanga Canyon

<HD>ACME's 'Ballgame' Provokes Thoughts Along With Laughter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ACME Comedy Theatre's "ACME Out to the Ballgame" has nothing to do
with baseball and everything to do with games.</LD>
<LD>   Its 16 comic sketches tend to skewer identity, propriety and other
socially imposed, behavior-altering notions. Stop second-guessing
yourself, the show seems to advocate. Quit letting other people
define you. Halt the game-playing and just be yourself.</LD>
<LD>   Or, maybe that's not what the show is saying at all. But what's
great about sketch comedy is that it homes in on things that everyone
is thinking about, and opens them up for contemplation and laughter.
Let the ideas take you where they will.</LD>
<TE>   The show's most subversive sketch manages to tweak political
correctness while testing the very notion of sketch comedy. In it,
two performers have just launched into a routine when a voice calls
out from the audience to complain that the material is slanderous.
Soon, other people (all planted in the auditorium) are chiming in
with topics that shouldn't be poked fun at. Taken to its extreme,
this sort of thinking would put everything off-limits and become a
form of censorship.</TE>
<TE>   That piece is written by Jeff Lewis and Jennifer Carroll, two
members of ACME's current A team, along with Ellen Horn, Ed Marques,
Kevin Small, Liam Sullivan and Jonna Tamases, under M.D. Sweeney's
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Two other smart sketches are written by Marques. In one, he plays
a Deepak Chopra-like self-help guru who's trying to admit he's a
fraud, but his acolytes--who are so determined to remake themselves
that they've become like sheep--aren't listening. In another, he and
Small portray bland, wimpy white guys who try to add some zip to
their lives by adopting the dress, language and attitude of Latino
homeboys--all in the safety of the living room.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan stirs the pot with a gender-bending sketch in which he
plays a prim woman who's a new volunteer at a blood drive.</TE>
<TE>   Embarrassed by the personal nature of the questions she must ask
potential donors, she tries to reword each topic into euphemisms.</TE>
<TE>   But her oblique references reveal more about her sex life than she
intended.</TE>
<TE>   The other pieces don't always tickle the ribs, despite the wide
array of funny faces and fake accents used to put them across. But
most of the sketches give the brain a nudge, at least.</TE>
<TE>   "ACME Out to the Ballgame," ACME Comedy Theatre, 135 N. La Brea
Ave., L.A. Saturdays, 8 p.m. Indefinitely. $15. (323) 525-0202.
Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Blue Man's Group</HD>
<DH>Phillips Exeter Blue I was drawn to rock--after all, Cher
took him to KISS shows when he was 2. Now he's frontman for the band
Deadsy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Listening to death-metal prog-pop synth-rockers Deadsy, you have to
wonder how the group conceived the sonic fusion behind such
slammingly catchy numbers as "The Key to Gramercy Park," in which a
prep-school worldview meets Deicide, Rush and Duran Duran.</LD>
<LD>   Or, perhaps, you wonder why they created such a decidedly campy
and--to some--annoying hybrid.</LD>
<LD>   But it makes sense when you talk to Deadsy's frontman,
singer-guitarist Phillips Exeter Blue I, better known to his folks as
Elijah Blue Allman. Unlike some rock-star offspring, the son of pop
diva Cher and Southern-rock icon Gregg Allman doesn't even vaguely
recall his parents' music. Los Angeles-based Deadsy mixes hypnotic
punk-metal guitars with Gary Numan keyboards and elements of such
'70s progressive-rockers as King Crimson and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to make the most abstract [stuff] that had nothing to do
with what anyone was doing," Blue, 26, says of Deadsy's recently
released debut album, "Commencement." His gaze darts around the
stuffy lobby of the Hollywood recording studio where he and bassist
Creature are mixing the band's next single. "I'm influenced by the
whole idea of creating an alternate reality."</TE>
<TE>   The tall, brawny, young man says that such a self-created reality
is partly escapist. But it also lets the quintet--which also includes
synth-guitarist Carlton Megalodon, keyboardist Dr. Nner and drummer
Alec Pure--transcend boundaries. "It's really about being passionate
about living," he says. "Not complaining about how drab it is, but
kind of romanticizing it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deadsy's freaky little horror-show world has taken some hits from
critics, and the album has sold just 62,000 copies. But the band is
becoming more popular thanks to its presence on Korn leader Johnathan
Davis' DreamWorks-affiliated label Elementree and on tours with Korn,
Papa Roach, Static-X and the Family Values festival. But the group
waited a long time for "Commencement" to, er, commence.</TE>
<TE>   An album the band completed for Sire Records in 1997 was never
officially released, but Deadsy played several high-profile gigs at
the Viper Room, the Roxy and the Whisky. Then the initial 1999
release date of "Commencement" was delayed until May of this year
(the better, perhaps, to capitalize on the synth-mania fostered by
pop music's current '80s jones).</TE>
<TE>   Blue is just relieved that the album is finally out. "There was a
hole for something like this," he insists, "but record labels are
very hesitant about things that go against the grain."</TE>
<TE>   His instinct, on the other hand, is to buck expectations. And
that's clearly a result of his upbringing. "I went off to boarding
school at about age 8, and that's where I stayed," Blue says. His
matter-of-fact tone is not bitter or angry, but it's easy to imagine
that under such circumstances even a privileged kid could feel
resentfully removed from his roots.</TE>
<TE>   He still doesn't have regular contact with his dad, who was
divorced from Cher when their son was just 1. "It's always been
really scattered," Blue says. "But I do wanna see him. I'm just so
busy I barely see my mom, who I grew up with. I don't have time to
dip into that can of worms right now."</TE>
<TE>   Cher has been supportive, attending Deadsy's shows, but Blue
doesn't know what his father thinks. "I never really even cared to
play him any of my music," he says. "I'm not looking for anyone's
validation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Inadvertently, however, Cher provided the impetus for Blue to form
Deadsy with some private-school pals when in their late teens. "We
got into some sort of a fight, and she kicked me out of the house,"
he says. It's all water under the bridge now, he adds, but that "kind
of forced me" to start the band.</TE>
<TE>   Cher's romantic adventures also had a major impact on young
Elijah. "I think I was about 2 years old when my mom was dating Gene
Simmons," says Blue. "So I got to see tons of KISS shows when I was
really, really young. I even saw the [filming] of 'KISS Meets the
Phantom of the Park,' " the 1978 TV movie starring the costumed
rockers. "So a lot of that is ingrained."</TE>
<TE>   There's no mistaking KISS' imprint, but Deadsy is more about
occult intellectual abstraction than sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.
In addition to having a pseudonym, each band member represents what
Blue calls an aspect of humanity--academia, science and medicine,
leisure, war and horror.</TE>
<TE>   It all feeds into a complex, nebulous, metaphorical universe
fueled by myriad inspirations, including "Dune," "Star Wars," "The
Lord of the Rings," the New Age religious text "Urantia" and
occultist Aleister Crowley, among many other things.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to pick up where KISS left off," Blue says. "We've got the
smoke and mirrors, but there's something real under it. It's about
the band members being gatekeepers to this other world, and that
other world is what's really important."</TE>
<TE>   The players are already working on the next album, which Blue says
will expand their intricate mythology. Perhaps, he muses, Deadsy will
eventually delve into the psyches of each member (solo albums,
anyone?).</TE>
<TE>   And Blue hopes to broaden the legend by branching into other
media, including video games, cartoons and so forth. "This thing has
its own life," he says. "It's bigger than us, and now we kind of have
to feed the demon, you know?"</TE>

<HD>Five Feet Beats a Hasty Retreat From L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA STRAND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Long, Five Feet: It was only eight months ago that the well-known
Laguna Beach restaurant Five Feet opened an L.A. branch in the
glamorous old Le Colonial location, but it closed its doors Aug. 16.
"I needed to regroup," said owner Michael King. "I'm retreating back
to Orange County." (Without missing a beat, he's opening another Five
Feet in Anaheim Oct. 8.) So why did he shut the doors in L.A.? King
gave the difficult economy and the long drive from Laguna he had to
make four to five times a week as reasons. "We were planning on
losing money the first year," he said. "I just didn't expect that I
would have to expend so much energy." Apparently, most of the kitchen
staff has found new jobs, though the remaining waiters will have to
fend for themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Sweetfish at Water Grill: Chef Michael Cimarusti now has ayu, a
Japanese summer delicacy known in English as sweetfish. "They're so
beautiful," he says, "and the white flesh has a fabulous, perfect
flavor." These tiny river fish (only about 5 inches long) are
imported in small cedar boxes directly from ayu farms in Japan. In
the past, though, sweetfish were hunted at night using torches and
trained cormorants; the birds would dive and catch the fish, but
they'd be pulled in by a tether around their necks so the fish could
be retrieved from their mouths, and then they'd be released to fetch
more. Cimarusti serves ayu sauteed in lemon and brown butter with
Montana morels and a poached egg on top.</TE>
<TE>   In another bit of Water Grill news, Cimarusti has announced that
he has stopped buying Russian and Iranian caviar and switched to
American and French. "In light of all the fishing practices and the
fact that the quality is just as good or better, it's time,"
Cimarusti says. He's now serving Transmountainous brand caviar from
Northern California and Caviare d'Aquitaine from France. "Both are
delicious," he says. "They're best compared to osetra. They've got a
lightly salty, nutty, rich, fatty taste, and the berries have a good
texture." They're slightly cheaper than Iranian and Russian caviars,
though when you're talking about caviar, "cheaper" is a relative
term.</TE>
<TE>   Chadwick Has Company: Chef-owner Ben Ford has enlisted an eclectic
group of guest chefs to cook at Chadwick the second Monday of each of
the next three months. The dinners will benefit the Multiple
Sclerosis Society. Each chef will cook his own four-or five-course
menu, with which specially chosen wines will be served. The list
begins with Mark Sullivan, the executive chef at the Village Pub in
Woodside, Calif. Food &amp; Wine just named Sullivan one of America's
best new chefs. Roxanne Klein, from Roxanne's in Marin, will exhibit
her organic, raw cuisine. Last is Gary Danko of Gary Danko's in San
Francisco. In 2000, Danko won the James Beard Foundation's best new
restaurant citation, and he was nominated in 2002 for outstanding
chef of the year. Ford plans on resuming the series in spring. "It's
exciting to bring new chefs in," he says. "You get so caught up in
your own world ... it's wonderful to get another perspective." For
more information, call (310) 205-9424.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: At Melisse, Josiah Citron has created a special
tomato menu, available until the end of September. Among the seven
intriguing courses are Maine lobster ceviche with lobster parfait,
tomato gelee and Green Zebra gazpacho, and Hudson Valley foie gras
poached in tomato consomme with macerated tomatoes and black pepper
honey gastrique. And for dessert, a tomato tarte tatin with fennel
seed ice cream and basil syrup. For reservations, call (310)
395-0881.</TE>

<HD>Early Films at Cinecon: Magic Flickers Into Being</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cinecon 38, the Society for Cinephiles' convention, is back for its
annual presentation of five days of silents and early talkies, most
of which hardly anyone, including Cinephiles themselves, have ever
heard of, let alone seen.</LD>
<LD>   The whole point is discovery. Practically everything the
organization's board turns up is worth a look--and worth preserving,
which is another of the society's goals.</LD>
<LD>   Cinecon, which opens tonight at the Egyptian, is always open to
the public, with passes available for the festival or a single day.
Robert Stack is this year's honoree, and the Renaissance Hollywood
Hotel is the host hotel for Cinecon's special events and memorabilia
marketplace.</LD>
<TE>   Among the films Cinecon was able to preview were some gems that
are also notable for the impressive quality of their prints. Of
historical importance will be the screening of the very first
narrative film with scenes shot in Southern California: Francis
Boggs' one-reel 1908 "Monte Cristo" (Saturday at 1:40 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   Made for the Selig Co., it boils "The Count of Monte Cristo" down
to about 15 minutes and, with the exception of a single scene, is but
a filmed play divided into acts, complete with the lowering of the
curtain. It is fustian melodrama with patently fake sets, and it
depends heavily on the audience's familiarity with the plot.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was shot in Chicago or perhaps New Orleans, but native
Californian Boggs returned home to shoot a sequence of Dantes
emerging from the sea and struggling to make his way to the safety of
some rocks.</TE>
<TE>   With a realism that is startling in contrast to the rest of the
film's artificiality, it is a clear harbinger of the direction the
movies would swiftly take.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Cinecon had a surprise hit with "Dangerous Blondes"
(1943), directed by Leigh Jason and starring Allyn Joslyn and Evelyn
Keyes as husband-and-wife detectives. This year brings Jason's 1941
"Three Girls About Town" (Saturday at 3 p.m.), a delightful screwball
comedy and mystery scripted by Richard Carroll and starring Joan
Blondell, Binnie Barnes and Janet Blair in the title roles. Big-city
convention hotel hostesses Blondell and Barnes have to cope
simultaneously with a wandering corpse and their vacationing younger
sister (Blair), eager to protect her while they work hard to pay her
college tuition, not realizing she's an audacious vamp with no
interest in higher education.</TE>
<TE>   The two hostesses are working both a morticians' convention and
union arbitration with a defense contractor, striking a serious note
in the months before Pearl Harbor. Among the reporters covering the
arbitration is Blondell's cocky fiance, John Howard, with whom she is
forever sparring. (The other reporters include an unbilled Lloyd
Bridges and Bruce Bennett.)</TE>
<TE>   "Three Girls" is frequently hilarious, the stars shine, and Jason
sustains an admirably brisk pace amid a torrent of dialogue and plot
complications, involving what seems the lion's share of Hollywood's
most deft and beloved character actors.</TE>
<TE>   Cinecon programmers believe that with the 1934 film "Bulldog
Drummond Strikes Back" (Friday at 7:50 p.m.), they have uncovered the
most outstanding unknown Hollywood movie of the '30s, and they could
be right. In it, Ronald Colman returns as the famous amateur English
sleuth he first played in 1929. Director Roy Del Ruth and
screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and all others concerned clearly see
this mystery as creaky but a great opportunity for fun.</TE>
<TE>   A peculiar odor lures Drummond into a sinister East Asian prince's
(Warner Oland) Gothic-style London mansion, which is the setting for
outrageous goings-on. Loretta Young is the film's lady in distress,
and Charles Butterworth very nearly walks off with the movie as
Drummond's hilarious sidekick, Algy, whose wedding night (with Una
Merkel) is continually interrupted by Drummond's summonses for help.
Colman plays with an elegant, witty, devil-may-care charm that is
timeless.</TE>
<TE>   William S. Hart emerged as the premier western star of the teens,
and "White Oak" (1921), which screens Sunday at noon, combines the
conventions of full-blown silent melodrama with the star's well-known
concern for authenticity. In a story of his own devising, Hart is the
familiar stoic, involved in a westward trek. He is drawn to vivacious
Vola Vale, who is about to lose her brother to the same villain
responsible not only for the death of Hart's sister but also for a
pending Indian attack.</TE>
<TE>   "White Oak" rambles, as do numerous other silents, but it has a
superb pictorial grandeur, thanks to the imagination of director
Lambert Hillyer and cinematographer Joe August.</TE>
<TE>   "Emperor Jones" (Friday at 2 p.m.), the 1933 Dudley
Murphy-directed film version of the 1920 Eugene O'Neill play, stars
Paul Robeson as a naive rural Southerner who lands a job as a Pullman
porter, gets caught up in Harlem high life and winds up in an island
prison, only to escape and become the dictator of a nearby Caribbean
island. There's not much point to all of this, but Robeson swaggers
through impressively. The film has superior art direction and is
atmospheric, particularly in its depiction of Harlem night life.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptian Theatre is at 6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. For
Cinecon 38 information, call (800) 411-0455.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunset 5 launches "Women in Peril," a three-weekend, 10 a.m.
series, with Jill Morley's "Stripped," an incisive documentary about
five exotic dancers, including herself. Other filmmakers have dealt
with the eternally provocative topic, but few with such depth and
clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Morley focused on women like herself: educated, articulate,
attractive, from middle-class backgrounds. All five went into it for
the money and the comparative freedom and independence. A struggling
actress and writer, Morley found stripping a steadier and more
rewarding way of supporting herself than a series of menial jobs. She
also thought it would be a great learning experience for an
actress--and she learned more than she bargained for.</TE>
<TE>   Morley and her other subjects feel conflicted about what they're
doing and how it is affecting their personal lives. They realize it
is a profession that is short-lived, but as Morley discovers, it can
also be addictive, as a lucrative occupation and as one that confers
an intoxicating power over men. Just when it seems that these women
are in control of their destinies, "Stripped" pulls a double whammy
at its climax that gives it an unexpectedly darker and disturbing
dimension.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunset 5 is at 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323)
848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' Documentary Days series continues at the
Sunset 5 with Saturday, Sunday and Monday 10 a.m. screenings of the
irresistible "Drive-In Movie Memories," directed by Kurt Kuenne. It's
based on the book of the same name by the film's producers, Don and
Susan Sanders, as well as their other book, "American Drive-In Movie
Theater."</TE>
<TE>   Steeped in nostalgia for a simpler, more innocent and communal
time, "Drive-In Movie Memories" is amazingly comprehensive and
chock-full of information for a film that clocks in at 58 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Camden, N.J., businessman R.J. Hollingshead Jr. opened the first
drive-in on June 6, 1933; legend has it that he was inspired to do so
because Hollingshead Sr. was too obese to fit into theater seats.</TE>
<TE>   It was a hit from the start, and drive-ins, mainly primitive
mom-and-pop operations, began opening up all over the country.
Drive-ins took off in a big way after World War II, becoming
corporate ventures, with as many as 700 theaters opening in 1947 and
1948.</TE>
<TE>   Television made a dent in what Variety dubbed "ozoners" just as it
did "hardtops," but drive-ins got a new lease on life in the late
'50s and early '60s when American International Pictures' Samuel Z.
Arkoff and James Nicholson and others started making inexpensive
exploitation movies expressly for teen audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of the shopping mall multiplex and the advent of the VCR
did in drive-ins, but there has been a modest revival across the
country in recent years, with about 40 ozoners either reopened or
newly constructed.</TE>
<TE>   The film is laced with drive-in promotional trailers and archival
materials, as well as the reminiscences of producers, exhibitors and
distributors, plus such drive-in movie stars as Beverly Garland,
Celeste Yarnall and Robert Fuller, who are represented by deliciously
lurid trailers for their films.</TE>
<TE>   "Drive-in Movie Memories" is as affectionate as it is informative,
and a valuable work of social history and popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Drive-In Movie Memories" will screen at 11 a.m. Sept. 7 and 8 at
the Monica 4-Plex, Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; Sept. 14 and 15 at
the Playhouse 7, Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and Sept. 21 and 22 at the
Fallbrook, West Hills, (818) 340-8710.</TE>

<HD>He's More Than Meets the Ear</HD>
<DH>The Hollywood Bowl's 'puppet man' would like a better gig,
but mostly he just wants to belong</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRICIA NELSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say the name David Liebe Hart to Hollywood Bowl concertgoers on any
given performance night, and you're bound to get puzzled looks. But
mention the "puppet man," as I did last weekend, and, well, you'll
get an earful:</LD>
<LD>   "He just makes you smile when you walk by him. He's really cute."</LD>
<LD>   "He doesn't sound good, and the Muppet is dirty."</LD>
<TE>   "I've never given him anything in 10 years because he's never
really given me anything."</TE>
<TE>   "He's irritating as all hell."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Bowl's colorful cast of buskers, Hart is a standout. He
usually stations himself across from the Edmund D. Edelman Hollywood
Bowl Museum, handling a ratty puppet he calls "Doug the dog." He
serenades patrons in a bellowing baritone, singing hymn-like ditties
with catchy refrains, such as "Take a happy song and pass it on."
Hart, 47, slightly unkempt, sporting oversized glasses and an unruly
but thinning afro, has been at it for 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   David Nkrumah Liebe Hart, as he now calls himself (he has also
gone by David Unger Hart and David King Liebe Hart), is a
singer-actor-musician waiting for his big break. "I'm hoping and
praying that I can get a recording contract from Capitol Records or
A&amp;M Records," he says. "I'm hoping that I can get television work and
get back on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Though the gospel, pop and patriotic songs in his repertoire do
occasionally change, Hart's act basically remains the same year after
year. He arrives by bus, sets up shop to catch Bowl-goers on their
way into shows and hangs around until the last stragglers have left
the venue. Hart doesn't speak or ask for donations; he simply sings.
He sits in a chair behind a cardboard box propped on a weathered
suitcase. As he belts out his songs, he uses his puppet Doug the dog
(occasionally replaced by Rangee the rabbit) in a ragged
ventriloquism act, hiding his mouth behind his fist or burying his
face in sheet music.</TE>
<TE>   A Chicago native, Hart followed his dreams to Hollywood in 1976
and says he was soon able to join the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists thanks to bit
parts on sitcoms such as "Chico and the Man" and movies, including
"Brewster's Millions."</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, he has a regular on-camera gig as the star and creator
of the 13-year-old "Junior Christian Teaching Bible Lesson Program,"
a religious puppet show on public access television that is,
according to Web sites and local press, an underground fave of those
who can find it. (The program can be seen locally on Adelphia Cable
channel 77 and AT&amp;T Broadband channels 43, 38 and 35.)</TE>
<TE>   Hart credits his entree to street performing and on-camera
puppeteering to his passion for--and frustration with--the Christian
Science Church.</TE>
<TE>   "What brought me to the Bowl was the church I was raised in didn't
want to hire a black soloist," he says. (Hart pontificates at length
about his brushes with racism.) He says Jim Henson, the late creator
of the Muppets, left him a puppet collection so he could create a
show for children. Hart also claims that he was once abducted by a
UFO and that he pulls in enough cash from his street performances to
cover his rent and cable bills. ("I think he's just trying to make a
buck," says Kyle Petty, a Foothill Transit driver who has talked to
Hart. "Unfortunately, I never see anything in his box. I've never
seen a dime.")</TE>
<TE>   The undisputable facts about Hart's life are as follows: He is
divorced and doesn't drink, smoke or do drugs. He can be found around
town cartooning and doing caricatures for passersby, and he performs
on the Music Center plaza during the Bowl off-season. He's a fan of
the TV Land network and especially loves color episodes of "The
Honeymooners." And, at the moment, Hart is in search of companionship
as well as a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Sherman, the Music Center's vice president of operations,
describes Hart as "a fascinating, albeit eccentric man."</TE>
<TE>   Until he lands that recording or TV gig, Hart is just content to
practice his beloved craft. "I just want to feel like I belong," he
says.</TE>

<HD>For 'Sopranos' Fans, Commentary Is a Treat That's Hard to
Refuse</HD>
<DH>Third-season installments of Emmy-winning series arrive on
video and DVD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about timing. With the fourth season premiere of HBO's "The
Sopranos" just 17 days away, HBO Home Video this week released the
third season of the Emmy Award-winning mob series on video and DVD
($100 for each format).</LD>
<LD>   The four-disc set features all 13 episodes in the wide-screen
format, talent files, a fun featurette that chronicles a day on the
set and three entertaining audio commentaries.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, discusses the episode he
wrote, "The Telltale Moozadell"; director Steve Buscemi talks about
the episode he helmed, the Coen Brothers-esque "Pine Barrens"; and
series creator David Chase chats about episode 12, "Amour Fou."</LD>
<TE>   There are also a DVD-ROM link to the Web site and an episode
index.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The world is divided into those who grew up watching the
"Schoolhouse Rock" shorts on ABC from 1972 to 1982 and those who
haven't a clue as to what all the hullabaloo is about.</TE>
<TE>   For those who did, Disney has just released a charming, nostalgic
two-disc set, "Schoolhouse Rock Special 30th Anniversary Edition"
($30). The discs feature 46 tunes from the series of clever musical
shorts that explore the fundamentals of math, grammar, science,
history and money. And even those who have never seen the series
before will probably enjoy such classics as "Conjunction Junction,"
"I'm Just a Bill" and "Electricity, Electricity." The collection also
features a new song about the electoral college, "I'm Gonna Send Your
Vote to College."</TE>
<TE>   The first disc also includes newly animated menus done by Tom Yohe
Jr., son of the original animator, the late Thomas G. Yohe, and
narrated by Bob Dorough, who was one of the original musicians and
singers.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc includes a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the
electoral college song; a "lost" song called "The Weather Show"; a
top 20 countdown of favorite numbers; a trivia game; four music
videos; a Nike commercial of "Three Is a Magic Number"; an Emmy
Awards featurette and audio commentaries from the talent behind
"Schoolhouse Rock."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Rookie" (Disney, $30) was one of the surprise hits of the
spring. Dennis Quaid stars in this sweet, true-life story of Jim
Morris, a 30-ish Texas high school science teacher and baseball coach
who gets a chance to become a relief pitcher in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes deleted scenes introduced by director
John Lee Hancock, a nice profile of the real Morris, baseball tips
from the pros and pleasant commentary from Hancock and Quaid. The DVD
is available in either wide-screen or full-screen editions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, who scored a hit together a few
years ago in the thriller "Kiss the Girls," reunite for the
pedestrian courtroom chiller "High Crimes" (Fox, $30). Judd plays a
high-profile attorney whose husband (James Caviezel) is accused of a
vicious military crime. She turns for help to a brilliant attorney
with a drinking problem (Freeman).</TE>
<TE>   Director Carl Franklin provides the self-effacing commentary. The
better-than-average featurettes examine such topics as "Comparing
Military Law to Civilian Law" and "How to Beat a Lie Detector Test."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walter Matthau died two years ago, and his great face, unique
voice and crack comedic timing are sorely missed. All three are on
display in the sophisticated 1980 comedy caper "Hopscotch," which
recently was released on DVD (Criterion, $30). Matthau plays a
Mozart-loving CIA operative who is forced into a desk job by his
dimwitted boss (Ned Beatty). Unwilling to be put out to pasture, he
decides to write his memoirs, exposing the CIA's dirtiest secrets.
Glenda Jackson, who starred with Matthau in the 1978 comedy "House
Calls," plays his former girlfriend, who helps him in his game of
hide-and-seek.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes two trailers and informative, amusing interviews
with director Ronald Neame and writer Brian Garfield, who both
clearly adored the rumpled Matthau.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Criterion is the digital edition of Rene Clair's
seminal 1931 French comedy with music, "A Nous la Liberte" ($30).
Raymond Cordy and Henri Marchand star in this satire of wealth and
industry about an escaped convict who becomes a wealthy entrepreneur
as a manufacturer of phonographs. For years he keeps his former
identity hidden, until his ex-cellmate arrives at the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a beautiful new digital transfer, the disc includes
deleted scenes; "Entr'acte," Clair's amusing Surrealistic short film
from 1924; a video interview from 1998 with Clair's widow, Madame
Bronja Clair; and an audio essay from historian David Robinson about
the lawsuit that Tobis, the company that produced the film, filed
against Charlie Chaplin and his film "Modern Times."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Cage gives one of those audacious performances he seemed
eager to attempt early in his career in the offbeat 1989 thriller
"Vampire's Kiss" (MGM, $15). Robert Bierman directed this truly
bizarre flick, in which Cage plays an odious New York literary agent
who believes he is a vampire after a beautiful woman (Jennifer Beals)
he picks up at a bar bites him on the neck. The film stirred a bit of
controversy for the scene in which Cage eats a cockroach.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features the director's cut of the film and very wry
commentary with Bierman and Cage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Carpenter followed up his 1978 slasher flick "Halloween" with
the creepy 1980 ghost story "The Fog." The "special edition" DVD
(MGM, $20) of the thriller that stars Adrienne Barbeau (then Mrs.
Carpenter), Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis and Hal Holbrook includes a
1980 documentary; a new documentary, "Tales From the Mist: Inside the
Fog," which includes interviews with Barbeau, Leigh, Carpenter and
Debra Hill, who co-wrote the thriller; outtakes; a gallery of the
advertising for the film and storyboard-to-film comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   Though Carpenter and Hill recorded the commentary on the DVD more
than seven years ago for the laserdisc edition, it's definitely worth
a listen.</TE>

<HD>Bowl Doesn't Sell Out to Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Works by Elmer Bernstein and Alex North hold their own with
'Scheherazade' in the 'Hollywood Goes Orchestral' program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attaching a "Hollywood Goes Orchestral" tag to Tuesday's concert by
the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra might be accurate, but it was also
misleading. In a program in which Elmer Bernstein's engaging Concerto
for Guitar and Orchestra--written for the evening's featured soloist,
Christopher Parkening--had its Los Angeles premiere, and a suite from
Alex North's "Cleopatra" score had its U.S. premiere,
music-for-its-own sake was the thing. In this context, the second
half's competent version of the Rimsky-Korsakov warhorse
"Scheherazade" seemed like dessert, for a change.</LD>
<LD>   Joaquin Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez" looms mightily over the
slim guitar concerto field, and others have braved the form,
including jazz guitarist John McLaughlin, who premiered his concerto
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Count Bernstein's new work as among the important new entries to
the repertory. The three-movement piece starts starkly, with the
guitar's open strings, and thickens its plot nicely. Propelled by a
musical language that is romantic and often Iberian in tone,
referring to the Rodrigo (especially in the second movement's guitar
cadenza), it also taps into Bernstein's urbane yet warm compositional
voice. Parkening played its mellow melodic segments and fervent
flamenco-esque strumming with his usual focused musicality.</LD>
<TE>   For an encore, Parkening retuned to a C-sharp chord for Carlo
Domeniconi's fascinating solo work, "Koyunbaba," whose languid rubato
introduction yields to a fast, hypnotically rippling effect.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor John Mauceri arranged "Cleopatra, a Symphonic Portrait,"
a wonderful case study in retooling film music for the concert stage.
North (1910-91), still an underrated figure in film music annals, was
an adventurous sort with a knack for lovely tunes, as with "Unchained
Melody" and "Love Theme From Spartacus." Both facets emerged here,
with ardent love themes stitched to polytonal tensions and microtonal
moments, in an altogether beautiful mesh. Hollywood conquered
Cahuenga Pass.</TE>

<LD>Photographer Jurgen Kuschnik, a Ventura County resident by way of
Germany, brings a distinctive, modernist spin to the familiar turf of
"Classic Images," in the Upstairs Gallery at Natalie's Fine Threads.
The show might seem to be evenly split between nudes and
architectural subjects, but Kuschnik brings both ends toward the
middle, focusing on the form common to both.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't approach the venerable tradition of nudes head-on,
particularly in the centerpiece of the show, images from his "Box
Works: The Figure Contained." Here, a female nude's form is encased
in an actual box. The frame-within-a-frame device becomes a playful
commentary on the "boxing" aspect of nude portraiture, contained as
they are in a frame and frozen in time. It's almost disarming to see
a figure's feet outside the box, violating the frame.</LD>
<LD>   Other nude images steer to the left of conventional, whether with
a very pregnant woman or a rough shot of a nude inside an art
gallery, as if taken quickly, on the sly.</LD>
<TE>   A similar, selective eye informs Kuschnik's architectural
photography, spanning his wide-ranging travels. The rounded edges of
a church in Taos, N.M., or the ornate white carvings on a door in
Vienna are fair game to a sharp, wandering eye. On a more personal
note, he goes home again with images from his native town of
Braunschweig, Germany. In one striking image, he shoots from an
oblique overhead view of coffee drinkers in "Kaffee Pause," inspired,
he says, by Bauhaus artist Umbo, otherwise known as Otto Umbehr.</TE>
<TE>   Kuschnik also shows a deceptively casual image of the
unceremonious front of the humble apartment building where he grew
up. By reading the accompanying text, we get the sense of a lot more
emotional baggage behind the cool, objective surface.</TE>
<TE>   * Jurgen Kuschnik's "Classic Images," Natalie's Fine Threads,
Upstairs Gallery, 596 E. Main St. Ends Saturday. 10:30 a.m.-5 p.m.
(805) 643-8854.</TE>

<TE>   Giving Voice: The discography of John Biggs, the acclaimed
Ventura-based composer, has just grown by two titles. Biggs' Consort
Press label recently released compilations of the composer's choral
and vocal music, culled from many years of his writings. They're
available through the Web site www.consort press.com. On a poignant
personal note, each CD package features still-life paintings by
Biggs' wife, Carol Rosenak, who passed away recently.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, "A Vocal Bouquet" and "A Choral Bouquet" nicely
showcase Biggs' seamless way with writing for voice. His musical
language tends to be abidingly tonal and melodic, with some
digressions into more dissonant terrain (as with the mournful "Canto
Sobre la Muerte de Silvestre," written in honor of the late, great
Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas).</TE>
<TE>   That piece, from "A Vocal Bouquet," comes in the midst of varied
musical landscapes, framed by the whimsical opener, "Eccentricities,"
and the emotionally probing, multilingual closer Songs for Baritone
and Cello. Recorded in the Ojai Presbyterian Church in 2000, in a
moving performance by baritone James Kenny and cellist Virginia Kron,
this Biggs work is a strong, recent field report from his musical
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "A Choral Bouquet" runs a gamut from his ambitious 1990 work "Mass
for Our Time" to two chorales on poems of Oscar Wilde, to an
affecting new setting of lyrics to "Silent Night."</TE>
<TE>   The CD ends with his chipper, Copland-esque "Auction Cries," its
bubbly Americana-tinged text drawn from auction ads from the Emporia
(Kan.) Gazette.</TE>
<TE>   Let it not be said that Biggs, despite his resistance to
contemporary schools of musical thought, isn't a composer with open
eyes and mind. His intriguing creative saga continues.</TE>

<HD>Zenith Joins ABC on HDTV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zenith Electronics Corp. will underwrite high-definition broadcasts
of ABC's prime-time comedies, dramas and movies for the TV season
that begins in mid-September, the two companies announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   CBS separately announced that Zenith and Samsung Electronics
America will sponsor the network's 18 programs broadcast in high
definition. This is the fourth year that CBS, owned by Viacom Inc.,
has broadcast its prime-time programs, with the exception of news and
reality shows, in high definition.</LD>
<LD>   Financial details of the deals were not disclosed, but ABC plans
to run on-air billboards at the start of each program advertising
Zenith as the network's HDTV sponsor. CBS, which partnered with
Zenith and Samsung last year, will run similar spots before the
broadcasts.</LD>
<TE>   ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co., will air at least 13 hours a week
in high definition, including "NYPD Blue," "The Practice" and
"Alias." Most of ABC's programs are shot on film and converted to
digital. This fall, there will be eight shows shot digitally, said
Alex Wallau, president of the ABC Television network.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year that ABC is offering the bulk of its
prime-time lineup in high definition.</TE>
<TE>   ABC had an arrangement three years ago with Panasonic to produce
digital broadcasts of "Monday Night Football" but that partnership
ended. Football and special events that ABC will carry next year such
as the Academy Awards, the NBA championships and the Super Bowl, "are
the next logical place for us to go," Wallau said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission has required network-owned
and affiliate stations of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox in the nation's
largest markets to be on the air with a digital signal for nearly
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Congress set a 2006 target date to convert analog television, the
current standard, to digital, which will allow for high-definition
pictures, clearer sound, more channels and interactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the FCC accelerated the nation's conversion to
digital television by giving TV manufacturers a 2007 deadline to
equip most new sets with tuners that will offer viewers
better-quality pictures and enhanced sound.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is playing its part, said Wallau.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can to drive the adaptation of this
format because we have a significant investment--particularly on the
station level," Wallau said. "Every station has spent millions of
dollars adding this technology."</TE>

<HD>Prison Term for Aviation Distributors' Former CEO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aviation Distributors Inc.'s former chief executive was sentenced to
three years in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to falsifying
the financial records of the supplier of commercial aircraft parts.</LD>
<LD>   Osamah S. Bakhit, who resigned as chairman, chief executive and
president of the company in 1997, was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine.
He pleaded guilty in February to 18 counts including securities fraud
and conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors claim that Bakhit, a Mission Viejo resident,
fraudulently inflated Aviation Distributors revenue by $1 million
when it filed for its initial public offering in March 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The 1.4-million-share sale on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market raised
almost $7 million for the Lake Forest company.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen had acted as Aviation Distributors' auditor and
resigned in August 1997 after it learned of problems with the
information that was being provided by the company.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Distributors and Bakhit's attorney couldn't be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Aviation Distributors were delisted from
over-the-counter trading in April.</TE>

<LD>UCBH Holdings Inc. agreed to buy the rest of closely held Bank of
Canton of California for $169 million in cash to expand its business

<LD>   UCBH Holdings, parent of United Commercial Bank and California's
largest bank serving customers of Chinese descent, said last month
that it planned to buy 25% of Bank of Canton for 1.3 million shares,
valued then at about $48 million.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies had said they were in talks for the remaining
75% of the bank.</LD>
<TE>   Acquiring the entire bank would increase United Commercial Bank's
assets by 42% to $4.4 billion from $3.1 billion as of March 31.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS, the largest U.S. public pension fund, said its assets fell
8% over the last year, dipping to their lowest level since 1998, but
real estate holdings softened the bear market's blow.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System said its assets
fell to $143 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30. Tumbling
stocks dragged CalPERS' total assets down from $156 billion last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The market's sharp fall has brought the pension fund's assets down
to their June 1998 level of $143 billion from a peak of $172 billion
two years earlier.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS said its investments in U.S. stocks lost 16.8% in its
fiscal year, but beat their benchmark, the Wilshire 2500 index, which
fell 17.4% in that period.</TE>
<TE>   Private equity holdings declined 7.8%, but real estate investments
in the pension fund rose 11.8%.</TE>

<HD>Making Safety Seat Use Child's Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The task of securely fitting a child safety seat into a car will
become easier beginning Sunday, when auto makers and car seat makers
are required to adopt new federal safety requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Makers of child car seats and automobiles will be required to
equip them with securing mechanisms that firmly and easily snap
together, a system called lower anchors and tethers for children, or
Latch. Some manufacturers began using the system in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Installing a safety seat with the new securing system takes less
than a minute. It involves hooking three short straps--one at the top
and two at the lower corners--from the child safety seat into anchors
i in the car seat.</LD>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that
the Latch system could prevent as many as 50 deaths and 3,000
injuries each year. An estimated 80% of child car seats are installed
incorrectly, contributing to vehicle crashes as the leading cause of
death for children of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said it launched an advertising campaign to make parents
aware of the new safety requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The Latch system can be installed on some car seats, but officials
said pre-Latch system child seats that are properly installed are
equally safe.</TE>
<TE>   The Latch system works with forward-and backward-facing seats, but
it should not be used with a booster seat.</TE>
<TE>   The system will make it easier to strap a child into a car seat,
but parents also should follow standard safety procedures such as
placing a child in the back seat and checking that the safety-seat
harness straps are tight, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents can arrange to have a child safety seat inspection by
calling (866) 732-8243.</TE>

<HD>Cendant Cuts CEO's Stock Options, Stresses Earnings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp. has sent a strong signal to its chairman and chief
executive to focus on delivering solid earnings rather than trying to
keep the travel and real estate giant's stock price propped up.</LD>
<LD>   In renegotiating Henry Silverman's employment contract for the
next 10 years, Cendant said Wednesday that his right to annual stock
option grants was terminated and replaced with an incentive bonus
that is tied to the company's pretax earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Experts said Cendant's action highlights changing attitudes about
executive pay in corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant refused to comment on the matter. However, a source
familiar with the company's decision said, "Companies are under a
great deal of pressure when it comes to how CEOs are compensated."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of scandals at Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.,
companies are battling to regain the trust of investors.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman voluntarily forfeited his annual stock option grant for
this year, the company said, cutting the value of his annual
compensation (on paper, at least) to $15 million, compared with $36
million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Of the amount he received in 2001, $3.1 million was salary, $4.7
million was in the form of a bonus, and most of the remainder came in
the form of options for 6 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman owns 8 million shares of Cendant and has options to buy
36.4 million more at an average exercise price of $13.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant's shares fell 9 cents to $14.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of Silverman's new contract coincided with
Cendant's decision to begin expensing stock options in January.</TE>
<TE>   The two moves amount to a public acknowledgment that stock option
payments to its top executive were excessive, said Bill Coleman,
senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com in Wellesley,
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "They're sending a clear message," Coleman said.</TE>

<HD>Work Still Appeals to Many Seniors</HD>
<DH>Economy: The choice to delay retirement shows that there
are jobs. And it eases pressure on Social Security funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL EDWARDS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The country clubs and cruise lines will have to wait.</LD>
<LD>   The share of American men 55 and older and still working rose to
40.4% in July, the highest since January 1984, according to Labor
Department figures. The 28% for women was a record, and participation
in the labor force among females over 65 jumped 6.5% during the last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Seniors are putting off retirement or returning to work after
watching slumping stock prices take a bite out of their savings over
the last two years. Changes in government and company retirement
plans are enticing people to work longer. Higher life expectancy and
better medical care are pushing retirement dates back. And some, like
Estelle Granger, find working more enjoyable.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'll ever retire," said Granger, 57, an
accountant who spent 25 years in banking. Four years ago, she took
early retirement, only to find herself sitting around her house on
New York's Long Island. "Most of my close friends were working. I was
so bored." Six months later, she joined Robert Half International
Inc.'s Accountemps temporary service and logs an average of 30 hours
a week.</TE>
<TE>   Stories like Granger's provide evidence the economy will continue
to recover from a recession that began in March 2001 because it
indicates companies are hiring and consumer spending is less likely
to falter, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are willing to go back to work to earn extra income and
they're able to do so," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Banc of
America Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the longer Americans keep working, the greater the
relief for the Social Security Administration, which is running out
of money to pay benefits, as baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964
retire.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Security trust fund that pays disabled workers may dry
up as early as 2028, the government forecast this year. The Medicare
trust fund will last until about 2041, while the Social Security
pension fund has until about 2043 before it runs out of cash.</TE>
<TE>   "If people would work until they're 70, we wouldn't have a Social
Security crisis," said Richard Johnson, a senior research associate
at the Urban Institute.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935, the average
American lived an average of 58 years. Now, life expectancy for both
sexes and all races is 77.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors also are at work. Employees have to shoulder more of
their retirement costs as companies shift to plans that require
workers to make contributions, such as 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   Fixed-benefit pensions based on earnings and years of service mean
additional years of work don't add much to retirement payments unless
incomes in later years rise dramatically, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, 401(k)s and other worker-managed plans provide an
incentive to stay on the job longer because employees can keep
amassing savings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's slump has accelerated the trend toward working
longer, economists said. About 54% of Americans ages 55 to 64 have at
least some of their retirement funds in the stock market, according
to a September 2001 report by the Investment Company Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "The sudden turn for the worse in people's portfolios has made the
idea of financing two decades of leisure out of the question for
society as a whole," said Clare Hushbeck, a labor economist with
AARP, which changed its name four years ago from the American Assn.
of Retired Persons to reflect the fact that much of its membership
was still working.</TE>
<TE>   Bern Beatty, the "over 70" accounting professor at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., just can't slow down.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely have no idea how I could spend the time more
pleasantly doing other things," Beatty said. "I don't like cruises. I
don't like golf. And if I stayed at home my wife would get very tired
of me."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Judge OKs Enron Severance Package</HD>
<DH>Courts: The ruling clears the way for payments to 3,553
fired workers. Also, a freeze is extended on $12 million Michael
Kopper agreed to forfeit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF ST. ONGE and DANIEL TAUB</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal bankruptcy judge Wednesday approved Enron Corp.'s
$28.8-million severance package, clearing the way for payments to
workers fired when the former energy trader filed for bankruptcy
protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Arthur Gonzalez also extended a freeze on $12 million that
former Enron executive Michael J. Kopper agreed to turn over to the
U.S. government as part of his plea agreement, giving the courts
several more weeks to decide whether the money belongs to
shareholders or creditors.</LD>
<LD>   The severance package ruling means that 3,553 employees will
receive an average $6,850 each, up to $13,500.</LD>
<TE>   The plan affects workers fired between Enron's filing and the end
of February. Employees laid off since February are covered under a
separate severance agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The court also allowed the former employees to challenge the more
than $80 million in bonuses paid to senior executives in the month
before Enron's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   "This settlement puts real money into the pockets of people who
need it most," said Ronald Sussman, a lawyer for a panel of Enron's
former and current employees. "They arguably could have been left
with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling on the $12 million came after the Enron creditors'
committee Monday sued Kopper and Enron's LJM2 Capital Management
affiliate in a bid to recover some of the more than $50 billion
they're owed. The creditors want to force the government to
relinquish its claim on Kopper's illegal gains.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, lawyers for creditors and the government
told the judge they agreed to leave the cash untouched until a
hearing in mid-September. Gonzalez approved extending the freeze
until then, subject to receiving a copy of the lawyers' agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors' committee, the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to a "stand-down from all
action" seeking to move the funds, Luc Despins, a lawyer for the
creditors' committee, told Gonzalez at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron creditors' committee and government lawyers also said
the suit will be moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan from
Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Partnerships that Kopper ran allegedly were used to hide $1
billion in Enron losses.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper pleaded guilty last week to fraud and money-laundering
conspiracies and agreed to surrender $12 million he confessed to
obtaining illegally. He agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators
and implicated ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow in the
scheme to defraud the energy company's investors.</TE>
<TE>   LJM2, which Kopper once managed, is pursuing a lawsuit in Delaware
seeking $6 million in fees paid to Kopper.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based energy company filed for bankruptcy protection
Dec. 2, the largest ever at the time, after disclosing that it used
partnerships to conceal debt. Creditors are owed more than $50
billion. WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing last month surpassed this.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the city of Portland, Ore., is considering a bid for
Enron's biggest utility company and may use government powers of
condemnation to acquire it.</TE>
<TE>   Portland General Electric was among the dozen assets Enron put up
for sale Tuesday to pay off creditors. Five years ago, Enron paid
$3.1 billion for the utility.</TE>

<HD>European Stocks Sag on German Data</HD>
<DH>Markets: Business confidence index drops to a six-month
low, indicating a shaky economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>European stocks on Wednesday suffered their biggest losses since
early August after a gauge of German business confidence slid to a
six-month low.</LD>
<LD>   The German DAX stock index tumbled 168.50 points, or 4.4%, to
3,682.84, the largest one-day drop since it fell 5.7% on Aug. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Britain's FTSE-100 fell 4% to 4,274.00, its biggest loss since a
4.8% drop Aug. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The Bloomberg European-500 index slid 3.4%, also the largest
decline since Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   France's main index lost 4.2%, while the Spanish market fell 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Europe's markets had rallied with Wall Street since July 25, and
have been following the U.S. market lower since Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Macroeconomic data in the U.S. and Europe have shown that things
aren't as rosy as the market was hoping in the past few weeks," said
Manlio Bonafede, who helps manage $1 billion at Banca Leonardo in
Milan. "Also, some companies have made it clear that it's still too
early to talk of any kind of sustained recovery at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, the Ifo Institute said Wednesday that its index of
business confidence this month declined more than economists
forecast, to the lowest level since February. It was the third
consecutive monthly drop. The index covers 7,000 companies in the
western part of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, which accounts for almost a third of the Continent's
economy, "is a drag on European growth," said Arnold Gast, who helps
manage $2.7 billion at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers in Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume picked up across Europe on Wednesday, lifting
volume in blue-chip shares to the third heaviest this month.</TE>
<TE>   European oil giants were lower on expectations that the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to
boost output when it meets Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Also, new woes for North American telecom company Nortel Networks
weighed on European telecom shares. Stock of Alcatel, Europe's
biggest phone equipment maker, sank 8.8% in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomberg European-500 index is down 23.2% year to date in
euro terms. That's worse than the 20.1% drop in the U.S. Standard &amp;
Poor's 500. Adjusted for the dollar's decline, the loss in the
Bloomberg European index is 15.5% for an American investor in those
shares.</TE>

<HD>The Future in Plastics</HD>
<DH>It's big business in California, but companies face
challenges</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has been preoccupied with helping the U.S.
steel industry, but its impact on the economy is minuscule compared
with the manufacture of plastics. In Southern California, making
plastics is very big business, employing 70,000 people among six
counties between Ventura and San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   In this region alone, plastics account for almost $15 billion in
annual output from 1,800 plants making parts for medical devices,
components for electronics and automobiles, housing for industrial
machinery and packaging for consumer goods. And plastics are a
business with growth and opportunity as new uses are found for
plastic materials.</LD>
<LD>   But plastics also are a business at the crossroads of the global
economy. Small to medium-sized companies in California and elsewhere
are threatened by low-wage competition from Asia and Latin America
but manage to hold their own by innovating products and manufacturing
processes.</LD>
<TE>   Many plastics factories in Southern California used to make parts
for aerospace defense contractors, and some of that work remains
here. But the region's factories also turn out highly engineered
products, including medical devices, cell phone casings and
construction parts such as polyvinyl chloride pipes and fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   And they do the work more efficiently every day. At a facility of
United Plastics Group Inc. in Anaheim, employees have learned how to
use new and faster machinery to "go from a prototype to full
production parts in four to six weeks where it used to take 12 to 16
weeks," says Tom Opielowski, the plant manager.</TE>
<TE>   The field of plastics keeps evolving as major chemical and
plastics firms--Dow Chemical Corp., DuPont Corp. and General Electric
Co.'s GE Plastics division--develop stronger materials and plastics
that can withstand greater heat or cold.</TE>
<TE>   "New products and processes keep coming. Few people realize that
fuel tanks on airplanes are made of plastics now," says James
Swartwout, chief executive of Summa Industries, a Torrance-based
manufacturer of plastic parts.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to advances in materials and manufacturing equipment, the
plastics industry can do things it couldn't do 10 years ago, such as
make very tiny parts for instruments used in microsurgery or
thin-walled components that allow computers and cell phones to be
light in weight yet hard enough to contain and protect powerful
microprocessors.</TE>
<TE>   United Plastics, a company with 11 plants nationwide plus
facilities in Mexico, China and Britain, is typical of today's
industry. United's Anaheim plant, which employs 250 people, produces
cell phone casings and medical device parts to exacting
specifications as well as simpler products such as plastic bottles
and packaging.</TE>
<TE>   And it competes with low-wage areas of the world.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the labor costs involved in an injection molding
plant in Mexico are only one-ninth of such costs in a U.S. plant,
says Anurag Roy, a researcher for Frost &amp; Sullivan, an industrial
consulting firm. But costs of machinery, raw materials, electricity
and transportation are cheaper in the U.S., so the labor cost
differential doesn't mean that production automatically moves to
Mexico. So adjustments are made.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim can share jobs with our sister plant in Tijuana," says
Chuck Villa, executive vice president of business development at
United's headquarters in Westmont, Ill. The company also has just
opened a plant in Suzhou, China, to supply packaging and parts to
manufacturers of cell phones and other electronic goods that have
moved production to that country.</TE>
<TE>   The globalization of plastics production differs from the pattern
of most industries. The United States runs an $8-billion trade
surplus in plastics, largely because the U.S. ships resins to most of
the world. But as makers of computer parts and electronic devices
move production to China and other countries, suppliers of plastic
parts follow them, as service suppliers follow their clients. As
plastic</TE>
<TE>   parts are low-priced, it is uneconomical to ship them long
distances.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most successful U.S. plastics companies, Nypro Inc., of
Clinton, Mass., established its first overseas plant 20 years ago and
now has 28 plants worldwide, but gets two-thirds of its $600 million
in annual sales in the U.S. Nypro has plants in San Diego and Tijuana
that share production across the border.</TE>
<TE>   So the U.S. plastics industry remains vibrant, employing 2.4
million nationwide--far larger than steel and most other
manufacturing industries. And the industry continues to grow 3% a
year, innovating products and new forms of organization and
financing.</TE>
<TE>   United Plastics, for example, is a company that has been put
together only in the last three years by Aurora Capital, a private
equity investment firm based in Los Angeles and headed by attorney
Gerald Parsky, a former U.S. assistant secretary of the Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky says he and his partners in Aurora are confident of earning
returns of 20% to 30% a year over five to seven years in the plastics
industry. Their strategy, taking a page from Nypro, is to own plants
around the world to supply local manufacturers. It has built United
to a company with $300 million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   United is making sizable investments to earn those returns for
Aurora. It has just opened a technology and development center at the
Anaheim facility, which used to be an aerospace supplier named
Southern Plastics Molding. Having acquired a plant in Suzhou, United
is looking for a facility in Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Aurora is not alone in seeing opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a great business," says Swartwout of Summa
Industries, which makes plastic parts at plants in Corona and Ontario
and in Tennessee and Mississippi. Summa, which will have about $115
million in revenue this year, makes lenses and reflectors for the
lighting fixtures you see in Home Depot and other warehouse
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good niche business because the "plastic reflectors are
large and not easily shipped from other countries," says Swartwout.
"Nonetheless, the cost pressures are enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Why then are plastics a vibrant business? "Because we can
constantly develop new products for customers," Swartwout says.</TE>
<TE>   The plastics industry, which employs 147,000 in California, may
not be the first industry that comes to mind when people think of
business in this state. But considering that it's a manufacturing
industry that relies on basic chemistry and adroit development of
technologies and new products, and that it is integrally involved in
the global economy, plastics are a natural for this region and this
state.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Bush administration should pay attention to the health
of the plastics industry; it's more important than most.</TE>

<HD>Scrutiny of Focus' Air Bags Increases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S. safety regulators have intensified another investigation into
reported defects involving Ford Motor Co.'s Focus compact car, citing
130 complaints of burn injuries from air bags.</LD>
<LD>   The injury complaints add to a litany of problems that have beset
the Focus since Ford put it on sale in 2000, marketing the car to
young buyers to introduce them to the Ford brand.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this month
upgraded the investigation into 576,700 of the 2000 and 2001 model
year Focus cars to an engineering analysis, a step that often
precedes a recall.</LD>
<TE>   NHTSA said Ford had received 100 complaints about the Focus' air
bags, adding to the 40 already made to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the 130 reported injuries, there were 18 reports that
the deployed air bags caused other parts of the vehicle to catch
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the gas in a deploying air bag comes from a chemical
reaction that inflates the bag in less than one-tenth of a second.</TE>
<TE>   The chemicals that launch a bag are heated to 350 degrees
Fahrenheit, and there have been several other reports of burns or
irritations from air bags in other models.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, Ford has been forced to issue nine safety
recalls for the Focus; six probes of possible defects are still
pending. And a lawsuit was filed in July in California over the
Focus' brakes.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA has five other investigations pending into the Focus over
complaints of under-hood fires, stalling engines, broken suspension
pieces, bad wheel bearings and air bags that deploy unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   The California lawsuit claims the front brakes on the 2000 and
2001 Focus wear out so quickly that they require "continuous
replacement." A reply from Ford is due this week.</TE>
<TE>   Ford says that it has fixed many quality problems with the Focus
and that warranty claims from the first months of service are
declining.</TE>
<TE>   But quality concerns may be one reason sales of the Focus are off
10% this year through July at 139,289 vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Focus is outsold in the United States by General Motors
Corp.'s Chevrolet Cavalier.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares fell 26 cents Wednesday to $11.63 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Cleveland Sues Ford Over Police Cruisers</HD>
<DH>Courts: The lawsuit says the Crown Victorias are unsafe; it
cites fire injuries and deaths outside Ohio. The auto maker says the
cars meet safety standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>M.R. KROPKO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>The city filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court Wednesday on
behalf of law enforcement agencies across Ohio that accuses Ford
Motor Co. of selling unsafe police cars.</LD>
<LD>   Similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Florida concerning the potential for fuel tank fires
in Crown Victoria police cars, a city official said.</LD>
<LD>   In the last 10 years, there have been reports of at least a dozen
police officer deaths in fiery wrecks involving Crown Victoria police
cruisers.</LD>
<TE>   Ford spokeswoman Sara Tatchio said the lawsuit was not a surprise
to the company because the issue is not new.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very serious situation for us, and we're treating it
with urgency," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 2, Texas filed suit to press for safety improvements in
the fuel systems of an estimated 25,000 Crown Victorias.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Arizona suspended all Crown Victoria purchases for
police agencies and demanded a safety review after the deaths of
three Highway Patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has been trying to determine how to prevent gas tank fires
and explosions after rear-end collisions in its police car version of
the Crown Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, which has maintained that the cars meet safety standards and
do not need to be recalled, agreed in June to set up two study panels
and has been attempting to conduct safety tests. However, this month
Ford said it hasn't been able to get fuel bladders needed for those
tests.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker is considering making foam-filled bladders
surrounding the gas tank to block fuel from leaking in a collision.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Cleveland's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court,
lists seven fuel tank fires during 2000 and 2001, all of which led to
injuries or deaths. None of the examples involved an Ohio police
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   R. Eric Kennedy, the attorney for the city, said, "This lawsuit is
trying to prevent deaths from happening."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit does not specify a dollar amount sought for damages,
but it says compensatory and punitive damages are appropriate, as are
restitution and attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland has 481 police cars that are Ford Crown Victorias, along
with Mayor Jane Campbell's city car.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, shares of Ford were down 26 cents to $11.63 in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Global Settlement Bid Rejected</HD>
<DH>Probe: SEC reportedly turns down initial proposal because
it does not name officers and executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a settlement proposal
from Global Crossing Ltd., the big fiber-optic network operator that
filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   Under Global Crossing's offer, the company would have agreed to
cease and desist fraudulent practices without denying or admitting
guilt, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC rejected the proposal because it would have applied to the
company in general and not to specific individuals.</LD>
<TE>   The commission wants a settlement that names specific Global
Crossing officers and executives. Potential sanctions against company
officials include disbarment from future office at publicly traded
companies, the Journal said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking into what Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick knew when he sold $123 million in stock in May 2001, when the
company engaged in numerous swap transactions, the paper said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Winnick declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's stance shows the increased pressure it is applying on
Global Crossing, which once had a greater market value than General
Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in January, then
the fourth-largest in history, was part of a wave of accounting
scandals across the industry.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the bankruptcy filing, former Global Crossing finance
executive Roy Olofson alleged that the company used improper
accounting methods, including so-called swap transactions, to help
maintain revenue and bolster its stock price.</TE>
<TE>   This month, a pair of Asian conglomerates acquired Global Crossing

<HD>Timing Is Key in IPO Awards to WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Probe: At issue is whether Salomon allocated shares after
they had begun to trade, assuring a profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The timing of coveted new stock allocations from Salomon Smith Barney
to executives of WorldCom Inc. is shaping up as a potentially key
question in a congressional probe into whether the brokerage doled
out shares to win investment banking business.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether Salomon placed shares of late-1990s initial
public offerings in the accounts of WorldCom executives after the
shares had begun to trade. Because many IPOs soared on their first
trading day, awarding shares at the IPO price in the days after an
offering could have guaranteed the buyer a risk-free profit.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee is studying Salomon's
dealings with WorldCom as part of a probe of the telecom firm's
record bankruptcy in July. The committee is investigating whether
Salomon dispensed shares of hot IPOs to WorldCom executives as a way
to lure lucrative investment banking business--and if it did, whether
that broke any laws.</LD>
<TE>   Salomon and its parent, Citigroup Inc., deny wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a committee subpoena, Salomon released documents
showing that the firm allocated almost 900,000 shares of various IPOs
to Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's former chief executive. Several
other WorldCom executives also were awarded IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   In its subpoena, the committee asked for the dates when Ebbers and
other executives acquired shares, but did not receive that
information, said Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for the committee,
which is chaired by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Arda Nazerian, a Salomon spokeswoman, said the firm believes "we
supplied all the information requested in the subpoena."</TE>
<TE>   The committee is believed to be considering another subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of doling out IPO shares to select executives, which
is known on Wall Street as "spinning," has long been controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Securities law experts say spinning itself is not illegal. An
explicit quid pro quo in which an executive promised business to an
investment bank in exchange for IPO shares could violate securities
laws, but proving such a link is difficult, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say you found a smoking gun because you found
spinning," said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia
University. "What you need to show is, in effect, allocations of free
money to highly placed executives in hopes those executives would
reciprocate by giving business" to a brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   If IPOs were given to clients only after trading had begun and the
shares had risen, the clients would have taken no risks yet been
guaranteed immediate profit.</TE>
<TE>   In such a scenario, a brokerage could give the appearance of
allocating the IPO shares to other investors, then reallocate them to
favored executives only after they had shown a profit, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon "can wait and see how hot the offering is," said Stephen
Bainbridge, a UCLA law professor. "If it's really hot and it would
lock in a huge profit, then they can reallocate the shares and give
their investment banking client a sure thing. If the offering is not
hot, the investment banking client has not invested in a so-so
stock."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon has said it based its IPO distributions to WorldCom
executives on the size of their personal brokerage accounts. The
WorldCom executives were among the firm's "best customers," Salomon
said, noting that it is industry practice to give IPO shares to
high-net-worth investors whose trading generates large fees for the
firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the documents it sent the House, Salomon said the date an
investor acquires IPO shares can sometimes be after the public
offering.</TE>
<TE>   One reason such "as of" trading can occur is that some customers
renege, meaning they "may not be willing or able to pay" for the
shares, Salomon said. The firm then would allocate the shares to
another customer at the IPO price.</TE>
<TE>   But it is unlikely that large numbers of investors would have
reneged on IPOs in the late 1990s, given the enormous profits that
many of the deals instantly generated, experts said.</TE>

<HD>Many Telecom Executives Got IPO Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least a dozen U.S. telecommunications executives and investors may
have received initial public offering shares from Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney unit in recent years, memos from the world's
largest financial services company show.</LD>
<LD>   Salomon had a system to give IPO shares to executives of companies
that the firm did investment banking business with, according to the
memos subpoenaed by the House Financial Services Committee. The
shares could be sold at a profit within hours or days.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup maintains that all of the IPO allocations were legal.</LD>
<TE>   Names on the documents include Qwest Communications International
Inc. founder Philip Anschutz, Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. Chairman
Stephen Garofalo, and former Williams Communications Group Inc.
Chairman Roy Wilkens.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon also awarded IPO shares to WorldCom Inc. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The documents were gathered in a congressional investigation of
whether Citigroup awarded IPO shares in exchange for future
investment banking business. Regulators also are looking into whether
analysts such as Jack Grubman, who had been Salomon's star telecom
analyst, touted stocks of companies that were investment banking
clients of their firms.</TE>
<TE>   The memos the House obtained specify the number of shares in two
1999 IPOs--Juno Online Services Inc. and Rhythms NetConnections
Inc.--that each telecom executive was interested in buying.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup told investigators that executives who received IPO
shares were awarded them because of their status as wealthy clients
of the brokerage, rather than their corporate affiliations.
Investment banking business played no role in the awards, the firm
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The memos merely indicate expressions of interest, as is
consistent with the allocation process," said Salomon spokeswoman
Susan Thomson. "There was a huge difference between what people
wanted and what they got."</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz personally received no IPO allocations, any of which
would have been made to his investment fund, said Craig Slater,
president of Anschutz's investment arm. "It's logical that, as a big
trader, we would have received allocations," Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   Slater said he doesn't know whether the Denver-based firm bought
Juno or Rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo "was a Salomon customer and as with other similarly
situated customers, he was given an opportunity-- which in his case
was a relatively small allocation--to participate in IPOs," said
Barry Bohrer, Garofalo's attorney. "It had nothing to do with
investment banking business. There were others at his company that
made investment banking decisions, and he was not in the loop."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkens could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Kmart to Publish Weekly Advertising in Spanish</HD>
<DH>Retail: As part of its restructuring, the discount chain
focuses on urban markets and multicultural shoppers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TROY, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp., which is restructuring under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, said on Wednesday that it will publish its weekly
advertising circular in Spanish for the first time, in a bid to reach
out to the growing Latino market.</LD>
<LD>   The discount retailer said the advertising circular would be
translated into Spanish starting today.</LD>
<LD>   The circular will be available in 160 Kmart stores located in
areas with large Latino populations and appear in 10 Spanish-language
newspapers throughout the United States, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Troy, Mich.-based Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
January and is struggling with empty aisles, said it is making the
move because of the buying power of the Spanish-speaking market,
which has more than doubled in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said this part of the market is a $500-billion growth
sector.</TE>
<TE>   Before its bankruptcy filing, Kmart attempted to compete with
rival discount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with an everyday
low-pricing strategy.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its restructuring, Kmart will focus on its strengths in
urban markets and multicultural shoppers, who comprise nearly 40% of
its customer base.</TE>
<TE>   More than 55% of all Latinos living in the United States are
within 15 minutes of a Kmart, the company added.</TE>
<TE>   "With our exceptional reach into urban markets, we feel we have a
distinct advantage over other discount retailers when it comes to
connecting with Hispanic customers," said Barbara J. Firment, a Kmart
senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart Chairman and Chief Executive James Adamson has said he wants
to incorporate Latino and African American brands into Kmart's
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Kmart will begin testing a men's clothing line, called
Ched-da.</TE>
<TE>   The clothing, created by a New York company, is described as young
men's urban, hip-hop line.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Kmart shares declined 2 cents to
66 cents.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Lehman Broker Pleads Guilty to Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Frank Gruttadauria, a former broker with Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.
and SG Cowen &amp; Co., pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing $40 million
from 50 clients by falsifying account statements.</LD>
<LD>   The former Cleveland branch chief for the two brokerages pleaded
guilty to securities fraud, mail fraud, identity theft and making
false statements to a bank, said Bill Edwards, first assistant U.S.
attorney in Cleveland. He will be required to make restitution.</LD>
<LD>   Gruttadauria, 44, was at the center of one of the biggest cases of
broker fraud in recent years. The matter led to congressional
hearings earlier this year in which the Securities and Exchange
Commission acknowledged conducting brokerage audits that didn't catch
his wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   Gruttadauria didn't commit the crimes for personal gain, said his
lawyer, Joan Synenberg. "He never took a penny for himself," she
said. "He stole Peter to pay Paul. He never stole Peter to pay
himself." She declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The broker was charged with fraud earlier this year on allegations
that he inflated the value of clients' accounts by $277 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gruttadauria could get 6 1/2 to eight years in prison.</TE>

<HD>FDA Clears Test to Detect Most Severe Form of Lupus</HD>
<DH>Health: With early diagnosis of the sometimes fatal
disease, damage to vital organs can be reduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists in Seattle have been cleared by the Food and Drug
Administration to market a new screening test for the most severe
form of lupus, a sometimes fatal disease so deceptive in its
development that it can be mistaken for everything from severe
sunburn to clinical psychosis.</LD>
<LD>   Systemic lupus erythematosis, or SLE, is the most virulent form of
the disease that attacks tissues of the body's vital organs,
including brain, heart and kidneys. Early detection, crucial in
protecting organs from lasting damage, has been elusive.</LD>
<LD>   Experts on the disease say the test, developed by Dr. Mark Roth of
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Basic Sciences division,
will close the gap in the 20% of SLE cases that escape detection and
remain undiagnosed for months or years.</LD>
<TE>   Duane Peters of the Lupus Foundation of America described the news
as important and exciting.</TE>
<TE>   Judith James, associate professor of medicine at the Oklahoma
Medical Research Foundation, affiliated with the University of
Oklahoma, agreed, saying that "there has never been a definitive,
clear-cut answer in terms of a test" for the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of lupus sufferers in the U.S. range from a low of
250,000 to as many as 1.4 million. But scientists said 10 times that
number may have the disease and need testing.</TE>
<TE>   Peters said the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has issued a request for proposals to more clearly
establish the number of lupus sufferers in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The disease primarily affects women in their child-bearing years.
African American women are two to three times more likely than whites
to have the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Angela Calger, a 32-year-old Oklahoma City resident,
is an example of the suffering SLE victims might have to endure
without a correct diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   In 12 years, Calger had two miscarriages and many debilitating
illnesses because of flare-ups of lupus before she was finally told
last year that she had the ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice if it could have been diagnosed a lot
sooner," Calger said.</TE>
<TE>   Labeled "the great mimicker," the disease can flare from simple
exposure to the sun. That's what happened to Calger in her most
recent and most serious attack, which has been quieted but remains
active, she said. Over the years, her disease was diagnosed by
doctors as a false positive for a sexually transmitted disease to a
severe case of anemia.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle-based Hutchinson center has cleared the FDA's
requirements for the screening test, which uses proteins to detect
lupus antibodies in the blood.</TE>
<TE>   If the antibodies are present, the sample turns deep purple or
almost black. Not every lupus sufferer has the antibodies, said
James, so the test would have to be used in concert with other tests.</TE>
<TE>   Roth said the center is negotiating with firms interested in
manufacturing and distributing the test.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Hit 2-Week Lows on Bleak Tech Outlook</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Warning from Nortel drags down telecom sector.
Investors remain cautious ahead of the Labor Day holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed at their lowest levels in two weeks Wednesday as a
hodgepodge of bad news--including job cuts at Nortel Networks and a
downbeat brokerage report on Sun Microsystems--eroded hopes for a
swift upturn in corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   "People are worried about earnings, and the news isn't getting any
better," Ken Turek, investment manager at Northern Trust Corp., told
Bloomberg News.</LD>
<LD>   All three major market gauges closed at their lowest levels since
Aug. 13, with tech shares leading the way down. The Nasdaq composite
index, loaded with tech and telecom stocks, dropped 33.40 points, or
2.5%, to 1,314.38. That came on top of Tuesday's 3.2% swoon.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.32 points, or
1.5%, to 8,694.09. The S&amp;P 500 index lost 16.95 points, or 1.8%, to
917.87.</TE>
<TE>   Losers trounced winners by 2 to 1 on both Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Trading volumes were thin, with much of Wall Street
on vacation ahead of Monday's Labor Day holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has given up about half of the 18% gain it rang up after
hitting a five-year low Aug. 5. The S&amp;P 500 has given back about a
quarter of the 20% it gained in the weeks after July 23, when the
benchmark index closed at a 5 1/2-year low.</TE>
<TE>   And since the Dow closed above 9,000 on Aug. 22--the first time in
six weeks--it has lost 360 points, an indication of how cautious
investors remain after the market's May-July decline.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, battered telecom equipment giant Nortel cut its
revenue forecast and said it would trim an additional 7,000 jobs.
Nortel fell 19 cents to $1.04, down 15%. Rival Lucent Technologies
fell 20 cents, or 11%, to $1.69. The Amex index of 15 telecom stocks
lost 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Sun fell 28 cents, or nearly 7%, to $3.96. Goldman Sachs said Sun
probably will not meet profit estimates, given the weakness in
information technology spending.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in stocks fueled demand for fixed-rate government
debt, lifting Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   "People are concerned about how strong this [economic] recovery
will actually be, which is hurting stocks and helping bonds," said
Mark MacQueen, a fixed-income manager at Sage Advisory Services.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 4.21%
from 4.28% on Tuesday. The yield on the two-year T-note fell to 2.17%
from 2.23% after $27 billion of new notes were auctioned by the
government. The amount matches a record sold in each of the last
three months, reflecting the government's need to finance the first
budget deficit since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury sold the two-year notes at a yield of 2.22%, the
lowest yield in auction history and below traders' expectations,
indicating demand for the securities was greater than anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar rose on speculation the Treasury auction prompted some
investors to buy the currency to invest in government debt.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, oil prices fell for a second day, dipping
49 cents to $28.34 a barrel in New York amid signs that OPEC may
raise production quotas when it meets next month.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks took a hit after Prudential Securities cut its
earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs Group and Lehman Bros. Holdings,
citing the weak stock market and anemic filings for new stock
offerings. Goldman fell $2.02 to $77.08, and Lehman fell $2.02 to
$56.22. The Amex broker-dealer index fell more than 3%.</TE>
<TE>   * Qwest Communications International surged 9%, up 24 cents at
$3.01, amid rumors the telephone and data services company was close
to a deal with its banks to amend the terms of a $3.39-billion credit
agreement, analysts said. The company declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Another bright spot was InterMune, which jumped $4.66, or 26%,
to $22.66 after results from a late-stage trial of its drug for a
fatal lung disease showed it helped prolong life in some patients.</TE>
<TE>   * Chip stocks were hit again by bad news after being slammed
Tuesday by a lackluster outlook from Intel that dampened hopes for a
rebound in the sector. Intel, which was the most actively traded
stock on Nasdaq, fell 34 cents to $16.84.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Semtech fell $4.87 to $14.05 after the chip maker forecast
third-quarter sales would fall due to weak consumer demand. A key
index of chip stocks, which has tumbled about 16% in the last week,
fell 4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil shares were weak, sagging in line with crude oil prices. Oil
giant and Dow component Exxon Mobil dropped $1.28 to $35.62. The Amex
oil index fell more than 2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Philip Morris jumped $1.41 to $49.31 after the tobacco giant
raised its quarterly divided 10.3%.</TE>

<HD>Nortel Bonds Fall on Lower Forecast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The telecom sector's meltdown continued Wednesday, as Nortel Networks
Corp. bonds--rated investment grade as recently as April--fell to
less than half of face value after the company's warning that
near-term sales will miss forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Nortel's bonds with a 6.125% annual coupon, maturing in 2006, slid
$5.50 to $48 per $100 face value. The bonds had traded at 80 cents on
the dollar in April, before the debt was downgraded to "junk" level.</LD>
<LD>   Nortel and rival Lucent Technologies Inc. have seen their bonds
sink since 2000 as sales of switches and routers have dropped, and as
many other telecom firms have collapsed into bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   The companies' cash levels--much of it raised from sales of
convertible preferred equity securities earlier this year--will
dwindle until the firms stem operating losses, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucent and Nortel both still have substantial cash, but as time
goes by and you still see a soft market for orders, depletion of
these cash reserves will impair bondholders," said Stephen Ardizzoni,
who doesn't own either company's bonds in the $450 million he manages
at SMH Capital Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The prices of Nortel bonds indicate investors lack confidence that
the company will be able to repay its debt. About 75% of companies
whose bonds trade below 50 cents on the dollar end up restructuring
their debt within three years, said Mike Taylor, a high-yield bond
analyst at Bear Stearns Cos.</TE>
<TE>   "They're essentially shut out of the capital markets," Taylor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies in Nortel's position sometimes try to restructure debts
with creditors rather than file for bankruptcy protection.
Restructuring options include offering bondholders some combination
of cash, stock and new debt in exchange for existing bonds, Taylor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel spokeswoman Tina Warren declined to comment on whether the
company plans a debt restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel, North America's second-biggest maker of telecom gear, said
Tuesday that sales in the current quarter will fall as much as 10%
from the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel's shares on the New York Stock Exchange fell 19 cents to
$1.04. They rallied as high as $1.29 last week after falling to a
record low close of 82 cents July 26.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel's debt is rated Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service and
BB-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's. Moody's said Wednesday that it may
further cut its rating.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberate Technologies Inc., a maker of interactive-television
software, said its fiscal first-quarter results will fall short of
forecasts because of lower spending by cable and telephone companies.</LD>
<LD>   Liberate said it will report a loss of 12 cents to 19 cents a
share, wider than the 6 cents to 8 cents it expected. Revenue
excluding impairment costs and other expenses in the quarter ending
Saturday will be $12 million to $14 million, compared with its
earlier forecast of $20 million to $22 million.</LD>
<LD>   The San Carlos, Calif.-based company said it will have
first-quarter costs of $2 million to $3 million to streamline
operations and expects to see savings in the second quarter. It did
not provide specifics on steps it is taking to reduce expenses.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts had forecast revenue of $20.6 million and a loss of 7
cents, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Liberate shares were down as much as 49 cents to $1.62 in extended
trading on the report, after closing at $2.11, down 4 cents, on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. shares tumbled 15% after an analyst cut profit forecasts
for the operator of the most-used Internet search site, partly on
concern about slowing sales growth at its job-advertisement site
HotJobs.com.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Yahoo fell $1.57 to $9.13 on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, TMP Worldwide Inc., owner of the biggest Internet
employment site, Monster.com, this month trimmed its full-year profit
forecast because companies are buying fewer ads on Monster.com. That
may indicate that rival HotJobs.com will have a tougher quarter than
forecast, said Investec Inc. analyst James Preissler, who rates Yahoo
shares a "sell" and does not own them.</LD>
<TE>   Preissler lowered his third-quarter earnings forecast to 3 cents a
share from 5 cents and 2002 profit to 13 cents from 16 cents.</TE>

<LD>All three car plants of Daewoo Motor Co. suspended operation after
the company's largest supplier stopped shipping parts to protest
delays in payments.</LD>
<LD>   The suspension, if prolonged, could disrupt General Motors Corp.'s

outside firms.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, an association of 191 parts suppliers for Daewoo Motor
has threatened to stop supplies Thursday to protest overdue bills.</TE>
<TE>   In April, GM agreed to set up a new joint venture with investors

<LD>Conseco Inc. was dealt another blow when a court upheld an
arbitrator's order that it pay nearly $27 million for violations of
consumer protection laws by a company Conseco acquired.</LD>
<LD>   The South Carolina Supreme Court made the ruling in a case that
was argued in March.</LD>
<LD>   The case affects 3,739 South Carolina customers with
home-improvement or mobile-home loans in the mid-1990s from what was
then Green Tree Financial Corp. Conseco bought Green Tree in 1998,
two years after the dispute began.</LD>
<TE>   Conseco Finance was ordered to pay about $20.1 million to the
clients affected, plus $6.7 million in legal fees and consumer
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A court in India rejected a move to reduce charges against the former
chairman of U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp. for a 1984 gas leak that
killed thousands in one of the world's worst industrial accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Judicial Magistrate Rameshwar Kotha ordered extradition
proceedings to begin against former Chairman Warren Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson originally was charged with "culpable homicide," which
carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in May asked the court to reduce the charge to
"hurt by negligence."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, whose whereabouts were not known, would have faced a
maximum sentence of two years if convicted in absentia of the lesser
charge. He has refused to appear in court in India since the case
opened in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Dow Chemical Co., of Midland, Mich., acquired Union Carbide last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Union Carbide paid the Indian government $470 million as part of a
settlement in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The company accepted moral responsibility for the disaster, but
said the plant was sabotaged by a disgruntled employee.</TE>

<HD>Michaels Stores' Profit Climbs in 2nd Quarter</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michaels Stores Inc., the world's largest arts-and-crafts retailer,
said second-quarter profit climbed more than fourfold on strong sales
and lower expenses. The company also benefited from new stores.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $21.5 million, or 30 cents a share, from $4.67
million, or 7 cents, a year ago, as sales jumped 19% to $576.6
million. The results far exceeded the 18-cent average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Irving, Texas-based Michaels, which also operates Aaron
Brothers stores, jumped as much as 14% to $45 in extended trading.
They had closed off $2.15 at $39.75 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Michaels also said that August sales have been stronger than it
expected, and it projects same-store sales this month to rise 5% to
6% from a year earlier, rather than a previous estimate that they
would be little changed.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Allege Scam by Shoreline</HD>
<DH>Securities: The SEC says members of the Costa Mesa firm
diverted money for their own use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission has halted a suspected
$3.8-million securities fraud run by Costa Mesa-based Shoreline
Development Co. and four individuals, including two who were
previously sanctioned by the SEC, the federal agency said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC obtained a temporary restraining order from U.S. District
Judge Ronald Lew in Los Angeles on Tuesday, halting the scheme.</LD>
<LD>   In its civil case, the SEC alleges that the defendants diverted
more than $1 million of investor money intended for oil and gas well
investment for their own purposes, including paying gambling debts at
the Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas and for a Maui honeymoon for
one defendant.</LD>
<TE>   Lew appointed Douglas Wilson as receiver for Shoreline, said SEC
spokeswoman Lisa Gok. Wilson will determine how much money is left in
Shoreline's frozen bank accounts and investigate whether the company
actually made gas and oil well investments.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said it learned of the alleged fraud through an investor
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants include: Todd J. Taylor, 36; Derek K. Gradwell, 29;
Paul A. Barrios III, 40; and Dennis P. O'Connell, 47, all of Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   David Grey, an attorney for the defendants, said he couldn't
comment on the case because he had just received a copy of the SEC's
documents and allegations and had yet to read through them.</TE>
<TE>   According to the SEC, "Taylor and Gradwell made misrepresentations
about the performance of Shoreline's wells; a purported business
relationship with El Paso Field Services; and their use of investor
funds."</TE>
<TE>   The diverted money also paid for lavish vacations to Florida, a
wedding for Taylor, customized motorcycles and other luxury items,
the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Taylor and Barrios are repeat securities law violators,
according to the agency. In 1999, Taylor was ordered by a federal
district court not to sell securities without registering with the
SEC as a broker-dealer because he was selling securities without a
license. In 2000, Barrios was the subject of a cease-and-desist order
issued by the SEC suspending him for 12 months for selling
unregistered securities.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued
against the defendants is scheduled for Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said it will seek a final judgment against the defendants
prohibiting them from future securities law violations and ordering
them to disgorge "all ill-gotten gains" and to pay civil penalties.</TE>

<HD>If Players Strike, Home Field Is a Disadvantage</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The local economies would take a hit, but owners
and athletes are expected to feel little pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO and LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those with the biggest financial stakes in major league baseball are
positioned to weather the immediate pain of a players' strike, but
cities such as Los Angeles and Anaheim would lose millions of dollars
in tax and business revenues with every canceled game.</LD>
<LD>   Estimates by the U.S. Conference of Mayors show that if players
strike as early as today, it would cost baseball cities and area
businesses an average $1.4 million a game, a spokesman said
Wednesday. Only if a strike eliminates the playoffs and World Series
or drags into next season, as the 1994-95 labor impasse did, would
the strain on baseball's internal economy begin to show, potentially
forcing several weaker teams into bankruptcy protection, sports
financial experts warned.</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball is the Titanic of sports leagues, and it's headed for
the glacier now," said Dean Bonham, chief executive of Denver-based
Bonham Group, a sports-marketing and finance firm. "The glacier is
the strike. And if the players go out on strike, the ship is going to
sink."</LD>
<TE>   Lessons learned from the sport's checkered labor history have
prompted baseball bankers and some landlords to limit their exposure
with large reserve funds or contracts that lock teams into making
lease payments. Players will be able to draw on a union savings fund.
And owners, who complain that they lose millions of dollars when
their teams are playing under the sport's current system, say they
can withstand a strike financially.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no looming financial pressure out there that in one
week's time, if the players go out, we'll all collapse," said
Jonathan Mariner, senior vice president and chief financial officer
for the league.</TE>
<TE>   The strike's timing--coming at the end of the season--and its
relatively isolated effect will blunt any drastic economic hit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not like the airlines, an engine of the American economy,
are going on strike," said Mark Rosentraub, dean of urban affairs at
Cleveland State University and author of a book on stadium economics.
"It's not like the entire auto industry went out and you're talking
about 15% of the nation's employment."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Orange counties, pro sports--basketball, hockey
and baseball--employ 2,600 full-time workers and generate $265
million a year, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. This
is dwarfed when compared with a regional work force of 4.5 million
and output of $457 billion, said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the
Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. "This is not going to
devastate the local economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some will feel the hurt right away.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer John brand meats would lose the sale of 260,000 Dodger Dogs
if the remaining 13 games of the Dodgers' regular season are
canceled, said Ron Smith, the firm's director of public relations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned about this," he said. "If the Dodgers are no
longer, then we're no longer. It's an integral part of who we are."</TE>
<TE>   Also in a pickle are companies such as Aramark Corp., which
operates concessions at Edison Field, Dodger Stadium and 12 other
ballparks. The firm declined to say how its business would suffer
from a strike, but its 2001 annual report said the last strike
resulted in a 5% drop in operating income and predicted a repeat
could "result in a substantial loss of sales and reduced profits."</TE>
<TE>   A top executive at rival Sportservice Inc. said the hardest hit
would be part-time vendors. "It's the common guy who is going to be
affected, who is making $25,000 to $30,000 a year," said Nick Biello,
chief operating officer of contract services for the firm, which runs
concessions at eight major league parks.</TE>
<TE>   At Edison Field, the ax would fall on 300 part-time Aramark
cashiers, cooks and other vendors who make $60 to $112 per six-hour
shift. Many are students or workers looking for a second income; many
also depend on the job for insurance.</TE>
<TE>   A strike would deprive them of income from the remaining 12 Angels
home games, plus the potential for making more during the playoffs,
said Ada Torres, president of Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union Local 681.</TE>
<TE>   "They really look forward to working each and every shift because
there's a limited number," Torres said. "The workers are concerned."</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative effect of lost taxes, local business and stadium
revenues on any major league city would be about 20% more than the
last strike, said the Mayor's Conference spokesman. Based on that,
another work stoppage would cost the city of Anaheim approximately
$2.3 million per home game.</TE>
<TE>   No numbers were immediately available for Los Angeles but a city
official said municipal coffers would lose 10% of Dodger Stadium
parking revenue, 1% of the sales tax on tickets and a business tax of
one-half of 1% of gross receipts from concessions. The Dodgers will
be billed approximately $1.44 million for property taxes, strike or
no strike.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the sports economic food chain, the players have
been urged for more than a year to put money aside in anticipation of
a strike, said Greg Bouris, communications director for the Major
League Players Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes, who make an average $2.4 million a year, will lose
two of their 12 paychecks for the year. And as an added measure, the
union executive board may give out shares from a pot of licensing
fees collected for using player images on trading cards, video games
and clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Their bosses, meanwhile, have counted the cost and concluded a
strike wouldn't hurt them right away, said Mariner, the league CFO.
Part of the reason: Although revenue would stop, owners would shed
two major expenses, player payroll and stadium rent, which in many
cases is tied to attendance. The league also would keep the payments
from its $2.5-billion national television contract with Fox Sports,
which receives credits for lost games and advertising.</TE>
<TE>   More worrisome is the $2.5 billion in debt that team owners have
taken on to pay for stadiums, the purchase of franchises and meeting
payroll. Some believe several owners are so seriously in debt that a
strike of any length would have dire consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of teams out there that are highly leveraged
and need every game to make payroll," said John A. Moag Jr., CEO of
Moag &amp; Associates, a Baltimore-based sports investment banking firm.
"If that gets cut off, it has very serious implications for
franchises ... about a third of them." He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   But baseball officials say they are prepared. There are nine
months worth of reserves to cover the debt teams owe through a
$1.3-billion leaguewide revolving line of credit underwritten by lead
investment bankers J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and FleetBoston
Financial, Mariner said.</TE>
<TE>   Team owners are on the hook to bankers for an additional $1.2
billion for individual loans taken to build stadiums, make player
payroll and purchase their franchises. Bankers who make those loans
often require similar reserve funds, said one financier.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an unfortunate comment on the state of sports, but people
have planned for it [work stoppages]," said Tom Whitworth, executive
vice president of Legg Mason Real Estate Services, a
Philadelphia-based firm that helps team owners find loans.</TE>
<TE>   An escrow account also will keep construction going on the
$296-million downtown ballpark for the San Diego Padres, according to
city and Padres officials. The park is set to be ready by Opening Day
2004.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for other public stadium authorities say they probably
will suffer a decrease from stadium revenue because some lease
payments are tied to attendance. Cut out the last games of the
season, and the money stops coming in. In Cleveland, officials say
the shortage won't affect the repayments to bondholders but might cut
deeply into the operating budget of the nonprofit that operates and
maintains Jacobs Field.</TE>
<TE>   The public authority running Coors Field, home to the Colorado
Rockies, would take a financial hit--just over $200,000--if the final
13 games are canceled. On pace to draw nearly 2.9 million fans, the
Rockies pay 25 cents to 50 cents for each ticket sold between 2.25
million and 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Other baseball landlords, mindful of potential strikes, have
insisted on clauses that locked teams into their mortgage payments.
In Milwaukee, where taxpayers pay an additional penny on a $10
purchase to cover stadium bonds, the Brewers are locked into a lease
requiring payment of $900,000 to $1.21 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Mick Duckett, who runs the Southeast Wisconsin Professional
Baseball Park District, said he has no fear that a strike would
interrupt the payments. "That's like saying, 'What happens if the sun
doesn't come up tomorrow morning?' " he said.</TE>

<HD>Target Pulls Apparel on Neo-Nazi Allegation</HD>
<DH>Retail: Clothes bearing '88' and 'Eight Eight' are code for
'Heil Hitler,' complaints allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Target Corp. pulled clothing bearing "88" and "Eight Eight" from its
shelves this week after complaints that the words and numbers are
code for "Heil Hitler" among neo-Nazis.</LD>
<LD>   The Minneapolis-based discounter issued a statement apologizing
"for any discomfort" that may have been caused by the baseball caps
with the numerals "88" and shorts bearing images of skulls and the
words "Eight Eight."</LD>
<LD>   "Target is a family-oriented store and company, and it is not our
intent to carry any merchandise that promotes hate," the statement
said. "Target does not and will not tolerate discrimination in any
form."</LD>
<TE>   Groups upset about the clothing say they want to know how such
designs ended up on Target apparel bearing one of the retailer's
private labels, Utility.</TE>
<TE>   "It is well-known here at the center that '88' means 'Heil
Hitler,' " Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said Wednesday. "The company needs
to investigate the manufacturer, the one who sold them the product.
Did the manufacturer know this was a code for Heil Hitler? If they
did, Target should not do any business with them in the future."</TE>
<TE>   In the Chinese community, the number eight is a symbol of good
luck. But in the case of the Target shorts, the words "eight eight"
were paired with skulls. And Hier said that regardless of potential
other meanings, the fact that "88" is a symbol for Heil Hitler means
the merchandise should not be sold.</TE>
<TE>   Target officials did not return calls. One analyst who follows the
company said the design approval process is often slapdash and said
that it's highly unlikely Target officials had any clue to the Nazi
symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times it's a graphics designer sitting at a screen
coming up with an idea," said Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons. "There's not a lot of time for the approval process.
You're trying to come up with multiple designs hoping that some of
them hit with kids."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy came to light after Sacramento resident Joseph
Rodriguez saw the shorts with skeletons and "Eight Eight." Because H
is the eighth letter of the alphabet, 88 and Eight Eight have been
used as code by white supremacists for "Heil Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," said Rodriguez, a video producer and
director for UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, 51, said he first complained to Target's customer
service center in early June but "they basically blew me off."</TE>
<TE>   In late July, Rodriguez contacted the Southern Poverty Law Center,
which said it also attempted to contact Target and then posted
information about the clothing on its Web site, www .tolerance.org.</TE>
<TE>   "By the next morning, we had a response from them that they were
going to pull all this merchandise from all 1,100 stores," spokesman
Mark Potok said.</TE>
<TE>   Having clothing with such symbols appearing on them sold by a mass
merchandise chain such as Target demonstrates how a "very small and
extremely violent subculture make their way into the mainstream,"
Potok said.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-eight is possibly the best known neo-Nazi shorthand in the
world today," he said. "When something like the 88 symbol makes its
way into mainstream youth culture, it's very likely the ideas
attached to that symbol will follow shortly."</TE>
<TE>   A designer with one Los Angeles T-shirt manufacturer asserted that
workers in the garment industry are too busy with deadlines to fuss
over hidden meanings in a design.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to hurry up and get it done," said the woman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I wouldn't put 666 [a Satanic
symbol] on a T-shirt, let's say that. And that's about as far as it
goes."</TE>
<TE>   In the young men's and juniors markets, companies are constantly
trying to come up with bold graphics that will appeal to youth,
Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the graphic or design "doesn't make any sense at all,"
he said, but somehow strikes a chord with young buyers.</TE>

<HD>Vitesse Chief Buys 200,000 Shares as Stock Plunges</HD>
<DH>Semiconductor: The company is trading below its IPO
price--at unrealistic levels, the CEO says. He blames analysts' bleak
forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILES WEISS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis Tomasetta, chief executive of Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., is
buying stock in the Camarillo chip maker as the shares trade below
their initial public offering price of a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Tomasetta, a company co-founder, has purchased 200,000 company
shares since mid-August for as little as $1.18 each, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December
1991, Vitesse sold shares through an IPO at $1.50 each, adjusted for
stock splits.</LD>
<LD>   Because Vitesse specializes in developing integrated circuits for
the telecommunications business, its revenue has declined as
telephone companies curtailed capital spending amid a capacity glut.
Bleak forecasts have pushed Vitesse shares below realistic levels,
Tomasetta said.</LD>
<TE>   "If you listen to some of the analysts, the assumption is that we
are running out of cash and are going to go out of business,"
Tomasetta said. "Today we are selling at barely one times revenue,
which is extremely low for a technology company, especially one that
has markets with long-term potential growth."</TE>
<TE>   Selling at one times revenue means the market value investors have
placed on Vitesse is about equal to the revenue it generates in one
year. When the telecommunications industry was booming in early 2000
and Vitesse shares reached $115 each, the company's market
capitalization of $18 billion was about 27 times its peak annualized
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Tomasetta said his purchases were his first on the open market in
five or six years.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Tomasetta generated about $13.8 million in profit by
selling Vitesse common shares, according to an SEC filing. He
exercised options to purchase 200,000 common shares at $5.63 each and
then sold the stock on the open market in January 2001 for $74.36 to
$75.75 a share.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the IPO in 1991, Vitesse generated quarterly
revenue of about $10 million, Tomasetta said. Vitesse now is
realizing about $40 million in revenue each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Vitesse's financial condition has become more
precarious because it has about $452 million of bonds outstanding,
compared with about $472 million of cash and short-term securities
that the company held as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Vitesse has "a weaker balance sheet relative to comparable
companies," said Paul Brandeis, an analyst at Needham &amp; Co. "The end
markets they are serving continue to be very weak without much
near-term visibility for a return to growth."</TE>
<TE>   Vitesse Semiconductor has been buying back its convertible debt on
the open market, paying about 70 cents for each dollar of face value.
This lowers the amount of debt that the company will have to repay
when the bonds come due in March 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "We have cut our costs to the stage that if we continue to buy
back bonds at a discount we will have plenty of cash to get through
the downturn," Tomasetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Vitesse shares fell 5 cents to $1.36 in Nasdaq trading Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Trading System Approved</HD>
<DH>Securities: Launch of next-generation SuperMontage is seen
as an attempt to win back market share from rival electronic
networks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nasdaq Stock Market won final approval from regulators to start
its new SuperMontage trading system within the next six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday unanimously
approved letting Nasdaq begin using SuperMontage on either Sept. 6 or
Oct. 11. The start date will depend on whether any electronic-trading
networks, known as ECNs, sign up in the next nine days for an
alternative computer display system to post prices at which their
customers are willing to buy and sell stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq built SuperMontage to win back business from ECNs, which
have siphoned off trades from the second-biggest U.S. stock market,
luring away almost half of the daily trading in Nasdaq shares by
offering anonymous transactions and lower costs. SuperMontage will
offer similar features and wants to include quotes of any ECN willing
to participate.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect to see an increase in Nasdaq's role in trading of
Nasdaq stocks because of SuperMontage," said Dean Furbush, who
oversees Nasdaq's trading systems.</TE>
<TE>   SuperMontage was deemed ready for real trading by Nasdaq's staff
in late July. As part of a compromise, the SEC voted on July 26 to
establish an alternative display facility, or ADF, a computer system
that ECNs could use as an alternative to SuperMontage.</TE>
<TE>   To date, only one electronic-trading network, Bloomberg Tradebook,
has said it will register to use the alternative display facility.
The networks may have been reluctant to commit in part because
registration required that ECNs commit to using the facility.
Misrepresenting their intention carried criminal penalties, a
stipulation the SEC removed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If no other trading systems sign up for the facility within five
business days of when the new usage certification will be available,
SuperMontage can begin. That would put the start-up date as early as
Sept. 6. In that case, Nasdaq's Furbush said, SuperMontage would
begin on Sept. 17, so as not to start the week of the anniversary of
the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   If an ECN does sign the certification saying it intends to use the
facility, SuperMontage can start on Oct. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The alternate facility is an electronic bulletin board where ECNs
and Nasdaq dealers can post prices at which their customers are
willing to buy and sell stock. For the first three months, posting
prices in the system will be free. Unlike SuperMontage, the facility
does not allow customers to execute trades automatically.</TE>
<TE>   Advisor Optimism Jumps, Poll Says</TE>
<TE>   Optimism about U.S. stocks surged last week among the ranks of
financial newsletters, with bulls outnumbering bears, according to a
weekly poll by Investors Intelligence newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of newsletters considering themselves bullish, or
optimistic, rose to 45.7 from 36.7 the week before. The percentage
considering themselves bearish, or pessimistic, slid to 31.5 from 40.</TE>
<TE>   For four of the last seven weeks, bears outnumbered bulls among
newsletters--an exception to the trend in which optimists have
dominated since October 1998. In the three weeks after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, bears also dominated.</TE>
<TE>   Technical analysts, who try to predict stock moves based on price
patterns and other statistical measures, see peaks in investor
pessimism, and lows in optimism, as so-called contrarian indicators
that stocks may be poised to gain.</TE>
<TE>   When the majority of investors are bearish, the reasoning goes,
they may have already sold out of the market, clearing the way for
buyers to move in and ignite a rebound. By contrast, a surge in
bullishness can be a sign stocks are due to fall because investors
who view the market favorably already may have bought stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Last week marked the first time the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index
notched five consecutive weekly gains since the period from Aug. 4,
2000, through Sept. 1, 2000. The S&amp;P hasn't had a longer streak since
an eight-week period that ended March 20, 1998. But stocks have
wavered since. Since last Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has slipped
4.7%.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Released by Colts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defensive tackle Ellis Johnson was released by the Indianapolis Colts
on Wednesday, a surprising move that team officials said Johnson
requested.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson was the Colts' first-round pick in 1995 and started all
but four games for the team since 1997. He started all three of
Indianapolis' exhibition games.</LD>
<LD>   Team President Bill Polian said Johnson did not believe he fit
well into Coach Tony Dungy's defensive scheme and that he preferred
playing full-time rather than being part of a rotation.</LD>
<TE>   Polian said Johnson first asked to be released or traded last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "He was dissatisfied with the way he had been playing, and he
didn't feel he was making much progress in the new system," Polian
said. "Our advice to him was to give it another week because
sometimes a light goes on."</TE>
<TE>   Polian said he, Johnson and Dungy met early this week and a second
time with Dungy before the team granted Johnson his release.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing a good job for us and playing well," Dungy said.
"But I think he wanted to play full-time, and we felt we owed it to
him to give him that opportunity a few days before the rosters have
to be down to 53."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had said at the end of last year that he wanted to return
to Indianapolis, where he lives. He even restructured his contract to
save the Colts $2 million on this year's salary cap so he could stay
with the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Ryan Sims, the sixth player selected in the NFL
draft, agreed to a seven-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   The 315-pound Sims, who is from North Carolina, likely will not be
ready for the season opener Sept. 8 against the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms were not announced, but a team source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the deal included a signing bonus of
around $10 million, partly deferred to next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New England Patriots have extended the contract of quarterback
Tom Brady, who led the team to a Super Bowl victory last season.
Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. Brady's original
contract was to expire after this season. The Patriots announced the
signing but didn't release details.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Glenn, who sat out the first three exhibition games because
of a knee injury, will make his debut with the Green Bay Packers in
the exhibition finale Friday night at Lambeau Field against
Tennessee.... The New York Jets claimed quarterback Todd Husak off
waivers from Denver. He was on the Jets' practice squad for much of
last season. Also, New York waived tight end Daniel Wilcox.</TE>

<LD>If baseball players strike Friday, it could mean Ernie Harwell called
his last game Wednesday night after 42 years behind the microphone
for the Detroit Tigers.</LD>
<LD>   The Tigers are off today.</LD>
<LD>   Harwell, retiring after the season at 84, had no way of knowing
Wednesday if there will be a strike, or how many games one might
cost, so he decided simply to go about his business.</LD>
<TE>   What a business it has been.</TE>
<TE>   One of Harwell's trademarks is identifying the supposed hometowns
of fans who catch foul balls--a custom that started by accident, but
caught on quickly, he told the Detroit Free Press.</TE>
<TE>   "A batter hit a foul ball into the stands. On the spur of the
moment I said, 'That foul was caught by a man from Saginaw [or some
other place].' A few days later I did it again.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while people would stop me when I walked through Tiger
Stadium. 'Hey, let a guy from Windsor catch one tonight.' ... Or some
lady would say, 'I'm from Battle Creek. Can't somebody from our town
catch a foul ball?' "</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, some folks never quite got the joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Some fans have speculated that I have seating charts to find out
about hometowns," Harwell said. "Others suggested I check with
turnstile men for information. Now that the computer age has arrived,
some suggest I use my PC for the desired town locations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Houston and Los Angeles are the only teams to win the
WNBA title. What teams other than the Comets and Sparks have appeared
in the finals?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olympic flameout: News that Washington didn't make the cut when
New York and San Francisco were chosen as the final U.S. contenders
for the 2012 Summer Olympics hit Washington Post columnist Tony
Kornheiser hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we could try again--in 2036!" Kornheiser wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "My fantasy is to win an Olympic medal at 90, but then fail a drug
test because I took ginkgo biloba to remember what event I was in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area bid: Art Spander of the Oakland Tribune doesn't know
whether it would be good news or bad news if the Olympics came to San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] all those empty dot-com offices can be turned into housing
for Olympic athletes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NHL woes: Jason Kay, managing editor of the Hockey News, isn't
buying NHL executives' claim that ESPN's drastic cutback in its NHL
telecast schedule this season will create higher demand for hockey in
the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "Less may be more in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, but
a 30% decrease in nationally televised NHL games is yet another
rejection of a league gasping for attention," Kay wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time hockey was in danger of being overexposed in the
U.S. is when Michael Ontkean's character in 'Slap Shot' performed a
strip tease."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: New York, Phoenix and Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Golf writer Eddie Sefko of the Houston Chronicle
enjoys seeing people of Fijian and Polynesian descent following Vijay
Singh, those of Mexican heritage in the galleries around Esteban
Toledo, and the many Asians behind K.J. Choi and Shigeki Maruyama.</TE>
<TE>   "It's human nature to want to follow somebody who has a similar
background or heritage as you. Which leads to the obvious question:
Why aren't there more Martians following Jesper Parnevik?"</TE>

<HD>Seminoles' Booker Plans to Redshirt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Ventura St. Bonaventure High running back Lorenzo Booker,
arguably the nation's most-coveted recruit last year, will be
redshirted by Florida State, Coach Bobby Bowden said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to him today and he's smart enough, feels like it's
best," Bowden said.</LD>
<LD>   Booker is listed behind Greg Jones, Nick Maddox and Willie Reid on
the Seminoles' depth chart. If any of those players gets injured for
an extended period, Bowden said he would change his mind.</LD>
<TE>   "If they go down, I'm going to have to get out of my redshirt,"
Booker said. "Which, if it happens late in the season is really an
inconvenience to me, but we're all out here for the same goal so I've
got to take that into consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Booker holds California records for yards rushing (8,502) and
touchdowns (137) in a career.</TE>

<TE>   ESPN has stopped a commercial that angered some Tennessee fans.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial showed Lee Corso, one of the "College GameDay"
analysts, waiting for an elevator. The doors open and the elevator is
filled with orange-clad Volunteer fans. A pig runs out and an
overweight woman holding another pig and wearing a shower cap and
robe yells, "Come here, Rocky Top!"</TE>
<TE>   An elderly man wearing shorts and hooked up to an IV bottle is
shown with a couple kissing in the back of the elevator. A sign
mentioning Tennessee alumni is also visible.</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee football office said it was swamped with calls from
fans upset about the commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between ESPN and the school have been strained since
1997 when fans accused ESPN of campaigning for Michigan's Charles
Woodson over Tennessee's Peyton Manning in the voting for the 1997
Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   The Nashville Tennessean reported that the outrage turned nasty at
times and that Chris Fowler, the host of GameDay, described the
reaction of Volunteer fans on a national radio show as "trailer park
frenzy." He later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, an ESPN.com report alleged academic improprieties within
the football program.</TE>
<TE>   The GameDay crew is scheduled to air its show from the Knoxville
campus on Sept. 21, when the Volunteers play Florida, and Nov. 9,
when Tennessee plays host to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Blue-Gray Classic, a college all-star game since 1939, won't
be played this year because organizers could not line up a corporate
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick," Charles Jones, the game's executive director, told the
Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he couldn't meet a deadline imposed by ABC, which
televises the Christmas Day game, to find a sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime sponsor Kelly Tires was absorbed by parent company
Goodyear Tires and did not renew its sponsorship after the 2000 game,</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Jones made up some of the difference by lining up 10
secondary sponsors. But he said the terrorist attacks caused several
potential title sponsors to back off from the annual expense.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is hopeful of resurrecting the event after a one-year
hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A decision by Washington State officials to play Saturday's season
opener against Nevada in Seahawks Stadium in Seattle apparently has
paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Although the venue is 300 miles west of Pullman, Wash., site of
the campus, the Seattle Times reports that 61,800 tickets had been
sold in the 67,000-seat stadium and there is a good chance the game
will be sold out.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest crowd to watch a Cougar "home" game came in 1997 when
40,306 saw Washington State defeat Stanford in Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Jim Sterk pushed for the game in the new home of
the NFL's Seahawks to help bring exposure to the program and to keep
in touch with alumni in Western Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although Coach Mike Price was initially opposed to the idea, he
appears to have softened his stance after learning that many of the
state's top prep prospects are expected to be in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Jose State's Neil Parry, who had part of his right leg
amputated two years ago, may not be able to resume his playing career
because of insurance concerns, the San Jose Mercury News reports.
Parry suffered compound fractures to his tibia and fibula in a game
against Texas El Paso on Oct. 14, 2000, and was told that his
lifetime coverage for his prosthesis would be canceled if he were to
play. Parry is expected to need a new $15,000 leg every two years for
at least the next decade.... Starting this season, bowl games will
count toward players' statistics in the national record books,
according to the NCAA. The governing body started keeping statistics
in 1937 when there were few bowl games.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum" pictorial history</LD>
<LD>   Author: Chris Epting</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Arcadia Publishing</TE>
<TE>   Price: $19.99</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum has a rich history, and much of it is captured in
this 128-page paperback book that contains more than 200
black-and-white photos.</TE>
<TE>   But much is left out. The chapter on football is only 12 pages.
USC football, in particular, gets short shrift. And the selection of
pictures seems odd.</TE>
<TE>   There is a picture of Bert Jones, who played for the Rams one
season (1982), lining up at quarterback. But he is in a Baltimore
Colt uniform.</TE>
<TE>   There is a photo of Joe Namath in a Ram uniform, but the Coliseum
was his home field for only one season (1977).</TE>
<TE>   The best part of the book deals with the building of the Coliseum.
Construction began Dec. 21, 1921, and the work was completed on time
and within the $800,000 budget on May 1, 1923. The first football
game was played there between USC and Pomona College on Oct. 23,
1923, before 12,836.</TE>
<TE>   The book also includes a chapter on the history of the Sports
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second book Chris Epting, an advertising executive
from Huntington Beach, has done for Arcadia Publishing. His first was
on the history of Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia Publishing has nothing to do with the city of Arcadia.
Started as a one-room operation in Dover, N.H., in 1993, it has
published more than 1,700 regional history books. The company has its
headquarters in Charleston, S.C.</TE>

<LD>Truly A Judge, who has made a nice living in California, has a chance
for his biggest win Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old gelding, owned by a partnership and trained by Dave
Bernstein, Truly A Judge is the 2-1 favorite in the $150,000 Jewel,
the longest at 1 1/8 miles and richest of the half dozen events in
the fourth annual Claiming Crown.</LD>
<LD>   Run for its initial three years at Canterbury Downs in Minnesota,
the Claiming Crown, a series of fairly lucrative races for horses who
have run in claimers at one time or another in the past year, is
being held this time at Philadelphia Park.</LD>
<TE>   Jose Valdivia Jr. will be in Pennsylvania to ride Truly A Judge,
who was a close second to Pie N Burger in an optional claimer at Del
Mar on Aug. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Atlantic Ocean, a pricey ($1.9 million) purchase
at Barretts earlier this year who has been a bust in her first two
starts for trainer Bob Baffert, will try to turn things around as she
stretches to a mile in today's sixth at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: David Flores. The jockey is the only rider in the top
10 at Del Mar to be winning at a 20% clip heading into the final two
weeks of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Duan Salvino. The jockey lost with 70 of his first 73
mounts at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exacta boxes in the fifth keying Order Del
Dia with Groovewiththebean, A Major Pleasure, Semper Tap and Great
Alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/63. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.40/$375.40. Total money bet: $528.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since being claimed for $2,500 almost five months ago by
owner-trainer Zvi Kriple, Bobbin Lee has been almost perfect.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-year-old Ole mare has won twice and was beaten by a nose in
her only loss on May 12.</LD>
<LD>   A California-bred, Bobbin Lee will try for her 13th lifetime
victory in the sixth, a 4 1/2-furlong contest for thoroughbreds that
drew seven other fillies and mares. The race is also the fourth leg

<HD>Feelings Mixed on Manning Case</HD>
<DH>Football: Toledo, Guerrero support senior cornerback after
arrest, but one starter says, 'We don't need this.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildly conflicting accounts of the late-night fight that resulted in
the arrest of UCLA senior cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. on two counts
of felony assault emerged Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides agree on a handful of facts, but deny starting the
April 24 brawl in the parking lot outside Madison's Neighborhood
Grill in Westwood. The fight resulted in Brian Herbert, 34, suffering
a facial injury from a Manning blow and Seth Spiker, 26, suffering a
concussion, two black eyes and broken teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Manning, a two-time All-Pacific 10 Conference pick and Minnesota
Twin minor leaguer, faces charges that could result in 11 years in
prison. His arrest Tuesday night is the latest in a yearlong string
of serious off-the-field incidents involving Bruin football players.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, tailback DeShaun Foster was suspended for the last four
games for an NCAA extra-benefits violation and quarterback Cory Paus
failed to inform Coach Bob Toledo of two DUI convictions. The
episodes contributed to four losses in the last five games after the
Bruins had opened with six victories.</TE>
<TE>   Although Manning practiced Wednesday morning, 12 hours after being
released on bail from the LAPD Pacific Division, and participated in
the team's afternoon scrimmage at the Rose Bowl, some teammates
expressed dismay at his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Ricky is the leader of this team and we don't need this right
now," said one starter. "I feel really bad for him, but we all talk
all the time about avoiding those kind of situations. Ricky knew
better."</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when Tremaine Mitchell, a friend of Manning and
the brother of Philadelphia Eagle and former UCLA receiver Freddie
Mitchell, exchanged words in the bar with Spiker, who like Herbert is
a bodybuilder employed as a security guard at the Hollywood Athletic
Club.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has a vastly different version of events that came next.</TE>
<TE>   Manning says Herbert and Spiker left the bar first and started the
fight when Manning and Mitchell exited at 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I was aggressed against and I defended myself," Manning said.</TE>
<TE>   Manning's attorney, Daniel Davis, characterized the actions of
Herbert and Spiker as hypocritical, saying they initiated the fight
then sought charges upon realizing that Manning is projected as an
NFL player who might some day sign a lucrative contract. Davis
pointed out that neither victim sought medical attention until late
the next afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert and Spiker, neither of whom has a criminal record, bristle
at the suggestion that they are attempting to cash in on a fight they
started--and lost.</TE>
<TE>   "Manning and his friends left the bar first, not us," Herbert
said. "The next thing I know Seth is on the ground and 10 people are
kicking his head in. Then Ricky Manning sucker-punched me in the
face. I was kicked and stomped on until my head looked like a
pumpkin."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert said he went to work the next day and co-workers told the
victims to go to the hospital. Personnel at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center contacted police.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know who Ricky Manning was until I talked to a UCLA
student the next day," Spiker said. "I don't know how he can say it
was self-defense when neither Bryan nor I threw a punch. I don't know
if Manning hit me or not because I was on the ground and so many guys
were kicking and punching me."</TE>
<TE>   Spiker, a Texas native who aspires to become an actor or a model,
estimated his medical bills at $20,000. Herbert, who moved to Los
Angeles from England 13 years ago and speaks in a thick accent, said
he is not sure how much he owes doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know I have no way of paying them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, who already had an outstanding warrant for a November
2001 fight, was arrested first and charged with felony assault. A
warrant for Manning's arrest was issued June 25, about the time he
left to play for the Twins' minor league affiliate in Davenport,
Iowa. Police notified UCLA officials Tuesday of the warrant, and
Manning, who said he did not know a warrant had been issued, turned
himself in at the campus police office.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear why he was not arrested until Tuesday, but he was in
Ventura County during training camp at Cal Lutheran and did not
return to Westwood until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I also want to thank the LAPD for handling this professionally,"
Manning said. "I was treated with care."</TE>
<TE>   Manning said he is considering filing suit against Herbert, who at
6 feet 3, 230 pounds is larger than the 5-foot-9, 180-pound
cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said that to his knowledge no other football player was
involved in the fight. And he is steadfast in his support of Manning,
who came to him and confessed his involvement the day after the
fight. Toledo punished the player at the time, although he would not
divulge the nature of the punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "He was trying to protect himself, that's what he told me and
that's what I believe happened," he said. "I'm trying to give him the
benefit of the doubt until the legal process takes its course."</TE>
<TE>   Manning would be dismissed from the team if convicted of a felony,
but Davis said the case probably wouldn't be resolved until after the
season. An arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 17, at which time a
preliminary hearing will be set. A trial, should the case reach that
point, would be several months away.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the problems of Foster and Paus, three players
besides Manning have been involved in fights. Junior defensive
lineman Asi Faoa was convicted of misdemeanor assault, senior
linebacker Audie Attar was dismissed from the team and freshman
defensive lineman C.J. Niusulu has been charged with felony battery
in his hometown of Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Dan Guerrero learned of the fight Tuesday when
the LAPD called to inform the school about the warrant for Manning's
arrest. He is backing his player and coach. Manning took the athletic
director aside at the scrimmage and thanked him for his support.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob dealt with this when Ricky told him about it in the spring,"
Guerrero said. "Neither one of them knew there was any police
involvement. They thought it was over."</TE>

<LD>No. 3 for Spitz; El Monte Girl Upsets Gould</LD>
<LD>   Another individual event. Another gold medal. Another world
record. Mark Spitz, who had won the 200-meter butterfly the day
before and anchored a triumphant relay team, came back with a victory
in the 200 freestyle. That was expected. Unexpected was Australian
Shane Gould's third-place finish in the women's 100 freestyle. She
was beaten by two Southern California teen-agers, gold-medalist
Sandra Neilson, 16, of El Monte, and silver-medalist Shirley
Babashoff, 15, of Fountain Valley.</LD>

<TE>   Fans Stage Near Riot After Soviet Boxer Beats American</TE>
<TE>   A 3-2 decision for battered and bloodied Soviet light-middleweight
Valeri Tregubov over American Reggie Jones in the opening bout for
both would turn out to be the most controversial of the tournament,
the announcement greeted by the tossing of a banana, a can and other
debris into the ring and 15 minutes of booing and catcalls.</TE>
<TE>   "Never have I seen a rowdier or longer protest at an amateur
boxing event," Donald Sanders of the London Daily Telegraph said.
"But then the decision ranks high among the bad ones I've seen." The
International Amateur Boxing Assn., fired the referee and warned 16
judges that their scores would be closely scrutinized, but that
didn't help Jones, a Marine lance corporal.</TE>

<HD>Neilson, Babashoff Took Gould's Luster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Australia's Shane Gould was as close to Mark Spitz as women's
swimming had in 1972. Although she was only 15, she was predicted to
win five gold medals. But the U.S. women were not convinced. Before
the Olympics, they had T-shirts made for themselves that said, "All
That Glitters Is Not Gould."</LD>
<LD>   They were right. Gould won her first race, the 200-meter
individual medley, but, on the next day, she finished a stunned third
behind two Southern California teenagers, Sandra Neilson, 16, of El
Monte, and Shirley Babashoff, 15, of Fountain Valley. For Gould, who
would rebound to win two more gold medals and a bronze, it was her
first freestyle loss in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Sandra Neilson-Bell still shows the tape of her victory to
her swim students in Austin, Texas. The wide-eyed students never seem
to mind that the black and white footage is nearly 30 years old. They
slide to the edge of their seats and monitor the race as if it were
live, erupting into cheers as she propels herself to victory.</LD>
<TE>   "When the kids watch, they always say, 'Do you win, do you win?' "
Neilson-Bell said. "When they see that I do, they scream, 'All
right!' "</TE>
<TE>   And Neilson-Bell never grows tired of using that clip as a
motivational tool for her students, many of whom are just learning to
swim. She won two more gold medals in relay races.</TE>
<TE>   She tapped into those performances as inspiration for a 1984
comeback that ended a 12-year layoff at the national level and lasted
until 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Her second career broke many personal barriers--she became the
first woman over 30 and 35 to break one minute in the 100 freestyle
and narrowly missed making the '88 Olympic team--and also
demonstrated that women over 30 could still compete at the highest
level. Many have followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Her return to international competition was spurred by Keith Bell,
a highly successful swim coach and sports psychologist who later
became her husband. She felt she had nothing left to accomplish after
the '72 Olympics, but said Bell forced her to reset her goals and
challenged her to be better than before.</TE>
<TE>   Now a mother of four and grandmother of two, Neilson-Bell spends
much of her free time coaching swimmers of all age. She gets her
biggest reward teaching adults to swim.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I always wanted to do," said Neilson-Bell,
inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1986. "See
them take that big step and learn how to swim."</TE>
<TE>   The '72 Olympics marked the beginning of Babashoff's international
swimming career. She won a gold medal and two silvers in Munich
before resuming classes at Fountain Valley High. She returned to the
'76 Games in Montreal, taking home another gold and four silvers.</TE>
<TE>   Babashoff was narrowly defeated there in the 800-meter freestyle
by East German Petra Thumer--the second consecutive Olympics in which
she entered an individual event as the world record holder but failed
to win--and then publicly accused the East Germans of using steroids.
Those involved in the sport had suspected the East German swimmers
were using performance-enhancing drugs, but Babashoff was one of the
few who spoke out. As a result, a large segment of the press called
her "Surly Shirley." However, she was later vindicated by revelations
in Germany that thousands of athletes, including Olympic swimmers,
were given daily "steroid cocktails."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the eight medals Babashoff won at two Olympics and
two world championships, she won 27 national championships, set six
world records and was a member of five world record relay teams.
Today, she is a postal worker living in Fountain Valley with her
16-year-old son, Adam, said Babashoff's sister, Debbie.</TE>
<TE>   Although she could not be reached for an interview, she told the
Orange County Register in 1996 that she prefers leading an
inconspicuous life. "It gets real awkward," she said. "You just want
to be normal, and you can't. You just want to do what you love, and
you can't. Everyone knows you, and it sets you apart. It's very
isolating. To this day, they'll introduce me at work as 'Shirley, the
Olympic swimmer.' It's like all the things I've done the past 20
years don't count."</TE>

<HD>49ers Roll in Exhibition Finale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For the first time in a taxing exhibition season, almost everything
went right for the San Francisco 49ers.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Rattay completed 16 of 21 passes and led four scoring drives
in the first half as the 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers, 27-3,
on Wednesday night in the exhibition finale for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco (2-3), banged up and thin after a brutal exhibition
season that included a trip to Japan and three games in 10 days,
improbably posted an easy victory. The 49ers took a 21-point lead in
the first half under the direction of Rattay, whose inconsistency
finally ended when he played with the team's first-stringers.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of capitulating to San Diego, as Coach Steve Mariucci all
but suggested his team might do, the 49er backups and fringe players
jumped all over the Chargers (2-2) on both sides of the ball in their
best performance of the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably one of the only guys that was happy we had five
preseason games," said Rattay, who passed for 158 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Bowl tandem Jeff Garcia and Terrell Owens didn't play for the
49ers, but Rattay finally might have solidified his job. Rattay led a
69-yard scoring drive on the 49ers' second possession, scoring on a
two-yard run after dropping the snap from Jeremy Newberry.</TE>
<TE>   Running back LaDainian Tomlinson returned for the Chargers after
missing the first three exhibition games because of an ankle injury
and gained 19 yards in four carries.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's offense struggled under quarterbacks Drew Brees and
Doug Flutie, who combined for 55 yards passing.</TE>

<HD>Three Sports in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Olympics: IOC task force recommends dropping baseball,
softball and modern pentathlon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT and ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An International Olympic Committee task force, mindful of President
Jacques Rogge's mandate to streamline the massive Summer Games,
recommended dropping baseball, softball and modern pentathlon from
the Olympics. Golf and seven-man rugby are their potential
replacements.</LD>
<LD>   Greco-Roman wrestling, equestrian's three-day event and walk
events in track and field were targeted for possible elimination in a
report presented by the program committee to the IOC executive board
Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland. To make changes, the executive
board would have to accept the recommendations and send them to an
IOC assembly, where a two-thirds vote is required for ratification.
The next IOC assembly is scheduled for Mexico City in November.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the changes would go into effect at the 2008 Beijing
Games.</LD>
<TE>   The board rejected adding several winter sports but reiterated
Rogge's insistence that figure skating stay in the Games, despite the
judging scandal that occurred at Salt Lake City in February. The IOC
executive board heard a report from the French Olympic Committee on
the still-simmering matter, in which alleged mobster Alimzhan
Tokhtakhunov was charged with conspiring to fix the pairs and ice
dance events so ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of
France would win. The French report exonerated the skaters. Rogge is
expected to discuss figure skating during a news conference today
that will close the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   In a widely anticipated move, the executive board narrowed the
field of candidates to host the 2010 Winter Games to Vancouver,
Canada; Salzburg, Austria; Pyeongchang, Korea, and Bern, Switzerland.
A final decision will be made next July. Vancouver and Salzburg are
considered frontrunners.</TE>
<TE>   That choice could affect bids by San Francisco and New York to
host the 2012 Summer Games. If Vancouver gets the 2010 Games, the IOC
is unlikely to return to the West Coast of North America in 2012. The
chances it will select any U.S. city are slim because the Games have
been staged in the U.S. and Canada six times in 26 years starting in
1976 at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda, manager of the gold
medal-winning U.S. baseball team at the Sydney Games, said he was
disappointed and shocked to hear baseball and softball are in Olympic
jeopardy. Women's softball was added in 1996, and the U.S. won gold
medals at Atlanta and Sydney. Men's baseball became a medal event in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wrong for them to do that," he said, "because
softball and baseball, you saw the crowds at the Olympics and the
excitement at the Games. I don't understand what the problem is."</TE>
<TE>   USA Softball spokesman Brian McCall said his organization hopes
the full IOC will reject the committee's recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our association spent 25 years getting our sport into the
Olympics, and it's something worth fighting for," he said. "And we
will do that in the next few months before they vote."</TE>
<TE>   IOC Director General Francois Carrard indicated the move might not
have unanimous support, saying, "It's not as much rubber stamp as you
think."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he wouldn't be surprised if supporters of dropped
sports fight that decision in court.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's world, anybody can take any legal action against
anybody for any purpose," he said. "The only question is, where does
it lead and who wins? Let's just say I'm confident we would not
lose."</TE>
<TE>   A media executive who requested anonymity doubts Olympic golf
would succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf's value as an Olympic TV sport is highly questionable,
particularly without any guarantees that Tiger Woods would
participate in an event that falls directly between the British Open
and the PGA Championship," he said.</TE>

<LD>I have to admit, I'm surprised. Some women e-mailed to say I don't
give females the attention they deserve, although I spent as much
time as I could looking around in the Sparks' locker room Saturday
before they asked me to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, I don't know how much more attention I can give to Anna
Kournikova and Lisa Guerrero. I know Guerrero is not an athlete, but
she talks about athletes and so I think she deserves my undivided
attention, which causes a real problem when the wife is home and she
wants to talk about what's going on in her life.</LD>
<LD>   You can mute Guerrero, of course, but I've learned it's not a good
idea to tell the wife she's blocking the view of our big-screen TV.
That's probably the reason why I haven't been able to give women
their due--because my wife is standing in front of the TV.</LD>
<TE>   And as much as the wife likes to talk, now I'm concerned I might
never see Kournikova win a tennis tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I thought I was being nice the other day when I acted as if I
was interested in the Sparks. Some women are upset, though, and let
me tell you, if you have women constantly telling you to get lost,
you can begin to develop a complex. I was in high school, and so I
know what that's like. College, too.</TE>
<TE>   I know I wasn't invited to the Sparks' singles mixer because I'm
married, but I wonder now if that would have made a difference. I'm
not sure there's any way to please some of these people, which makes
me wonder if they'll appreciate my desire to tell this story about a
wonderful female athlete who regularly beats the guys in head-to-head
competition like no other female in any sport.</TE>
<TE>   I mean she really kicks mule. Now I know what word comes to your
mind so easily, but I'm a stickler for accuracy, and while everyone
knows a donkey is an ass, Black Ruby, the greatest female of them
all, is really a mule, and she really kicks mule.</TE>
<TE>   Now you can imagine the reaction of the watch dogs from the "Women
Watching Sports News" organization if they start reading this story
in the wrong place, and I'm talking about the greatest female athlete
I know, and referring to her as half ass.</TE>
<TE>   Black Ruby is, of course, because to get a mule you have to mate a
donkey with a horse. Female mules are known as Mollies. Male mules,
by the way, are called Johns, and I've already pressed my luck with
the Women Watching Sports News, so I think I'll just continue without
further wisecrack.</TE>
<TE>   Black Ruby has run 54 times in her career and has won 47 races
against mostly male opponents. She has never finished worse than
third, and on Sept. 8 at Del Mar she will run a match race against
Taz, the best male in the mule business.</TE>
<TE>   "As Taz has gotten older he's become more impressive," trainer Ed
Burdick said. "He's changed physically and gotten better looking with
age."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously some of us have some things in common with male mules,
but because of my sensitivity training I didn't ask Burdick how the
female mule has aged over the years, but apparently he has read some
of my stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "You probably want to know that's she's very striking to look at,"
said Burdick, "but believe me, she's no 10."</TE>
<TE>   It really doesn't matter what she looks like, of course, because
if we were interested only in the good-looking competitors we'd be
writing just about Kournikova, or what the Williams' sisters are
wearing, or that volleyball babe.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Ruby knows she's special; we treat her special," said Mary
McPherson, the mule's owner. "She gets a bigger pen at home."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously some of us have some things in common with female mules;
my wife gets the bigger closet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PERFORMANCE IS all that should matter in women's sports, and Black
Ruby has consistently beaten Taz--until last weekend when they
strapped eight extra pounds to her back, allowing Taz to nip her at
the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had to hook males all her life," said jockey Jim Burns, who
has ridden Black Ruby 46 times--winning 42 of those races. "I can't
think of any other female that hooks males all the time, and wins."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone out there knows of a female who hooks males all the
time, and wins, I would appreciate knowing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOME TRACKS allow only win bets when Black Ruby is competing,
because they were taking a loss with the public putting down as much
as $500,000 on her to finish no lower than third.</TE>
<TE>   "She's known all over the world," McPherson said. "She probably
takes after the thoroughbred in her mother, My Satinette, rather than
in her donkey father, Two Bals, because she runs more like a horse
with big strides. In her case all the genes are lined up in the right
place."</TE>
<TE>   Black Ruby's mom and dad are no longer with us, but in their
10-year-old daughter racing fans have the closest thing ever to a
sure bet, which leads me to believe that Curtis Crayon is out there
somewhere betting on someone to beat Black Ruby.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question Black Ruby is very special and nobody really
knows why. Why is Tiger as good as he is?" Burdick said. "In this
sport, folks lean toward acquiring female mules because for some
reason they just seem to be more dominant day in and day out than the
males. Sometimes, however, the ladies are a little tougher to
handle...."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going there because I'm a changed man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ray Butler:</TE>

<TE>   Then you know how I'm going to feel when he says: "Till death do
us part."</TE>

<HD>Scottish Champion Celtic Suffers Stunning Failure</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five-time winner AC Milan on Wednesday qualified for the 32-team
European Champions League, as did another former winner, Barcelona of
Spain, but Scottish champion Glasgow Celtic crashed out at the final
hurdle.</LD>
<LD>   Milan made it through to the lucrative tournament despite losing,
2-1, to Slovan Liberec in the Czech Republic. The Italian team had
won the first match of the two-game series, 1-0, in Milan, and when
the aggregate score ended up tied, 2-2, striker Filippo Inzaghi's
vital away goal Wednesday was the crucial difference.</LD>
<LD>   Away goals count double when the aggregate score is tied over two
games.</LD>
<TE>   Barcelona had no such difficulties. It shut out Legia Warsaw of
Poland, 1-0, in Warsaw to advance, 4-0 on aggregate, after winning
the first game in Barcelona, 3-0, two weeks ago. Gaizka Mendieta
scored Wednesday's goal on a 68th-minute penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   For Celtic, which in 1967 became the first British club to win the
European Cup, Wednesday's ouster at the feet of FC Basel of
Switzerland was totally unexpected. The Scottish club had won the
first game, 3-1, in Glasgow, and qualification was expected to be a
formality.</TE>
<TE>   But Basel, playing at home, got first-half goals from Christian
Gimenez and Murat Yakin to win, 2-0. That tied the aggregate score,
3-3, and FC Basel advanced on the away goals rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the advantage going into the game and we wanted to
preserve that in the first 25 minutes," said Celtic Coach Martin
O'Neill. "In that period, we conceded two goals and we had to abandon
the plan. We had to score, but it was not to be."</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Rebuffed</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer and the Galaxy have been rebuffed in their
initial efforts to sign South Korea's World Cup captain, Hong
Myung-Bo.</TE>
<TE>   Hong plays in the K-League for the Pohang Steelers, whose coach,
Choi Soon-Ho, said Wednesday that the offer made by MLS for the
33-year-old defender was "unreasonable and nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Choi told Reuters that a transfer fee of $200,000 had been
offered.</TE>
<TE>   USA Women on TV</TE>
<TE>   Today's semifinal match between the United States and Germany in
the first FIFA Under-19 World Championship will be broadcast live
from Edmonton, Canada, on Fox Sports World at 4:15 p.m. Pacific time,
U.S. Soccer announced.</TE>
<TE>   Host Canada plays Brazil in the other semifinal, with the winners
meeting Sunday for the inaugural title in a 1 p.m. (Pacific)
championship match that the network also will carry.</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk Moves On</TE>
<TE>   U.S. World Cup defender Frankie Hejduk has signed a one-year
contract with St Gallen of the Swiss first division after being
released by Bayer Leverkusen of the German Bundesliga.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old former UCLA player from San Diego spent four
seasons with Leverkusen.</TE>
<TE>   Magee Nets Four</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. under-20 national team overpowered Ukraine, 5-2, with
forward Mike Magee of the Chicago Sockers scoring four goals, to
advance to the semifinals of the XIX Torneo Internacional de Futbol
de l'Alcudia in Valencia, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were set to meet Uruguay in one semifinal, and
Brazil will play Costa Rica in the other.</TE>
<TE>   Roa Sinks Lower</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Roa, Argentina's starting goalkeeper at the 1998 World Cup
in France, Wednesday signed a one-year contract with Albacete of the
Spanish second division. Roa, 33, was a free agent after completing
his contract with Real Mallorca and had been rumored to be on his way
to Arsenal of the English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Player Drops Shorts</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Rodolfo Garcia, an Argentine playing for Espoli in
Ecuador's first division, has been banned for six months for indecent
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "He dropped his shorts right in front of the referee [during a
league match against Liga de Quito]," said an Ecuador soccer
federation spokesman. "He has been suspended for behavior that
damages the prestige of the national sport."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia apparently was angry at being ordered by the referee to
keep his shirt tucked in.</TE>
<TE>   Astudillo Elected</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Astudillo, a 47-year-old lawyer and former president of
Deportivo Cali of the Colombian league, was elected president of the
Colombian soccer federation Tuesday night. Astudillo said his
immediate priority would be to find a coach for the national team,
which has been without one since Francisco "Paco" Maturana resigned
after failing to qualify Colombia for this year's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian Problems</TE>
<TE>   The Bolivian league has imposed a maximum salary of $1,500 a month
for players and coaches and has banned them from receiving additional
bonuses. It has also banned referees from traveling outside their
home cities.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman Leads Revolution</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Twellman scored twice in the first half to grab a share of
the MLS goal lead as the New England Revolution beat the Colorado
Rapids, 3-1, at Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman is tied with the Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz with 17 goals.</TE>
<TE>   New England improved to 9-14-1 and Colorado fell to 11-11-3.</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos Honored</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, a favorite son in his
native El Salvador, will have a sports complex in his home country
named after him in La Union.</TE>
<TE>   The complex, which will include a regulation soccer field, locker
rooms, track and field, lights and sprinkler system, will cost
$50,000. Fans can make a tax-deductible donation of $50 to the
project and, in return, receive two tickets for the Galaxy's Sept. 14
match against San Jose, a T-shirt with a photo of Cienfuegos, a $5
certificate for Liborios Market and have their name on a plaque at
the Mauricio Cienfuegos Sports Complex.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Gets Off to Fine Start</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: He avoids recent struggles to defeat Portas in
straight sets. Haas also advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Introducing Pete Sampras, a refuge in a world of (tennis) chaos. In
the context of what has happened--Lleyton Hewitt dropping verbal
bombs on the ATP Tour, various misdemeanors against fashion, nude
shots in the tabloids of Tommy Haas and the far right-wing leanings
of Jelena Dokic--the normality of Sampras was almost reassuring.</LD>
<LD>   The funny thing is this hasn't been an ordinary year for him,
featuring several coaching changes and the approaching arrival of his
first child. He has not won a title since Wimbledon 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "Tennis is still a big part of my life, but it's not what it used
to be," said Sampras, 31, who expects to play the Australian Open in
January, the first Grand Slam after the birth of his child. "I used
to live and die with my wins and losses. I still get disappointed and
frustrated, but when I hit 30, 31, there's more to life than tennis.
That being said, I'm still here."</LD>
<TE>   For him, the hope is the U.S. Open serves as the same jump-start
it did last year when he reached the final. His first step was
promising Wednesday. For the first time in months, the 17th-seeded
Sampras won in straight sets, defeating Albert Portas of Spain, 6-1,
6-4, 6-4, in the first round. "Today was a good start. You're always
a little bit nervous in your first-round match, trying to settle into
the tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Haas, seeded third, showed his usual survival skills,
winning despite severe cramps. He defeated David Sanchez of Spain,
7-6 (1), 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, in 3 hours 23 minutes. His warm-up was
disrupted when officials told him he could not wear a sleeveless
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   His coach, Red Ayme, was angered by the double standard, pointing
out that Serena Williams wore a black form-fitting cat suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inconceivable," he said. "I think those girls look good. But
you ask the females out there, and they might have liked his shirt.
Let the other guys have fun. Let them entertain."</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, unseeded Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand is having one of
the better summers, winning at Long Island and losing in the final at
Washington. He defeated USC's Prakash Amritraj, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0, in the
first round. The wild-card entrant, Amritraj, the USTA's 18-and-under
national champion, was following his famous father Vijay, who played
here from 1972-84.</TE>
<TE>   Rain disrupted night play, causing several delays. Impacted the
most was a second-round match between No. 4 Lindsay Davenport and
Petra Mandula of Hungary. Davenport was leading, 6-4, 2-2, when play
was suspended. Officials called the match at 11:30, and it will be
completed today, weather permitting, after Jennifer Capriati plays
Tina Pisnik of Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   The highest seeded woman to exit was No. 5 Dokic of Yugoslavia in
the second round. Promising teenager Elena Bovina of Russia defeated
her, 6-3, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic's departure came after a summer filled with injuries,
illness and controversy. The latest was her recent letter of support
for right-wing presidential candidate, ultra-nationalist Vojislav
Seselj in the upcoming Serbian election. "It's my private thing," she
said. "I have the right to do that. It's something I wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faced with mounting criticism from Hewitt, the world's No. 1
player, ATP chief executive officer Mark Miles met in separate
briefings with Australian and American reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt denounced the men's tour as a "circus" and accused certain
staff members of lying, and hinted at legal action. He was fined
about $100,000 for failing to do a pre-match interview with ESPN this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, the campaign being waged is working in regard to
reducing the fine. Miles said the appeals committee probably would
not meet until after the Open. "I believe they'll make a reasonable
decision, and I don't think $103,000 would be reasonable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of these infractions, the highest fine paid was $29,000 by Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, according to the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "The people around Lleyton had a clear understanding that our
staff were to decide what was expected," Miles said. "I think they
understood for days that it was expected he would do the ESPN
interview, so they had it for his first match."</TE>

<HD>Harrison Makes His Mark</HD>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bruins' final exam turned into a pop quiz, with the loudest hits
in Wednesday's scrimmage at the Rose Bowl coming from players
fighting to win a starting position.</LD>
<LD>   Redshirt freshman center Mike McCloskey, cornerback Joe Hunter and
fullback Manuel White appeared to be winners, although nothing is
certain until coaches watch film and construct a depth chart today.</LD>
<LD>   "We simulated a game situation as much as we could," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "We worked down-and-distance and field position, and we
transitioned from offense to defense to the kicking game."</LD>
<TE>   Jason Harrison, a redshirt freshman running back, was the most
impressive of the skill-position players, breaking off nifty runs and
making two difficult receptions.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, like White, can play tailback and fullback.</TE>
<TE>   "Harrison stood out, he's really versatile," Toledo said. "We like
the way he catches the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jarrad Page, a freshman safety, returned punts along with redshirt
freshman Tyler Ebell.</TE>
<TE>   Page was a center fielder at San Leandro High good enough to be a
fifth-round draft pick of the Milwaukee Brewers, and Toledo likes his
hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Page has a knack for catching the ball," he said. "I don't know
how many yards he'll gain after he catches it, but we need to have
different guys for different situations."</TE>
<TE>   Page has spent time working with the starting defense but probably
will be behind sophomores Ben Emanuel and Jabril Raymo at strong
safety. Kevin Brant is also a factor at the position, and Brant and
Emanuel can also back up Matt Ware at free safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if I don't start, I'll be in the rotation and I'll play on
special teams," Raymo said. "I think we are all looking at it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Sciarra, a redshirt freshman, made a strong push to become
the backup to senior Cory Paus at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Sciarra has thrown the ball well in recent practices, and in the
scrimmage he twice scrambled for yardage.</TE>
<TE>   However, Drew Olson, a freshman from Piedmont, is expected to get
the nod at No. 2 quarterback. Matt Moore, a freshman from Hart who
did not play because of a sprained left knee, probably will redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Paus opened the scrimmage with a long completion to receiver Tab
Perry and also threw crisp passes to tight end Mike Seidman and
receiver Ryan Smith.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two-a-days are over.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will practice once today and Friday then take Saturday
and Sunday off before beginning preparations for their Sept. 7 opener
against Colorado State.</TE>

<HD>Fargas Says He's Ready for Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justin Fargas wore full pads and absorbed hits for the first time in
11 days Wednesday, and the USC tailback said he remains determined to
play in Monday's opener against Auburn.</LD>
<LD>   Fargas, No. 1 on the depth chart at the start of training camp,
injured his right hamstring Aug. 17 during a drill before the
Trojans' first scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this week, Coach Pete Carroll said he would not play
Fargas against Auburn if the senior transfer was not at full
strength.</LD>
<TE>   Fargas ran without noticeable discomfort for about 90 minutes of
the two-hour practice.</TE>
<TE>   Team trainers then pulled him before a drill that pitted the
first-team offense against the first-team defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to go and do as much as I can without re-hurting
myself," Fargas said. "I'm doing more every day."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas will increase his workload at today's practice, a workout
Carroll said would be key in his decision whether to play him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first chance to really get a good look at him,"
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Dominique Byrd, moved from tight end to defensive end on
Aug. 18 because of a depth shortage, was switched back to tight end
with the return of junior college transfers Daniel Urquhart from a
neck injury and Van Brown from a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said last week that Byrd was second on the depth chart
behind left end Omar Nazel and would probably play against Auburn in
passing situations. But Byrd said Carroll called him Tuesday night to
ask him if he was amenable to returning to his original position.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Byrd will work as the third tight end behind Gregg
Guenther and Alex Holmes and will play on special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Urquhart will back up Nazel.</TE>
<TE>   Said Byrd: "I remember the [offensive] plays for the most part....
It's funny. I have my offense playbook, my defense playbook, the
defense-ready-for-Auburn folder and the offense-ready-for-Auburn
folder. So I should have Auburn pretty much down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond almost made it through his first
full-contact practice before he tripped and reopened a wound on his
right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Stitches in the knee became infected after the second day of
training camp and forced Allmond to be hospitalized for five days. He
returned last week and was cleared to practice on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said junior college transfer Ronald Nunn is still in
contention to displace freshman Justin Wyatt at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he is a backup, Nunn will get significant playing time
because he can play both corner positions and will be in the nickel
package.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior offensive lineman Zach Wilson will miss the Auburn game
because of a strained left foot but said he hopes to be ready for the
Sept. 14 game at Colorado. Wilson, a three-year starter at right
guard, suffered the injury on the first day of camp and has been
wearing a protective plastic boot since.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out of the boot for an hour and then I got thrown back in,"
Wilson said. "It was on a such a rapid [recovery] pace before, I
thought it would keep going."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Scott Huber was taken off the field on a cart after
injuring his left hip. Huber, who redshirted as a freshman in 1998
after suffering a hip fracture in fall drills, underwent an MRI....
Quarterback Matt Cassel, who chipped a bone in his right kneecap on
Aug. 17, took repetitions and hopes to be available Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Senior fullback Chad Pierson dressed but did not participate in
drills because of a strained left hamstring. Pierson said he is
day-to-day.... Mazio Royster, who rushed for 1,168 yards in 1990,
attended practice.</TE>

<HD>Miller Is Uncertain for U.S. Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Reggie Miller's heart is telling him to do something his head--and
sprained right ankle--are still telling him not to even consider.</LD>
<LD>   Miller said the injured ankle felt better on Wednesday than it did
the day before, but he still wasn't sure whether he would play in the
opening round of the World Championships today.</LD>
<LD>   He knows what he wants to do, though.</LD>
<TE>   "To miss a game is not in my character. I'm sure it's going to be
tough [today]," Miller said. "But knowing how stubborn and hardheaded
I am, I'm probably going to push it and be ready for Friday's game.
Even though I know I shouldn't be playing, I probably will."</TE>
<TE>   The United States, the heavy favorite in the 16-team tournament,
will play Algeria today. The next two games will be against Germany
on Friday night, and China on Saturday night. The United States beat
both of those teams handily in a pair of exhibition games last week.</TE>
<TE>   It was during the 91-73 victory over Germany on Sunday that Miller
injured his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, as more time goes by, the better I'm going to feel,"
he said. "If this was a playoff game, I'm sure I'd push myself."</TE>
<TE>   He said he would see how his ankle felt after a shoot-around in
the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I won't be 100%," said the 37-year-old Indiana Pacer
guard, the oldest player on the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach George Karl said he still had not settled on a starting
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty close, but I'd rather wait until [today]," Karl said.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever plays, Karl said, will be prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that the NBA does probably as well as anybody in the
world is prepare. You play 82 games and you have to be an expert on
how to prepare for every game and get it scouted and get the film
work done," said Karl, who coaches the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my film guy down here ... so we'll be very prepared for
whoever we play in the quarterfinals, semifinals, finals."</TE>

<HD>Bush Offers Argentina Greater Access to the U.S. Import
Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Reluctant to support a new bailout for Argentina, President Bush
granted trade benefits to the crisis-hit country Wednesday giving its
exporters greater access to the U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   The White House said the benefits, approved by presidential
proclamation, could help ease Argentina's economic crisis. They could
also improve the administration's standing in the region. Bush and
his top advisors have been wary of pledging U.S. tax dollars to bail
out Argentina, which is suffering a four-year recession.</LD>
<LD>   The White House said the proclamation provides duty-free access
for 57 types of imports, from leather products and dried apples to
gold and silver jewelry. These imports totaled $126 million in 2001.
Argentina had previously lost the benefits because it exceeded export
limits.</LD>
<TE>   Additional products could receive similar privileges once the
United States and Argentina settle a long-running dispute over
Argentine patent laws on pharmaceuticals, U.S. trade officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America has been frustrated by the Bush administration's
slow response to the Argentine crisis, which has dragged down the
economies of Brazil and Uruguay and threatens others in the region.</TE>

<LD>   A couple who say Air Canada lost their cat is seeking $5 million
in compensation in the largest lawsuit filed over a pet, the Toronto
Star reported.</LD>
<TE>   Andrew Wysotski and Lori Learmont, of San Francisco, are suing Air
Canada and Continental Airlines, which handled baggage for the flight
when their 15-year-old tabby, Fu, disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "What most people don't know is that if [airlines] lose or kill
your pet in transit, their liability is generally limited to $14 per
pound ... as if your pet was a mere suitcase," Wysotski told the
paper.</TE>

<HD>Chinese AIDS Activist Missing</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A veteran Chinese AIDS activist and onetime visiting scholar at USC
is reportedly missing, prompting fears that he may have been
arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Wan Yanhai, also a gay rights activist, was last seen by his
friends Saturday night at a movie screening here in the Chinese
capital. The event, which featured a gay-themed film, was also
attended by plainclothes police, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center for Human Rights and Democracy said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Wan has been well known in the AIDS-prevention effort in China for
nearly a decade. He ran afoul of the Chinese government in the early
1990s after he established an AIDS hotline. He left the country
shortly thereafter.</LD>
<TE>   In 1997, Wan was a visiting scholar at USC. He since has divided
his time between China and Los Angeles and has run a Chinese-language
Web site on AIDS awareness and prevention. Wan recently helped
publicize the plight of villages in central China ravaged by AIDS, a
sensitive story the government has tried to censor.</TE>

<HD>Foreign Troops Leaving Congo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KINSHASA, Congo</DL>
<LD>Uganda and Zimbabwe have begun their pledged troop withdrawals from
Congo, a rare concrete step toward ending Central Africa's four-year,
six-nation war, the United Nations confirmed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Both nations--enemies in the Congo war--have pulled out hundreds
of troops in recent days, U.N. mission spokesman Hamadoun Toure said
here in the Congolese capital.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope all the parties will do the same. We very much hope in
the days to come the foreign military presence will become no more
than a memory," Toure said.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Uganda withdrew 242 of its estimated 2,000 troops in
this country from the town of Beni in rebel-held northeastern Congo,
Toure said. He added that an unknown number of Ugandan troops also
have left the northern town of Gbadolite.</TE>
<TE>   From government-allied western Congo, Zimbabwe has brought home
hundreds of its troops, Toure said. Zimbabwe was believed to have
12,000 troops in Congo.</TE>
<TE>   Congo's war has split the country into government-held zones and
rebel-and foreign-occupied zones. What some call Africa's first world
war has killed an estimated 2.5 million people, most of whom
succumbed to disease or famine brought on or worsened by the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Peace efforts have moved forward under Congo's current leader,
President Joseph Kabila, who came to power after his father, Laurent
Kabila, was assassinated in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Namibia pulled out its relatively few troops last year. Angola,
once a major force on the government side of the war, now has only a
"symbolic" troop presence in Congo, the U.N. mission says. Only
Rwanda, with an estimated 30,000 troops in eastern Congo, has yet to
comply with promises to pull out.</TE>

<HD>After the Floods, a Mosquito Deluge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A plague of mosquitoes and washed-up World War II munitions are
hampering Germans' efforts to return to normal life after disastrous
floods, but Czechs got encouraging news Wednesday as Prague's 14th
century Charles Bridge reopened after two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The bridge, a tourist magnet and symbol for Czechs of their proud
heritage, was nearly submerged at the height of the floods.</LD>
<LD>   On most summer days, tourists, artists and musicians crowd the
span. But on Wednesday, only a few tour groups were on it.</LD>
<TE>   The roar of generators and heavy machinery surrounded the bridge
as construction crews worked to repair nearby buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Other landmarks in the capital didn't escape harm. The first
expert assessments revealed that the stability of Prague's Old Town
Pinkas Synagogue was damaged.</TE>
<TE>   The synagogue, known for its etchings of the names of nearly
80,000 Czech Holocaust victims on its walls, was flooded by more than
6 feet of water. It will be closed for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Old-New Synagogue, a 13th century Gothic landmark, will reopen
next week, but services won't resume for six months.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup and reconstruction continued in Germany as well. Police in
Augsburg, a city on the Danube tributary the Lech, discovered
high-caliber ammunition, grenades, rifles and parts of mines from
World War II and warned locals not to touch them because many are
still functional.</TE>
<TE>   Further east, mosquitoes are creating irritation. The Bernhard
Nocht Institute in Hamburg said mosquitoes had already benefited from
a mild winter, a wet July and high summer temperatures. Now they are
thriving along the Elbe, the main river in Germany affected by the
floods.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers and those trying to restore riverbanks are
complaining of the mosquitoes, and shops in affected areas reportedly
have sold out of repellent.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread flooding caused $14.7 billion in damage in Germany,
$2 billion in Austria, $3 billion in the Czech Republic and more than
$34 million in Slovakia, the European Union has said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed a special disaster
fund that could be used to quickly help pay for the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Romano Prodi said the $492-million fund would
be in addition to several billion dollars being directed to
flood-damaged parts of Germany and Austria and to the EU's eastern
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Prodi said the fund would be a permanent reserve to be used to
tackle disasters in Europe and would probably be increased to about
$983 million next year. The fund must be approved by the EU's 15
member states and the European Parliament.</TE>

<HD>Germany Files Terror Charges</HD>
<DH>Probe: A Moroccan man is accused of helping the Sept. 11
hijackers in Hamburg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges Wednesday against the only
suspect in their custody linked to the Hamburg terrorist cell accused
of carrying out the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Mounir Motassadeq, a 28-year-old Moroccan, will face trial
"because of his participation in the terror attacks," the office of
Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm announced in a statement that did not
specify the charges. Nehm planned a news conference for today to
disclose details.</LD>
<LD>   Motassadeq was a frequent visitor to the Hamburg apartment of
hijackers Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi, and his name appeared
last fall on a U.S. list of 370 people or associations suspected of
assisting terrorists. He was arrested Nov. 28 after investigators
discovered he had a power of attorney over a bank account held by
Al-Shehhi and had been a witness to Atta's last will and testament--a
document replete with extremist religious expressions and paranoid
comments.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement at the time of Motassadeq's arrest, Nehm's office
said the suspect managed the bank account for Al-Shehhi from May to
November 2000 and that "large sums of money were regularly
transferred into this account.... According to our information, these
funds were used to help members of the terrorist group."</TE>
<TE>   The payments were made to support the plotters during their stay
in the U.S. for flight training, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Atta, a 33-year-old Egyptian, is believed to have piloted the
hijacked American Airlines Boeing 767 that on Sept. 11 crashed into
the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York. That attack
was followed about 20 minutes later by the crash of a United Airlines
767 into the South Tower; Al-Shehhi, 23, of the United Arab Emirates,
was believed to have been at the controls.</TE>
<TE>   Another Hamburg associate, 26-year-old Ziad Samir Jarrah of
Lebanon, died aboard a United Airlines Boeing 757 that crashed in
rural Pennsylvania after passengers apparently stormed the cockpit in
an attempt to overpower the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews before his arrest, Motassadeq denied any role in the
attacks and insisted that he knew the suspects only from occasional
encounters in Hamburg at the Al Quds mosque they all frequented. But
sources involved in the investigation say the Moroccan is pictured
with the Sept. 11 figures in 1999 photos taken at the wedding of
another suspect, Said Bahaji, who is now a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq, an electrical engineering student, attended the same
Hamburg Technical University department where Atta and Al-Shehhi were
students. His apartment was just a few blocks from the Marienstrasse
hangout where the elaborate planning for the terrorist strikes is
believed to have taken place under Atta's supervision.</TE>
<TE>   International arrest warrants have been issued by Nehm's office
for three other suspected collaborators from the Hamburg cell:
Bahaji, 27, a German citizen of Moroccan descent; Ramzi Binalshibh,
30, of Yemen; and Zakariya Essabar, 25, of Morocco. All are wanted
for allegedly providing support for the suicide pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still investigating whether Motassadeq's two years
of work as a janitor at Hamburg's airport might have given him access
to secure areas or means of creating false identifications. German
media reported last fall that police sweeps of suspected terrorist
hide-outs in other areas of the country turned up airline uniforms
and security badges that might have helped terrorists gain access to
planes.</TE>
<TE>   Although German intelligence officials in Hamburg have been under
intense pressure from FBI agents and other U.S. authorities to round
up anyone suspected of aiding the hijackers, Motassadeq is the only
one who has been kept for more than brief questioning. Two other men,
however, were put under surveillance after their associations with
suspects came to official attention.</TE>
<TE>   Both men, who are of Syrian origin, have been questioned. One has
since fled to his homeland and is now the subject of an extradition
case.</TE>

Israeli settlement, residents and doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   The shelling in the village of Sheik Iljeen came after Israeli
tanks entered Palestinian-controlled territory and Israeli gunboats
patrolled the Gaza Strip shoreline for the second night in a row.
Tanks blocked the main north-south road in Gaza, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Red Crescent rescue service workers said Israeli tank shells hit
two houses. The dead were identified as Rawaida Hajien, 50; two of
her sons, Ashraf, 23, and Mehad, 17; and their cousin Mohammed, 20.
Hajien's 4-year-old son, Khaled, was critically wounded, and three
other people were hurt, doctors said.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Nafez Shalach, acting director of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City,
where the casualties were taken, charged that Israeli forces
prevented ambulances from reaching the wounded for more than 40
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
suspicious figures approached an army outpost, and tanks fired at
them, hitting them. The sources said this was late at night in an
area where Palestinian movement is forbidden, not in a built-up area.</TE>
<TE>   Even before today's incursion, Israel postponed a meeting to
implement a new security agreement because of recent violence.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security forces set up checkpoints Wednesday in the
Gaza Strip to show that they can maintain order as part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement to use Gaza and the West Bank town of Bethlehem as
test cases, announced Aug. 18, led to withdrawal of Israeli forces
from Bethlehem two days later. Palestinians charge that the Israelis
are stalling the Gaza handover.</TE>
<TE>   Israel counters that the Palestinians are not stopping terrorist
attacks and called off a meeting between Israeli Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Palestinian Interior Minister Abdel Razak
Yehiyeh.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Palestinians were reportedly killed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In central Gaza, Israeli troops killed a Palestinian man as he
approached an army post.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, a 32-year-old Palestinian man was killed when a
tank opened fire with machine guns, hitting his home in the Jenin
refugee camp, Palestinian witnesses said.</TE>

<HD>In Minsk, a McDonald's May End Up Mincemeat</HD>
<DH>Belarus: The city wants to temporarily close an eatery to
build a school. Critics say the case shows the hazards for foreign
investment in the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Belarus, the Soviet throwback sandwiched between Russia and Poland,
is resisting efforts by McDonald's to turn it into a fast-food
nation.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-food giant filed a lawsuit this month in a land dispute
with authorities--the latest in a string of problems it has had since
it opened for business in Belarus in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in the capital, Minsk, leased a prime location near
Belarus State University and a train station to McDonald's for 39
years, and the chain built a restaurant on it--one of six it has
opened in the nation. However, the city later ruled that the
university could use the same site, and officials intend to build a
school of international relations there.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald's would have to close for two years during construction.
If--or when--the restaurant reopens, it would be surrounded by the
university building. McDonald's officials say they are seeking
compensation for lost revenue during construction.</TE>
<TE>   If this were an argument on what is better for young
people--burgers and fries or education--the answer would be clear to
many. But it is far from that simple.</TE>
<TE>   Critics see the case as an illustration of the hazards of doing
business in Belarus, where authorities have often broken deals with
foreign investors. Corporations such as Ford Motor Co. have simply
walked away from multimillion-dollar investments.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's is still considered a remarkable institution by many in
Belarus, population 10 million. Provincial folk arriving in Minsk
flock to the disputed restaurant directly from the adjacent train
station. Families line up for photos in front of it.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the wide-eyed admiration, the company also has many
detractors in the city administration, the Health Ministry and
Belarus State University.</TE>
<TE>   Among its opponents are the "Grill Brothers," a group of
disaffected former employees of the hamburger giant who use their own
McDonald's slang and run a pithy Web site berating the company for
its treatment of young workers, its low pay and its management style.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed restaurant now languishes behind a 6-foot-high metal
fence. The 100-yard detour to find the gate has deterred many
customers, the company says. Worse lies ahead. After the two-year
closure during construction of the school of international relations,
the restaurant will be encircled by the new building and will be
invisible from the railway square.</TE>
<TE>   The company's manager in Belarus, Natalya Zygmont, declined to be
interviewed for this article. Its press officer, Olga Troyan, would
not say how much money the company is seeking in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank reported in January that Belarus was one of the
least reformed of the former Soviet states. President Alexander G.
Lukashenko has shunned reform, and small business has failed to put
down strong roots.</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana Kalinkina, deputy editor of the Belorusskaya Delovaya
Gazeta, a business paper, said the McDonald's case typifies the
problems faced by foreign investors in Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of foreign investors, big and small, have realized that it
is virtually impossible to do business in Belarus," she said. "Too
many people in power in Belarus continue to think that it is possible
to turn the country into a small Cuba right in the heart of Europe
and survive with the help of domestic resources."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is only one of many McDonald's has faced in Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   First, Belarus authorities insisted that McDonald's use only local
beef and potatoes. McDonald's managed to convince them that it needed
to import 70% of the ingredients from Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Next, in 1997, authorities in Minsk ruled that the university
could build on land leased to McDonald's because it originally was
university land.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, the Belarus Health Ministry declared that McDonald's
food was bad for people's health. It advised people to eat
traditional Belarussian food, which, like Russian cuisine, is heavy
in fat and carbohydrates. Fried potatoes are a much-loved
accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where the courts often reflect the views of
authorities, Minsk city officials appeared disdainful of McDonald's
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Vyacheslav Kushner, deputy mayor of Minsk, said that McDonald's
should never have been granted a lease to operate on university land
and that the hamburger giant has made no attempt to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have easily found a way out: Either make a deal with
the university, or find another place to move their restaurant," he
said. "They could have easily avoided this conflict. Instead, today
McDonald's is ready to fight on the barricades. It is a very stupid
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides this, they need to clearly realize that the university is
more important to us than a fast-food restaurant," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Kozulin, university rector, said that the school offered
to build a new McDonald's building on one of four other sites, but
that the company refused.</TE>
<TE>   "We are normal people. We are not barbarians, but no matter what
we offer them, they never accept it," he said. He accused McDonald's
of breaking promises to offer students discounted meals and to
sponsor some university programs, claims denied by the company.</TE>
<TE>   "McDonald's has taught us a very good lesson, and we are grateful
to them for it," Kozulin said. "We now know that even the biggest and
best-known transnational corporations are not to be trusted."</TE>
<TE>   Troyan, the McDonald's spokeswoman, said the university's building
plans infringe on the company's property rights and the fence
restricts access to the site.</TE>
<TE>   "This fence has become a strong psychological deterrent for our
clients," she said, but she declined to provide a figure for the
company's losses.</TE>
<TE>   Troyan said McDonald's was prepared to accept the university
expansion but wanted compensation for its losses in the two years the
restaurant would be closed.</TE>
<TE>   She said the amount of compensation McDonald's was seeking would
not cover its losses. "We have done so much, but we got nothing in
return," she said. "Instead, they put up this fence."</TE>
<TE>   Belarus attracts only a trickle of foreign investment, despite its
cheap labor and ideal location between Russia and Europe. Its own
industries are foundering: Nearly half of all companies, mainly
large, unreformed Soviet-era dinosaurs, are broke, according to March
figures from the Belarus Statistics Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Ford set up a minivan plant in 1996 but pulled the plug on its
$19-million investment two years ago when Lukashenko's government
reneged on a tax break.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian beer company Baltika struck a deal last year with
Lukashenko to invest millions in a state-owned brewery in return for
a controlling stake, then demanded its money back when the deal did
not materialize. The dispute is unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   The McDonald's dispute has upset even some of those who dislike
the fast-food giant. Valery Manyuk, a 19-year-old student, worked for
a year at another McDonald's in Minsk and said managers there treated
their staff poorly.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who does his job well at McDonald's today does it not
because they love their job," he said. "They do it for fear of being
fired."</TE>
<TE>   Manyuk said that when he first heard about the problems faced by
the disputed McDonald's, he felt a surge of glee, but then he thought
of what it meant for his country.</TE>
<TE>   "As a citizen of Belarus, I am disappointed. If such huge
companies as that are tortured by the authorities, it means we can
have little hope of a better future in this country. The McDonald's
situation shows that Belarus remains a hopeless case."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Accuses N. Korea of Weapons Violations</HD>
<DH>Asia: A Bush official says regime's intransigence may
affect plans to build reactors for the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's top arms control negotiator today accused
North Korea of ignoring repeated warnings about its weapons programs
and hinted that the United States could reconsider a 1994 agreement
under which the U.S. and other countries are supposed to build
light-water nuclear reactors for Pyongyang.</LD>
<LD>   "The global consequences of its proliferation are impossible to
ignore," warned Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton, delivering
one of the administration's toughest speeches to date on the
recalcitrant North Korean regime.</LD>
<LD>   In a methodical, prosecutorial style, Bolton read off a litany of
charges against the North Koreans. "North Korea is the world's
foremost peddler of ballistic missile-related equipment," he charged,
listing clients that include so-called rogue regimes such as Iran,
Syria and Libya.</LD>
<TE>   "North Korea has one of the most robust offensive bioweapons
programs on Earth," Bolton continued. With regard to chemical
weapons, he cited South Korean Defense Ministry estimates that North
Korea has at least 2,500 tons of lethal chemicals and is "exerting
its utmost efforts" to produce more.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were drawn largely from two declassified CIA
reports submitted to Congress this year. However, the tone and timing
of the speech suggested a hardening of the Bush administration's
views.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton repeated assurances by President Bush that the United
States has no plans to attack North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But his speech cast grave doubts on whether the administration
will continue to support the agreement to build reactors to ease
North Korea's energy shortage in exchange for Pyongyang's suspension
of its nuclear weapons program. The nuclear components cannot be
delivered until North Korea allows international weapons inspectors
to certify that it is complying with the treaty--something that it
has so far refused to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Continued intransigence on the part of Pyongyang only begs the
question: What is North Korea hiding?" Bolton said.</TE>
<TE>   He said if North Korea fails to allow inspections promptly, "the
future of the 'agreed framework,' " as the 1994 treaty is known,
"will be in serious doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Bush this year refused to certify to Congress that North Korea is
in compliance with all treaty provisions. Last week, the
administration announced sanctions against a North Korean
manufacturer for selling missile parts to Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton, well known for his hawkish views, comes to Seoul at a
politically and diplomatically sensitive time. South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung, in his final months in office, is anxious to wring out
of the North Koreans more tangible gains from his "sunshine policy"
of engagement with the North that won him the Nobel Peace Prize in
2000. This week, economic officials from Pyongyang are visiting Seoul
to talk about plans for a railroad reconnecting the two Koreas.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton's speech, delivered to an audience of foreign and South
Korean diplomats, academics and business leaders, appeared to draw
some fire from supporters of Kim.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Yoon Kyu, chief executive officer of Hyundai Asan, challenged
Bolton on whether the Bush administration supports economic projects
between the Koreas.</TE>
<TE>   "We only wish the North Koreans would spend more money on economic
development and less on weapons of mass destruction," Bolton said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Warns Iran Against Harboring Terrorists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>The United States warned Iran on Wednesday not to harbor terrorists
after Tehran rejected a newspaper report that it had given refuge to
two deputies of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified Arab intelligence
sources, reported Wednesday that two Al Qaeda deputies were in Iran,
along with dozens of Al Qaeda fighters, and were said to be plotting
new attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The paper identified the two as Saif Adel, an Egyptian on the
FBI's most-wanted list, and Mahfouz Ould Walid, whom U.S. officials
reported killed in Afghanistan in January.</LD>
<TE>   Tehran rejected the report. "It has become a bad habit of some
American circles to issue repetitious and baseless charges against
Iran. Those Al Qaeda members are not in Iran," Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, near the ranch where President Bush is
spending the month, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: "We
expect every government not to harbor terrorists in their country and
not to provide them with safe haven. And that's what we call on the
Iranian government to do as well. We want to be very clear to the
Iranian government on that message."</TE>
<TE>   Iran says it has arrested and deported more than 100 people with
suspected links to Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime and Al Qaeda.
Sixteen of the suspects were handed over to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran's policy is not to shelter Al Qaeda members and to prevent
such people from entering the country," Asefi said. "We have been
fighting against terrorism from the start and are still pursuing this
policy."</TE>

<HD>For Afghans, Postwar Recovery Begins With Rebuilding Roads</HD>
<DH>Asia: A $180-million route, to be funded by the U.S., is
one of the highway projects aimed at bolstering economy and Karzai
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Under pressure for results from Afghanistan's struggling government,
foreign donors and international aid agencies are poised to undertake
a massive road-rebuilding program that will provide a boost to the
economy and some much-needed political capital to President Hamid
Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   The United States is taking on the biggest single piece of
construction, the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat route, a $180-million project
that will include the rebuilding of 10 bridges, Afghan government
sources say. The European Union, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank also will bankroll major road segments.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan's entire infrastructure, from water treatment systems
and schools to electricity, is a shambles after 23 years of war. But
Karzai has made reconstruction of the road system his top aid
priority since taking office Dec. 22.</LD>
<TE>   The roads are so awful that a 600-mile run on the route from Kabul
to Herat, the main east-west corridor, takes truckers up to a week
because of potholes, collapsed bridges and washouts.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign officials resisted the idea of dedicating so much aid
money to highways, convinced that smaller projects such as fixing
irrigation canals, cleaning up wells and rebuilding schools might
actually bring more economic and social benefits faster.</TE>
<TE>   "The Afghan government would like to see large-scale projects be
built with enormously high political profiles [while] we want to
improve the quality of people's lives," said one top foreign official
who did not want his name or that of his government used.</TE>
<TE>   International donors are far behind in delivering aid they have
pledged. Of $1.8 billion promised for this year at an aid conference
in Tokyo in January, $1.2 billion is outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Afghan refugees have returned in unexpectedly high
numbers. The return of 1.5 million people has forced the diversion of
reconstruction funds to urgent needs such as providing food, shelter
and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   But now, with pressure mounting on Karzai to deliver results,
Afghanistan's foreign benefactors are coming around.</TE>
<TE>   Reconstruction of five major trunk roads costing hundreds of
millions of dollars will soon be announced. Work will begin as money
is appropriated.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say funds for the U.S. portion are expected sometime
before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "We sympathize with the need of the transition government to show
visible progress," the foreign official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of destruction here exceeds anything I've ever seen,"
the official said. "We've got to get moving."</TE>
<TE>   Iran's government was the first to announce that it was
underwriting a major road project, the 80-mile stretch from Herat to
the Iranian border, perhaps shaming others into following suit.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans have grown impatient with the slow pace of reform in the
months following the removal of the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai and aid agencies have cautioned that reconstruction will
take 10 to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   But road repairs cannot come soon enough for Ajamel, 24.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he was wrung out after finally arriving in Kabul, the
capital, with a load of Chinese fabric from Herat.</TE>
<TE>   He was furious at the government, claiming that his work was
easier under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Other drivers also waiting at the Kabul customs depot said they
were angry not only about the bad roads but also about the lack of
security.</TE>
<TE>   Trucks are routinely stopped by armed men who shake down drivers
for cash before allowing them to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "At least you only had to pay one toll and they worked on the
roads," Ajamel said of the Taliban. "Now we pay eight different
bandits along the way 10 times as much and the roads only get worse."</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans promised they would make the government bring
peace, but they are asleep now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another driver, Seddiquallah, 19, also arrived Monday from Herat
and said the trip had become an ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The potholes are so deep that the truck nearly tipped over in
several places," he said. "And I still got stopped at eight
checkpoints by people who said they were in charge of local security.
They say they are with the government, but they take money for
personal benefit."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to proceed with the roadwork came after much debate
among donor nations and international agencies about where to deploy
their limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   "In a country where there are so many problems, making priorities
is difficult," Lakhdar Brahimi, chief of the United Nations mission
in Afghanistan, said at a news conference Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 80% of Afghan school buildings are destroyed, only
one-fifth of the capital's population has piped water, and as few as
150,000 homes and businesses in a country of 26 million people have
electric power.</TE>
<TE>   But the economic costs of a road system in ruins may have
persuaded the donors to adopt Karzai's priority. Roads have
deteriorated to the point that transportation costs per ton in
Afghanistan can be eight times those of neighboring Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Project sponsors will insist that Afghan public works officials
operate in a totally new way, putting the projects out for
competitive bid while investing a minimum in government-owned
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the international donors are insisting on a system of taxes
and tolls to ensure that the roads are maintained, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans will actually build the roads. The international agencies
and foreign governments will pay for construction and closely monitor
it to control costs.</TE>
<TE>   The road building itself is expected to generate an enormous
economic and social benefit by putting thousands of Afghans to work.</TE>
<TE>   And if, as expected, many militia members take jobs on the road
crews, the projects could have the added benefit of disarming parts
of Afghanistan. Many serve under regional warlords because they have
no other means of subsistence.</TE>
<TE>   Good roads would also make Afghanistan's economy much more
efficient by reducing the time and cost of transportation.
Afghanistan's child mortality rate, which is very high, might fall
because mothers in rural areas would have easier access to medical
centers.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank's country manager for Afghanistan, William Byrd,
said Afghanistan needs so much help that it is hard to choose where
to start. But as deep a hole as Afghanistan is in, other countries
have recovered from similar adversity.</TE>
<TE>   "South Korea in 1960 still looked like a poor prospect, and look
what it's done. It's a high-technology center. The government got
into a crash program to increase exports and promote education and is
now prospering," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghans are energetic and entrepreneurial. We shouldn't be
discouraged," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Faizullah Muktaj, an editor at the government-owned Kabul-based
newspaper Anis, warned that new roads won't bring about economic
recovery unless the government is able to bring security to lawless
roads and cities.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still 2 million armed men around, and as long as there
is no security or stable situation, reconstruction work will not be
effective for the people and the Americans will fail," Muktaj said.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Victims of Suicide Attacks See Grounds for Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Those hurt by bombers--physically or
financially--go after the Palestinian Authority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>If roadblocks, home demolitions and family deportations don't deter
suicide bombers, maybe attorneys will.</LD>
<LD>   At least three pending lawsuits against the Palestinian Authority
seek millions of dollars in compensation for injury, lost business
and even the chilling effect that violence has had on tourism.</LD>
<LD>   The central tenet of the lawsuits--by a group of hotels, an
Israeli bus company and a businessman--is that the Palestinian
Authority as a quasi-governmental organization has been negligent in
preventing acts of terror--and in some cases has even abetted them.</LD>
<TE>   This month, an Israeli court agreed to increase to $20.4 million
the amount of Palestinian funds that Israel will
"attach"--essentially seize pending an outcome--after the filing of a
50-page lawsuit by 37 hotels accusing the authority of scaring
tourists away.</TE>
<TE>   The attachment, and any settlement, comes out of taxes Israel
collects on behalf of the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil abu Rudaineh, a senior aide to President Yasser Arafat, said
the Palestinian Authority takes the cases seriously but disputes
their basic premise. "We are the ones who should take Israel to court
for the occupation and millions of dollars in damaged and destroyed
buildings, not the other way around," he said. "We will probably sue
them."</TE>
<TE>   In the other cases, the Egged bus company, Israel's largest, is in
the final stages of preparing its own lawsuit, which it expects to
file in the Court of International Justice in The Hague or another
United Nations venue, seeking $81 million in compensation for lost
lives, gunfire-and bomb-related damage to its buses and lost revenue
as riders increasingly walk, hitchhike and otherwise avoid riding its
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   And pioneer litigant Shlomi Dan, a businessman, has an ongoing
lawsuit against the Palestinian Authority for $815,000 in pain,
suffering and economic loss after his spinal cord was damaged in a
March 4, 1996, suicide bombing at Tel Aviv's Dizengoff shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs all say their motives are economic rather than
political, even as they acknowledge that the lawsuits can't help but
have a strong political element. Attorneys add that they expect other
Israeli industries and individuals to follow their lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We recently saw the World Trade Center families file suit," said
Carmit Bar-On, an attorney representing the hotel industry. "It's an
international trend."</TE>
<TE>   This latest battle tactic in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has
some Israelis fretting that their country is catching the "American
disease" and will get swept up in a lawsuit frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Others are more sanguine. "We haven't gone that far," said Roland
Roth, an attorney for one of the plaintiffs. "We haven't gotten to
the point where everyone's suing if their drinks are too hot, or too
cold, or whatever it is."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary Israelis expressed mixed views over the idea of trying to
hold the Palestinian Authority financially and legally responsible
for bombings and other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Health policy researcher Bruce Rosen, 44, said he thinks the court
should treat the cases as straightforward commercial claims and
ignore the political implications. Orin Sheetreet, a 24-year-old
sandwich shop worker, said he doesn't think the plaintiffs can win,
while Boaz Epstein, a 28-year-old mechanic, thinks that it's worth a
try. "I say, 'Go for it,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel industry has been among the hardest hit by the
Palestinian intifada, with those in Jerusalem or catering to
businesspeople reporting occupancy rates as low as 8%. Avi Rosenthal,
director-general of Israel's 350-member Hotel Assn., says 5.3 million
tourists have stayed away from Israel since the start of the intifada
23 months ago, depriving the industry of $6 billion in revenue and
60,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the hotel owners who filed suit believe that the
Palestinian Authority should pay, and they say more hoteliers are
expected to join the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel industry attorney Bar-On says she faced skepticism before in
a similar case when previous clients sought compensation for damage
suffered during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Ultimately, however, they
prevailed under a U.N. compensation plan, she said, including one
hotel group that was awarded $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "At first people laughed," she said. "But the people who didn't
join ate their hats."</TE>
<TE>   Neta Ziv, a legal professor with Tel Aviv University, said that
the hotel case is innovative but that it could prove difficult to
make a causal link in civil court between the injury suffered as a
result of attacks and the Palestinian Authority's responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Egged bus company has suffered far more direct damage from the
recent violence than the hotel industry. Over the last 18 months, the
company's 4,000 vehicles have been the object of 13 suicide bombings
and 188 other attacks that killed 100 people, including one of its
drivers, and wounded 600.</TE>
<TE>   Ridership has also eroded by nearly 15% on average, with the slump
especially pronounced immediately after an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been thinking about filing this lawsuit for a long time,"
Egged spokesman Ron Ratner said. "Buses are a major target, and we
haven't seen the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   The granddaddy of all plaintiffs, however, is businessman Dan, who
was the first to file suit against the Palestinian Authority in 1997,
paving the way for subsequent lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a fascinating case," said Roth, his attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Roth said Dan came to him bankrupt, his life a shambles and intent
on suing shortly after the 1996 suicide attack confined him to a
wheelchair. Dan's initial idea was to go after the trucking company
that had transported the suicide bomber to the attack. But Roth had
an epiphany one day in mid-1997, he said, after reading in a local
paper that Arafat had an account at an Israeli bank.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I had my brainstorm," Roth said. "I was sure hundreds
of other victims would have the same idea about attaching the money,
so I ran to court. But no one else was there."</TE>
<TE>   The last several years have seen a protracted struggle to have
Israel recognize Dan's claim given the novel legal approach and its
political implications. But Dan persevered. Now Roth is preparing to
call witnesses, to prove that what they say is the clear causal link
between the Palestinian leadership and the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Some, meanwhile, fear that Israel is following in the United
States' footsteps, becoming increasingly litigious. Rosen, the health
policy analyst, says he's watched medical malpractice cases steadily
increase.</TE>
<TE>   But others pooh-poohed the notion, citing a less litigious culture
and high costs that tend to discourage frivolous suits. Filing a
$1-million lawsuit, for instance, costs you $25,000 just in court
fees.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S., you have lots of time to sue, and there's lots of
money all over the place," said Jerusalem resident Epstein, the
mechanic. "In Israel, it's just not like that."</TE>

<HD>Indoor Stoves Killing Millions in Third World, WHO Says</HD>
<DH>Health: Leaders at South Africa summit seek to end cooking
and heating practices among the poor that unleash poisons in their
homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRA, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The mother stoked a crude stove with wood, broken bits of
particleboard, chunks of coal--and a large, white plastic bag.</LD>
<LD>   "The plastic bag gets very hot and will melt into coal," Nontisha
Langbell maintained, as the year-old daughter strapped to her back
turned away to avoid the acrid plume. Children gathered around the
stove that will cook the family meal of potatoes and gravy and keep
them warm.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few miles from this Johannesburg township, health and
environmental officials meeting at the World Summit on Sustainable
Development are seeking ways to break this daily ritual common in the
Third World. Air pollutants trapped inside homes from stoves that
burn coal, wood or cow dung have been linked to the premature deaths
of 2.1 million women and children each year, the World Health
Organization says.</LD>
<TE>   "The No. 1 killer of children under the age of 5 is pneumonia, an
acute respiratory illness," said Yasmin von Schirnding, an
epidemiologist with the WHO.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the international summit, who have spent days
haggling over an environmental master plan, readily agreed that
indoor air pollution is a global threat. The extensive document calls
for providing cheap and cleaner energy to the poorest and most
distant corners of the globe, "particularly to reduce dependence on
traditional fuel sources for cooking and heating, which affect the
health of women and children."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 10-day conference that began Monday, various groups
and nations will roll out projects to tackle the problem, which
experts say is only now receiving the attention it deserves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major priority of this summit," said Nitin Desai, the
gathering's secretary-general. "It brings together the health of
women and children and the environmental dimension of saving forests
and reducing air pollution. I think it's fixable if we put our minds
on it."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration may announce as soon as today the U.S.
government's approach to solving the problem: the "Partnership for
Clean Indoor Air," a joint project with other nations, some nonprofit
groups, including the Shell Foundation, and UC Berkeley's Renewable
and Appropriate Energy Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Details are still being worked out. But the project aims at
inspiring the development and local production of cheap, reliable and
efficient stoves with vents to the outdoors, and lining up new kinds
of fuel to replace coal, animal waste, straw and other crop refuse
gleaned from the fields or nearby forests.</TE>
<TE>   "It may mean substituting dung and straw and wood with methane
from the landfill to power the village," said John C. Beale, deputy
assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Other solutions include use of solar power or small canisters of
cleaner-burning gas that wouldn't require a hefty outlay of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Kui-Nang Mak, chief of the United Nations' energy program, said
international groups have worked for the last decade on pilot
projects to bring modern sources of energy to the 2 billion people
who do without. These programs, he said, have taken on a greater
urgency with widening recognition of the health implications.</TE>
<TE>   Such a realization struck Mak two years ago when he revisited the
small village in China where he spent his childhood in the late 1940s
and early '50s. His mother died at a young age of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember vividly," he said. "She was carrying me on her back as
a boy as she was cooking using rice stalks and branches from trees.
There was smoke everywhere. It was awful. When I took my kids to my
village two years ago, they were still doing it."</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the world's households cook or heat using
unprocessed solid fuels such as wood and agricultural waste. In
India, about 75% of households use these fuels. Typically they are
burned in open fires or primitive stoves, mostly in rooms that lack
adequate ventilation or chimneys. Without ventilation, women and
children around the home are regularly exposed to high concentrations
of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde
and carcinogens such as benzene.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Smith of UC Berkeley's School of Public Health studied such
practices and concluded: "Half a million children and women die each
year from indoor air pollution in India."</TE>
<TE>   China accounts for another heavy concentration of smoke-related
illness and death. But such cooking practices also are widespread in
sub-Saharan Africa and in many poor and rural areas of Latin America,
including Guatemala, Nicaragua and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Maged Younes, a WHO toxicologist, said it is not easy to pinpoint
precisely how many of the 2.1 million premature deaths a year are
caused exclusively by indoor air pollution and how much other
factors--such as outdoor air pollution and poor nutrition--might play
a role. Yet studies have shown repeatedly that children are much more
prone to chest infections, coughs, colds and middle-ear infections if
exposed to indoor smoke.</TE>
<TE>   One study in the African nation of Gambia showed that children who
were carried on their mothers' backs were six times more likely to
develop acute respiratory illness. Another study in Tanzania found
that children younger than 5 who died of respiratory infection were
almost three times more likely to have slept in a room with an open
stove than healthy children of the same age.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have linked stillbirths, low birth weight, blindness
and suppressed immune systems of newborns to indoor smoke exposure
and carbon monoxide poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Von Schirnding, the WHO epidemiologist, once participated in a
study of women and children in households in Soweto, another
Johannesburg township. "We were surprised at the number of mothers
who had no idea that air pollution had any role in their children's
respiratory illness," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Mvelase, director of the Alexandra Health Center, said
that's no longer the case. The women know, she said, but they have no
money to buy expensive fuel or fancy stoves.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of children coming in with pneumonia," she said. "If
that weren't enough, in the winter we get a lot of carbon monoxide
poisoning." That usually happens when mothers fall asleep and forget
to take the brazier outside for the rest of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Carbon monoxide poisoning causes a lot of death here," said Dr.
Thabo Mnisi, who works at the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Langbell said she always remembers to take the brazier outside
before she falls asleep. She is also careful to start the wood and
scavenged charcoal burning outside, to let most of the smoke escape,
before she takes the stove inside her 12-by-10-foot shack made mostly
of corrugated iron.</TE>
<TE>   "When I take it in the house, it makes me dizzy," Langbell said,
as she began to feed her five children. But she has her own folk
remedy to fortify herself against the smoke. "I take a little bit of
the coals and put it in a little bit of water and drink it a little
bit and then it will not affect me."</TE>

<HD>Sabotage in a Few Clicks</HD>
<DH>In what may be a case of corporate computer hacking, Canal
Plus alleges a rival firm broke its secret code, then gave it to
counterfeiters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the popular imagination, a computer hacker is on the fringes of
society--either a brilliant but misguided teenager or a solitary,
disaffected adult. He's more interested in showing off his skills
than benefiting from them. He values havoc over money.</LD>
<LD>   Canal Plus Technologies, a leading maker of the smart cards that
control satellite television signals in people's homes, went
searching three years ago for just such a troublemaker.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of Europeans were buying counterfeit Canal Plus smart
cards on the black market and inserting them in their set-top boxes,
instantly getting free access to premium channels that carry soccer
games and adult movies. In Italy, there were as many as three
freeloaders for every legitimate customer.</LD>
<TE>   Canal Plus, a division of French entertainment conglomerate
Vivendi Universal, learned that the code controlling the cards had
been posted on a Canadian Web site specializing in the secrets of
digital technology. Using the code as a blueprint, it was relatively
simple for counterfeiters to make cards.</TE>
<TE>   But who had actually cracked the code that Canal Plus had spent
$35 million developing in total secrecy? The firm's investigation
ultimately led not to some maladjusted youth or embittered
ex-employee but to an entire company.</TE>
<TE>   Not just any company, either. Behind the hack, Canal Plus says, it
was shocked to find NDS Group, a competing smart-card developer
largely owned by Rupert Murdoch's global entertainment conglomerate,
News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   According to a lawsuit Canal Plus filed in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco in March, NDS sought to dominate the smart-card market
by driving a wedge between Canal Plus and its customers. Canal Plus
claims a billion dollars in damages.</TE>
<TE>   NDS, which was co-founded in Israel and run for several years by a
fugitive from U.S. law enforcement, has denied the charges, calling
the suit "an attempt by an inept competitor to shift the blame for
its incompetence."</TE>
<TE>   The hacking has altered the global media industry. The counterfeit
cards may have played a role in the downfall of Vivendi former Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier. They also brought about the
near-ruination of Vivendi's prized Italian satellite system,
propelling it to the auction block in early June. News Corp. promptly
struck a deal to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   The case marks the biggest and most sensational accusation yet of
corporate cybercrime, a shadowy, unsavory and increasingly popular
activity, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations and organizations looking for an edge find hacking
irresistible and all too easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible to wreak havoc on a competitor today in a way that
it wasn't before," said high-tech consultant Sean Badding. "It's only
a few clicks of the mouse from legal to illegal."</TE>
<TE>   A long-running Silicon Valley case illustrates how "a few clicks"
can undermine and even potentially destroy a company.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, Cadence Design Systems, a maker of design
software for integrated circuits, sued Avant Corp., claiming it had
stolen its programs. A subsequent criminal case, brought by a
determined San Jose prosecutor, led to verdicts last year against
seven current and former Avant employees, including the chief
executive and three founders. Five received jail sentences.</TE>
<TE>   For years, however, Avant was on the offensive, asserting that
Cadence was merely a lame competitor. It was an argument that proved
surprisingly effective. "We had a lot of pressure from people in the
electronics industry saying, 'Get over it, crybaby,' " said Cadence
general counsel Smith McKeithen.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of being labeled a loser lead a lot of companies to hush up
about sabotage. And even when they're willing to go public, the
prosecution record is "disappointing," said Bill Boni, coauthor of a
forthcoming report from the American Society for Industrial Security
on "trends in proprietary information loss."</TE>
<TE>   "From information theft to manipulating and destabilizing
competitors, espionage and sabotage are getting worse," said Boni,
chief information security officer at Motorola Inc. "But catching the
culprits is hard. If the FBI didn't catch [former agent and admitted
spy] Robert Hanssen stealing counterintelligence documents, how do
you think corporations are going to find someone digitally plundering
their crown jewels?"</TE>
<TE>   At its most basic, corporate espionage is a search for competitive
information. At Princeton University, the director of admissions
recently was caught hacking into a Yale University Web site that let
prospective students know whether they had been admitted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Internet bookseller Alibris paid $250,000 to resolve
federal charges that it had unlawfully intercepted thousands of
e-mail messages to its customers from online bookseller Amazon.com.
Many of Alibris' customers were booksellers themselves; knowing what
they were buying from Amazon could provide Alibris a better
understanding of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Although companies can put some rudimentary defenses in place, for
the most part they are helpless against the type of hacking in these
cases. As for corporate sabotage, which is what Canal Plus is
alleging, there's literally no defense.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people look at computer security and say, 'Give me the
answer. Tell me what will make these problems go away,' " said
consultant Bruce Schneier. "And I say, 'Nothing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Weinstein, co-founder of People for Internet
Responsibility, an advocacy group, said it is a mistake to look for a
technological solution to sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me to be purely an ethical question," he said. "We're
going to have to rely on the better part of human nature."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that newspapers are overflowing with stories about
corporate executives who lied and looted, Weinstein acknowledged,
"Unfortunately, that's not always a lot to count on."</TE>
<TE>   A Colorful History</TE>
<TE>   A smart card, about the size of a credit card, has an embedded
chip with a central processing unit and memory cells. Basically, it
is a tiny portable computer. That makes it perfect for controlling
access to digital television, which is beamed encrypted from
satellites.</TE>
<TE>   The smart card slips into the set-top box that converts the
digital signal, unscrambling it and acting as a sort of gatekeeper
for the programming content. A smart card, for instance, will record
what pay-per-view program a subscriber watches and transmit that
information over a phone line to the billing office.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 million TVs worldwide use smart-card technology. A third
of the cards come from NDS Group, a company with a colorful history.</TE>
<TE>   "NDS is all about the business of keeping secrets," said Neil
Chenoweth, author of a biography of Rupert Murdoch that will be
published this fall. "For most of its history it has existed in a
legal and tax sense somewhere between Hong Kong, London, Jerusalem
and Grand Cayman. But what happens if the secret side of an
organization gets out of control?"</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. funded the Israeli start-up in 1988 with vague hopes of
profiting from its encryption technology. When Murdoch realized that
his new British satellite television service would be endlessly
pirated without adequate safeguards, NDS, then called News Datacom,
proved its worth almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   NDS was run by a young English-born entrepreneur named Michael
Clinger, a onetime bank credit analyst in New York who became chief
executive of a small medical laser company. The Securities and
Exchange Commission brought fraud charges against that firm, which
Clinger settled in 1986. He then decided to emigrate to Israel. In
1990, a U.S. grand jury indicted Clinger on 51 counts of fraud,
conspiracy and insider trading, all relating to the laser company.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Murdoch knew that one of his crucial divisions was being
run by an international fugitive remains unclear. Even after
relations between Clinger and News Corp. soured, Chenoweth writes in
his book, "It wasn't in News Corp.'s interest for Clinger to be
arrested." An NDS spokeswoman declined to discuss the issue, calling
it "ancient history."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Murdoch bought out Clinger's interest in NDS and got rid
of him. Or thought he did. Clinger still secretly controlled the
manufacturing company that made the smart cards for NDS, which gave
him a direct pipeline into his former company.</TE>
<TE>   Matters spiraled out of control, according to several news
accounts, when Clinger's ex-wife, a former swimsuit model, got
involved with NDS' former chief financial officer. Apparently for
revenge, Clinger turned him in for alleged evasion of personal income
taxes. Apparently for revenge, the chief financial officer told News
Corp. officials that Clinger hadn't gone away as they thought.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. sued Clinger for fraud in 1996, saying he was inflating
the costs of each card he sold to NDS. Clinger fought back by telling
the Israeli tax authorities that they should check NDS' books.
Seventy-five inspectors raided the NDS offices. Eventually, News
Corp. paid $3 million to the Israeli tax authorities, saying it
wanted to "terminate the uncertainties and the exaggerated rumors"
that the case had been spawning.</TE>
<TE>   In an NDS safe, the tax inspectors found something not so simply
dealt with: numerous tapes of conversations between Clinger and his
lawyers long after he had left NDS. News Corp. denied that it had
done any wiretapping of its former executive and asserted that the
tapes had been planted by Clinger to frame NDS.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud case, argued in an English court, went badly for
Clinger, ending in 1998 with a judgment that he was "a skillful liar"
who owed News Corp. and NDS nearly $50 million--a judgment that has
not been paid.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, as the world moved toward digital
entertainment, investors figured that a company selling encryption
devices would be a big winner. Late in 1999, News Corp. sold 20% of
NDS to the public. Within a few months, the value of the company
exceeded $5 billion. Among NDS' big clients were News Corp.'s British
Sky Broadcasting Group and DirecTV, a leading U.S. satellite TV
operator.</TE>
<TE>   As NDS' stock was peaking, Vivendi was having massive problems
with piracy. The smart cards made by its Canal Plus division powered
12 million set-top boxes, mostly for European television systems
owned by its parent.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, for instance, Canal Plus technology was used by Telepiu,
a digital system controlled by Vivendi. News Corp. controlled the
competing platform, Stream.</TE>
<TE>   As the companies fought for a commanding lead, their losses
mounted. The biggest financial drain for Telepiu was freeloaders.
When a new subscriber was buying a satellite dish and set-top box,
the vendor would often sweeten the deal by telling the subscriber
whom to call for a cheap counterfeit card.</TE>
<TE>   Telepiu canceled its contracts with a quarter of its vendors, but
that did little to stem the tide of piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, Canal Plus began to track the problem to its source.
There were so many counterfeit cards, not only in Italy but
elsewhere, that the company was facing claims from its clients for
compensation. Competitors were pointing out that Canal Plus couldn't
guarantee the integrity of its system, an alarming charge to make
against a security company. Full-scale disaster loomed.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus' investigation ultimately yielded a date, March 26,
1999, and a Canadian Web site, DR7.com. It was then and there, Canal
Plus says, that its secret code was revealed for the world's
counterfeiters to see and exploit.</TE>
<TE>   But someone had to crack the code in the first place. Canal Plus
maintains that this would have been very difficult. In the first
three years it sold the cards, it says, they were never successfully
hacked on a widespread basis.</TE>
<TE>   Further investigation, Canal Plus says in its suit, led to Haifa,
Israel, and the NDS lab. There, Canal Plus alleges, NDS engineers
spent part of 1997 and all of 1998 in a $5-million effort to crack
the cards and extract the software code, using such techniques as
microprobing, laser cutting and focused ion-beam manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations that the Haifa lab had extracted the code came from
Oliver Kommerling, a consultant whose company, Advanced Digital
Security Research, was partly owned by NDS.</TE>
<TE>   "These efforts and the results were put into a written document
and circulated among some NDS employees," Kommerling stated in a
court declaration, adding that he also had a copy of it.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus even believed it had found an NDS employee who posted
the code on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The director of security for Canal Plus Technologies, Gilles
Kaehlin, said in a court filing that he had met with Christopher
Tarnovsky, an NDS employee at its U.S. headquarters in Newport Beach
whom he identified as "a well-known 'pirate' within the hacker
community." Using a "nonverbal method of communication," Tarnovsky
admitted sending the code to the DR7 Web site, Kaehlin alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Why Tarnovsky should so readily incriminate himself is unclear,
but Kaehlin added that the hacker indicated he might switch sides.</TE>
<TE>   "He promised me that he would tell the truth to the court if he
were called to testify but that he would not be the 'whistle-blower'
on NDS' illegal activities, because he ... feared too much for his
life and that of his family," Kaehlin said in the declaration.</TE>
<TE>   In its lawsuit, Canal Plus accuses NDS of unfair competition,
flouting copyright, racketeering and violating the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, which criminalizes the cracking of encryption devices
in order to circumvent them.</TE>
<TE>   The case was filed as the satellite TV companies, if not winning
against hackers, at least seemed to be fighting them to a draw. But
the Canal Plus suit undermined any notion of progress against
pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have one of the largest media companies in the world
actively working against the copyright holders, the digital future
doesn't have a prayer," said Chenoweth, the Murdoch biographer. "This
suit is really about the future shape of the media industry."</TE>
<TE>   NDS not only denied any involvement in the hack, it offered to the
court some theories about what really happened. Canal Plus cards were
hacked long before any code was posted to DR7.com, NDS said. They
were vulnerable because they were junk, it added.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what really transpired, NDS says: Four months before the
suit was filed, Canal Plus approached NDS about a merger. At the same
time, it privately accused NDS of compromising Canal Plus' smart
cards.</TE>
<TE>   The accusation, NDS says, was an extortion attempt: Canal Plus
would go public with the charge unless NDS paid an "outrageous"
acquisition price. Now that the merger negotiations had fallen apart,
Canal Plus was merely doing what it threatened. NDS was the victim
here, not the villain.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as an aside, NDS wondered on what grounds it was being
sued. Why, it asked, does "United States law govern the actions of
engineers in Israel employed by an English company to
reverse-engineer the [code] in a smart card created by and for a
French company"? It asked the judge to drop the case.</TE>
<TE>   Court Skirmishes</TE>
<TE>   NDS might have said the Canal Plus suit was without merit, but its
stockholders fled. On March 12, the day the suit was filed, NDS
shares plunged 25%. It closed Wednesday at $9.87, up 57 cents, on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In early court skirmishes, Canal Plus maintained that the case was
so "clear-cut and shocking" that it warranted the unusual legal step
of expedited discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at the beginning of the summer, Vivendi, Canal Plus'
debt-laden parent, began to fall apart. To raise money, it had to
shed assets. First on the block was its Italian pay-TV division,
Telepiu.</TE>
<TE>   If the need for a sale wasn't a surprise, the prospective buyer
was one that Canal Plus executives must have found galling: their
hated foe, News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   One condition was attached to the purchase: Drop the suit.</TE>
<TE>   After Vivendi CEO Messier was forced out on July 1, the company
also sought a buyer for Canal Plus Technologies. At one point, NDS
Chief Executive Abraham Peled told a British newspaper that he was
interested. "It's all a question of the right price," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ending might almost have been foretold from the beginning.
First pirates had destroyed Canal Plus and Telepiu. Now News Corp.
had a chance to pick up the pieces on the cheap. When the deals were
done, it would have no satellite competition in Italy and only one
remaining smart-card rival, the Swiss Kudelski Group.</TE>
<TE>   If Vivendi had fewer counterfeiters, one observer said, Messier
might have avoided seeing the dismemberment of his company, the loss
of his job and the triumph of Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make a [revenue] forecast and it's not reached because
you have a piracy rate of 35% instead of 10%, it means you're not
reliable," said Davide Rossi, secretary general of the European Assn.
for the Protection of Encrypted Works and Services, a trade group
that both Canal Plus and NDS belong to. "Your partners may not be
willing to support your other provisions."</TE>
<TE>   The Telepiu sale has not gone through. Neither has any deal been
announced for Canal Plus. As a result, the lawsuit has come back to
life. On Aug. 15, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker slightly narrowed
the case but declined to either move it or drop it, as NDS wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Canal Plus' assertions about how "no person or company is
above the law," legal experts and industry sources close to the case
say its interest is more tactical than ethical. When the suit's
utility as a bargaining chip is over, they expect it to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kommerling, the consultant whose company is partly
owned by NDS, has paid a price for coming forward with allegations
against NDS.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours after NDS saw his critical declaration, Kommerling
was locked out of his offices, which adjoin the NDS headquarters in
an outer London suburb. He is suing NDS for wrongful interference,
but at the moment has little recourse except to walk away from his
own company.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regret it," said Kommerling. "Given the circumstances, it
was the only way to go. When I have spent all of my money in legal
costs, I'll still have my integrity and skills and that's the
important thing."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Kommerling, NDS declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>2 Indicted in Probe of WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Court filing indicates that two other officers
may help U.S. prosecutors build case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two former top executives of WorldCom Inc. were indicted Wednesday on
securities fraud and other charges, widening the federal government's
efforts to prosecute alleged accounting fraud at the fallen
telecommunications giant.</LD>
<LD>   The move is seen as a key step as the government works to build a
case against former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers, legal
experts said, although Ebbers' lawyers contend that he had no
knowledge of the accounting scheme under which profit was allegedly
inflated by billions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors accused Scott D. Sullivan, the 40-year-old
former chief financial officer of WorldCom, and Buford Yates Jr., the
company's former director of general accounting, of directing a
two-year scheme to conceal $3.9 billion in company expenses and boost
profit.</LD>
<TE>   The 24-page indictment also names two other WorldCom accounting
executives, Betty Vinson and Troy Normand, as unindicted
co-conspirators. However, court documents filed Wednesday indicate
that Vinson and Normand--along with former WorldCom Controller David
Myers--are prepared to plead guilty and cooperate with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   If fraud is proved, it would be the largest accounting scandal in
U.S. history. WorldCom, the once-highflying telecommunications giant
that carries nearly half of the country's Internet traffic, owns MCI,
the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said he intended for the indictments to
send a "clear message" to deter corporate lawbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's indictments ... are the result of sustained law
enforcement actions aimed at prosecuting corporate lawbreakers and
protecting the savings and pensions of Americans," Ashcroft said.
"With each arrest, indictment and prosecution, we send this clear
message: Corrupt corporate executives will be punished."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who was arrested Aug. 1 along with Myers, allegedly
conspired with Yates to instruct subordinates to hide WorldCom's
mushrooming expenses by capitalizing them--improperly shifting costs
from operating to capital expenses--thus reducing reported expenses
and artificially inflating profit.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven-count indictment by a federal grand jury in New York,
prosecutors allege that the scheme began taking shape about three
years ago when WorldCom entered a large number of long-term lease
agreements with other carriers to amass additional network capacity
for an anticipated explosion in Internet traffic. That growth failed
to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, many of the leases required WorldCom
to make upfront payments to other carriers regardless of whether
WorldCom actually used the additional capacity. Before the summer of
2000, WorldCom treated these payments as operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But as the number of carrier leases climbed and became a
significant expense, WorldCom did an about-face and began to
capitalize the costs.</TE>
<TE>   By ordering subordinates to carry out the change, the indictment
says, Sullivan and Yates "engaged in an illegal scheme to ... falsely
and fraudulently" boost WorldCom's reported earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The moves allegedly allowed WorldCom to report to investors that
its expenses were about 40% of company revenue from 1999 through
2001, even though the actual figure in the third year was closer to
50%.</TE>
<TE>   "As Sullivan, Myers, Yates, Vinson and Normand well knew, there
was no justification in fact or under generally accepted accounting
principles for these entries," the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's accounting problems first surfaced in late June, when
the company was forced to restate its earnings and admit that it
wrongly listed $3.9 billion as capital expenses in 2001 and 2002.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, WorldCom submitted the biggest bankruptcy filing in
U.S. history. Since then, the company has disclosed an additional
$3.3 billion in inflated profit.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, Yates and their alleged co-conspirators "were able to
assure that WorldCom's reported earnings exceeded its actual earnings
for the period from October 2000 through April 2002 by approximately
$5 billion," says the indictment, which does not mention Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who is free on $10-million bail and is facing a prison
sentence of up to 65 years if convicted on charges of securities
fraud, conspiracy and filing false statements, could not be reached
for comment. Sullivan's attorney, Irv Nathan, has said his client was
a victim of "a rush to judgment."</TE>
<TE>   David Schertler, a Washington lawyer who represents Yates, said he
was surprised by the indictment of his client.</TE>
<TE>   "It came totally out of left field," said Schertler, who added
that Yates worked two levels below Sullivan in the corporate
hierarchy and reported to then-WorldCom Controller Myers, 44.
Schertler declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit of top WorldCom executives has consumed law
enforcement officials who have been looking to crack down on a wave
of corporate financial scandals that began late last year when
evidence surfaced that energy trader Enron Corp. used off-the-books
partnerships to hide its deteriorating financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   But the government's complex case against Enron has produced only
a single guilty plea and no criminal indictments of top executives.</TE>
<TE>   The case against Sullivan and Yates also could prove difficult for
prosecutors, some experts said. That's because the accounting
standards they are alleged to have violated are not clear cut.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a gray area and it is not entirely clear that what they
did was wrong," said Joshua Ronen, an accounting professor at New
York University who has served as an expert witness in a variety of
securities litigation cases.</TE>
<TE>   One source close to the Justice Department said the government has
amassed considerable evidence, and noted that Yates and Sullivan
would face trial in New York, where a jury would be likely to include
at least some pensioners, investors or telecom employees angry about
what has happened.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't a close call at all," said Scott E. Cleland, a
telecom expert and analyst at the Precursor Group, a Washington
research firm, referring to the alleged wrongdoing. "This was way
over the line."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment against Sullivan came after plea bargain talks
apparently broke off. It is not known which side terminated the
talks. But their end sets the stage for a criminal case that could
have repercussions for corporate bookkeeping and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The WorldCom scandal has [already] gotten Congress to pass the
corporate reform bill," Cleland said. The legislative reforms and
legal case against Sullivan and Yates should serve as notice that
"there is zero sympathy in Washington for the distant CEO who says,
'I wasn't aware of any fraud going on.' "</TE>
<TE>   The indictments came amid disclosures that brokerage Salomon Smith
Barney directed shares in hot initial public offerings in the late
1990s to former top WorldCom executives, including Ebbers. Congress
is probing whether Salomon awarded those shares in an attempt to gain
lucrative investment banking business.</TE>

<HD>Compton Insider Gets a Bargain</HD>
<DH>Development: Politician pays millions less for city parcel
than its appraised value, records show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton has agreed to sell some of its best city-owned land to a
well-connected politician for millions of dollars less than it is
worth, city and county records and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the deal, Paul Richards, who has no experience
as a developer, would put up none of his own money. Instead, the city
would lend him $1.6 million, which would cover the purchase price of
the land and nearly half a million dollars in planning costs. He
would have to repay only the loans--without interest--when he sold
the 231 houses he plans to build.</LD>
<LD>   Richards is a longtime councilman in Lynwood, which is next to
Compton, and an important member of a network of allies who have held
political posts and public-sector jobs in both cities.</LD>
<TE>   Before and during his tenure as a Lynwood council member, Richards
served for years as an assistant city manager in Compton and as a
labor negotiator for the city as well as a paid advisor to the
Compton Community College board. He is a political ally of former
Compton Mayor Omar Bradley, who, in turn, has worked as an
administrator for Lynwood's schools.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley lost his reelection effort last year, but his allies still
control Compton's City Council. Richards negotiated the deal during
Bradley's administration, and the council unanimously approved it in
January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Charges of cronyism have for years been a feature of Compton, a
working-class city of 93,000 residents, most of them black or Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The land, which is vacant, is at the end of an industrial and
commercial corridor along the Artesia Freeway. The parcel, about 20
acres, is bordered by the Alameda Corridor on the east, the Blue Line
on the west, the Crystal Park hotel and casino on the south, and
Greenleaf Boulevard on the north. In a recent interview, Bradley
cited the property as the city's most valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Richards defended the deal, saying his ties to Bradley and his
allies brought him no special treatment. It is not unusual for cities
to discount land sold for redevelopment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, a lawyer who was raised in Compton, said he has
exceptional qualifications other than development experience
including "a unique understanding of the desires and expectations of
Compton residents" and "a blend of experience that surpasses what
anybody brings to the table."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's successor as mayor, Eric Perrodin, has repeatedly
denounced the arrangement, asking: "How come we're giving him money
to develop that property? How come we can't get developers who will
spend their own money?"</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, even told
a council meeting that he believes that "somebody's getting a
kickback" on Richards' "sweetheart deal." He offered no evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is investigating allegations of
misuse of public funds in the city. There is no evidence that
Richards' project is part of that investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin has not had the votes to kill the project, although it
has been delayed by administrative moves.</TE>
<TE>   When the council approved the $1.6-million price for the land, it
did not publicly disclose that a 1997 appraisal conducted for the
city had placed the property's value at $3.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Richards' purchase price reflected the approximate assessed value
set by Los Angeles County for property tax purposes. That assessment
was made in 1975, and has been increased only by the 1% annual hike
allowed under Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   The county assessor's office said last week that sale prices of
Compton real estate had soared by comparison, increasing more than
fivefold since 1975.</TE>
<TE>   If the market-price increase were applied to Richards' land, it
would now be worth about $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   No Track Record</TE>
<TE>   That matches what Jerry Evans, president of the commercial real
estate firm Lee &amp; Associates- South Bay Inc. said he thinks the
parcel would be worth.</TE>
<TE>   The market value would be four to six times what Compton, a city
struggling with budget problems, was asking Richards to pay, Evans
estimated.</TE>
<TE>   Compton never tested the land's market value by asking other
developers how much they would pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of people with expertise in redevelopment said such
tests are desirable but not required by California law.</TE>
<TE>   They added that although it is not unusual for cities to make land
available to developers at reduced costs in redevelopment deals, it
is unusual for a developer to get such a deal when he has no track
record. It also is unusual for a city to assume a project's early
financial risks as in this case.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Compton City Council has twice approved the loan to
cover Richards' predevelopment costs, the city attorney has held it
up, saying he is worried that the city might not be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   All other projects in the city have had substantial outside
financial backing, City Atty. Legrand Clegg II told the council
recently. Richards has not submitted proof that he can repay the loan
if his project fails, Clegg said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's failure to issue Richards his predevelopment check
prompted him to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Compton.</TE>
<TE>   He said in an interview that he has moved ahead in planning the
project without the city's money and has by now incurred more than $1
million in costs.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say how he planned to pay them.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported two weeks ago that in Lynwood, Richards last
year voted for the city to pay his sister up to $1 million for
negotiating a billboard deal that correspondence showed he already
had in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Her payday was imperiled by last November's election. Although
Richards won reelection, he lost an ally who had given him a
three-vote City Council majority. The new majority voted to cancel
his sister's no-bid contract; the matter is now in court.</TE>
<TE>   In his lawsuit against Compton, Richards is demanding that the
city release his loan funds and pay him $20 million in damages for
causing an "inexcusable delay" in the project.</TE>
<TE>   Richards has aspired to become a housing developer at the site at
least since 1999. That year, he proposed in writing that Compton
allow him to develop housing at four locations in the city, including
this parcel, known locally as the Auto Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Richards made the proposal as part of an effort to settle another
lawsuit he had filed against the city, alleging that he had been
wrongfully discharged from his job as a part-time labor negotiator,
earning $68,500 per year.</TE>
<TE>   Richards had served as Compton's assistant city manager for
several years but had quit to run for Congress in 1995, a bid that
was unsuccessful. He then got a two-year contract as a labor
negotiator. Compton officials declined to renew the contract in 1997
amid union complaints that Richards was often unavailable. That move
sparked his lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   After Bradley came to dominate the City Council, the suit was
settled for $350,000, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Bradley and his allies had suggested paying Richards
nearly $1.4 million to settle the case, according to the city's
outside trial counsel, Nelson Atkins.</TE>
<TE>   That plan was abandoned after Atkins wrote a confidential letter
to the City Council saying that if it approved a settlement that
large, it might be held liable for making an improper "gift of public
funds."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, Richards' proposal to become a housing
developer was dropped. But about the same time, Compton's city
manager began talking up the idea of bringing upscale housing to the
city, Lawrence Adams, a city administrator, later told the City
Council. Compton is one of the poorest cities in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The city then began negotiating exclusively with Richards to
develop such housing, priced from $170,000 to $240,000, Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   The median sale price for a house in Compton in July was $142,500,
according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc. of La Jolla, which
tracks completed sales.</TE>
<TE>   Richards and Bradley have touted the housing plan as a way to
boost the city's ability to attract more upscale residents, who would
in turn act as a magnet for fancier stores and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Richards said he has had this idea for 20 years. "Cities like
Compton die because of the lack of repatriation of human capital," he
said, referring to upwardly mobile young people who have left for
lack of high-grade housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Financial capital will follow human capital," Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Compton's written redevelopment guidelines call for a potential
developer to put up earnest money when exclusive negotiations begin,
but officials did not require this of Richards.</TE>
<TE>   He and city staff negotiated a deal calling for the city to
advance him the full purchase price of the land in the form of two
loans--one for $1.15 million and the other, the predevelopment loan,
for $485,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to repaying the loans, the deal also calls for
Richards to split with the city certain net profits from the sale of
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Richards has presented the terms as a benefit to Compton.
"Generally, citizens are asked to pay, but never see the rewards of
the development," Richards told the City Council in seeking approval
of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he said, he and the city will be 50-50 partners.</TE>
<TE>   He did not explain that the 99-page agreement with the city
ensures that he will receive nearly $6 million in management and
"preferred profit return" fees before he begins splitting any
remaining profits with the city.</TE>
<TE>   Some council members who voted to approve the agreement seemed
unfamiliar with it.</TE>
<TE>   But even if they had read it, they might have been confused.</TE>
<TE>   Clarifying Boundaries</TE>
<TE>   The officially recorded version mentions two different amounts for
the predevelopment loan and provides two different schedules for its
repayment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, city administrators asked the City Council to
eliminate these contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, they asked and the council agreed to clarify the
physical boundaries of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement Richards negotiated with the city called for him to
receive 25 acres of city-owned land.</TE>
<TE>   However, before the council approved that deal, city administrator
Adams told members that the city might have to hold back five acres
for a project of its own.</TE>
<TE>   He asked that the council leave exact boundaries up to
administrators, who then recorded a document that omitted the five
acres.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, administrators got the council to restore the
acreage to Richards' project at no additional charge.</TE>

<HD>To D.C., Olympics Loss Is Another Hard-Luck Tale</HD>
<DH>Capital: The foreign policy of the federal city sinks any
efforts to be a normal town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This is a city that just can't catch a break.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists attack the United States--and bellhops and waitresses
in Washington go unemployed as tourism in the nation's capital
collapses to its lowest levels since the Depression.</LD>
<LD>   Someone fires a gun at the White House--and the Secret Service
closes Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular travel, snarling traffic and
imprisoning the city's Beaux Arts architecture behind barricades.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the U.S. Olympic Committee has rejected Washington's bid to
host the 2012 Olympics because, Washington organizers of the effort
say, the European-dominated International Olympic Committee would not
smile on an application from a city planning an unpopular war against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, it seems, the foreign policy of the federal city has
torpedoed the well-meaning, painstaking efforts of Washington to act
like a normal town.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned by the reversal, local officials Wednesday bravely talked
of the good that had already been accomplished, the "legacy" of
cooperation between Washington and Baltimore, which was the
co-applicant in the bid, and the spirit of camaraderie and goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember Washington and Baltimore working together this
closely since the War of 1812," said Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley,
who is 39.</TE>
<TE>   Through the civic smiles, it was hard to hide the disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to reconcile the fact that we had such a strong
technical bid with the decision not to move us forward," said Dan
Knise, one of the torch carriers for Washington's six-year,
$10-million Olympic campaign. "We always knew that Washington had a
unique position, pro and con. But we were somewhat blindsided at the
end by this amorphous sense that Washington might not be the right
place."</TE>
<TE>   Tough Opponents Seen</TE>
<TE>   In making its decision Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic Committee
eliminated bids from Houston and the Washington-Baltimore region,
leaving alive the hopes of San Francisco and New York to be the U.S.
choice to host the 2012 event. Even at that, the U.S. choice faces
stiff opposition from several European cities, among them Paris, Rome
and Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. committee will announce its final selection Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the U.S. committee said only that the narrowing of the
U.S. field was a consensus choice. Unofficially, according to leaders
of the Washington-Baltimore team, there was sentiment among committee
members that offering Washington as the U.S. choice might inflame the
anti-American bias of Europeans distrustful of President Bush's
drumbeating for ousting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   And, the committee was still smarting at the treatment Congress
meted out to then-IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch three years
ago over the lavish excesses of the international Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess if being honest and truthful and calling them as you see
them gives them a bad taste, then it gives them a bad taste," said
Joe Barton, the feisty Republican congressman from Texas who grilled
Samaranch particularly hard during congressional testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Some Washington observers were not surprised that the city--with
its diverse neighborhoods, its cultural wealth, its international
flavor and its economic vibrancy--was once again confused with the
governmental policies of the "other" Washington, the seat of federal
power.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case where the evaluation of the Washington area as an
appropriate venue was clouded by its role as the focal point for the
federal government and U.S. policy in the world," said Stephen S.
Fuller, an economist at George Mason University in Virginia who has
made the region's fiscal health a centerpiece of his scholarship.
"San Francisco or New York are viewed more as world-class cities.
They are in the United States, but it doesn't taint them in the same
way Washington is tainted."</TE>
<TE>   Parallels to Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Fuller likens the rejection to the repeated cold shoulder
Washington has received from organized baseball, which has expanded
its roster of teams to places such as Tampa Bay and Denver but won't
give the time of day to Washington, which boasts the fourth-strongest
economy in the nation after New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a $250-billion economy, with 3.5 million jobs and 5
million people," Fuller said of the Washington region, which takes in
the wealthy and housing-market-hot areas of suburban Virginia and
Maryland. "But advertisers discount us too. Maybe it's because the
buildings don't stick up above the trees."</TE>
<TE>   The buildings may indeed be part of the problem. Ever since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, security has defined Washington. Guards are on
round-the-clock patrol, metal detectors block entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Tours at the Capitol and the White House, among the most popular
of Washington's attractions, are now restricted. The
Smithsonian--that national jewel of museums from the National Zoo to
the Air and Space Museum--is suffering a 30% decline in visitors. And
the broad avenues envisioned by Pierre L'Enfant as a tribute to the
capital's majesty are all but encased in stone.</TE>
<TE>   Still, city officials--who periodically petition Congress to make
the District of Columbia the 51st state, with voting rights and
powers of taxation--are not ungrateful for the shared history.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that we are the nation's capital, and we're
delighted," said John Koskinen, deputy mayor and city administrator.
Acknowledging that city officials were surprised by the Olympic
Committee's decisions--"we thought all our embassies gave us a leg
up"--Koskinen put the relationship in perspective. "There are
challenges," he said, "but we wouldn't trade with anybody."</TE>

<HD>6 Men Charged in 9/11 Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Grand juries in Detroit, Seattle return findings
against alleged Islamic militants. One of the men named is second
American tied to attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Grand juries in Seattle and Detroit charged six alleged Islamic
militants Wednesday with supporting global terrorist activities,
including a U.S. citizen accused of providing safe houses and
training to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   The indictments escalate the legal battle against terrorism,
bringing to nine the number of alleged terrorists charged in U.S.
courts since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   One of the men charged Wednesday, James Ujaama of Seattle, was the
second American indicted as a result of the Sept. 11 investigation.
The other, John Walker Lindh, pleaded guilty last month to taking up
arms as a Taliban soldier and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   "The material support for terrorism has to be regarded as serious
as terrorism itself," said Charles Mandigo, the head of the FBI's
Seattle field office, where Ujaama was investigated and indicted. All
but one of the men were in custody.</TE>
<TE>   There was no coordination between the separate prosecutorial
actions, authorities said, but they came after months of growing
controversy over the Justice Department's continued detention of
suspects held since Sept. 11 without having charges filed against
them. Even so, Justice Department officials in Washington had little
to say, citing a gag order in one of the cases and the continuing
counter-terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to let the indictments speak for themselves," one Justice
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Both indictments were voluminous, and alleged that militants
nestled within the Islamic communities of those cities operated
"sleeper cells" that had been plotting to help launch terrorist
attacks here and overseas as part of a jihad, or holy war, against
the United States and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   When they were arrested, the men named in the Detroit indictment
had in their possession "surveillance" videotape footage of
Disneyland in California and the MGM Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas,
the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, authorities in Germany indicted a man already in
custody there on charges of aiding the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said Wednesday that they were trying
to get more information about that case against Mounir Motassadeq, a
28-year-old Moroccan who lived in Hamburg along with several of the
hijackers. They declined to elaborate, as they may try to extradite
and prosecute Motassadeq, who will face trial in Germany first
because of what officials there described as "his participation in
the terror attacks."</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, a federal grand jury indicted Ujaama on charges of
providing the Al Qaeda terrorist network with "training, facilities,
computer services, safe houses, and personnel" as part of a
conspiracy to "destroy property and murder and maim persons located
outside the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama told associates he had attended Al Qaeda training camps,
the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Ujaama, 36, was accused in the two-count indictment of trying to
set up a "jihad training camp" in rural Oregon in 1999 and of leading
discussions there and in Seattle about the need "to attend violent
jihad training camps in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleged that Ujaama talked about how to poison an
unsuspecting public, commit armed robberies, build underground
bunkers to hide weapons and firebomb cars.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Daniel Sears, accused the government of abusing its
authority by holding Ujaama for more than a month as a material
witness. Ujaama, who was taken into custody July 22, repeatedly has
denied having ties to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have broken any laws and am guilty of crimes against the
American people, then I must be held accountable," Ujaama said in a
statement Tuesday. "The fact is that I am innocent of any wrongdoing
and am fully prepared to face my accusers and defend myself in a
court of law."</TE>
<TE>   Born James Earnest Thompson, Ujaama is one of two brothers from
Seattle who converted to Islam and, according to the FBI, became
militants bent on aiding terrorists. He has spent much of the last
few years in Denver and London, where he became a follower of Sheik
Abu Hamza Al Masry, a radical Muslim cleric suspected of being a
major Al Qaeda recruiter, according to FBI documents.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI suspects that Ujaama provided Al Qaeda and the ruling
Taliban regime in Afghanistan with laptop computers and other
assistance before Sept. 11 as well.</TE>
<TE>   In its indictment of Ujaama, the grand jury detailed the
activities of three unnamed co-conspirators who have not been
charged. U.S. law enforcement officials identified the men as Abu
Hamza and two associates, and said that they are under active
investigation for plotting terrorist attacks as well.</TE>
<TE>   In the Detroit indictment, the five men face charges of conspiracy
to provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization
linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The men, whom authorities say have lived in the United States
since at least 2000, were charged with operating a "sleeper" cell
that operated as "a covert underground support unit for terrorist
attacks within and outside the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The men were identified as Karim Koubriti, Ahmed Hannan, Farouk
Ali-Haimoud, Youssef Hmimssa and a fifth man, known only as Abdella,
with several aliases but no known given name. All but Hmimssa were
accused of forming an agreement to provide a variety of services to a
terrorist organization known only as "the brothers"--a common term
among jihadists for supporters of the militant cause.</TE>
<TE>   The men, all from North African countries, were accused of trying
to "directly access airlines" by finding security breaches at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport. Some worked in the kitchen of an airline
catering firm, while others were experts in the use of fake IDs and
calling cards. At least one received funds and consulted with a
network of other "brothers" in Europe linked to a fundamentalist
Islamic religious movement called Salafiyya, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   The men conspired to help Islamic militants here and abroad in a
jihad that would have included terrorist attacks in the United
States, Jordan, Turkey and other countries allied with the U.S., the
indictment said. Specifically, it said the men conspired to cause
economic harm to U.S. businesses and to provide personnel,
indoctrination, recruitment and training, safe houses, mail drops,
"intelligence target data collection," weapons, false documentation
and identification and other covert assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The men were charged with four counts of providing material
support to terrorists, conspiracy to engage in fraud and misuse of
visas, permits and other identification documents and related
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the men were held soon after Sept. 11, while the man
identified as Abdella remains a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment did not spell out any specific charges against
Hmimssa because he is cooperating in the investigation, a federal law
enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach lawyers for the men were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the six suspects indicted Wednesday and Lindh, two
other men have been charged in U.S. terrorism-related cases. Zacarias
Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, faces trial Jan. 6
as the only person charged in the United States in direct connection
with the Sept. 11 attacks, and Richard C. Reid, a Briton accused of
trying to blow up a plane by detonating explosives in his shoes, is
to go on trial Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Two other U.S. citizens, Yaser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, are
being held in military lock-ups as "enemy combatants."</TE>

<HD>Congress Wants In on War Debate</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bush team presses the Iraq issue as returning
lawmakers seek to play a bigger role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) headed home for Congress'
summer recess, he was armed for a slew of town meetings to discuss
the future of Social Security--a favorite topic for Democrats this
election year.</LD>
<LD>   But Matsui soon found his constituents had another issue on their
minds: They peppered him with questions about the growing prospects
that President Bush will launch a military attack against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   ''It's dominating the discussion back home,'' Matsui said.</LD>
<TE>   And it's likely to dominate Capitol Hill when lawmakers reconvene
in Washington next week--a big change from when Congress left town
for its monthlong break. At that point, a U.S. attack on Iraq seemed
a somewhat vague possibility; since then, top administration
officials have been aggressively pressing the argument for going to
war.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are increasingly worried about whether they can get a
word in edgewise in this rapidly escalating debate. They already are
bridling at administration lawyers, who argue that Bush is not
legally bound to seek congressional approval to launch an attack.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sure bet returning members of Congress will be demanding
more information and consultation from the administration about its
Iraqi policy. Although there are precious few voices flatly opposing
an attack, many lawmakers are urging the administration to do more to
explain why military action is needed--even after Vice President Dick
Cheney earlier this week laid out the case for a preemptive strike.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's got to be more of that,'' said Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.), noting that polls show support for sending U.S. ground
troops to oust Saddam Hussein dropped to 53% of those polled in
Gallup's latest survey--down from 74% in November.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with several members of Congress around the country
indicate that Bush still has a lot of work to do to win the support
of voters--even in Republican-dominated districts.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Shelly Moore Capito (R-W. Va.) estimated that 80% of the
voters she has asked think the president's approach to Iraq is too
bellicose.</TE>
<TE>   ''They don't find a compelling reason for us to go into Iraq at
this time,'' said Capito, who benefited from Bush's coattails when
she narrowly won her first term in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated congressional debate should expose divisions
within the GOP that mirror the splits within the Bush administration
between those who are clamoring for action--the sooner the
better--and more cautious Republicans who remain unconvinced that an
attack on Iraq is the best way to topple Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Among Democrats, meanwhile, the Iraq issue poses distinct
political challenges. Most Democrats remain loath to openly oppose a
popular president on his foreign policy; senior party strategists
predict that if it came to a vote, Bush would easily win approval of
using force against Iraq. But like Matsui, many Democrats have been
hearing from constituents who are cool or even hostile to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some Democrats are concerned that a full-blown debate on
Iraq could undercut their party's focus on other issues--such as the
economy--that they want to keep front and center as the November
elections near.</TE>
<TE>   ''I take the threat posed by Iraq seriously, and I think we need a
regime change,'' said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). ''But we also need
an economic strategy and a homeland security strategy. We risk both
of those if all the attention and money moves to Iraq.''</TE>
<TE>   Bush says he has not decided yet whether to invade Iraq to topple
Hussein, despite recent comments from Cheney and other hawkish
members of the administration that have made a strike seem
practically inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has promised to consult with Congress before he takes such as
step. But that process got off to a rocky start when word leaked this
week that White House lawyers believe Bush would not need
congressional approval because, they argue, the 1991 congressional
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq when Bush's
father was president still applied.</TE>
<TE>   That ruffled feathers in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   ''If that's the case, I would caution the Vietnamese because that
means the Tonkin Gulf resolution still applies,'' said McCain,
referring to the measure that authorized U.S. involvement in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), a fierce defender of congressional
prerogatives, called the White House argument a ''power grab.''</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, agreed that technically Bush would not be
legally bound to seek congressional approval to use force against
Iraq. But Hyde, a strong Bush ally, said it was politically essential
to get a popular mandate from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   ''On an issue as important as this, Congress has time for a debate
and a vote,'' Hyde said.</TE>
<TE>   A sure sign of the growing spotlight on Iraq is the growing clamor
for more hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde is planning hearings on the issue in September, but is still
negotiating with the administration about which witnesses will be
called.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the top Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, on Wednesday called for hearings, saying
''the crescendo of debate on Iraq has reached an extraordinary
level'' in Congress' absence.</TE>
<TE>   The administration, which is seeking to quell criticism that it
wants to bypass Congress as it plots its Iraqi strategy, responded
favorably. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said congressional
hearings ''are part of a healthy discussion on how we move forward on
Iraq. And we look forward to participating and being cooperative with
Congress as those hearings are held.''</TE>
<TE>   The hawks in the Bush administration have an influential and vocal
congressional ally in House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), who in
a recent speech gave a spirited defense of the policy of preemptively
attacking Iraq--and a pointed rebuke to those who favor going slow in
dealing with Hussein to build a broader international coalition.</TE>
<TE>   ''These apologists for idleness would have us believe that
consensus is a first principle,'' DeLay said. ''But if we can't agree
that terrorists murdering innocent civilians should be actively
opposed, this path offers nothing but immobilizing confusion.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, many of those calling for caution are DeLay's GOP
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, ranking Republican on the
Foreign Relations Committee, has said the administration must work
harder at building support for possible military action. ''We must
develop a more certain road map for the American people,'' Lugar
wrote in a column for his hometown newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   And Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is battling for reelection,
voiced concern that ousting Hussein may not achieve the more
important goal of eliminating Iraq's capability to deploy weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think the administration's focus on Saddam Hussein is a
mistake,'' Collins told a home-state newspaper. ''Our focus ought to
be on the biological and chemical weapons in Iraq.''</TE>
<TE>   Doubts also have been raised by those with little to worry about
politically. Said Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), who faces no Democratic
opponent this fall, ''The president has not made the case with the
American people. There is still confusion and misunderstanding about
why he feels so strongly about this.''</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts say Iraq has not risen into the top tier of
campaign issues, but its prominence is clearly on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, a close Senate contest is still dominated by
pocketbook issues like health care and jobs. But Iraq came up in a
debate Tuesday between Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S. D.) and his GOP
opponent, Rep. John R. Thune (R-S. D.).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats may come under pressure this fall to mount more
aggressive opposition to an invasion. A case in point: A coalition of
peace activists in California on Wednesday held a news conference to
give Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) a ''thank you card'' for her
''leadership against the Bush administration's rush to war."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, said Feinstein spokesman Scott Berber, the senator has
not opposed the use of force; she has only sponsored a resolution
calling for Bush to seek congressional approval for any use of force.
''That is a long way from opposing a war,'' said Gerber.</TE>

<HD>Bronx Cheers Resound in Boston After Shutout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans booed the Boston Red Sox, and it didn't have anything to do with
a possible strike.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Mussina pitched a three-hitter and Bernie Williams hit a
three-run homer to help the New York Yankees beat Pedro Martinez and
the Red Sox, 7-0, Wednesday at Fenway Park in Boston.</LD>
<LD>   New York shut out the Red Sox for the second consecutive game.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no question it's going to take a big chunk of their heart
away from them," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said after Boston lost its
final game before the strike deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The win gave New York a season-high nine-game lead in the American
League East. Boston failed to gain on the Angels in the wild-card
race.</TE>
<TE>   Mussina (16-7), who came within one strike of a perfect game at
Fenway last September before finishing with a one-hitter, struck out
nine and walked one for his first shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox committed three errors--two in the first inning as the
Yankees touched Martinez (17-4) for an unearned run.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez gave up three earned runs, five hits and a season-high
four walks. He struck out nine before leaving down, 2-0, with two on
and one out in the seventh. The Yankees extended the lead in the
inning after Williams homered off reliever Alan Embree for a 5-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Seattle 1--Torii Hunter hit a two-run homer to help
Johan Santana out-duel Joel Pineiro, and the Twins beat the slumping
Mariners at Minneapolis. Bret Boone homered for the Mariners, who
have lost four of five and 13 of 22. If a strike ends the regular
season Friday, the Mariners would be out of the playoffs for the
first time since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's homer in the sixth was all Santana (8-5) needed. He gave
up five hits, a run and three walks and struck out five in seven
innings before yielding to J.C. Romero, who loaded the bases in the
eighth on two singles and a walk.</TE>
<TE>   But John Olerud grounded into a double play that ended the threat,
and Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 43 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro (13-5) lost for the first time in eight starts since July
16 against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 2, Detroit 1--Jim Thome homered twice and C.C. Sabathia
pitched seven solid innings to lead the Indians at Cleveland. Thome
was three for three with home runs in the second and sixth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Fryman, who announced before the game that he will retire
at the end of the season, was 0 for 3. Indians fans gave Fryman a
standing ovation in the top of the seventh following a video
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The five-time All-Star tipped his cap and Thome, John McDonald and
Omar Vizquel ran over from their positions in the infield to embrace
him.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (9-10) gave up a run on four hits and four walks,
striking out six. It was his first win in three starts. Danys Baez,
moved from the starting rotation to the closer role this week,
pitched the ninth for his first career save.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 5, Baltimore 3--Todd Hollandsworth and Ivan Rodriguez
homered, and Chan Ho Park struck out eight in seven innings to lead
the Rangers at Arlington, Texas. Park (6-6) won consecutive decisions
for the first time since signing a $65 million, five-year contract
with the Rangers last December. He gave up two runs and seven hits.</TE>
<TE>   The wins have come in the right-hander's first two starts since
coming off the 15-day disabled list because of a blister on the
middle finger of his pitching hand. He gave up two runs on seven hits
over six innings at Yankee Stadium last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Toronto 0--Jon Garland pitched a six-hitter for his
first career complete game and Magglio Ordonez homered twice to lead
the White Sox at Chicago. Garland (9-10), making his 56th career
start, struck out nine and walked one, allowing only three runners
past first base and one past second.</TE>

<HD>Zito Extends A's Win Streak to 15</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Oakland left-hander takes perfect game into sixth
inning before settling for a 7-1 victory over Kansas City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Barry Zito would have had an excuse if he seemed distracted.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Oakland Athletics' player representative took a
perfect game into the sixth inning as the Athletics won their 15th in
a row, 7-1, over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "Going out there in every start, there's always going to be stuff
in your personal life and your life on the field that you have to
block out," Zito said. "I felt like I did that tonight.</LD>
<TE>   The streak is the longest in the major leagues since Seattle won
15 in a row last season.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland completed its first 10-0 road trip, and the streak is the
A's longest since they won 17 in a row from May 5-25, 1931.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our situation as Oakland, but we have to put that aside
right now," Zito said. "If we had lost 15 in a row, we'd feel the
same way [about the strike]."</TE>
<TE>   Zito (19-5) gave up one run and four hits in seven innings. His
three strikeouts gave him 154, leaving him third in the American
League.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd got impatient early, starting chants of "Let them
strike!" and "Strike right now!" in the first inning, as the A's
jumped on starter Shawn Sedlacek.</TE>
<TE>   When reliever Jason Grimsley--the Royals' player
representative--entered the game in the top of the eighth, the crowd
booed him loudly.</TE>
<TE>   Sedlacek (3-4) gave up six runs on seven hits in the first inning,
then got things under control, allowing only two hits over the next
five innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a terrible first inning and took us out of the game right
off the bat," Sedlacek said. "It's not the way to go about it when
you have that good of a team and that good of a pitcher on the
mound."</TE>
<TE>   Seven different players drove in runs for the A's. Every starter
got a hit, with Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada getting two.</TE>
<TE>   Zito retired his first 16 batters. Neifi Perez singled to center
to break up the perfect game</TE>
<TE>   "You always know what's going on," Zito said. "I wasn't pitching
to maintain some kind of no-hitter. I left the ball up the middle and
Perez hit it up the middle. It was a good hit."</TE>
<TE>   The Royals loaded the bases after that. But Mike Sweeney grounded
out to short to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals finally scored in the seventh, when Kit Pellow grounded
into a double play, scoring Raul Ibanez.</TE>

<LD>Few people in baseball know how a work stoppage can damage a
franchise as well as Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman, who was the
Montreal Expos' vice president for baseball operations for 15
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Stoneman said the 1994 strike put the Expos in a tailspin they
have never recovered from, reaching the point where they were a
contraction candidate last winter.</LD>
<LD>   The Expos may have been the best team in baseball in 1994, with a
roster that included Moises Alou, Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill, Pedro
Martinez, Larry Walker and John Wetteland. They were eight games
ahead of the Atlanta Braves and pulling away in the NL East when the
strike hit.</LD>
<TE>   "We were running away," Stoneman said. "It was a lot of fun and
then it stopped."</TE>
<TE>   The strike did more than just derail their season. It made key
Expos exports before play resumed in 1995. Walker left as a free
agent and Hill, Grissom and Wetteland were traded.</TE>
<TE>   "The Expos never recovered," Stoneman said. "The work stoppage
cost the club $16 million-$17 million. When we added it all up, we
figured that was exactly what it was going to cost us to have Larry
Walker, Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill and John Wetteland. The team was
quickly very different and not as good."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman doesn't see the same potential for disaster with the
Angels if there is a strike this season.</TE>
<TE>   "The ownership is very different and much more stable," he said.
"This is a better baseball environment than Montreal. It is not fair
to draw comparisons."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, who has missed 15 games because of a bruise on his
left hand, did not call it a setback, but he was disappointed
Wednesday that his injury had not healed enough for him to return to
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon had a cortisone injection Friday and was told to remain
inactive for three to five days. Salmon went through hand exercises
Tuesday and swung a bat briefly Wednesday but felt no closer to
returning the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not healing by my timetable," Salmon said. "I feel like it
has gone from 10 to three, pain-wise.... I feel so much pressure to
push this thing and rightfully so. I should do everything I can to
get back into the lineup. But my goal is not just to play, it's to
play and be productive. I don't want to get back and just stink it up
for the final four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a nine-to-five job, I'd be just great. But I have to
pick up a bat and swing it."</TE>

<HD>Indians' Fryman Will Retire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cleveland Indian third baseman Travis Fryman, who has struggled most
of the year after off-season shoulder surgery, announced Wednesday
that he will retire at the end of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Fryman decided to make the announcement now because a strike could
make Wednesday night's game his last. He also thought the timing was
appropriate because the Indians were playing Detroit, where he
started his career and spent eight seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The players' association is set to strike Friday unless it has an
agreement for a labor contract, and the Indians are off today.</LD>
<TE>   Fryman was batting .214 with nine home runs and 47 RBIs before
Wednesday night's game, with a career average of .274 with 221 homers
and 1,014 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before what could be the final game of the season at Comiskey
Park, White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf addressed his team and
criticized his players' effort.</TE>
<TE>   "He feels that we haven't given any effort and it's embarrassing
the kind of year that we had," White Sox player representative Jeff
Liefer said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Brian Moehler, one of the Cincinnati Reds' July trade
acquisitions, was put on the 15-day disabled list because of a weak
shoulder.... Atlanta Brave right fielder Gary Sheffield is expected
to miss a week because of a sprained left thumb. Sheffield was
injured during batting practice Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Post-Tiger, Harmon Moves On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger and Butch, Butch and Tiger, it's always sounded like a couple
of characters from "The Little Rascals," hasn't it?</LD>
<LD>   Now that Tiger Woods has gone on record and officially said that
he's parting ways with coach Butch Harmon, or at least not using him
as much, it's officially the end of an era.</LD>
<LD>   This has been coming for a long time, so it can't be considered
much of a surprise anymore. In fact, it was a year ago at the PGA
Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club when it was reported that the
two were squabbling, which Woods and Harmon quickly denied.</LD>
<TE>   But insiders have been saying for months that the Woods-Harmon
relationship was indeed on rocky ground and now it has been
confirmed--by both parties.</TE>
<TE>   At this year's PGA Championship at Hazeltine, Woods said that his
relationship with Harmon had changed and he simply didn't need him to
be around as much anymore to help with his swing.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon didn't comment until this week and then refused to be drawn
into the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't see any reason to get involved in this and comment
any further," Harmon said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger's said enough, I think. It's not going to do anybody any
good to debate this thing, so I'm just going to be silent and leave
it alone."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon did say that he would be at the Ryder Cup next month at the
Belfry, in Sutton Coldfield, England. To work with Woods? That's not
probable. Harmon will be at the Ryder Cup to work as a commentator
for Sky TV.</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting to note that on the driving range the final day
at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn., Harmon was working with Justin
Leonard, not Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon has varied business interests, based around his golf school
at Rio Secco Golf Club in Las Vegas, so you have to figure that he
will be all right. And remember that Harmon also coaches Adam Scott,
the 22-year-old Australian who won the Scottish PGA Championship at
Gleneagles by 10 shots Sunday with a closing 63 and played the
par-fives in 22 under for the week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with Adam and proud of it," said Harmon. He is
also working with rookie pro Ben Crane, who tied for sixth last week
at the Reno-Tahoe Open and was second in May at the Byron Nelson
Classic. Crane is fifth on the PGA Tour in putting average.</TE>
<TE>   And as for a current swing influence on Tiger, you probably need
to look no further than Mark O'Meara, whose influence on Woods has
been steadily rising.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   He's resting. After finishing second in the PGA Championship and
fourth in the NEC Invitational in successive weeks (and banking
$809,000), Woods spent a day doing a corporate gig for Nike at
company headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., on Monday, and then started
a three-week vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Woods returns Sept. 19 at the $5-million American Express
Championship at Kilkenny, Ireland, and the Ryder Cup the next week at
the Belfry near Birmingham, England.</TE>
<TE>   That's Rich</TE>
<TE>   The headline from a www.canada.com news release on this week's PGA
Air Canada championship: "Fred Couples to play, Jim Beem turns down
the Air Canada Championship."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, fame is fleeting.</TE>
<TE>   Weight for This</TE>
<TE>   From Ricky Barnes of Stockton, who won the U.S. Amateur at Oakland
Hills, on spending six months losing 65 pounds when he was a freshman
in high school: "I was a little chunkster."</TE>
<TE>   Schedule News</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been officially released, but an insider's peek at the
2003 PGA Tour schedule shows a very busy West Coast stretch of five
consecutive tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   The list: Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Jan. 29-Feb. 2; Pebble Beach
AT&amp;T, Feb. 6-9; Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines, Feb. 13-16;
Nissan Open, Feb. 20-23; the Accenture World Match Play, Feb.
27-March 2.</TE>
<TE>   It's a different schedule from this year, when the Phoenix Open
was scheduled between the Hope and Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The World Match Play is back at La Costa as a result of a new
four-year agreement that runs through 2006. La Costa has undergone a
$50-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Count Them Next Time</TE>
<TE>   News item: William Guy of Scotland was disqualified from the
Scottish PGA Championship when he ran out of golf balls by the
seventh hole of his second round.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Doesn't he get them for free? Who was his caddie, Ian
Woosnam's?</TE>
<TE>   Back to Back</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman pulled out of this week's BMW International in Munich,
Germany, because of a bad back, but that's not as big a news item as
Colin Montgomerie's withdrawal from the same tournament. Montgomerie
withdrew from the NEC Invitational after nine holes Friday because of
back pain that could affect his play at the Ryder Cup. Montgomerie is
unbeaten in five Ryder Cup singles matches.</TE>
<TE>   Princely</TE>
<TE>   Prince Albert of Monaco is the host at a charity golf tournament
next month in Monte Carlo that will feature a 77-yard 19th hole--in
Casino Square, where the best angle from the tee to the green is over
a fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Information describing the event deserves some sort of recognition
in press-release-hall-of-fame competition, if there were such a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Take a deep breath ...</TE>
<TE>   "Despite concerns that the hole's presence would create a logjam
of people-traffic in the Principality's bustling town square, the
"Golf in the City" project was made possible by the excellent
collaborative relationship the Monte Carlo Invitational holds with
various municipality departments and with the SBM [Society des Bains
de Mer], whose activities would be heavily impacted by the ambitious
project."</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, and please pass the canapes.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament Update</TE>
<TE>   The Fred Meyer Challenge is looking for a title sponsor after 17
years in Portland, Ore., and Ford Motor Co. is interested in becoming
the title sponsor at Doral in Miami in a four-year deal beginning in
March. This week's Air Canada Championship near Vancouver could be
the last because there is no title sponsor for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Turfball</TE>
<TE>   News item: Oakland Plantation Turf Farm, a distributor for the
Greg Norman Turf Co., installed 110,000 square feet of Norman's GN-1
hybrid Bermuda grass on the stadium floor of Ravens Stadium in
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: From an expert on slip-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Update</TE>
<TE>   Brace yourself, because they're already keeping track of points
for the 2004 Ryder Cup team, even though this year's event isn't even
going to be played until next month.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, 2004 is way off and a lot can happen before the final U.S.
team is solidified, but if you're keeping score, here is the latest
top 10 for the team two years from now: Woods, Leonard, Phil
Mickelson, Rich Beem, Fred Funk, Chris Riley, Rocco Mediate, David
Toms, Jerry Kelly and Jim Furyk.</TE>
<TE>   Wizard Says</TE>
<TE>   Ozzie Smith, the Hall of Fame shortstop, has taken up golf and his
best score is a 78, although he's usually in the mid-80s. He is a
member at Fox Run Country Club in Eureka, Mo., and at the Country
Club of St. Albans, near St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Says Smith: "People ask me all the time, 'What's easier, golf or
baseball?' And I say, 'Baseball.' "</TE>
<TE>   Suggestion Box</TE>
<TE>   In the September issue of Golf magazine, in a tongue-in-cheek
letter to Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson, possible
candidates are suggested to be the first female member, along with a
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes Tonya Harding ("We know she can swing a club.")
and Anna Kournikova ("So what? She can't play tennis either.").</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   The Ninth Cancer for College tournament will be held Sept. 20 at
Pala Mesa Resort in Fallbrook, Calif. The event benefits the North
County charity that provides college scholarships to current and
former cancer patients. Details: (760) 599-9339.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL Celebrity Shootout at La Costa raised $350,000 for NFL and

<HD>Some Optimism Surfaces From Intense Baseball Talks</HD>
<DH>Labor: With the clock ticking to a Friday strike date, both
sides express cautious hope that they are narrowing their
differences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A frantic round of shuttle diplomacy led to a sense of cautious
optimism here late Wednesday night as negotiations to avert a strike
by major league baseball players entered their final 24 hours.</LD>
<LD>   The players say they will strike Friday--before any games are
played--unless there is a labor agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Talks were held all day and into the night. There was an
optimistic sense among people close to the collective-bargaining
process that negotiators for the club owners and Major League Players
Assn. had significantly narrowed their differences but remained
separated on the issue of payroll tax.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig arrived from Milwaukee and lawyers joked
that they needed hiking boots as they frequently walked the four
blocks between the Manhattan offices of the players union and major
league baseball. Proposals and contract language on the key issues of
the tax and revenue sharing were exchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Said one lawyer with ties to the union, weighing the possibility
of a bargaining agreement before games are canceled Friday, "It looks
good, but Yogi was right. It's not over until it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Union staffers briefed the 30 player representatives, and some
optimistic remarks emerged there also.</TE>
<TE>   "We were definitely left with the impression that a deal can get
done. The tone was very positive," said one player, who asked not to
be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristic of the fluid situation, however, is that a union
lawyer cautioned late Wednesday that the players may have been taking
their optimism more from what they were hearing from their respective
clubs than from what they heard during the union conference call.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, baseball showed signs of grinding to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the teams scheduled to play weekend games on the road
were revising travel plans, opting because of the uncertainty to wait
until Friday morning rather than flying tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, scheduled to play the first game of a road series at
Houston on Friday, will depart from Burbank Airport at 1 p.m. today,
though they may be flying to final destinations unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Vice President Derrick Hall said, "With our charter, we
plan on leaving Houston Sunday night as scheduled." But whether the
team goes to Phoenix, to face the Arizona Diamondbacks, or elsewhere,
"we are flexible in our plans."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said he would roam the plane during the
flight today and talk to his players.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were not scheduled to travel again until they finish a
weekend series at Anaheim with the Baltimore Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the talks that shuttled back and forth between the
headquarters of the two factions went on long past midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Robert DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, was among those
striking an optimistic tone. He told reporters during a mid-evening
stroll to the union offices that "every time we've had a discussion I
would characterize it as getting closer. We won't quit. Our goal is
to get a deal without one minute of a work stoppage. I'm optimistic
we can do it [today]."</TE>
<TE>   If that is achieved, it would be a baseball first. All eight of
the previous labor negotiations have ended in either a strike by the
players or lockout by the owners.</TE>
<TE>   In these negotiations, the players insist they are simply trying
to maintain a system that has seen their average salary rise to $2.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   They are threatening to strike because of concern that the
combination of a restrictive tax on the payrolls of high-revenue
clubs that drive the salary market and increased revenue sharing,
putting another burden on those same clubs, serves as a dual hit and
is tantamount to a salary cap, unacceptable to the union.</TE>
<TE>   They are also concerned that, barring a settlement, owners will
impose a contract lockout when the season ends and attempt to
unilaterally implement new work rules after declaring an impasse in
the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The owners, claiming debt of $4 billion and 2001 operating losses
of more than $500 million, are insistent that the structure has to
change, that they have to attain a measure of control over payroll
and salary growth while improving the competitive and revenue
disparities.</TE>
<TE>   Selig, who has ultimate authority over the labor process from the
owners' standpoint and had been monitoring talks from his Milwaukee
office, arrived late Wednesday afternoon. He was spotted by a fan as
he walked from his car to the baseball offices, the fan yelling: "Get
a deal done. You're making me miserable."</TE>
<TE>   Selig made his way through a group of reporters, saying he was
"here only to help keep the talks going" and that "I'm hopeful we can
have a constructive 24 to 36 hours."</TE>
<TE>   He re-emerged shortly before midnight and seemed to contribute
more to the positive tone as he returned to his car, saying, "We've
just had a long night, and they're still upstairs working hard at it.
There are a lot of issues still to be decided. I can't say we're
closer, but both sides are reaching out. Generally, these things go
down to the last second. Hopefully, we can get something done before
then. We need a settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Selig had said Tuesday that the sides needed to reach that
settlement by midnight tonight or they would be on "dangerous ground"
regarding Friday's games. He seemed to amend that Wednesday,
suggesting there would be time to continue the negotiations Friday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stretch it as far as we can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was uncertain whether Selig participated in any of the talks
with union lawyers Michael Weiner and Steve Fehr, the brother of
union leader Don Fehr, or talked at any time with the latter, but
sources have said that the union believed it important that Selig be
present.</TE>
<TE>   That thought prompted Mets pitcher Al Leiter to remark: "I'm very
grateful and appreciative that the commissioner of baseball feels
that, 48 hours before another work stoppage, it's important enough
for him to leave Milwaukee and go to New York."</TE>
<TE>   Selig has said his negotiating committee had full authority to
complete an agreement. But the union has been wary, according to
sources, of making pivotal concessions on the tax and revenue sharing
without assurances from Selig that he can get an agreement ratified
by the 30 owners, including seven or eight hard-liners who have
lobbied Selig to make a meaningful deal.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sides have agreed on random steroid testing,
conditioned on an overall agreement and covering only steroids and
not recreational drugs, only the tax and revenue sharing remain among
the major issues to be resolved.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diana Munz won the first of four consecutive gold medals for the
United States on Wednesday in the Pan Pacific swimming championships
at Yokohama, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans lead the six-day meet with 16 golds. Australia is
second with nine, paced by Ian Thorpe, who won his fifth gold
Wednesday in winning the men's 100-meter freestyle.</LD>
<LD>   Munz won the women's 800-meter freestyle in 8 minutes, 31.89
seconds for her third gold of the meet. Japan's Sachiko Yamada won
silver in 8:31.89, and Hayley Peirsol, a senior at Newport Harbor
High, was third in 8:32.27.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm happy to come out with three medals," Munz said. "I'm not too
pleased with my time, though. I was running out of steam after 400."</TE>
<TE>   World-record holder Aaron Peirsol, a freshman at Texas, earned his
second gold, overtaking Australia's Matt Welsh after the first 50
meters in the men's 200 backstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol, who set the 200 world mark at the 2001 world
championships, clocked 1:56.88. He won by a half body-length over
Welsh, who touched in 1:57.69.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dying near the end," said Peirsol, who also won the men's
100 backstroke. "I was aware of [Welsh] at the first 50 and that
really pushed me. It's hard to get a good time here."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won its third gold in the women's 200 breaststroke when
Amanda Beard touched in 2:26.31. Australian Leisel Jones was second
(2:26.42), and Kristy Kowal (2:27.59) took the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Benko then anchored the women's U.S. 800 freestyle relay
team to victory over Australia in 7:56.96.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe clocked 48.84 seconds to edge compatriot Ashley Callus
(49.26) and American Nate Dusing (49.47) in the men's 100 freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe will be bidding for his sixth gold when he takes part in
the 400-meter relay today--the final day of competition.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Canadian boxer Joe Gatti was released from the hospital at
Leipzig, Germany, four days after he was knocked out in a fight and
then collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Gatti, 35, was beaten by Germany's Sven Ottke in an IBF
super-middleweight title fight on Saturday and collapsed in his hotel
room a few hours later. He sustained a mild concussion and minor
bleeding in his brain.</TE>
<TE>   WBA lightweight champion Leonard Dorin broke his arm in a cycling
accident in Montreal, forcing him to postpone his title defense,
which was planned for November.</TE>
<TE>   Dorin was cycling recently with his family when the accident
occurred, said Jacques Theriault, a spokesman for Dorin's promoter.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach Charlie Spoonhour signed a
one-year contract extension through the 2004-05 season. Spoonhour led
the Runnin' Rebels to a 21-11 record and an NIT appearance last
season, his first at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Tryon, the youngest player to earn his PGA Tour card, has
recovered from mononucleosis and plans to return to competition next
week at the Utah Classic on the Buy.com Tour. Tryon, 18, earned his
card at 17 years, six months and one day.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale High football player Jason Chamberlin was released from
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Wednesday, one week after collapsing
and losing consciousness during a practice. Chamberlin, a 6-foot-3,
280-pound sophomore lineman, suffered from heatstroke and
dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Kovalev rejected the Pittsburgh Penguins' initial offer on
a long-term contract extension. Kovalev is in the final year of a
contract that will pay him $4.6 million this season. He said last
week that he wants to be among the league's top-paid players.... The
Columbus Blue Jackets re-signed defenseman Derrick Walser and center
Blake Bellefeuille.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds' back is out of alignment. It doesn't seem to be
affecting his swing.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds homered for the fourth time in two games and Russ Ortiz
allowed four hits in eight innings and drove in two runs as the San
Francisco Giants beat the Colorado Rockies, 9-1, Wednesday night at
Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds' back has been bothering him enough over the last few days
that Manager Dusty Baker had considered holding him out of today's
game against the Rockies.</LD>
<TE>   But with the Giants only 2 1/2 games behind the Dodgers in the
National League wild-card race and a potential strike looming,
there's no way Baker is going to keep Bonds out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got an off day on Monday, so this isn't a tough stretch for
us," said Baker, whose team has won four straight and eight of 10.
"This is not another 20 in a row stretch for us, so we can try to
pace things and try to space out the off days and put the best team
on the field at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds homered in the first, his 39th, and just missed another in
the fifth on a double that hit near the top of the wall in center. He
was three for four before being taken out in the bottom of the
seventh and finished a triple short of hitting for the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent homered for the third consecutive game, a solo shot to
left off Colorado starter Jason Jennings (15-6) in the first inning.
Bonds followed by barely clearing the wall in left three pitches
later. It was his fourth homer in five at-bats--he walked in the
third Tuesday night--and his fifth consecutive hit.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 1, Atlanta 0--Brian Giles' one-out single off reliever
Mike Remlinger broke up a scoreless tie in the 10th and the Pirates,
shut out by Greg Maddux for nine innings, beat the Braves at
Pittsburgh. Mike Williams (2-5) struck out Rafael Furcal with the
bases loaded and two out in the 10th to get the win.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 2, San Diego 1--Roy Oswalt won his seventh consecutive
start, giving up four hits and pitching into the eighth inning as the
Astros won at Houston. Oswalt (17-6) hasn't lost since July 16.
Oswalt has a 1.03 earned-run average during his seven-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 9, Cincinnati 2--Garrett Stephenson returned from a
three-month layoff by throwing four shutout innings, and pinch-hitter
Kerry Robinson had a three-run double as the Cardinals won at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Philadelphia 3--Tomo Ohka struck out a career-high 11
and Brad Wilkerson drove in three runs as the Expos won at
Philadelphia in a game delayed 2 hours, 1 minute because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Chicago 1--Lenny Harris had four hits, including a
home run, and Glendon Rusch pitched seven strong innings for host
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, New York 3--Charles Johnson drove in three runs and six
Marlin pitchers helped beat the Mets at Miami.</TE>

<HD>A Nuclear Weapon Just Waiting to Happen</HD>
<DH>Perilous materials at insecure sites around the world must
be removed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW BUNN</AU>
<BD>Matthew Bunn, a former White House advisor on
management of nuclear materials, is a senior research associate in
the Managing the Atom project at Harvard University's Kennedy School
of Government. He is a consultant to the Nuclear Threat Initiative.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrorists with the makings of a nuclear bomb represent the worst
homeland security nightmare. So last week's removal of enough highly
enriched uranium, or HEU, for 2 1/2 bombs from the poorly guarded
Vinca research facility in Yugoslavia is a dramatic step toward
making the world a safer place. But it is only the first step.</LD>
<LD>   Today, plutonium and HEU--the essential ingredients of nuclear
bombs--are in hundreds of facilities, in scores of countries. Because
obtaining such materials is the hardest part of making a nuclear
bomb, vulnerable nuclear material anywhere is a threat to everyone
everywhere. Yet there are no binding global nuclear security
standards, and the security for these materials ranges from excellent
to appalling. Vinca was so impoverished it had dead rats floating in
its spent fuel pool.</LD>
<LD>   There are more than 300 civilian research facilities like Vinca
around the world fueled with HEU, which is the easiest material for
terrorists to make into a nuclear bomb. Many of these sites do not
have enough HEU to pose a serious security threat. But there are
others like Vinca: poorly secured and with enough material for a
nuclear bomb.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than trying to beef up security everywhere, we need a
focused "global cleanout" program targeted on getting rid of bomb
material from as many sites as possible around the world and then
effectively securing the sites that remain. The surest form of
prevention is to ensure there is no bomb material to steal.</TE>
<TE>   Such a global cleanout effort would be feasible and
cost-effective. Like Vinca, many of the facilities containing
potential bomb material have no genuine need for it anymore,
recognize that they cannot afford to secure it effectively for the
long haul and can be persuaded to give it up if the right incentives
are offered.</TE>
<TE>   The program should have the flexibility to tailor its work to the
needs of each site--from paying the cost of shipping the material
away, to buying the material outright, to helping to convert research
reactors to use fuel that cannot be used in bombs, to paying
scientists to do research that no longer requires a research reactor.</TE>
<TE>   A program funded at perhaps $50 million per year would have the
potential to eliminate essentially all of the most serious
threats--the facilities that are both poorly secured and have a
substantial amount of bomb material--within a few years.</TE>
<TE>   The Vinca operation vividly demonstrates why such a focused,
flexible program is needed. While ultimately successful, pulling it
together required more than a year of secret interagency and
international negotiations. And when the U.S. government found that
it did not have the authority to spend money on one part of the job
crucial to sealing the deal with Yugoslavia, it had to reach out for
$5 million from the private Nuclear Threat Initiative, founded by Ted
Turner and Sam Nunn. It was a similar story when the United States
airlifted nearly 600 kilograms of vulnerable HEU from Kazakhstan in
1994: more than a year of interagency debate to pull the mission
together while the material remained insecure.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11, we no longer have time for that, and we cannot
afford to force the government to go to the private sector for
handouts to get these vulnerable bomb caches secured. We need to
create one office with all the authority needed to get the job done
and to move as fast as we possibly can to reduce this urgent risk to
U.S. security.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress returns from its August recess, the House and Senate
will be debating language in the Senate's defense bill that would
authorize such an effort (although the Senate failed to provide new
money to carry it out).</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of securing ourselves and our children from
terrorist nuclear attack, Congress and the Bush administration need
to work together to launch a fast-paced effort to clean out all of
Vinca's vulnerable cousins, wherever they may be.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1. Which is correct?</LD>
<LD>   A) George W. Bush has been arrested four times.</LD>
<LD>   B) George W. Bush is the first president with an MBA.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: B</TE>
<TE>   (Bush has been arrested only three times. Once for drunk driving
in 1976 and twice while a student at Yale, once for ripping down the
goal posts after a Princeton-Yale game and once for stealing a
Christmas wreath from a hotel.)</TE>
<TE>   2. Which jobs did Bernie Ebbers have before becoming CEO of
WorldCom?</TE>
<TE>   A) Gym teacher, milkman and bar bouncer.</TE>
<TE>   B) Bookkeeper, shoe-shine stand operator, paper-cutter.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: A</TE>
<TE>   (Bookkeeper, shoe-shine stand operator and paper-cutter were all
jobs held by Al Capone.)</TE>
<TE>   3. True or False: In the mid-1990s, indicted former Adelphia CEO
John Rigas put his home phone number on Adelphia's cable bills.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: True</TE>
<TE>   (It is not true, however, that customers could check a box on
their bills if they wanted to donate $1 to the "John Rigas Bail
Fund.")</TE>
<TE>   4. Which of the following is a job previously held by Martha
Stewart?</TE>
<TE>   A) Cancer-drug developer.</TE>
<TE>   B) Stockbroker.</TE>
<TE>   C) Bail bondsman.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: B</TE>
<TE>   (Bail bondsman is probably the most recent addition to her Palm
Pilot. As for cancer-drug developer, I'm sure she wishes she'd never
met one.)</TE>
<TE>   5. Which of the following is true of former Tyco CEO Dennis
Kozlowski?</TE>
<TE>   A) In 2002, he was arrested and charged with evading millions of
dollars in tax on art purchases he made.</TE>
<TE>   B) In 2002, he was named Florida Atlantic University's Business
Leader of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Both true.</TE>
<TE>   (And, in a speech to the graduating class at New Hampshire's St.
Anselm College, also in 2002, he said: "You will be confronted with
questions every day that test your morals. Think carefully, and for
your sake, do the right thing, not the easy thing.")</TE>
<TE>   6. Which of the following are actual suggestions made by
then-WorldCom CEO Ebbers to save money at the company's headquarters?</TE>
<TE>   A) Raise the thermostats in summer.</TE>
<TE>   B) Let office plants die to save on water.</TE>
<TE>   C) Count coffee bags to make sure they aren't stolen.</TE>
<TE>   D) Switch to AT&amp;T for long-distance service.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: A, B and C</TE>
<TE>   (It is not true that Ebbers asked employees trying to stay warm on
cold days to snuggle by the space heaters.)</TE>
<TE>   7. Why did Adelphia's Rigas refuse to show porn movies on his
cable systems?</TE>
<TE>   A) It offended his sense of morality.</TE>
<TE>   B) Securing broadcast rights was too convoluted.</TE>
<TE>   C) He was reserving the channel space for family programming.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: A</TE>
<TE>   (If we are to believe his accusers, stealing $3.1 billion from
Adelphia shareholders apparently didn't weigh on his conscience one
bit, though.)</TE>
<TE>   8. True or False: According to USA Today, 82% of 401 high-ranking
corporate executives admit to being less than honest on the golf
course.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: True.</TE>
<TE>   (And the other 18% were probably lying to the person taking the
poll.)</TE>
<TE>   9. What percentage of the Fortune 1,000 are managed by female
CEOs?</TE>
<TE>   A) 5%</TE>
<TE>   B) 9%</TE>
<TE>   C) 1%</TE>
<TE>   Answer: C</TE>
<TE>   (There are only 11 women CEOs. And none of them have been indicted
in the recent spate of accounting scandals, not even Martha--yet.)</TE>
<TE>   10. Which of the following homes is owned by indicted former Tyco
CEO Kozlowski?</TE>
<TE>   A) A $13.5-million, 15,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style
waterfront estate with boat dock, elevator, pool, cabana, tennis
court and fountain.</TE>
<TE>   B) An $18-million, 13-room 5th Avenue apartment featuring artworks
by Monet and Renoir and a $6,000 gold shower curtain.</TE>
<TE>   C) A $5-million coastal Nantucket mansion with a three-bedroom
guest house, in-home chef and boat dock.</TE>
<TE>   D) An $8.5-million, 7,800-square-foot Colorado estate on nearly
three acres with eight bedrooms and 10 bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: All of the above.</TE>
<TE>   (Plus, Kozlowski owns four others. His eight houses are valued at
about $54 million. Although, if the Manhattan district attorney gets
his way, Kozlowski's next home will be 8-by-10 with a toilet, bed and
sink all in the same room.)</TE>

<HD>Let's End the Embarrassment of Low Voting Rates</HD>
<DH>Plan for same-day registration would revive the system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD RIORDAN and ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA</AU>
<BD>Richard Riordan, a Republican, is former mayor of Los
Angeles. Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, is former speaker of the
California Assembly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 30 years, there's been a steady decline in voter
participation in California. Only one in four eligible voters went to
the polls in this year's March primary. This is an embarrassment to
our state. We must do more to protect the integrity of the election
system and encourage every eligible citizen to vote.</LD>
<LD>   One of the best ways to do that would be to approve a measure on
the November ballot--Proposition 52--that would allow same-day voter
registration. As has been shown in other states, this is a proven way
to increase voter participation.</LD>
<LD>   Passage of Proposition 52 would allow otherwise eligible voters to
register on election day if they had a California driver's license or
two valid forms of identification to ensure they were voting at the
correct polling place. The initiative includes enhanced election
safeguards and strict new penalties against voter fraud. These
reforms, taken together, would increase voter confidence that our
election system was both inclusive and secure.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 52's most significant safeguard is the requirement
that voters registering on election day must show either a California
driver's license or two pieces of identification from a list approved
by the California secretary of state. Currently, no identification is
required to register or to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of this common-sense reform are distorting the truth
about the measure. They say it would encourage voter fraud when,
rather, it contains many safeguards against fraud. And they are using
other excuses, such as "less informed people will vote," in a cynical
attempt to limit legally eligible citizens from exercising their
constitutional right to vote.</TE>
<TE>   These same scare tactics and claims were made about campaign
finance reform, absentee voting and so-called "motor voter''
registration (the federal mandate for voter registration forms to be
freely available at all government offices, such as the Department of
Motor Vehicles and City Hall)--all sensible reforms that have
improved the system for voters.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 52 should not be about politics. It deserves the
support of everyone because it would strengthen democracy by
increasing turnout among Democrats, Republicans and independents
alike.</TE>
<TE>   We need this reform because many voters do not tune in to an
election until the final weeks of the campaign. Some are unable to
cast ballots because they didn't remember to fill out a registration
form in time, and some because they moved and didn't realize they had
to re-register. Others are informed, involved Californians who lacked
the time or opportunity to focus on their registration status. These
are not valid reasons to deny an eligible citizen's right to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Even the strongest democracy can't thrive if more of its citizens
don't vote. Proposition 52 would breathe new life into our electoral
system. When more people vote, we build stronger communities, a
healthier state and a more responsive government.</TE>
<TE>   There are two sides to this debate--those who value inclusion and
expanded democracy and those who want to limit the number of people
who are allowed to vote. Californians who value inclusion, democracy
and bipartisanship should support the expansion of the electorate
through the reforms contained in Proposition 52.</TE>

<HD>The World's Different, and So Are We</HD>
<DH>9/11 spurred many of us to question our paths in life and
to make changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer and a senior fellow
at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up
after Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the upcoming first anniversary of Sept. 11, it's worth noting not
just how the world has changed in the last year but how Americans as
individuals have changed personally. After all, Sept. 11 was
something we took very personally. But, looking back, it seems clear
that we surprised the rest of the world with our reaction.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly there was some of the predictable "woe is me," and a bit
of the teary "why us?" victimology in the immediate aftermath. But
that was our shock registering, more than anything else--the sound of
our geopolitical ignorance and our hermetic complacency crashing to
the ground along with their symbolic stone equivalents, the Twin
Towers.</LD>
<LD>   Nationalism was quickened by injury. A sharp wound to the ego made
us jump. We howled and stamped our feet like spoiled children
disciplined at last. To be fair, however, all this passed quickly,
given the scope of the event, and gave way to something much more
private and, arguably, much more quintessentially American than
bratty backlash or haughty solidarity.</LD>
<TE>   We took what happened on Sept. 11 and put it in the context of
each and every one of our lives the way you do only when confronted
with some purely subjective twist of fate or catastrophic near miss
that leaves you scrambling to pick up the pieces.</TE>
<TE>   We asked ourselves what was and remains perhaps the hardest
question at the heart of this national tragedy: What am I doing with
my life? Not, what is my country doing?</TE>
<TE>   Fundamentally, we asked something much more existential and
productive, though we rarely, if ever, asked it out loud or talked
about it with our friends. We asked: What am I--a single, accountable
individual in society, a mortal nobody living out his or her days in
quiet desperation--doing?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly the kind of thing you hear at the mall, much less
expect from a bunch of supposedly insulated consumerists, but there
it was on the table when we were all sitting up nights or staring out
the window in the middle of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Scratch most Americans these days and you'll find that many of
them have made a big change in their lives in the last 12 months,
something not obviously attributable to Sept. 11 but a response to it
nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   It might be something as outwardly trivial as finally sticking to
the Atkins diet, quitting smoking or taking up yoga. Then again, it
might be something monumental like ending a decades-old bad marriage
or quitting a cushy job to pursue a life in the arts. But whatever it
is, the impetus behind the changes we made is essentially the same
for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Deep down we all did it because we knew that it might have been us
in those towers.</TE>
<TE>   So what makes this so American? Because it's our unique history.
We are a nation made up largely of the children of penniless
immigrants who once hopped a boat to terra incognita, landed often
sick and in rags and pulled themselves up for generations by their
proverbial bootstraps.</TE>
<TE>   It's immortalized in our literature as well. Ralph Waldo Emerson
was not only guiding our individualist spirit but describing it when
he wrote in his canonical essay "Self-Reliance": "Every true man is a
cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers
and time fully to accomplish his design.... Bid the invaders take the
shoes from off their feet, for God is here within."</TE>
<TE>   We have found rigor under duress, shown our mettle to be made
perhaps of sterner stuff than our detractors thought.</TE>
<TE>   We have been modest heroes to ourselves, and that, for what it's
worth, has made all the difference.</TE>

<LD>It's difficult to picture baseball union leader Don Fehr shoulder to
shoulder with Walter Reuther or Jimmy Hoffa. But there's also a
disconnect when the owner of the Texas Rangers, having paid star
shortstop Alex Rodriguez $252 million over 10 years, says the system
is broken. Who broke it, the man taking the money or the one paying
him?</LD>
<LD>   Friday is the deadline for avoiding a strike in major league
baseball, a labor action by men paid an average of $2.4 million a
year. This isn't farm workers in the Central Valley or garbage
workers in Memphis. It is simply not possible to feel sorry for the
players.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say there's sympathy for owners who pay hundreds of
millions of dollars for teams, say they're losing big bucks and whine
that they didn't know what they were getting into. Teams claim to be
in the red, but owners refuse to open their books. This doesn't mean
their accounting is patterned on Enron or WorldCom, but disclosure
could give them a stronger case with players who wonder why someone
would pay $700 million to buy the Boston Red Sox when the team
reported a loss of nearly $14 million last year. Television rights
are lucrative, as are stadium receipts, and claims of losses are hard
to assess.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball, however, is the only major sport without caps on
salaries, and the link between stratospheric salaries and winning can
be weak. This year's high-priced New York Mets are in last place,
while the relatively poorly paid Minnesota Twins are in first place
in their division. The players say the salary caps demanded by owners
would decrease the value of their hard-fought free agency. Athletes
in sports with salary caps are doing just fine.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball does have revenue sharing, with richer teams helping the
poorer. The overall amount is already scheduled to increase, but one
issue in negotiations is how quickly that will happen. There is a
risk that an owner of a weaker team would take the newfound money and
pocket it rather than spending it on better players, but the baseball
commissioner, Bud Selig, says setting a minimum payroll for the 30
teams would prevent that.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's last strike was in 1994. It led to cancellation of the
World Series and left a bitterness that endures. After all, a player
with an average salary makes in two years what it would take a
$48,000-a-year wage earner 100 years to make. A new walkout would
produce at least as bad a fan reaction. Especially in Los Angeles,
since the Dodgers and Angels are candidates for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The players did belatedly agree to random testing for steroid use.
They also have shown willingness to accept increased revenue sharing
among teams. A "tax" on teams with outsize payrolls, with the
proceeds going to lower-payroll teams, could also help even out the
sometimes wide disparities that discourage fans of perennial losers.
The owners should allow a longer time than they currently want to
phase in the revenue transfers.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty of room on both sides for compromise but only one
day left to get there.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Congressional Budget Office's report Tuesday that federal tax
revenue has taken the steepest percentage drop in more than half a
century is no cause for panic. In a time of recession, running
deficits is what governments do, because to further restrict spending
would deepen and prolong the downturn.</LD>
<LD>   But the report's projection that deficits will continue for at
least four years does indicate the government's vital signs are
weakening--and could drop dangerously low unless the administration
ends its addiction to tax cuts.</LD>
<LD>   An unexpectedly deep plunge in capital gains tax revenue, a
slowing economy and the administration's 2001 tax cut have all
contributed to a revenue shortfall, with receipts running 6.6% under
last year's. The deepening debt has helped kill a prescription drug
benefit program, which would have cost more than $40 billion a year.
Still alive, however, is the prospect of a war against Iraq, which
could cost more than $50 billion even before expenses of an
occupation are counted. What's more, America's allies aren't willing
to help foot the bill this time.</LD>
<TE>   But the most significant roadblock to bringing down the deficit is
the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut that Bush proposed and Congress
approved last year. The wealthy, who spend a smaller percentage of
additional income than the less well-off and thus offer less stimulus
to the economy, will receive the lion's share of cuts in coming
years.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is calling on Congress to make his cuts permanent
instead of sunsetting them after 2010. If it agrees, that will almost
certainly wipe out any return to budget surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, the president, in the aftermath of his economic forum
in Waco, Texas, is widely reported to be considering more tax cuts.
He would, among other things, reduce the capital gains tax rate below
the current 20% for long-term gains and allow more generous
write-offs for selling stocks at a loss. But the budget office has
estimated that cutting the capital gains tax would have little effect
on long-term economic growth, and the tax code already provides a
cushion for moderate investment losses. Both changes could also
exacerbate stock selling.</TE>
<TE>   With the economy stumbling as it tries to emerge from recession,
the last thing the president and Congress should be doing is
generating greater debt with dubious benefits. Big deficits lead to
higher interest rates, gobbling up money that businesses could
otherwise reinvest. Congress should reduce last year's tax cut, not
consider new cuts.</TE>

<LD>Given a choice, what consumer would pass out his or her personal
financial history to company after company, inviting them to dig for
marketing opportunities, or worse?</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, that's the way this supposedly private information
is handled these days. Get a home loan or open a bank account and
watch helplessly as the information you provided is sold off to
insurers, furniture companies, investment "counselors."</LD>
<LD>   Members of the California Assembly can stop some of these
outrageous abuses by voting today for Senate Bill 773, a measure by
Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) that would require financial
companies to obtain consumers' permission before sharing personal
data with "nonaffiliated" companies or selling this information to
such companies.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Speier agreed to amend the bill to satisfy business
concerns without harming consumers. For example, an earlier version
of the legislation would have required auto insurers to obtain
consumer permission even before switching a customer from a high-risk
group to a low-risk group. Speier agreed to let insurers make such
changes on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The concessions satisfied many moderate Republicans and Democrats
attentive to business concerns. For example, Assemblyman Rod Pacheco
(R-Riverside), who opposed the Speier bill last year, has co-authored
this year's version. The bill has also been embraced by other former
opponents, such as American Express and lobbyists representing the
state's credit unions.</TE>
<TE>   However, as of Wednesday night, banks, Internet brokers, insurers
and other large commercial interests were still furiously lobbying to
kill the bill by pressing legislators to vote against it or just not
vote at all, and by trying to tack on a last-minute amendment that
would gut it. Their amendment would, among other things, let a health
insurer share what it knew about you with life insurers.</TE>
<TE>   If that amendment kills the bill, or Gov. Gray Davis vetoes it, a
similar measure will no doubt end up on a statewide ballot. Voters
would be forced to do for themselves what elected officials, cowed by
business contributions, failed so cravenly to do on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation's fate could lie in the hands of several Democrats
who declined even to vote on the bill last year and who said they
were "neutral" as of Wednesday night. The names of a few key Assembly
members from Southern California are listed below. Call to let them
know why they should support Speier's sensible effort to rein in
invasions of basic consumer privacy.</TE>

<LD>Re "History Echoes as Farm Workers Rally for Bill," Aug. 26: I am a
lifelong Democrat who has never voted for a Republican. But Gov. Gray
Davis' loathsome vacillating while he calculates the optimally
self-aggrandizing position to take on SB 1736, the farm workers'
arbitration bill, has cost him my vote. I plan to write in Richard
Riordan's name on election day.</LD>
<LD>   If Bill "Simple" Simon has any desire to garner more than 45% of
the vote come November, he will seize this "once in a political
lifetime" chance to turn his ethically tainted, dubious campaign and
image around and come out for SB 1736. By doing so, he can actually
lay claim to a morally principled position that counters his
well-earned reputation as a money-mongering corporate shill who
always puts the interests of his big-business patrons first.</LD>
<LD>   Even if Davis then does the right thing and signs SB 1736, his
action will cement his image as a political hack with his finger
perennially in the wind. And if Davis vetoes SB 1736, Simon can gain
a foothold with Latinos and liberal Democrats that no Republican
gubernatorial candidate could dream of gaining in Simon's lifetime.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bridges Are Roadblocks for L.A. River Bikeway," Aug. 25: Yes,
it's state of the art. Yes, it has fancy gates. No, there is no law
enforcement. The L.A. River is home to countless transients and their
"pets." Recently, while exploring the new section between Los Feliz
Boulevard and Fletcher Drive, my family, along with our (leashed)
dog, were attacked by two pit bulls and a German shepherd ("pets,"
according to the "camper"). The LAPD, the Parks and Recreation
Department and, finally, the Department of Animal Regulation all
said: "This is not our jurisdiction."</LD>
<LD>   A series of rabies shots later, I'm glad I was with my schnauzer,
not a little kid. Somebody needs to police, as well as fund, this
project.</LD>

<LD>Re "Schools to End Soda Sales," Aug. 28: While volunteering at my
son's high school selling snack food to raise money for the PTA, it
dawned on me that there must and should be better ways to raise money
than promoting unhealthful food and drink. It was great to hear that
the Los Angeles Unified School District has stepped up to the
challenge of confronting a problem that has long been ignored and
abused by profit-seeking extremists.</LD>
<LD>   I support fund-raising but find bothersome the contradiction of
belief involved in the selling and promotion of unhealthful food.</LD>
<LD>   Kara Frazier</LD>
<TE>   Trabuco Canyon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is not the school district's place to decide what children eat
and drink. That is up to their parents. Does the school board think
that by not letting the kids drink soda they will lose weight and be
more healthy? Get real. They will just go off campus and buy what
they want. It's a choice. That's what freedom is--the freedom to be
obese if you want to.</TE>
<TE>   Why not address the real issue? Thirty years ago there was money
to teach the kids and for the extracurricular activities that the
soda money now pays for. Why is there not enough money for sports and
dances? It's wasted somewhere. Cut the waste. Stop worrying about all
the fizz on campus and get back to basics: reading, writing and
arithmetic. That should be the job of the public school.</TE>
<TE>   If the loss of soda money forces the schools to cut back on the
physical education department, isn't that defeating the purpose? The
problem is not soda or health, it's education!</TE>

<TE>   It's high time the schools expel the junk food! We all know
questionable items like soft drinks and candy bars are filling kids
with sugar and helping them to make very poor health choices. Why are
schools willing to be parties to this compromising behavior?</TE>

<LD>Re "A Shot Across the Bow From the Darkness," Commentary, Aug. 26:
Reading Jonathan Turley's article on the secret court, I wonder why
every American citizen isn't outraged by the existence of that court.
And why isn't every member of the U.S. Senate and House of
Representatives outraged by the existence of that court and its
misuse by our current attorney general?</LD>
<LD>   And why isn't every media outlet expressing outrage at the false
applications for secret searches submitted to that court by the
Justice Department?</LD>
<LD>   And to think that many of us were pleased that the people of
Missouri saw fit not to return John Ashcroft to his Senate seat in
the last election. Talk about unintended consequences--that Ashcroft
should then wind up in a position where even the secret court
admonished him and the Justice Department.</LD>

<LD>Re "Hussein Is Called 'Mortal Threat,' " Aug. 27: Having spent my
18th, 19th and 20th birthdays in the service, 14 months of that on
sea duty, I feel I am entitled to voice an opinion regarding the
proposed attack on Iraq. Because of blind patriotism, like many other
veterans I did not voice my opposition to the Vietnam War until it
was too late. By then, 58,000 body bags had been filled, nearly 20%
by Latinos, although we made up less than 10% of the population.</LD>
<LD>   This time I am determined to raise my voice in protest before it
is too late. What we need are leaders with understanding and vision
rather than "talking heads" mouthing inflammatory conjecture as fact.
If Saddam Hussein is truly a threat, there are ample ways to contain
him, just as we have contained Fidel Castro, another convenient paper
tiger. I think there has been enough killing in our generation, and
we are still not safe. It is time to try another alternative.</LD>

<TE>   The detractors of the Bush administration's plan to go after Iraq

Do they remember 1991 and Iraq agreeing to inspections? Do they
remember Iraq kicking out the U.N. inspectors? Based on those two
criteria, I can't see how they are saying we don't have the right to
go back into Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Do they really think Iraq would hesitate to put a nuclear weapon
in the U.S.? If they do, they are truly ostriches.</TE>

<TE>   Regarding the Bush administration's Iraq bluster: Those of us old
enough to remember the Vietnam War may recall the Nixon-Kissinger
"total lunatic" theory of negotiation, which they attempted to
practice (unsuccessfully) on the North Vietnamese: If you can
convince the enemy that you're crazy enough to do anything--like drop
the bomb--you put them at a disadvantage when it comes to bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Iraq (and other matters), the current Bush team seems to
have evolved that doctrine into what might be called the "total
imbecile" theory--the idea that it is stupid enough to do anything.
The problem with this theory is that it seems to be making our
friends more hysterical than our enemies.</TE>

<LD>Re "Crying Out on Health Care," editorial, Aug. 25: The Board of
Supervisors has become more mystical and dangerous than Scrooge. It
has transformed horrible diseases of the past into potential diseases
of the future. Since when has ceasing to immunize so many children
against severe communicable diseases been more cost-effective than
treating even a few of these morbid diseases in our local hospitals?</LD>
<LD>   And what about the children who might be forced to suffer from
these illnesses in our county facilities? I have, in the past,
personally attended children in county facilities suffering from
polio, tetanus, diphtheria, measles, German measles and other
life-threatening--yet preventable--diseases. These illnesses cost
these children--and taxpayers--an unbearable and unjust price.</LD>
<LD>   In very recent years I have hospitalized underimmunized children
in Los Angeles for measles, chickenpox, whooping cough, Haemophilus
influenza type B and pneumococcal infections (including meningitis).
These horrific, preventable infections are still present in our
community.</LD>
<TE>   What shall I tell the noninsured mother who wants to go to a
clinic to protect (immunize) her child? Where do children who then
have symptoms of these and other communicable illnesses go for
treatment? What sort of future can I envision for all of our
underinsured and noninsured children in Los Angeles? And yes, these
illnesses can spread to all of our children. As the mass of
underimmunized children grows, so does the threat to all our children
and all our community. Is my plea too late?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Senator Pays Price for Defying GOP" ( Aug. 26) just amazed me. The
bitterness and party-line control of the Republican Party is amazing.
Where is it written that, when elected, state senators under no
circumstances can cast votes from the heart, have minds of their own
and think logically, unless it falls within their own party's
viewpoints? These types of controls destroy the very fabric of our
state and federal elections.</LD>
<LD>   I cast my vote for those running for public office on vision,
merit and what they have to offer, regardless of party. My hat's off
to state Sen. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding) for having the courage
to cast his vote in a manner he felt was best for California.
Republicans never seem to get it. People don't want far-right-wing
puppets. Look out, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas): We have
many Republican politicians here in California eyeing your job.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Lee</LD>
<TE>   Pomona</TE>

<TE>   The shunning of Johannessen shows one of the reasons I switched
from Republican to nonpartisan years ago. I realize the story could
just as well be about Democrats. A politician willing to vote his
conscience and not toe the party line no matter what will get my vote
every time.</TE>

<HD>School for Arts Seeks Bond Funding</HD>
<DH>Education: The magnet high would use $10 million from
November measure to start feeder campus, boosting attendance by Santa
Ana students.</DH>

<LD>Supporters of the Orange County High School of the Arts have their
hopes pinned on a state bond that goes before voters in November. If
approved, the measure would include funding that would help the
charter school meet a promise to boost its enrollment of Santa Ana
students.</LD>
<LD>   The $13-billion bond measure includes $400 million for charter
schools. The arts high school would get $10 million to open--as soon
as next year--a charter elementary school intended to prepare Santa
Ana students for the arts high school's demanding entrance auditions.
The money would be used to buy and renovate an office building at
Sycamore and 10th streets next to the high school downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The elementary campus could direct hundreds of low-income Latino
students into the charter high school, helping bridge a cultural gap
that has prevented the school from meeting a requirement that it
recruit 30% of its student body from the Santa Ana Unified School
District.</LD>
<TE>   The district imposed the quota as a condition of sponsoring the
independently run school after it moved from Los Alamitos in 2000 in
search of a larger campus.</TE>
<TE>   With a $20-million state loan, the school bought three buildings
downtown to house classrooms and practice areas. The city's
redevelopment agency provided a $1.6-million start-up grant.</TE>
<TE>   Although most charter schools give local students preference,
quotas are unusual, state officials say. Santa Ana Unified officials
said they wanted the quota to ensure its students benefited from the
school.</TE>
<TE>   But "one of the lessons learned is that we were overly optimistic
in terms of what needed to be done to get to the goal we wanted,"
said John Palacio, president of the Santa Ana Unified school board.</TE>
<TE>   In three years the number of Santa Ana students has grown
dramatically, from six to 131. This makes Santa Ana the biggest
contributor to the student body, whose hometowns include Palm Desert,
Carlsbad and Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   They come for intensive training in music, creative writing,
dance, film, television, opera and visual arts. Students attend
regular academic classes from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., take a break, then
study their disciplines in the arts until about 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at less than 11% of the enrollment of about 1,200, the
Santa Ana contingent is far smaller than the required 30%.</TE>
<TE>   The high school has tried other ways to attract Santa Ana
students, but none has produced significant results. Last year, for
example, the school added ballet folklorico as a discipline, but only
five students from Santa Ana Unified chose it.</TE>
<TE>   The latest idea is to create a feeder school, the Santa Ana
Elementary Arts Academy, that would be open only to Santa Ana
students. It would open with kindergarten through third-grade classes
for about 300 children, adding grades as the children advance. This
means it would take four years for the first students to reach the
arts campus, which serves grades 7 through 12.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the low numbers stem in part from a cultural
mismatch between the school's mission and the lifestyles of local
immigrant families--as well as their preference for neighborhood
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an elite school in a sea of poverty," said Santa Ana
Unified board member Nativo V. Lopez, noting that 85% of the
district's students qualify for free lunches. "People are
intimidated."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a certain mind-set" among families in the city that
discourages them from applying, acknowledged Ralph Opacic, the
school's executive director. "We need to raise the awareness of the
kids in Santa Ana."</TE>
<TE>   The elementary school is an ambitious project for a school
struggling to meet its own fund-raising goals. This year, the school
cut support staff when it fell $300,000 short of its $2.5-million
annual fund-raising goal, Opacic said.</TE>
<TE>   The new elementary school won't require private fund-raising to
build or operate, relying instead on bond funding as well as state
and federal grants, Opacic said. Aggressive fund-raising, however,
will remain a fact of life for the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Because the arts high school is a charter school, the state pays
60% of its $10-million operating budget, covering the basic academic
mission. Last year, the remaining 40% came from $2 million in private
donations raised by the charter school's nonprofit fund-raising arm,
$1 million given by parents and $1 million from ticket sales and
other income.</TE>
<TE>   By law, charter schools can't require parents to pay money as a
condition of enrollment, but the school has sent parents letters
asking for funds. Last year, a donation of $750 per family was
suggested. This summer's letter suggested $4,000 per family. It
generated $100,000 in contributions, Opacic said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents feared the letter would further alienate potential
Santa Ana students. School officials emphasize, however, that the
donation is optional.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to lower another barrier, school officials decided
this year to simplify the lengthy application form, thinking it might
be discouraging prospective applicants. They held workshops to advise
students how to audition, and informed parent-teacher groups in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   The school also offered a free after-school "camp" during the fall
and spring to introduce local children to the arts.</TE>
<TE>   City and school officials agree that their inability to
significantly raise the percentage of Santa Ana students stems
largely from an unwillingness among many families to leave their
neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there could be some students who are uncertain about
leaving what they know, their friends and their neighborhood," said
Jess Araujo, who serves on the board of the arts high school and was
among those who helped the school move to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Some students also doubt they have the talent needed, perhaps with
reason. Few get the private music, dance or art lessons that many
students in more affluent areas routinely enjoy. Some believe
cultural differences also account for the difficulty in attracting
more students from Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Hernandez, 13, said she never thought of attending the
school until a counselor at Villa Fundamental Intermediate School
suggested she audition for the vocal program.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not have tried," said Christina, who begins ninth grade
at the school in September. "Some of my friends just thought they
didn't have enough talent, so they didn't go and audition."</TE>
<TE>   Visual arts student Karina Delgado, 14, said friends told her she
would never fit in because she was from Santa Ana. She tried anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured it was a brand-new school, so nobody was going to fit
in," said Karina, who wants to be an animator or comic book artist.
Her audition in visual arts rattled her so much that she sat down and
cried afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asked to draw things I realized I didn't know how to draw.
I remember having to draw roller skates, and it was hard," said
Karina, who ultimately was accepted two years ago. "They let me in,
but it was really intimidating. I was really scared."</TE>

<HD>Budget Gap Getting Wider, Connell Says</HD>
<DH>Funding: The state will fall billions more into the red
than projected as revenues continue to run short, controller says.
Stalemate continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bolstering Republican calls for deeper spending cuts, state
Controller Kathleen Connell warned Wednesday that disappointing
revenues are paving the way for the state's budget gap to swell to
nearly $27 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Connell's warning came as talks over a new spending blueprint,
already more than eight weeks overdue, appeared stalled in the
Assembly. Democrats want $4.2 billion in new revenue to help close a
budget gap that has been projected at $23.6 billion, but Republicans
seek deeper spending cuts to eliminate the need for tax hikes and to
diminish future shortfalls.</LD>
<LD>   Connell said June and July revenues are running $434 million below
projections by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, and the state would
take in $2.9 billion less than anticipated during the current fiscal
year if the trend continues.</LD>
<TE>   Even after a budget is adopted for 2002-03, the imbalance between
revenue and expenditures is expected to continue. Connell projects a
$12-billion shortfall next year, and she said the situation warrants
a midyear review of the spending plan lawmakers approve this year.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Gore, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Finance, had
no comment on Connell's revised revenue forecast. Gore said her
department would not revise its revenue estimates until January.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said her office is preparing a plan for the state to
borrow as much as $12 billion to avert a cash crunch that will
materialize in November if the current standoff drags into the fall.
She warned, however, that securing the short-term borrowing would not
free her to make certain payments without a budget in place.</TE>
<TE>   State payments for abortion services provided after Sunday as well
as payments owed to 21 regional centers that help connect the
developmentally disabled to services--ranging from transportation to
residential care--will cease without legislative intervention until a
budget is approved and signed by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights advocates disagreed Wednesday with Connell's
interpretation of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Connell has already stopped paying elected officials, legislative
staff and hundreds of vendors who provide goods and services to the
state. Assembly Republicans urged Democrats Wednesday to hear a bill
that would allow emergency appropriations to be made for the
developmentally disabled, vendors and others.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Planners OK 283-Home Project in Wildlife Corridor</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Planning Commission on Wednesday endorsed a
developer's plan to build 283 homes in the foothills of the Santa Ana
Mountains, despite warnings from state biologists that the proposal
threatens to disrupt crucial wildlife links between two of the
country's biggest urban conservation districts.</LD>
<LD>   "To hold up a private property owner is a shame," Commissioner Ben
Nielsen said while joining the 4-1 majority in favor of the 230-acre
Saddleback Meadows plan. "We need to move on with it."</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Barbara Merriman cast the lone vote against the
proposal. She cited concerns that the property is too steeply sloped
for homes to be built safely.</LD>
<TE>   The plan will now be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors.
Opponents vow to bring the matter back to the courts, where they have
had success in holding up development for several years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the county approved plans for 705 mobile homes on the
property, a zoning designation that still stands. Since then,
developer California Quartet has tried to revise the plans so it
could build houses instead. The county approved that plan in 1998,
but the courts threw out the approval, saying that the environmental
documents were inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   California Quartet returned a few months ago with new
environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   County planners urged the commission to approve the project
Wednesday, making the point that 283 homes is less harmful to the
environment than 705. The developer has said it will go forward with
the mobile homes if its other plans are rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Tippets, environmental program manager for the state
Department of Fish and Game, warned the Planning Commission that the
proposal for 283 homes on the property threatens a "critical linkage"
for large mammals and endangered gnatcatchers between regional parks,
the Cleveland National Forest and tens of thousands of acres that
either have been or will be set aside by the Irvine Co. and Rancho
Mission Viejo for wildlife protection.</TE>
<TE>   But California Quartet shot back with its own expert, Dennis
Murphy, who in the early 1990s helped draft the Natural Communities
Conservation Plan for the area--the plan the wildlife agency
officials say they are trying to protect.</TE>
<TE>   "This piece of property is a biological desert," he said. "It may
be one of the most disturbed and least valuable properties for
species habitat."</TE>

the mobile homes if its other plans are rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, however, contend that the mobile home plan is a
bluff. They say that the steep slopes of the property will make
grading extremely difficult, if not impossible, and that mobile homes
simply would not bring in enough of a return to make it worth the
developer's while.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Tippets, environmental program manager for the state

<TE>   Murphy said that the science on wildlife corridors is suspect and
that they are merely a "handy tool to extract more acreage from
landowners."</TE>
<TE>   In approving the plan, the commission also declined to consider an
alternative plan offered by opponents that would have allowed the
developer to build 87 units on 37 acres and preserve the rest for
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with saying, 'Developer, you can make several
million dollars this way and then we can put an end to all this,' "
said Ed Connor, an attorney who presented the alternative plan. He
vowed that approval of the California Quartet proposal will be met
with many more years of court fights.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no peace ... until one group comes forward and says
I don't have to have everything, I have enough," Connor said.</TE>

<HD>When Davis Outpolls Simon on Ethics, You Know GOP Is in a
Jam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Score the summer round for Gov. Gray Davis. A new poll shows just
how one-sided this contest has been.</LD>
<LD>   It's not merely that Davis leads Bill Simon by 11 percentage
points among likely voters, 41% to 30%, in the survey by pollster
Mark Baldassare for the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of
California.</LD>
<TE>   It's worse than that for Simon: Voters think Davis is the more
ethical.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who they believe would "do a better job of maintaining high
ethical standards in government," the nod goes to Davis by 43% to
28%.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same governor, after all, who has set the all-time
state record for raking in special</TE>
<TE>   interest money. The guy who's highly vulnerable, Simon thinks,</TE>
<TE>   to the charge that he demands "pay for play," favoring political
donors in policy decisions. The unpopular chief executive who</TE>
<TE>   has been the subject of</TE>
<TE>   countless news stories implying sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   And it gets even worse for the Republican nominee: Fewer
Republican voters (33%) are satisfied with their choices for governor
than are Democrats (41%).</TE>
<TE>   This runs counter to the thesis that so many liberal Democrats are
disappointed with Davis that they'll markedly help Simon by
boycotting the governor on election day. Simon has even more
disappointed Republicans to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people who dislike Davis don't feel Simon would necessarily
do a better job," Baldassare says.</TE>
<TE>   One indication of that is this finding: Of the voters who
disapprove of Davis' job performance, only 53% support Simon. A mere
43% approve of the way Davis has handled his job, while 52%
disapprove--basically the same as six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   So why is all this possible? Why are Davis' ethics thought to be
superior? Why are Simon's fellow Republicans so unhappy with their
ballot options?</TE>
<TE>   One major reason is that Davis has been pummeling Simon with TV
ads all summer, attacking his integrity and acumen as a businessman.
"We've done serious damage to the guy," says Garry South, Davis'
chief strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Davis began running TV ads in early June and since then has poured
$11 million into air time, South estimates. That's probably 10 times
what Simon has spent on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, a lot of special interest money Davis has taken
heat for raising, he's now using to sully the integrity of his
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been, South points out, "a classic case of harmonic
convergence."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' attack ads have been corroborated, in many voters' minds,
by real-life events: a jury ordering the Simon family investment firm
to pay a former partner $78 million in fraud damages, an IRS
investigation of a Simon offshore tax shelter, corporate scandals
reflecting badly on any rich businessman- candidate....</TE>
<TE>   And while Davis has been running all-out, Simon has laid back,
saving for the post-Labor Day sprint to election day.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom that things don't start until Labor Day
has not been the case in recent gubernatorial elections," Baldassare
notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Important things happen in those dog days of summer. People get a
chance to know the candidates in a leisurely manner. A lot of
Californians want to make up their minds and move on to other
things."</TE>
<TE>   Examples: In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson passed front-running
challenger Kathleen Brown during the summer and won in a breeze. In
1998, Davis began outrunning Republican Dan Lungren in August.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Baldassare found, 74% of voters are "closely"
following news about the race and 71% have seen a campaign
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's chief strategist, Sal Russo, isn't buying. But part of the
reason is that Russo hasn't had enough money for a big TV buy anyway.
As of June 30, Simon had only $5 million in the bank. Davis had $31.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been too early. Voters are tuned out, not focused on
politics," Russo insists. "Why'd you want to be advertising?</TE>
<TE>   "Our numbers are ready to come back up as soon as we</TE>
<TE>   can tell our story. And people want to hear a story about somebody
who would be a</TE>
<TE>   better governor than Gray Davis. People don't like him. They think
he has been a failed governor. Between now and election day, voters
are going to hear the other side."</TE>
<TE>   That's also South's plan. He wants to tell the other side of
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   South's summer strategy has been to bury Simon so deep in mud that
he can never dig out. But for the fall round, he'd like to run more
"positive" ads--pitching Davis' record--and restore the governor's
once-shining image.</TE>
<TE>   That will be harder than beating Simon.</TE>

<DH>Courts: Judge finds the Panorama City tile setter guilty of

while strangling the woman.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Panorama City tile setter accused of strangling his wife,
butchering her with a carving knife and dumping her remains off the
Ventura County coast was found guilty of first-degree murder
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo, 38, bowed his head as Ventura County Superior
Court Judge Herbert Curtis III announced the verdict after a
three-day trial.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis, who decided the case after Castillo waived his right to a
jury trial, ruled brain hemorrhages detected during an autopsy of the
victim's severed head show that Castillo strangled her for several
minutes--enough time to form a deliberate intent to kill.</LD>
<TE>   As Curtis set a Sept. 25 sentencing date, Castillo quietly raised
his hand, like a student in a classroom, indicating that he wanted to
speak.</TE>
<TE>   He turned to an interpreter sitting next to him and spoke to her
in urgent Spanish, then looked up at the judge as the interpreter
translated his words: "I would like to apologize for all this, that's
all."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo faces a minimum 25 years in state prison and could be
held for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, the prosecutor said the evidence against
Castillo was overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Dec. 6 after a Ventura County sheriff's deputy
stopped near Mugu Rock to investigate an illegally parked truck and
spotted Castillo climbing up a rocky area from the surf, splattered
with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo told authorities the blood was from a cut on his arm and
that he was climbing the rocks to dispose of a cat he had run over.</TE>
<TE>   But deputies shining lights on the water saw human limbs floating
in the surf. The victim was later identified as Maria Pinaloza
Ambario, 34, a Pacoima factory worker and Castillo's wife. In his
truck, police found trash bags, gloves and a receipt for a carving
knife.</TE>
<TE>   At the couple's apartment, a detective found a bow saw, plastic
sheeting, knives and, in the garbage disposal, a human heart.
Surveillance video from outside the apartment the night of the
killing showed a man disposing of several trash bags. Ambario's
clothes and belongings were found in nearby trash bins.</TE>
<TE>   The defense did not dispute that Castillo killed and cut up his
wife of two years but argued there was no premeditation, urging a
finding of second-degree murder.</TE>

<LD>A Panorama City tile setter accused of strangling his wife,

Ventura County coast was found guilty of first-degree murder
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo, 38, bowed his head as Ventura County Superior
Court Judge Herbert Curtis III announced the verdict after a
three-day trial.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis, who decided the case after Castillo waived his right to a
jury trial, ruled that brain hemorrhages detected during an autopsy
of the victim's severed head show that Castillo strangled her for
several minutes--enough time to form a deliberate intent to kill.</LD>
<TE>   "The defendant did have the time to reflect on his actions,"
Curtis said. "I think in this case, he could have stopped."</TE>
<TE>   As Curtis set a Sept. 25 sentencing date, Castillo quietly raised
his hand, like a student in a classroom, indicating that he wanted to
speak.</TE>
<TE>   He turned to an interpreter sitting next to him and spoke to her
in urgent Spanish, then looked up at the judge as the interpreter
translated his words: "I would like to apologize for all this, that's
all."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis stepped off the bench without comment. Castillo was led by
sheriff's deputies to a nearby holding cell. He faces a minimum 25
years in state prison and could be held for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, the prosecutor on the case said the
evidence against Castillo was overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Dec. 6 after a Ventura County sheriff's deputy
stopped near Mugu Rock to investigate an illegally parked truck and
spotted Castillo climbing up a rocky area from the surf, splattered
with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo told authorities the blood was from a cut on his arm and
that he was climbing the rocks to dispose of a cat he had run over,
according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But deputies shining searchlights on the water saw human limbs
floating in the surf. The victim was later identified as Maria
Pinaloza Ambario, 34, a Pacoima factory worker and Castillo's wife.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of Castillo's truck, police found trash bags,
gloves and a receipt for a carving knife.</TE>
<TE>   At the couple's apartment, a detective found a bow saw, plastic
sheeting, knives and, in the garbage disposal, a human heart.
Surveillance video from outside the apartment the night of the
killing showed a man disposing of several trash bags. Ambario's
clothes and belongings were found in nearby trash bins.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, the defense did not dispute that Castillo killed and cut
up his wife of two years.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defender Doug Daily argued there was no evidence
his client planned the slaying. Daily described it as a sudden attack
that occurred during a domestic dispute and urged Curtis to find
Castillo guilty of the lesser crime of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   "As bad as this is, judge, what we have here is not an act that
you can say is cold, calculated, first-degree murder," Daily argued.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Harmon acknowledged in his closing
argument there was no evidence Castillo planned the killing.</TE>
<TE>   But Harmon argued that premeditation began when Castillo wrapped
his hands around Ambario's neck and began choking her. A prosecution
expert testified that injuries suggest the killer released his grip
at least once and strangled her for possibly five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon further argued that Castillo's meticulous dismemberment of
the body--the coroner testified the remains were cleanly cut at the
joints--and his disposal of Ambario's clothes show the crime was cold
and calculated.</TE>
<TE>   "He was trying," the prosecutor argued, "to make all traces of her
disappear."</TE>

<HD>State Lifts Ban on Cell Phone Use at Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California students may be able to take their cell phones and pagers
to school legally, under legislation signed this week by Gov. Gray
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The action reverses a statewide ban on cell phones and other
"electronic signaling devices" enacted in the 1980s to stop on-campus
drug dealing. But the new law allows school boards to decide whether
to permit cell phones on their campuses or to restrict their use.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the ban say the legislation, sponsored by state Sen.
Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), merely recognizes reality. In recent years,
students across the state have flouted the law. "By allowing school
districts to let its students use cell phones and pagers, families
can communicate better and students can feel a greater sense of
security while at school," Davis said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation followed three grass-roots repeal efforts. The
principal at Monroe High School in North Hills announced last year
that he would no longer enforce the law. A leadership class at Logan
High School in Union City urged Figueroa to submit a bill. La
Canada's school board also urged repeal. La Canada High School was
evacuated Sept. 11 because of its proximity to the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, feared to be a terrorist target. The youths' cell phones
were essential to evacuating all 1,200 students in half an hour.</TE>

<HD>$5 Million Awarded in Compton Cemetery Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury in Bellflower has returned $5 million in verdicts against a
cemetery in Compton for burying bodies in the shoulder of a roadway
after staging phony graveside services in a nearby grassy plot, an
attorney for the plaintiffs said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 250 verdicts were handed down Monday and Tuesday in a
class-action lawsuit filed in 1995 against Angeles Abbey Memorial
Park. Awards ranged from $1,000 to $125,000, depending on the
relationships between the plaintiffs and the deceased, according to
Santa Ana attorney Amador Corona.</LD>
<LD>   Corona said the cemetery moved a roadway, tearing up some of the
pavement and burying the bodies in a dirt area that had been covered
with asphalt. Confusion over the configuration of the new roadway led
motorists to drive over the dirt burial area, the attorney said.</LD>
<TE>   He said the only thing to indicate the presence of graves was a
series of numbers painted on a curb.</TE>
<TE>   Corona said several of the plaintiffs, most of whom are from
low-income, minority families, said they had been misled to believe
that their relatives were being buried in the grassy area where
interment services had been conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Since the lawsuit was filed, the dirt area has been sodded and
marked to indicate the graves, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Up to six bodies were buried in each grave, Corona said. Relatives
were aware from the outset that the deceased were being buried in
multiple-interment plots, he said.</TE>
<TE>   No one was available for comment Wednesday at Angeles Abbey. Scott
Cox, an attorney for the cemetery, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>9 Say They Made LAPD Short List</HD>
<DH>Police chief: Kroeker, Bratton, the force's Margaret York,
Sharon Papa and David and George Gascon say they are among 13
candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine law enforcement officials, almost all current or former members
of the Los Angeles Police Department, confirmed in interviews
Wednesday that they are among a short list of candidates for the
chief's position.</LD>
<LD>   The position opened up when Chief Bernard C. Parks stepped down
after the Police Commission's highly controversial decision to deny
him a second five-year term. The chief commands more than 9,000
officers responsible for policing 467 square miles. The new chief
will inherit a climbing murder rate and a dwindling interest in
police work among the city's most qualified men and women.</LD>
<LD>   The candidates, who will be interviewed by the Police Commission
starting next Wednesday, include:</LD>
<TE>   * LAPD Assistant Chief David Gascon, the department's chief of
staff. He is best known for his role as the department's spokesman
during the O.J. Simpson trial.</TE>
<TE>   * LAPD Deputy Chief Margaret A. York, the first woman in a top
position in the department. She is in charge of all operations in
downtown Los Angeles. Previously, she headed the internal affairs
unit. She is married to Judge Lance Ito, who presided at Simpson's
trial.</TE>
<TE>   * Deputy Chief David Kalish, the highest-ranking gay officer in
the LAPD. He served as the department's spokesman under Parks. He is
in charge of Westside operations.</TE>
<TE>   * LAPD Cmdr. Sharon Papa, formerly the chief of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority police. She briefly was a department
spokeswoman before becoming the department's ombudswoman.</TE>
<TE>   * LAPD Cmdr. James McDonnell, who oversees the senior lead officer
program and other community policing efforts as a special assistant
to acting Chief Martin Pomeroy.</TE>
<TE>   * LAPD Cmdr. George Gascon, who oversees training of LAPD officers
and recruits. He is no relation to David Gascon.</TE>
<TE>   * Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, who served as an LAPD
deputy chief under former Chief Willie Williams. He was one of three
finalists for the chief's position five years ago and left the
department shortly after then-Mayor Richard Riordan chose Parks.</TE>
<TE>   * Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, the
media-savvy head of the NYPD under ex-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He is best
know for dramatically cutting the crime rate in New York City. He
also was the head of the Boston Police Department and the New York
City transit police.</TE>
<TE>   * Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, formerly an LAPD deputy chief and
one of the department's highest-ranking Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, two other candidates up for interviews
include former Philadelphia Police Chief John Timoney and Sacramento
Police Chief Arturo Venegas, who was a finalist for the LAPD job five
years ago. Both men have declined to comment. Santa Ana Police Chief
Paul Walters has been named as another possible candidate. He was on
vacation Wednesday and could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission officials said Tuesday that they had narrowed
the list of candidates to 13.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have refused to release those names, citing privacy
concerns. However, commission President Rick Caruso said Tuesday that
the 13 men and women are an ethnically diverse group from within the
LAPD and other law enforcement agencies across the country.</TE>
<TE>   In a closed meeting, the commission voted candidate by candidate
whether to extend an interview invitation, Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the remaining 13 received the backing of all
commissioners, he said, but after each candidate was voted on, the
panel voted again and unanimously approved the list.</TE>
<TE>   Since April, former Deputy Chief Pomeroy has led the department on
a temporary basis. Pomeroy, who retired last year, said he plans to
return to his home in Montana once a new chief is selected.</TE>
<TE>   Under the City Charter, the commission will select its top three
choices and forward the names to Mayor James K. Hahn, who will make
the final decision, subject to City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the commission will pick six finalists, in case Hahn
rejects the three top contenders.</TE>
<TE>   He said the commission will adhere to the criteria created by a
blue-ribbon citizens committee in interviewing candidates.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the list of desired qualities is effective
leadership and the ability to inspire the department's officers.</TE>
<TE>   The new chief also should support reform efforts, boost community
policing, work to maintain the department's diversity, be a good
manager and know how to navigate the city's political waters, the
committee recommended.</TE>

<LD>Luis Miguel Ortiz Haro, a veteran Mexican government official and
member of that country's ruling political party, has been named the
new Mexican consul in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz Haro, 42, who has held a variety of jobs in Mexico's Federal
District, is moving to the United States today and will start his job
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The new consul has worked as a planner and development officer in
Mexico's capital, as well as an administrator in programs including
judicial matters, government employee benefits, traffic and citizen
complaints.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe there is a lot we as a government can do for Mexicans
living outside the country, in the United States," said Ortiz Haro.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to learn more about their needs."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana attorney Jess Araujo, who has served as a legal advisor
to previous consuls in Santa Ana as well as other Mexican nationals,
said he hopes to work closely with Ortiz Haro.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through five different counsels," Araujo said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just start with the next one. We'll try to make it easy for
the new consul by connecting him with the right people to add
stability."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government maintains 48 consulates in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Those in California are the most active, particularly after some
U.S. government agencies decided this year to accept Mexican
identification cards, which consulates can issue.</TE>
<TE>   Consulates have been besieged since with requests for the cards.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Angel Isidro, the previous consul, left this month for
Guatemala in a routine transfer after three years in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Isidro helped win acceptance of the Mexican identification card,
the matricula consular.</TE>
<TE>   Matriculas are accepted as identification in several U.S. cities
and some banks.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Isidro was credited with improving relations
between Mexican immigrants and police, who frequently turned
immigrants taken into custody over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, people were deported after minor traffic offenses
because they could not show proof of identity.</TE>

<HD>2nd Video Is Said to Justify Shooting</HD>
<DH>Police: Downey asserts that a squad car tape backs
officers' story on fatal incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A spokesman for the city of Downey said Wednesday that a second,
unreleased video of the police shooting of Gonzalo Martinez shows
Martinez's hands were not raised at the time, supporting the city's
contention that the shooting was justified.</LD>
<LD>   A video of the Feb. 15 shooting, taped by a freelancer, has
brought months of protests in Downey and was shown repeatedly on
local Spanish-language television and in Argentina, where Martinez's
parents came from. But the case has frustrated the family because it
has drawn less attention than the highly publicized beating of a
16-year-old in Inglewood in July.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the family again held a news conference at the
offices of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
Afterward, the city spokesman detailed the contents of the second
tape.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Alaniz of Hill &amp; Knowlton, the public relations firm hired
by the city to represent it in the case, said the second video, shot
with a camera mounted on the dashboard of a police car that had
pursued Martinez, would not be released until the district attorney's
office finishes its investigation of the Feb. 15 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The second video was shot at a different angle from the footage
that has aired on television. That initial tape shows Martinez, 26,
with at least one arm raised. He was unarmed, police have confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Alaniz said the police video would be made available to the media
"when, as we expect, the district attorney concurs with [our
opinion], that this shooting was justified."</TE>
<TE>   He said the district attorney's office has been provided with the
police video.</TE>
<TE>   Downey "is trying to urge the D.A. to push forward on his
investigation," Alaniz said.</TE>
<TE>   At the district attorney's office, however, spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said no one from the city "has asked us to speed up."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said the "wrap-up" of the investigation began only after
May 1, when the Downey police delivered its investigative findings on
the shooting, and then was delayed by the July 6 police videotaped
beating case in Inglewood, which initially was assigned to the same
senior investigator.</TE>
<TE>   After Inglewood, "we had to assign another investigator to the
Downey case," Gibbons said. Now, she said, it may take another two to
three weeks to finish the Downey investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also is investigating the Martinez shooting, which has led
to demonstrations by the Martinez family and Latino activists.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the city agreed to allow another protest march
Saturday. The ACLU had threatened to sue to force Downey to open its
streets to demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police account, the shooting occurred after a
12-minute chase, during which Martinez at one point backed his car
toward officers in an apparent attempt to run them over. A coroner's
report added that, when Martinez later emerged from his car, he made
"furtive" movements with one hand, which led the police to open fire.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lerman, the attorney who is representing the family in a
lawsuit against the city, said that he has been trying, so far
without success, to obtain a copy of the police video and that he
believes there may even be a third video, shot from a police
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Lerman said, the district attorney's investigation
has had access to eyewitnesses who believe that the police shooting
of Martinez was not justified.</TE>
<TE>   If the eyewitnesses are given proper credence, "they'll have no
choice but to find that this shooting was not only not justified but
was a criminal act," Lerman said.</TE>

<HD>Defections Stall Bill to Allow Purchase of Toll Lanes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Legislation that would allow the Orange County Transportation
Authority to buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes was in jeopardy
Wednesday after two key legislators pulled their support.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would allow OCTA to take over 10 miles of toll lanes in
the center of the Riverside Freeway between Anaheim Hills and Corona.
The sale would remove a state ban on improvements to the congested
road, which serves as the main commuter artery between Orange and
Riverside counties. Officials said the sale would ultimately ease
traffic in one of Southern California's most intense commuting
corridors.</LD>
<LD>   Passing the bill this session is considered crucial because the
toll road's owner has said it will pull out of the sale if
legislation isn't passed this year.</LD>
<TE>   Time is running out as lawmakers scramble to meet Saturday's
deadline to pass this year's bills.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) said he
cannot support the legislation because an amendment he wanted did not
make it into the final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte insisted that the bill require Riverside County to spend
$500 million--as it has promised--for improvements to the freeway.
Riverside County officials successfully fought Brulte's changes,
saying a mandate would usurp local control over the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the desire for local control, but I'm the one being
asked to vote for this," Brulte said Wednesday from the Senate floor.
"What if I voted for this and 15 years from now, none of the
improvements have been made?"</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) announced late Wednesday that
he would oppose the bill because language he wanted requiring that
OCTA fund Riverside Freeway improvements was also rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's author, Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), said he
still hopes the bill will get through. It was approved Wednesday by
the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Correa hopes it will be
voted on today in the full Senate. It also must be approved by the
Assembly before being sent to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature.</TE>
<TE>   Correa said he was disappointed at Wednesday's developments. Mike
Ward, an OCTA board member from Irvine, shared Correa's frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought that if the thing got messed up, it would get
messed up by politics in Sacramento," Ward said. "If that happens,
people sitting in their car on the freeway need to be reminded who
did this to them."</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats are philosophically opposed to toll roads,
including Davis, who announced in March that "as long as I'm
governor, freeways are staying free."</TE>

<HD>OCTA's 91 Toll-Lane Deal in Trouble</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bill allowing the sale loses the support of a

<LD>Legislation that would allow the Orange County Transportation

<LD>   The bill would allow OCTA to take over 10 miles of toll lanes in

The sale would remove a state ban on improvements to the congested

<TE>   Time is running out as lawmakers scramble to meet Saturday's

<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) said he
cannot support the legislation because an amendment he wanted did not
make it into the final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte insisted that the bill require Riverside County to spend
$500 million--as it has promised--for improvements to the freeway.
Riverside County officials successfully fought Brulte's changes,
saying a mandate would usurp local control over the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the desire for local control, but I'm the one being

"What if I voted for this and 15 years from now, none of the
improvements have been made?"</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) announced late Wednesday that

OCTA fund Riverside Freeway improvements was also rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's author, Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), said he
still hopes the bill will get through. It was approved Wednesday by
the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Correa hopes it will be
voted on today in the full Senate. The bill also must be approved by
the Assembly before being sent to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature.</TE>
<TE>   Correa said he was disappointed at Wednesday's developments.
"Clearly, not having Brulte on the bill is not good news," Correa
said. "We'll keep working."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ward, an OCTA board member from Irvine, shared Correa's
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought that if the thing got messed up, it would get
messed up by politics in Sacramento," Ward said. "If that happens,
people sitting in their car on the freeway need to be reminded who
did this to them."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, introduced just two weeks ago, faced hurdles from the
start. Many Democrats in Sacramento are philosophically opposed to
toll roads, including Davis, who announced in March that "as long as
I'm governor, freeways are staying free."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democratic legislators called it unfair for inland commuters
who work in Orange County but can't afford to live there to be forced
to pay tolls for an easier drive to work. Critics also argue that the
toll lanes, which opened in 1996, contributed to the traffic on the
Riverside Freeway because the state promised not to make improvements
to the road that would coax cars off the toll lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Correa hoped that high-powered support from a united coalition of
Democrats and Republicans from Orange and Riverside counties would
overcome the critics. The Riverside Freeway is among the most
congested in Southern California, handling more than 250,000 vehicles
a day.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA earlier this year offered to pay the California Private
Transportation Co. $207.5 million for the lanes, which were built for
about $135 million. The public agency would continue to charge tolls
until the lanes were paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through great pains to get to a [sales price]," OCTA
spokesman George Urch said. If the bill fails to win approval, the
agency would have to go through purchase negotiations again "and it
would be a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   "In the next 20 years, Orange County's population is expected to
grow by 600,000 people [and] west Riverside County will double in
size," Urch said. "We've got to do something with the 91 ....If this
[legislation] doesn't pass, at least we know we did our best to help
the people who use this road."</TE>

<HD>Jury Hears Teen Testify Against Westerfield</HD>
<DH>Hearing: A 19-year-old says an incident occurred 12 years
before the Van Dam murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A former niece testified Wednesday that, when she was 7 years old,
David Westerfield stuck his finger in her mouth while she was
sleeping and began "playing with my teeth."</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came on the first day of the penalty portion of
Westerfield's trial for kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle
van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Under state law, a jury in a penalty trial can consider prior
misconduct by the defendant, even if it did not result in a criminal
charge or investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The young woman was called by the prosecution in an attempt to
show that Westerfield had a tendency toward making improper advances
on underage girls. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek told jurors in
Superior Court that Westerfield deserves to be executed.</TE>
<TE>   The witness, 19, who was identified as Jenny Lynn, said she had
bitten Westerfield to get him to stop, but that she had not shouted
or called for her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I was too freaked out about it," she said. "I didn't understand
what was going on." She added that Westerfield removed his finger
from her mouth only after she bit him "as hard and as long as I
could."</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Lynn's mother testified that her daughter had told her about
the incident a week later, and that she had reacted angrily with
Westerfield. But she added that her daughter had not given enough
details to make her disbelieve Westerfield when he responded that the
girl was lying.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Lynn testified that she had not spoken of the incident in 12
years before she told investigators about it after Westerfield was
arrested in late February for the Van Dam murder. Westerfield was
married to Jenny Lynn's aunt at the time of the alleged incident; he
and the aunt have since divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors played part of a tape recording of a police
interrogation of Westerfield that took place soon after Danielle
disappeared in which he said that Jenny Lynn's mother "came to me
with a story about how I had molested her children." A second
daughter was said to have been sleeping beside Jenny Lynn at the time
of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening remarks, defense attorney Steven Feldman said he
would call dozens of witnesses to testify about Westerfield's
kindness toward them. Among them, he said, will be people helped by
the medical and rehabilitation devices that Westerfield, 50, a design
engineer, has developed to help handicapped or injured persons.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't try to excuse the crime. There is no excuse," Feldman
said. "But David Alan Westerfield is not the worst of the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman also suggested that doubts linger about Westerfield's
guilt. The jury deliberated for 40 hours over nine days before
reaching its guilty verdict last week.</TE>
<TE>   Also taking the stand Wednesday were the dead girl's parents,
Brenda and Damon van Dam, who testified to the pain that the family
has suffered. An urn with her ashes sits in a place of prominence in
the family home, and her room has been preserved "so we won't forget
her," her father told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of time, I can't sleep at night," Brenda van Dam said, "so
I go in there [Danielle's bedroom] to cry ..."</TE>

<HD>Judge Lifts Ban on Firing Officer in Taped Beating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge lifted a temporary restraining order against the Inglewood
Police Department on Wednesday, clearing the way for Officer Jeremy
Morse to be fired for his conduct during a videotaped beating of a
handcuffed 16-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lois A. Smaltz ruled that
the department had not violated Morse's civil rights during its
internal investigation of the July 6 incident. After hearing
arguments in a Redondo Beach courtroom, Smaltz denied a request by
Morse's attorney for an injunction that would have prevented any
discipline against the officer.</LD>
<LD>   Inglewood Police Chief Ronald Banks recommended Aug. 1 that Morse
be fired and gave the officer written notification of the decision.
But Judge Jean E. Matusinka blocked the department from further
action.</LD>
<TE>   Now Banks plans to move forward with disciplining Morse, who is on
paid administrative leave from the department. Morse will have an
opportunity to meet with Banks personally, and can request an
arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   The videotape of Morse slamming Donovan Jackson against a police
car and punching him in the face brought a nationwide outcry and
accusations of police brutality. Three days later, Inglewood Mayor
Roosevelt Dorn called for Officer Morse to be fired and prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was indicted July 17 by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on
a criminal charge of assault under the color of authority. His
partner, Bijan Darvish, was indicted on a charge of filing a false
police report.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department recommended a short suspension for Darvish,
but was temporarily blocked from disciplining him as well. A judge
will hear arguments today on Darvish and on Antoine Crook, another
officer who was at the scene and faces disciplinary action.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's attorney, Richard Levine, argued Wednesday that the
department had violated the police officers' bill of rights, a state
code that spells out protections for officers. Levine alleged that
Morse had not been advised of his constitutional rights before he was
initially questioned, and had not been allowed to have his preferred
attorney present at a later interrogation. Levine also said that
Morse had not been provided with all relevant notes, reports and
other documents.</TE>
<TE>   Smaltz ruled that, on the basis of the evidence presented, the
internal investigation had been proper.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Senior Assistant City Atty. Emmerline Foote said later
that Smaltz's decision was good for the city because it allows
supervisors to do their jobs. If the judge had ruled in favor of
Morse, supervisors would not have been able to question officers
about their use of force, she said. "It would have resulted in a
really absurd situation," Foote said. "Sometimes on the scene, you
need to know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Police Assn. President Neil Murray said the ruling was
disappointing. He said he believes there were violations of the
officers' bill of rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hopeful that a judge would see there was a need to issue
an injunction to hold off on the discipline," Murray said, adding
that an appeal would be considered. "Obviously that wasn't the case."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that he remained hopeful, but that Wednesday's
decision did not bode well for today's hearing. "We're preparing for
the worst."</TE>

<HD>Assembly Panel Revives Insurance-Discount Bill</HD>
<DH>Capitol: The measure is backed by Mercury firm, a heavy
contributor to lawmakers. Insurance chief opposes it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers have revived legislation that would undermine the authority
of the state's insurance commissioner and benefit a company that has
contributed generously to lawmakers from both parties.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, SB 689, would allow automobile insurers to offer
discounts to customers who have continuously purchased insurance. A
similar bill was voted down by a Senate committee earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Pushing to bring it back to life was Mercury Insurance Group, a
Los Angeles-based carrier that has donated to two-thirds of the
Legislature in the last two years, including contributions of
$174,000 to Assembly Insurance Committee Chairman Thomas Calderon
(D-Montebello).</LD>
<TE>   At an impromptu hearing Monday night, the measure passed the
committee 14-2 despite a warning from the committee's lawyer that it
would probably violate the provisions of Proposition 103, the
voter-approved initiative establishing regulation of the insurance
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would stop a move by Insurance Commissioner Harry
Low to outlaw the discount on grounds that it requires customers who
are not eligible for the price break to pay higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   In a memo circulated to lawmakers, Low asked for defeat of the
bill, arguing that it "circumvents the commissioner's authority,"
undermines the new regulations and would discourage uninsured
motorists from buying coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Those without prior insurance would end up paying significantly
more in premiums to offset the discount," Low wrote the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Snodgrass, a lobbyist for Mercury, told lawmakers her
company had been offering the discount for years and it now needed
their help to stop Low from acting.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bill allows you to shop for prices and allows you choices in
the marketplace," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), author of the legislation, argued
that lawmakers had a greater prerogative to make rules that were
typically reserved for the commissioner because Low was not elected
to his post.</TE>
<TE>   Low was appointed to the job by Gov. Gray Davis after the elected
commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, resigned to avoid impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush was accused of allowing insurance companies to avoid
fines for mishandling Northridge earthquake claims by paying into a
foundation that then spent the money for his political benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) disagreed with Perata,
saying that as a former appellate court justice, Low was
better-suited than an elected commissioner to make a deliberative
decision not influenced by politics.</TE>
<TE>   While most insurance groups supported the bill, it had strong
opposition from consumer groups, which argued that it would
disproportionately affect the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Only an insurer who's given to a vast majority of the politicians
could push a controversial anti-consumer bill like this through the
Legislature in the final week of its session," said Douglas Heller, a
lobbyist for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's
impossible for poor people and all California consumers to stop this
kind of a juggernaut."</TE>
<TE>   Heller noted that all 14 members of the committee who voted for
the measure had received contributions from Mercury in the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation surfaced on Sunday afternoon--six days before the
end of the legislative session--when a measure by Perata dealing with
prostate cancer was amended to become a bill that allowed insurance
companies to offer the discount.</TE>
<TE>   It is expected to come up in the Assembly today.</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Accused of Starting 5 Blazes in San Diego
County</HD>
<DH>Crime: The 19-year-old with the California Conservation
Corps is arrested. The fires destroyed two homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A 19-year-old firefighter with the California Conservation Corps was
arrested Wednesday on suspicion of setting five fires in the Julian
area of northern San Diego County this week that burned 275 acres and
destroyed two homes.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Patrick Klausen was being held in County Jail on five
felony charges, his bail set at $250,000.</LD>
<LD>   Roxanne Provaznik, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Prevention, said residents had reported seeing
suspicious activity before the fires.</LD>
<TE>   Fire investigators coordinated information about when and where
the fires had erupted with information about where corps firefighters
had been stationed at the time. Many of the firefighters were part of
the force that fought the Pines Fire, which broke out July 29 and
destroyed 37 homes and blackened 62,000 acres in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   Klausen is not the first firefighter to be arrested and charged
with setting fires in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Robles, 26, is serving a 17-year state prison sentence after
being convicted of setting a series of fires near his Escondido home
in the summer of 1997, destroying 13 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Phillips, 53, who served as a volunteer firefighter near
his home in Ramona, is in state prison after being convicted in 1996
of setting 16 wildfires. Investigators suspect he set more than 200
wildfires throughout San Diego County, beginning in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   This week's fires--which began between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Tuesday--led to the evacuation of hundreds of residents, many of whom
had to flee July's Pines Fire.</TE>
<TE>   "A special thanks goes to the citizens of Julian for their quick
reporting of the fires and observations that helped lead to an
arrest," Provaznik said.</TE>
<TE>   Klausen was in a one-year program to help him earn his high school
diploma.</TE>

<HD>2 Armed Men Seize Boy, 9, in Violent Abduction</HD>
<DH>Kidnapping: Child was at center of a bitter custody fight.
Father is beaten by Palm Desert intruders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD, TINA DIRMANN and JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>Adding to what suddenly seems a long list of children plucked from
their homes, two armed men burst into a house early Wednesday,
grabbed a 9-year-old boy who is the subject of a bitter custody
dispute, beat his father and fled in an SUV, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials were searching Wednesday night for the boy's mother--and
pleading with her through the media to come forward.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Michael Farber was wearing only his briefs when he was
taken just after 2 a.m. from the home he shares with his father in
Palm Desert, near Palm Springs.</LD>
<TE>   The father, Michael Farber, was beaten in the face and body by the
two men before the boy was taken, officials said. Farber was able to
call 911 on his cellular telephone before he was taken to a hospital,
where he was treated and released.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the kidnapping had been carried out with alarming
precision.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some thought that went into this," said Riverside
County Sheriff-elect Bob Doyle. "The suspects came in with a mission
and they accomplished their mission. They took care of their business
as they saw it and then got out."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas' parents married in 1991 and underwent an unpleasant
divorce in 1995, according to authorities and court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Debra Rose, 38, of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
could not be reached Wednesday, nor could she be located by
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rose has been married and divorced five times, according to court
records. Michael Farber was her third husband.</TE>
<TE>   Rose recently landed in a Colorado detention center after
violating a restraining order, according to Sheriff's Lt. Melissa
Hartman in El Paso County, Colo. The restraining order was related to
a dispute with another former husband, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   She was arrested by Colorado Springs police on Aug. 15 and was
released the next day after posting an $800 bail bond. Officials said
she missed a scheduled court appointment in an unrelated civil matter
Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Farber only recently obtained temporary custody of Nicholas, who
had been living with his mother in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   After Rose's arrest, Farber had received a telephone call from
another of her ex-husbands advising him to pick up the child,
acquaintances said.</TE>
<TE>   Farber then went to Colorado and was unhappy with the boy's living
conditions, said his San Pedro attorney, Terry Ponchak. A judge
granted Farber temporary custody and the two returned to California,
the attorney said. Farber and Rose were scheduled to appear in court
to debate permanent custody of Nicholas on Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy's only been with him a couple weeks," said Ralph Pierce,
72, whose niece owns the home Michael Farber rents. Pierce came to
the one-story white stucco house Wednesday to drop off some granite
for a kitchen remodeling, learning of the abduction from reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody called him in the middle of the night and said, 'You'd
better come get the kid, because she's in jail,' " Pierce said. "He's
just a super nice guy. He's the kind of guy who wouldn't hurt a soul.
He doesn't have a mean bone in his body."</TE>
<TE>   According to documents filed in Orange County, where Rose lived
before moving to Colorado, Michael Farber accused his ex-wife during
the custody dispute of being a drug addict and said she suffers from
migraines so severe that she is unable to care for Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been disruptive in my child's school, where she was ordered
not to appear unless she limits her visit to the school office,"
Farber said in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   After another trip to Colorado, court records say, Farber could
not locate Nicholas. He eventually found him, he wrote in court
documents, in a storage facility, "tired, dirty ... and hungry."</TE>
<TE>   "I firmly believe that my son is in danger if he is allowed to
remain with his mother," Farber wrote in the court documents. "I can
provide my son a safe environment."</TE>
<TE>   Another of Rose's ex-husbands filed an affidavit supporting
Farber's petition for custody of the boy, also alleging that Rose is
addicted to prescription drugs, including morphine.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Fritz, the Newport Beach attorney who represented Rose
during her divorce from Farber, said she is no longer in touch with
the boy's mother. "But I can't believe she has anything to do with
this," Fritz said. "It doesn't fit her at all."</TE>
<TE>   Despite suggestions that domestic troubles might be behind the
kidnapping, officials continued to call it a "stranger abduction."</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, two [men] came in and abducted the boy," said
FBI Special Agent Matt McLaughlin. "Now we are simply in attack mode,
trying to get a missing child home."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities tried to appeal to Rose through a series of news
conferences Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Debra, please contact us," Sheriff-elect Doyle said. "We need to
talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County Sheriff's Capt. Patrick McManus also had a
message for the two kidnappers: "We will find you."</TE>
<TE>   The case follows highly publicized child abductions around the
country, including the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle
van Dam near San Diego and the slaying of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion
near Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle said that the number of child abductions is not actually on
the rise. Instead, he said, a coincidental series of dramatic and
shocking cases has grabbed the nation's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is more attentive right now because of the more
horrific cases lately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not issue a so-called Amber alert for the sport
utility vehicle used in Wednesday's kidnapping because, officials
said, they did not have enough information about the vehicle, other
than that it was white.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they were also searching for a second vehicle, a
gray 2002 GMC pickup truck with the temporary plate H12197. They
stressed that the pickup was a "witness vehicle" and had not been
used in the abduction. But they said that Rose had access to that
truck.</TE>
<TE>   A composite sketch of one of the kidnappers was released late
Wednesday. He is described as 5 feet 8, 175 pounds with black hair.
He is between 20 and 30 years old and has a goatee, officials said.
The other man was wearing a stocking over his face, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the case was asked to call a hotline
at (760) 836-1632.</TE>

<HD>County Survey Finds Gains, Losses in Children's Welfare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The health, safety and social conditions of children in Los Angeles
County showed steady improvement at the close of the 1990s, but a
comprehensive new study also found troubling inequalities, depending
on where youngsters live.</LD>
<LD>   The Children's Scorecard, released by the county's Children's
Planning Council today, showed declines in the numbers of children
living in poverty, exposed to violent crime and born with low birth
weight.</LD>
<LD>   During the same period--1995-99--however, crimes committed on
school campuses increased, as did cases of sexually transmitted
disease among Los Angeles County teenagers. And despite the era's
strong economy, almost one-third of the county's 2.6 million children
lived in low-income families at the dawn of the new millennium.</LD>
<TE>   The study found alarming disparities among the eight geographical
areas into which planners divide the county. For instance, 40% of
poor children are concentrated in two adjacent regions--a swath of
territory that stretches from Hollywood to Compton and encompasses
downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Lynwood. In this same
area, nearly 30% of children lack any kind of health insurance,
compared with 20% countywide.</TE>
<TE>   "The most compelling part of the findings is the differences in
kids' well-being around the county," said Jacquelyn McCroskey, a USC
professor of social work who helped prepare the scorecard. "While
some overall trends are going in the right direction, we can and
should be doing better by all of our children."</TE>
<TE>   The study echoes recent census reports and other research showing
that Los Angeles County has made progress.</TE>
<TE>   The number of children living in poverty decreased 21% over the
five-year period, homicides of children younger than 18 dropped 51%
and the number of newborns with low birth weight, an indicator of
possible health troubles ahead, declined 9%.</TE>
<TE>   But the county still lags far behind other California counties and
the nation in erasing the income gaps among its young.</TE>
<TE>   And in its tidbits of regional intelligence, the study evokes a
vivid impression of how differently lives are lived across the vast
expanse of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the rate of young adults registered to vote ranged
from 30% in metropolitan Los Angeles to 73% in the Antelope Valley,
while the percentage of high school students who graduated with their
class ranged from 40% in the Antelope Valley to 75% in the San
Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Schools in the San Gabriel Valley, which includes communities like
Pasadena, Baldwin Park and Pomona, recorded the most campus crimes.
The areas with the highest 1999 rate of felony arrests of children 10
to 17 were the Antelope Valley, which includes communities like
Palmdale and Lancaster, with a rate of 2,441 per 100,000 youngsters,
and the Westside, with 1,862 such arrests per 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The number of children and young adults up to age 24 hospitalized
for assault injuries showed wide geographic differences: 37 in the
Antelope Valley in 1999, compared with 595 in South Los Angeles
communities such as Watts, Compton and Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the study confirm how profoundly the wealth of a
community can affect its children.</TE>
<TE>   * The rate of girls younger than 18 giving birth was 22 per 1,000
in South Los Angeles compared with 5 per 1,000 girls on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   * Eighty-five percent of public school teachers on the Westside
were fully credentialed, compared with 58% of teachers in South Los
Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   * Eight-seven percent of Westside mothers had at least a high
school education compared with 46% of mothers on the Southside.</TE>
<TE>   * Fifty-five percent of third-graders in Westside communities such
as Santa Monica and Culver City read at their grade level, compared
with 19% of third-graders in central and mid-city communities,
including El Sereno, West Hollywood and Pico-Union.</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Planning Council has been measuring the conditions
of children since 1994 but this year's scorecard is the first to
provide a detailed profile of the eight geographic regions it serves.
Each region has an advisory council composed of members of community
groups, schools, churches, city and county agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Council Executive Director Yolie Flores Aguilar said the
data are important because school districts, county and city
governments and nonprofit groups spend nearly $18 billion a year on
Los Angeles County children.</TE>
<TE>   Given the current uncertain economy, resources must be used wisely
and communities must be encouraged to make improvements, she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are already examples of communities moving to resolve issues
pinpointed by the scorecard data.</TE>
<TE>   In South Los Angeles communities that have a disproportionate
number of children in foster care, the regional council is working
with the county Department of Children and Family Services to help
relatives keep children who might otherwise be placed with foster
families.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, grandparents and other relatives either do not know
about or cannot meet strict standards for such things as fencing,
smoke alarms and number of bedrooms to become caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   Community groups are working to get them information and to
collaborate with businesses such as Home Depot that might provide
tools and equipment that would make it easier to meet guidelines.</TE>

<HD>L.A. City College Steps Into Future</HD>
<DH>East Hollywood: Today the down-at-the-heels campus will
begin $147 million in renovation projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time hasn't been kind to Los Angeles City College, the site of the
original UCLA campus and an alma mater of such Hollywood actors as
Robert Vaughn and James Coburn.</LD>
<LD>   The tightly packed, 48-acre campus in east Hollywood is dotted
with tired buildings put up in the Great Depression. Its newest
structure is 20 years old.</LD>
<LD>   "When I first came here, I looked at this campus and wondered why
I decided to come," said Mary S. Spangler, president of the school
and an administrator there since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   But today the school will formally launch $147 million in
construction and renovation projects to revitalize the campus. The
aim is to modernize the facilities while making the campus, which is
easy to miss while driving by, more inviting to residents of the
Hollywood area.</TE>
<TE>   Projects scheduled to be constructed over the next five years
include a student admissions center; a math, science and technology
building; and a health, fitness and physical education facility. They
will be among the first major construction efforts stemming from
voters' approval in April 2001 of Proposition A, a $1.2-billion bond
issue program for the Los Angeles Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall "Mark" Drummond, chancellor of the community college
district, said the improvements are badly needed. Los Angeles City
College, the oldest of the district's nine campuses, was established
as a two-year school in 1929 after previously serving as the campus
for UCLA and its predecessor schools dating to 1914.</TE>
<TE>   "They've made some strides in the last few years, but with a
number of buildings, like the [chemistry] building, it's just
hopeless," Drummond said, referring to a 1930s-vintage building to be
replaced by the new math, science and technology facility.</TE>
<TE>   Drummond added that the existing men's physical education
building, also being torn down for a new facility, "is so old that
we've had the pool condemned for years. It's really good to get that
out of there. It almost borders on being an unsafe building."</TE>
<TE>   Spangler, the campus president for five years, says the new
buildings will house some new academic and student service programs.
The math, science and technology building, for example, eventually
will house a nursing program being launched this semester, a full 17
years after the campus' last one was shut down.</TE>
<TE>   For that move, Spangler has drawn praise from Assemblywoman Jackie
Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), whose mother studied at the city college
campus when it still was the site of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The campus has three hospitals nearby: Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center and Queen of
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to have a nursing program, to me, was just a crime," Goldberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new program "will mean a lot to that community, because there
are a lot of folks who would like to become nurses, and we have a
terrible nursing shortage."</TE>
<TE>   The projects funded with the Proposition A money are just the
first phase of a $250-million master plan developed by the college to
guide development over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the next phase, Spangler hopes to add a $23-million library on
the outer edge of the campus, which community residents would be
encouraged to use. Later on, the school hopes to add a $25-million
performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   The school's attempts to upgrade in recent years have ignited some
opposition. A deal with a developer to build a for-profit golf
driving range at Melrose and New Hampshire avenues, on five acres of
college property immediately south of the current campus, is being
challenged in a campaign led by an alumnus, Duke Russell, who calls
it a misuse of public land. He said he is trying to find financial
backers to challenge the deal in court.</TE>
<TE>   Russell also considers it wasteful to use $2 million of
Proposition A money to move the school's athletic field to another
area of the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Spangler said the college and the district, in hindsight,
"probably" should not have pursued the golf course deal, which is
expected to bring the school $1.2 million over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But she explained that the district legally obligated itself to go
forward before Proposition A passed, when the college was in far
weaker shape financially. In addition, Spangler said, the college can
take back the land in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Spangler expressed no reservations about plans for the athletic
field, which is to be moved from the corner of Vermont and
Willowbrook avenues, on the northeast corner of the campus, to the
southwest corner of campus near Melrose Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Spangler said she wants to create a dramatic entrance for the
campus at Vermont and Willowbrook that will both "make a statement"
to the surrounding community and take advantage of proximity to the
MTA Red Line station. It will feature a grove of trees and maybe a
water fountain and bell tower.</TE>
<TE>   "Too much of what I heard when I first came here was that people
ride by on the bus and they don't even know what's beyond the walls
here," Spangler said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come up from the MTA station now, what greets you? A
chain-link fence and a field, and you can't access the college," she
added. "By moving the stadium to the other part of the campus ... we
now can open up that door."</TE>

<HD>Bill to Force Mental Treatment Gains</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Law would close gap in involuntary treatment
if a judge finds patient a risk. Protection of tribal sites advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Landmark legislation that would commit mentally ill people to
involuntary treatment programs if a court found that they were likely
to become dangerous without special intervention was approved
Wednesday by the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The bill cleared the upper house as the Legislature plowed toward
scheduled adjournment Saturday with hundreds of bills in play and no
sign of an end to the state budget stalemate that has plagued
lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis all summer.</LD>
<LD>   In the Assembly, a heavily disputed bill that would give American
Indian tribes more power to protect their sacred sites from land
developers was approved over the objection of opponents who claimed
it would give them too much power.</LD>
<TE>   The mental-health bill, the third attempt at such reform after
years of failure, seeks to fill a gap in the pioneering state law
that allows the forced detention of mentally ill people who are
considered to be a danger to themselves or others.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current Lanterman-Petris-Short law, forced detention can
stretch from 72 hours to six months, depending on a patient's
recovery progress.</TE>
<TE>   But some advocates for the mentally ill cite a "core" group of
people who do not meet the detention requirements of the 30-year-old
law. Many live on the streets and need the special attention offered
in local voluntary outpatient programs but refuse it, the advocates
say. Consequently, they become regular occupants of jails and
hospitals, often because they quit taking their medications.</TE>
<TE>   Their behavior can be abusive to others, including threats of
violence, but does not rise to the level of being classified as a
danger to themselves or others or of being so "gravely disabled" that
they must be involuntarily locked up for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, AB 1421 by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), would
seek to plug the gap by creating a new hearing process in court,
where the patient would be represented by a public defender or
private attorney in an adversarial proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues, a judge would have to decide whether the
patient had a history of lack of compliance with treatment and within
the last four years had threatened or committed actual acts of
"serious violent" behavior against himself or others.</TE>
<TE>   In counties that agreed to participate, the patient would be
assigned to recently expanded outpatient treatment programs con-
sidered the "least restrictive" necessary to achieve recovery.</TE>
<TE>   On a bipartisan 27-8 vote, the Senate returned the bill to the
Assembly for approval of Senate changes. If the Assembly concurs, it
would go to Gov. Gray Davis, who has no position on the measure, a
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill to protect sacred sites of Native Americans--SB 1828 by
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)--would
establish a process under the state's primary environmental law to
restrict construction projects with potential adverse effects on
hallowed grounds of American Indians. Tribes would have to be
notified of any development proposal within a 20-mile radius of their
current lands in case the project might infringe on sacred sites,
defined as locations recognized for their ceremonial or religious
significance. The effects on those sites would have to be carefully
addressed and avoided as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argued that though many important Native American sites
have been destroyed, giving tribes such power over current sites
would have dramatic results on future land-use decisions. The
definition of a sacred site is loose at best, they said, noting that
for many tribes, entire mountains are considered special.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters argued that although the measure would pose serious
consequences for development, it is the least the Legislature could
do to protect a people who were almost exterminated and driven from
their finest land with help from militias hired by the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to claims by lobbyists that Native Americans are
winning protections now only because of their newfound gambling
casino wealth, Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) said, "You
are right." But that is because the money has allowed them to raise
children who have become lawyers and scientists who have fought to
preserve sacred land and reconnect with their culture, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real hard to maintain your religion if you're being
persecuted to extermination," Leonard said.</TE>

<HD>Candidates Favor a Valley Police Force</HD>

the council.</DH>

<LD>Most of the candidates for mayor of the proposed San Fernando Valley
city envision a new municipality with its own police force, tough
rent-control laws, a light-rail line and lower taxes that would
attract more businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Support is also broad among the 10 candidates for tighter noise
restrictions on Van Nuys Airport, continuation of Los Angeles'
"living wage" ordinance and smaller salaries for the new city's
elected officials than those proposed by secessionists.</LD>
<LD>   In interviews, the mayoral contenders laid out their broad plans
for a city that would be carved off from Los Angeles if a majority of
voters in the Valley and citywide approve the secession measure on
the Nov. 5 ballot. The candidates are running in that election and
would take office only if secession wins.</LD>
<TE>   A Valley city would begin operation July 1, 2003. During a
one-year transition, Los Angeles would provide all services to the
new city. After that, the Valley mayor and a 14-member city council
would have the option of contracting with Los Angeles or the county
for key services or providing them on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We essentially have a clean slate," said mayoral candidate Bruce
Boyer, who manages an alarm company.</TE>
<TE>   With few exceptions, the candidates say they favor as complete a
break from Los Angeles as practical. That would include ending
reliance on the Los Angeles Police Department after the Valley is
able to field its own police force--largely staffed with LAPD
officers transferred to the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "That way we can control our own destiny," said candidate Mel
Wilson, a Realtor. He and others said it may take a couple of years
for a Valley city to wean itself from the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral hopeful Leonard Shapiro, a journalist, said he wants a
Valley police department because "I don't believe the LAPD can ever
reform itself. ... I think the LAPD is beyond repair."</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates supporting a Valley police department include
insurance adjuster David Hernandez Jr., auditor Henry Divina,
activist Greg Roberts and Realtor Jim Summers.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure a Valley department would be the best option, most
candidates say they would ask the LAPD and county Sheriff's
Department to submit proposals for policing the Valley under a
contract arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   State Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), whom some see as
the front-runner in the race, said he would consider contracting with
the LAPD but not with the Sheriff's Department, which is facing
budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   Richman also said the LAPD would have to significantly boost its
Valley deployment of officers or he would push for the creation of a
Valley force.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department fares better with the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Richman, Wilson and others said they would support contracting
with the Fire Department at least for the near future. They said the
department has done a good job, although it is short-staffed.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more paramedics," said Wilson, a former city fire
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer is the only candidate who says the Valley city should not
adopt Los Angeles' rent-control laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Rent control destroys housing. It violates property owners'
rights and it needs to be phased out," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some candidates, including union activist Benny Bernal, said the
rent controls should be made stronger.</TE>
<TE>   On the living wage, only Boyer and Richman say they are hesitant
to adopt the Los Angeles law, which applies to city contractors. The
wage is $7.99 an hour for workers who receive benefits, $9.24 for
those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   A former member of the city redevelopment board, Richman said the
wage law is "a detriment to development."</TE>
<TE>   All of the candidates would either reduce or eliminate the city's
tax on business receipts. Many say cities like Burbank and Glendale
are in a better position to attract business because they do not
charge such a tax.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we are not competitive with our neighbors," said
Wilson, who would cut the tax immediately by 10% to 15%, then reduce
it further as the new city got on its feet financially.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said he would cut the tax in half at first, with the goal
of eventually eliminating it. Candidate Marc Strassman, an Internet
consultant, would phase out the tax with annual cuts of 20%, while
Boyer and Shapiro would kill the tax outright.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the light-rail line embraced by Roberts, Wilson,
Summers and Hernandez would run east-west across the Valley,
replacing a planned busway. Richman and Shapiro support the busway as
a starting point for a broader transit system.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a better mass transit system for the Valley," Summers
said. "The bus project is just a temporary Band-Aid."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson wants to build a second light-rail line north-south across
the Valley, from Sylmar to North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   All the candidates say they would work with neighbors of Van Nuys
Airport to impose more stringent noise controls. Most were short on
details. Strassman, though, said he would like to see tighter curfews
for jets and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates differed on the specifics of an issue that would
affect their own pocketbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, the mayor and council members would be paid
$1,000 a month. But leaders of the Valley VOTE secession group have
proposed that a Valley city council put a measure on a future ballot
to increase the pay to $75,000 for council members and $100,000 for
mayor so they can serve full time.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez and Summers support the higher salaries, while Shapiro
and Boyer want the pay to stay at $1,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Strassman would set the council and mayor pay at the median salary
of all workers in the Valley; Roberts supports a $50,000 annual
salary for mayor; Divina says $60,000 is reasonable; and Bernal
suggests something below $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Before asking voters to approve higher salaries, Richman and
Wilson said, the new city should conduct a public discussion of how
significant the elected officials' role will be in the government.</TE>

<HD>5 Residents Die at Unlicensed Care Home That County Tried
to Close</HD>
<DH>Health: Authorities have described the Rosemead house as
'unclean, unsafe, unsanitary.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least five mentally ill residents of an unlicensed boarding house
in Rosemead died this year, two of them after Los Angeles County
authorities found "deplorable living conditions" at the home in March
and attempted to shut it. The county coroner determined that three of
the residents died of morphine overdose, although other medications
played a role in two of the deaths. The fourth patient died of
bleeding in the brain, and the fifth from still-undetermined causes.
All were living at the house on Tegner Street, which billed itself as
a sober-living facility.</LD>
<LD>   The county Sheriff's Department is investigating the deaths but
prosecutors have filed no criminal charges against the owner or
operator of the San Gabriel Valley home, which went by various names
including Sober R Us and San Gabriel House of Independence. It is
illegal for a boarding house to provide medical care or supervision
without a license.</LD>
<LD>   The home's owner is Yu-Chen "Tony" Wang of Chino Hills and the
manager is Kevin Slavin of Los Angeles, according to a sworn
declaration filed by a county sheriff's deputy. Neither man could be
reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the county Department of Mental Health took
rare disciplinary action against two psychiatric hospitals that had
referred patients to the Rosemead home.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health department officials contended that City of Angels
Medical Center-Ingleside and Hollywood Community Hospital of Van Nuys
improperly discharged to the Rosemead facility three of the patients
who later died. In letters sent in July to both hospitals and filed
in court, one top official described the boarding home as "unclean,
unsafe, unsanitary and in very poor condition."</TE>
<TE>   The county subsequently stripped City of Angels and Hollywood
Community of their authority to detain mentally ill patients and
treat them against their will. Both hospitals filed lawsuits in Los
Angeles Superior Court, asking that the county's disciplinary action
be overturned.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals contended that the county has unfairly blamed them.
Hospitals can recommend places for discharged patients to stay, but
"the patient's ultimate right is to live where they choose," said
City of Angels chief executive John Fenton.</TE>
<TE>   The patients who died were: Gary Michael Reddish, 33; Rudolfo
Fuentes, 32; Charles Edward Stiel, 27; Ryan Powell, 19; and Matthew
Lee Janssen, 42. Their hometowns were not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths highlight the difficulty of monitoring vulnerable
residents at unlicensed boarding houses, which do not fall clearly
within the jurisdiction of any regulatory agency.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, public officials this week said they were virtually
powerless even to put such facilities out of operation. Authorities
often don't find out about problems at unlicensed homes until a
resident is harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Task Force Formed</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a constituent brought concerns about the
Rosemead home to the attention of county Supervisor Gloria Molina,
and a multi-agency task force was formed to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   During a March 27 inspection, the team found more than 30 people
living in four bedrooms, including 20 who needed care for mental
disorders or substance abuse, according to mental health department
correspondence filed in court.</TE>
<TE>   The facility stored residents' prescription medications in open
cabinets, which allowed all residents to have access to each others'
prescriptions, the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear from court records or mental health department
correspondence where the patients who overdosed obtained morphine.</TE>
<TE>   Task-force investigators also found that the Rosemead facility
lacked telephone service and first aid supplies, according to the
documents. In fact, residents--not staff members--performed first aid
and CPR on two of the residents who died, the county alleged in the
court filings and letters to the psychiatric hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a resident had to walk to a pay phone on a nearby
corner to summon 911 for a patient who had died, the documents
stated.</TE>
<TE>   Several residents of the Rosemead home told investigators that
they had been moved there by Slavin after another boarding house he
managed, known as Priscilla's Place, was shut down, according to an
affidavit by a county mental health department employee. State and
local agencies closed the home after citing it for being unlicensed,
according to court documents filed by the county.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, after the March 27 inspection of the Rosemead home,
authorities moved most of the residents to other licensed facilities.
But the owner of the Rosemead home allowed other people to move in,
keeping the number of occupants less than six. The small number of
residents meant that the facility was just like any home under the
law, and even zoning inspectors could not take action against the
operator, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing that anybody could in fact do to shut them down
or board up their operation," said Roberta Fesler, senior assistant
county counsel. County officials from various agencies did, however,
visit the home regularly, she said, to ensure that no more than six
people lived there and that no one needed care or supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one resident died in April and another died in July. Within
days of the final death, the home was abandoned, and it was
subsequently boarded up by county workers.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said the residents were being misled by the
home's owner and operator. They were "duped out of their Social
Security benefits under the false pretense that they will be
receiving adequate licensed care while living at the facility,"
Sheriff's Deputy Stephen Opferman wrote in a July declaration filed
in court.</TE>
<TE>   Opferman wrote that the owner and operator of the Rosemead
facility "willfully and knowingly engaged in the theft of benefits
from dependent adults and are subjecting them to conditions likely to
cause great bodily injury or death."</TE>
<TE>   Unlicensed board-and-care centers have been a problem for years in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, home operators picked up destitute and disabled
people from skid row, took their Social Security checks and placed
them in decaying houses, according to an investigation by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the only punishment meted out so far has been
directed at psychiatric hospitals that allegedly sent patients to
unlicensed homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the level of what has happened here and the fact that
several people have died, we feel it is our responsibility to take
vigorous action," said David Meyer, chief deputy director of the
Department of Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at City of Angels said they were taken aback by the
county's action.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two City of Angels patients who died, one was discharged to
a different home 13 days before his death, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Rosemead after that without the hospital's knowledge,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   The second patient insisted on being discharged to the Rosemead
facility against doctor's advice, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He died 17 or 18 days later, after entering and being discharged
again from another psychiatric hospital, City of Angels officials
contended.</TE>
<TE>   Fenton disputed the county's claim that his staff should have
known about problems at the Rosemead home. "We had no knowledge,"
Fenton said. "We had no right to inspect the facility. We are not the
policing body. We are the caregiver."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Community lawyers and officials did not respond to
multiple requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, they argued that they could not legitimately be
held responsible for where a patient chooses to live after
hospitalization.</TE>

<CX>   Care home--A story in Thursday's California section incorrectly
referred to the location of an unlicensed boarding house. The home is
in an unincorporated area in the San Gabriel Valley. Los Angeles
County court filings had identified the home's location as Rosemead.

operator, Kevin Slavin.</CX>

<LD>A man convicted of murdering three Anaheim hospital workers in a 1999
rampage hours after his mother died at a nearby medical facility has
asked a jury to give him the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   "I dare you. I dare all of you to send me to death," Dung Trinh
told a jury this week during the penalty phase of his trial. "I
deserve it. I not only deserve it, I need it."</LD>
<LD>   Trinh, 46, of Anaheim, was convicted Aug. 19 of three counts of
first-degree murder with a special circumstance allegation of
multiple murder. The special-circumstance allegation makes Trinh
eligible for execution.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of a religious high school have submitted petitions that
could force a citywide vote on a proposal to rezone a parcel of land
to allow construction of Serra High School.</LD>
<LD>   The signature campaign is intended to clear the way for
construction of the school at the intersection of Camino Capistrano
and Junipero Serra Road. A hotel and commercial facility are planned
for the site.</LD>
<LD>   Plans to build the school on nearby land owned by a Christian
ministry fell through when the Rev. Robert Schuller's Rancho
Capistrano ministry said it was uncomfortable that religious
instruction at the school would be given by Roman Catholics.</LD>
<TE>   If city officials determine that Serra High boosters have
submitted enough valid signatures, the City Council would be
obligated to put the matter to a citywide vote.</TE>

<HD>Certain USC Band Members Were Probably Not Whistling a
Happy Tune</HD>

<LD>USC's college football opener is near, and the school's workouts have
been grueling. At one point during Wednesday's practice, four
participants were ordered to do push-ups because they were giving
less than 100%. I believe one of them was a trombonist.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, yes, I'm speaking here not of the football team, but of the
Trojan Marching Band, which also will take the field Monday night
during the USC-Auburn game. Band director Arthur Bartner is a
disciplinarian, which is why USC's musicians were ranked among the
top eight in the nation by USA Today. If only the football team could
fare as well.</LD>
<LD>   Letter imperfect: "I think I may have located Dan Quayle," quipped
David Putnam of KABC-TV. Putnam wondered if the former vice president
was behind the botched spelling of one city's name on press passes
issued for a visit by President Bush (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Ginny Rangel of Torrance didn't realize the Pacific
Ocean laps up on the shores of Pasadena until she read it in a real
estate ad (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Bob and Joanne Drake of Brea made the same happy discovery about
their hometown (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   "Our home should increase in price by at least $100,000," they
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   And Bob Padgett of Manhattan Beach snapped a shot of a real estate
sign that seemed to be a lot of talk about nothing (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Chavez Ravine's beach: As if the Dodgers didn't have
enough worries, what with the strike deadline, the team is being
bugged by those mischievous 99 Cents Only folks again.</TE>
<TE>   The chain has a sale on the type of ball that Dodger Stadium
ushers routinely seize in a (usually vain) effort to keep it from
being batted onto the field (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the Dodgers and 99 Cents Only chilled after the
the team's disastrous 1992 showing of 63 wins and 99 losses. The
chain ran newspaper ads that read, "Congratulations, Dodgers, on your
99 losses! You're just like us. Nothing over 99 ever!"</TE>
<TE>   Yer outta here! the Dodgers replied. The chain was ousted from the
team's annual Fan Appreciation Day giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed signals: Debby Yates points out that the bar with the "Sorry
We're Open" sign is Blackie's by the Sea, which is in Newport Beach,
but not the Balboa section of the city as I said. (I'm doing my
push-ups now.)</TE>
<TE>   She adds that the other side of the sign says: "Glad We're
Closed."</TE>
<TE>   Cary Stewart, meanwhile, was reminded of a joint called the Hang
Tree, which he used to visit in Sun Valley more than 35 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Its sign advertised tough steaks, warm beer, stale bread and hard
butter, Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   And the menu "offered T-Bones for $0.25 (with meat, $1.25)."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: When USC's band marched behind a convertible carrying
then-First Lady Pat Nixon in the 1973 Rose Parade, the front row of
uniformed, instrument-toting Trojans was actually composed of Secret
Service agents.</TE>

<HD>Fred Darrington, 91; Artist Sculpted His Masterpieces in
Sand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Darrington, 91, a British artist who gained acclaim through 70
years of sculpting masterpieces of sand, died Aug. 16 at his home in
Esher, Surrey.</LD>
<LD>   Until he was slowed by a stroke six years ago, Darrington had
spent every summer for seven decades on the beach at Weymouth, a
resort town on England's southern coast, building awe-inspiring
creations out of sand and water.</LD>
<LD>   He sculpted the prince and princess of Wales, a tableau of the
Last Supper, winning thoroughbreds and Egyptian pyramids. One of his
most famous creations was a group of monkeys playing poker, titled
"Fleecing the Lamb."</LD>
<TE>   He embellished his works with paint, creating images so realistic
that they inspired beachfront debates.</TE>
<TE>   Once two onlookers got into an argument over whether an apple in a
display of fruit he had crafted was genuine. Darrington finally
picked up the apple and threw it to the skeptic. When it crumbled in
his hands, the doubter disgustedly threw the coin he had wagered into
Darrington's bucket.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Andover, the son of a railway worker, Darrington began
sculpting sand at the age of 12. He found the sand at Weymouth to be
an ideal medium.</TE>
<TE>   It was so clean and fine that it bonded tightly when wet, leaving
a structure so sturdy that critics often accused Darrington of using
glue.</TE>
<TE>   He left school at 14 and worked most of his life as an engineer,
always reserving summers for sculpting in Weymouth. His grandson, his
first and only apprentice, took over his spot on the sand several
years ago. This week he shaped the Sphinx, one of his grandfather's
favorite sculpture subjects, in tribute.</TE>

<HD>Quail Hawkins, 97; Wrote Children's Books Popular in the
1940s</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quail Hawkins, 97, the author of several children's books popular in
the 1940s, died Aug. 16 in a retirement home in Pacific Grove, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins' nine illustrated books ranged from beginning-to-read
picture books to volumes for young adults. She was a coauthor of
several other works for children. Though none of her books remain in
print, "A Puppy for Keeps" in 1943 and "Mark, Mark, Shut the Door" in
1947 were among her most popular.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins worked at bookstores and publishing houses, and encouraged
the work of such authors as Beverly Cleary and Ursula K. Le Guin.</LD>
<TE>   In Cleary's memoir, "My Own Two Feet," she wrote about how in 1941
Hawkins hired her to work during the Christmas rush at Sather Gate
Book Shop in Berkeley. She described Hawkins, then the manager of
children's books, as "a rapid, omnivorous reader with a retentive
memory, a love of books and a passion for persuading others to read
them."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins also was children's book specialist for seven years at the
University of California Press.</TE>

<HD>Santa Clara River Bridge Project Enters New Phase</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Crews widening the 101 Freeway span will begin
installing 65-foot support shafts near Ventura Road and Johnson
Drive.</DH>

<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next big step in the Santa Clara River Bridge expansion project
on the Ventura Freeway is scheduled to start Friday, as workers begin
installing the 65-foot cement shafts that will buttress the new span.</LD>
<LD>   Although two pile drivers will operate within about 10 feet of the
northbound slow lane of the freeway at Ventura Road, cement barriers
topped with plywood planks will separate the construction zone from
traffic.</LD>
<LD>   "We call it a 'gawk screen,' " California Department of
Transportation spokeswoman Patricia Reid said.</LD>
<TE>   Construction work at the site is scheduled for 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
weekdays through Sept. 5, though work could stretch to 7 p.m. some
days, Reid said. No lane closures on the freeway are scheduled, but
northbound traffic on Ventura Road is reduced to one lane.</TE>
<TE>   The pile drivers will be moved to the Johnson Drive bridge
abutment on Sept. 6. Construction there will follow the same weekday
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson Drive bridge work will be about 30 feet from northbound
traffic. There will be no lane closures on the freeway or Johnson
Drive, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Additional pile driving work is scheduled to begin Sept. 16 in the
freeway median between Ventura Road and Johnson Drive, and
construction along the median is scheduled to continue until summer
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The $112-million project aims to eliminate the chronic bottleneck
between Oxnard and Ventura along the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   It is scheduled for completion in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The new bridge will boast 12 lanes instead of six and will include
a bicycle lane. The highway on both ends of the bridge, from Vineyard
Avenue to Johnson Drive, also will be widened.</TE>

<HD>Tentative Approval Given to Port Pact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Averting a possible strike that could have halted shipments through
the Port of Hueneme, the Oxnard Harbor District reached a tentative
agreement Wednesday with the union representing its 18 employees.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for the Service Employees International Union Local
998 helped craft a proposal to hike workers' pay an average of 15% by
2005, provide bigger pensions and maintain the current seniority
system.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed three-year pact maintains current language regarding
other worker rights, such as holding union meetings at the port, but
there were concessions.</LD>
<TE>   The district would limit its future payments for medical insurance
and rein in retiree health-benefit provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, an employee retiring at 50 is guaranteed lifetime
health insurance after working five years at the port.</TE>
<TE>   "We're satisfied that our people will be protected on the
medical," said Stephen Lynch, a member of the union's bargaining
committee.</TE>
<TE>   "You never get everything that you want.... We think we were able
to maintain the things we think are most precious," Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   Wages for the local's unionized workers now range from $13 an hour
for a beginning clerical worker to $23.40 an hour for an experienced
wharfinger, who helps coordinate vessel traffic in and out of the
port's five berths.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-person staff also includes eight maintenance workers, who
have the same pay scale as wharfingers.</TE>
<TE>   The formula for determining pension payments would be
altered--raised to 2 1/2% from 2%--to provide higher paychecks to
retirees. For instance, an employee with 30 years at the port would
now be paid 75% of his or her final salary in retirement rather than
60%.</TE>
<TE>   Other contract enhancements include adding Cesar Chavez's birthday
as a paid holiday and increasing the amount of accumulated sick leave
workers can cash out when they retire.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement came after two days of extended
bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   District officials declared an impasse Aug. 20 after the union
announced publicly its membership had authorized a strike if there
was no progress in negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   When talks broke down last week, the union had sought 17% in
raises and the district had offered 13%</TE>
<TE>   Port Executive Director William J. Buenger said the two sides will
return to the table Friday to "consolidate the document" by reviewing
the final wording of the various items before a revised contract is
submitted to union members for a vote, which is expected Wednesday</TE>
<TE>   The Harbor Commission must also approve the contract before it can
take effect.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Redfud, one of the first three black teachers in the Compton
Unified School District and a founding teacher of its Centennial High
School who inspired hundreds of students to become judges, lawyers,
principals, surgeons, engineers and executives, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Redfud died Sunday in Kaiser Permanente Hospital in West Los
Angeles after a long illness, said Wini Jackson, a singer and child
advocate and former student. Redfud lived in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   It was Jackson who organized a 1999 "Pioneers in Education" dinner
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to honor Redfud and 26 other former
teachers who encouraged and challenged the students attending
Compton's Centennial High in the mid-20th century to assume
leadership roles in a country undergoing integration.</LD>
<TE>   More than 600 alumni gave Redfud a rousing ovation as Jackson sang
"Unforgettable" and "You Are the Wind Beneath Our Wings."</TE>
<TE>   Redfud, who was born in Louisiana, graduated from Southern
University in Baton Rouge and taught at schools in Bogalusa and
Minden before moving to Los Angeles to earn his master's at USC.</TE>
<TE>   He qualified to teach, but couldn't get hired in late 1940s Los
Angeles because he was black. That changed when the unassuming white
principal of Compton's Willowbrook Junior High, Marian Wagstaff,
became concerned that she had no black faculty members in a school
where more and more black students were enrolling. The Supreme Court
mandate to desegregate schools would not come until 1954, but
Wagstaff wasn't waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the best teachers. It was not a matter of hiring Negro
teachers," she told The Times in 1999. "It was a matter of hiring the
best qualified."</TE>
<TE>   She selected three blacks, including Redfud, in 1950. A few years
later, as Wagstaff moved to Cal State L.A. to train future teachers,
Redfud and many of the other people she hired helped open the new
Centennial High School.</TE>
<TE>   Formal but friendly, Redfud greeted his history students at the
classroom door, treated them as employees with himself as the
employer, demanded a steady stream of homework and advised them if
they called in sick to send the assignments by taxi. He worked long
days and weekends, used his own money to provide supplies, took his
debaters to watch the Beverly Hills High School competition and
challenged them to top it, and otherwise inspired students to be
self-disciplined and become self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hear people talk about what good schools they had in Beverly
Hills and Fairfax," he told The Times in 1998. "I didn't want to be
teaching anywhere that wasn't competitive with the outside world. I
spent 14-hour days creating learning experiences, to expose my class
to things other people would be getting. I made sure they learned how
to compete."</TE>
<TE>   Redfud ended his career as principal of Compton Adult School
before retiring in 1983. In recent years, he lamented the declining
quality of the Compton school district, which became so riddled with
failure that the state assumed control in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Asked three years ago for his recipe for classroom success, Redfud
said: "Discipline. Every time they walked in, my boards were filled
with work for them to start doing."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Genevieve; two sons, Duane
and Damon; one daughter, Yolanda; three grandchildren; and one
great-granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at St. Eugene Catholic
Church, 9505 Hass Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made in Redfud's
name to the Los Angeles Alumni Chapter of the Southern University
Scholarship Fund, Box 19612, Los Angeles, CA 90019, or to St.
Eugene's School, 9505 Hass Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90008.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bans South Gate Official From Entering Police
Facilities</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Order extended against city treasurer, who is
charged with threatening an officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Wednesday barred South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles from
entering any of the city's police facilities after prosecutors
charged that he had violated a court order restricting his movements.</LD>
<LD>   Robles, awaiting trial on charges of making death threats against
Lt. Vince Avila and two state legislators, is not allowed to be
within 100 yards of the alleged targets or witnesses in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Robles' attorneys acknowledged he had visited the Police
Department but argued the visits related to his official duties as
treasurer and, as such, did not violate the protective order.</LD>
<TE>   But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John A. Torribio said his
order was a "reasonable restriction" of Robles' movements.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a public function that involves the city management
at the police station, he may not attend it," he said in his written
ruling. "The court recognizes that this limits his ability to perform
100 percent of his duties, but it allows him to perform 99.99
percent."</TE>
<TE>   In another ruling and potential blow to prosecutors, the judge
ordered that an illegal weapons case against Robles be handled in a
separate trial. The judge sided with Robles' attorneys, who argued
that trying the cases together would deny his right to a fair
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge showed that he was extremely fair and recognizes the
prejudice that Albert would suffer were he tried with these weapons
charges," said Thomas M. Brown, Robles' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Robles was arrested in April and charged with threatening
Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) and Avila.</TE>
<TE>   Robles allegedly sent a death threat to Avila through a mutual
friend, saying, "The way to properly kill someone is to shoot them in
both eyes to be certain they are dead," according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, worried about his safety, told two of his superior
officers, both of them lieutenants who are expected to testify at the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Since Robles' arrest, prosecutors allege Robles has entered the
Police Department at least three times as part of a pattern of
intimidation against Avila and the other witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The day after one of Robles' alleged visits--a meeting to
introduce  the city's new acting police chief to department
brass--several senior level officers were either demoted or stripped
of their police cars and telephones, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry
Bork.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, Bork said, also has entered the building after hours and
is believed to possess or have access to a key.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you have a guy accused of threatening to kill people having
entree to the city's arsenal," Bork said. "The message is: I have
power over each of you."</TE>
<TE>   Brown denied the accusations, and said prosecutors are attempting
to "inflame" their case against Robles. Each of the visits involved
official business, Brown said, and Robles did not have contact with
any of the witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The D.A.'s motion based on alleged confrontations and fearful
police officers is meritless. These confrontations never occurred,"
said Brown in a court document.</TE>
<TE>   The case has opened a rift between prosecutors and acting Police
Chief Rick Lopez. Lopez, through his attorney, Glen Jonas, said Bork
threatened to derail his career if he didn't cooperate with the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Bork denies the accusations, and expressed frustration that the
city's top law enforcement official has refused to be interviewed
without a city attorney being present.</TE>
<TE>   Bork wants to ask questions related to the original court order
barring Robles from being within 100 yards of Avila, Escutia and
Firebaugh.</TE>

<HD>City Fights Subsidized Housing Loss</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge is asked to bar three landlords from leaving a
low-income program. The legal dispute focuses on proper notice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a bid to keep hundreds of low-income tenants in their homes, Los
Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo asked a judge to issue a
temporary restraining order, blocking three apartment owners who are
attempting to remove their buildings from a federally subsidized
housing program.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said the owners had failed to abide by a state law
that requires them to notify tenants and several public entities
before leaving the Section 8 program. Such notification theoretically
would give governments or private groups a chance to purchase the
properties to maintain them for low-income residents.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a variety of options that we can engage in to preserve
affordable housing, but if we don't have the notice that these
properties are going to market rate we can't act," said Sarah
Dusseault, assistant deputy mayor for economic development.</LD>
<TE>   Without the restraining order, some tenants may face increased
rents and possible eviction by the end of next week, officials said.
A judge is expected to rule on the restraining order Friday. The city
also has filed a complaint seeking an injunction.</TE>
<TE>   The filings follow a months-long effort by tenant advocates, local
members of Congress and City Council members, who had asked the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development to reject the owners'
applications to leave the program.</TE>
<TE>   Local HUD officials approved the owners' applications, arguing
that the federal agency has no responsibility to enforce state and
local laws.</TE>
<TE>   HUD's response has baffled local officials and tenant advocates,
who said that the agency's own Section 8 guidebook states that
"owners must also comply with any state or local notification
requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a letter about one of the properties, a HUD official
said the regulations do not require the department to enforce the
rule.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowhere does the guide provide for any action on HUD's part as a
result of the owner not ... following state or local notification
requirements," wrote Jerome Champion, HUD's director of multifamily
housing in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the City Council, citing the state law concerning
notification, unanimously voted last week to explore legal action
against the three apartment owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not questioning a person's right to remove units from this
program," said Councilman Ed Reyes, who introduced the motion with
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel. "What I am questioning is whether or not
the process of doing so was adhered to and whether or not tenants
were being treated fairly. We have 80,000 people on a waiting list
for this program, so every unit counts."</TE>
<TE>   HUD officials did not return several phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy stems from three Section 8 contracts: with LA Pro
VI, involving six buildings scattered in South Los Angeles; Arminta
North and South, two buildings in Sun Valley; and One Venice
Apartments, in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   A 2-year-old state law requires owners seeking to terminate a
contract to notify renters a year in advance. Public entities that
must be notified include the city, the California Housing and
Community Development Department and the local housing authority. In
addition, owners must notify entities on a state-maintained list of
nonprofit groups and others interested in preserving low-income
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing owners to leave the program without notification is
"going to be a tremendous signal to other owners that they can opt
out ... without having to go through the necessary steps that were
put in place to protect tenants," said Larry Gross of the Coalition
for Economic Survival.</TE>
<TE>   But the general partner of the Sun Valley buildings, Kurken
Alyanakian, said owners had "complied with all laws that we are bound
by as far as notification" is concerned.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is not bound by state law because the law was passed
after he applied to leave the program. The other two apartment owners
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of notifying Section 8 tenants of possible changes in
their housing has also arisen in Claremont. Earlier this month, that
city filed a lawsuit and, in a settlement, the owner of the Brighton
Park apartments agreed to give new notices and keep the 40 units in
the Section 8 program for a year, said Min Chang, a staff attorney
with Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County, who assisted
tenants.</TE>

<LD>A Granada Hills man has pleaded guilty to billing fraud as a result
of a statewide undercover probe of false health-care claims,
authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Mazor, 36, operator of Countrywide Health Care in the 4900
block of Wilshire Boulevard, faces up to 30 years in prison and a
possible fine of $750,000 because he overbilled government agencies
by $38,000 and paid kickbacks to undercover agents posing as clinic
employees, Assistant U.S. Atty. Rebecca Lonergan said.</LD>
<LD>   Mazor is among at least two dozen operators of medical supply
houses who have recently been charged with falsifying documents so
that Medicare or Medi-Cal would pay claims for medically unnecessary
wheelchairs, braces, beds or other equipment, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI set up an undercover operation at a medical clinic in
Encino as part of its investigation of Mazor and other business
operators, Lonergan said.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies are searching for a man who
fatally shot a Quartz Hill motorist last week after flagging him down
under the pretense of having car trouble, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man--standing by what appeared to be a broken-down
car--allegedly waved to driver Ladd Schweitzer, 67, and his
girlfriend about 11 p.m. Thursday at Avenue N and 70th Street East,
deputies said. Schweitzer pulled over to help, and the man pulled out
a handgun and demanded money. When Schweitzer tried to drive off, the
man shot and killed him, deputies said.</LD>
<LD>   Homicide detectives said the man was in a silver car. Anyone with
information is asked to call (323) 890-5500.</LD>

<HD>A Nightmare Vision for a Valley City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has invoked some awful visions of
what awaits the people of the San Fernando Valley if they secede from
L.A., but not even Hahn has raised so cataclysmic a specter as Sandow
Birk.</LD>
<LD>   To wit:</LD>
<LD>   The vengeful armed forces of San Francisco rampage south along the
101 and 5 Freeways, pouring into the brand-new San Fernando Valley
city on their way to attack despised Los Angeles. The Valley, having
recently seceded from L.A., can field only a puny army to defend
itself. It is quickly put to flight. As the San Franciscans burn and
loot their way across the new city, desperate Valley military leaders
gather at the Sherman Oaks Galleria and argue over whether to appeal
to Los Angeles for help.</LD>
<TE>   Having just thrown off L.A.'s oppressive yoke, they cannot bring
themselves to go begging to their former masters.</TE>
<TE>   Atop the Hollywood Hills, L.A.'s supreme commander, Major General
Juan Gomez de los Angeles, is informed that the Valley is afire and
utters the immortal words that seal the new city's fate: "Let it go.
Let [them] burn."</TE>
<TE>   Conjuring this particular downside to Valley secession took the
delinquent imagination of Birk, who has been fascinated by the
concept of schism in California for the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley's fate is a small part of an expansive series of
paintings, propaganda posters, sculptures and narratives Birk has
created about a fictional war between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
His "In Smog and Thunder: The Great War of the Californias" has been
shown in galleries and museums in San Francisco, West Hollywood,
Laguna Beach and Sonoma. One of the paintings, depicting the
destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge, was included in the L.A.
County Museum of Art's mammoth "Made in California" exhibit two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The "In Smog" project started in 1995, when a gallery in San
Francisco gallery invited Birk to show and paint there for a time. "I
was astonished by the animosity people there had toward L.A.," he
says. "It was something I didn't know about. It was funny in a way.
So I came up with the idea to do a show that would be their worst
nightmare--being taken over by L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The first show, mounted in San Francisco, depicted the destruction
of that city by invading L.A. forces and consisted of scarcely two
dozen works. With each subsequent show, the number of works grew to
its current 110, as the "war" moved to the sea off the California
coast, and San Francisco's thirst for revenge led to the
counter-invasion of Los Angeles, with the aforementioned devastating
results for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Birk, with collaborators Paul Zaloom and Sean Meredith, has just
completed a 46-minute film about the works, modeled, tongue-in-cheek,
on Ken Burns' epic documentary "The Civil War." (The new film is
available on DVD at www.smartartpress .com.)</TE>
<TE>   In the film, a talking-head "historian" explains, "Just two months
before, the San Fernando Valley had seceded from the city of Los
Angeles after a long, nasty political struggle. Its troops were very
green. They retreated from the get-go, without more than a few shots
fired in self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   The Walter Cronkite-like narrator picks up the story, intoning,
"From his temporary headquarters atop the Hollywood Hills, General
Gomez watched the Valley burn ... " and intones Gomez's historic
utterance.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old Birk, a surfer and son of Seal Beach, graduated
from Otis Parsons School of Art, and has received Guggenheim,
Fulbright and Getty fellowships. He now lives and works in a loft in
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings in "In Smog and Thunder" are patterned after heroic
works by Jacques-Louis David, Eugene Delacroix, Francisco Goya and
others. They include sprawling battle scenes on land and sea, and
depictions full of classical allegory, dramatically gesticulating
figures and courageous leaders on horseback (and sometimes
motorcycles).</TE>
<TE>   Combatants sport both 19th century military raiment and the
streetwear of the modern urban young. In battle they're as likely to
be wielding leaf blowers, electric guitars and signs advertising
no-fee checking as they are swords and muskets. The broken and bent
detritus of modern city life lies scattered underfoot. At sea, tall,
many-sailed frigates vie with giant modern battleships. Above,
helicopter gunships share with old-fashioned blimps a sky smoky from
burning, recognizable urban precincts.</TE>
<TE>   But Birk's ocean of incongruity has a serious undertow of
awareness about real-life social and political issues, such as
secession. The paintings cite the misdeeds of LAPD officers, the
greedy inanity of the entertainment industry and the galloping
commercialization of life (corporate-sponsor logos adorn battleships
and swordsmen clash beneath billowing pennants that read "Smog Check;
Pass or Don't Pay").</TE>
<TE>   Although he depicts combatants of all races on both sides, Birk
can be bitingly observant of various ethnic and occupational groups,
the homeless, lesbians and gays. His images of urban destruction are
disturbingly reminiscent of what Los Angeles (and San Francisco) have
actually endured at the hands of nature and people run amok.</TE>
<TE>   His close tracking of the unfolding Valley secession issue has
left him with a firm opinion. "I'm opposed to secession, by far," he
says. "Even if the Valley becomes a separate Valley city, it's still
L.A. Come on. It's part of L.A.'s history and culture and economy."</TE>
<TE>   For someone given to imagining the ultimate in social unraveling,
he believes an essential coherence binds the geographic, ethnic and
cultural sprawl that is metropolitan Los Angeles. "I just look at how
I live every day," he says. "I'll be surfing in Huntington Beach in
the morning, having lunch in Chinatown and maybe going to a party at
night in Venice. And I live and work in Long Beach. But, as far as
I'm concerned, it's all L.A."</TE>

<HD>Lecturers Join Clerks in UC Berkeley Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Classes are disrupted across the campus in a protest
over stalled contract talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Lecturers seeking greater job security and better pay joined clerical
workers on the picket lines Wednesday at UC Berkeley, disrupting
classes across much of the campus.</LD>
<LD>   Both the lecturers and clerical workers, who began their walkout
on the first day of the fall semester Monday, plan to return to work
today. They staged the short-term strikes to protest a lack of
progress in negotiating new contracts with the nine-campus University
of California system.</LD>
<LD>   University officials said they did not know how many classes were
postponed, canceled or held off-campus because of the strike, but
they added that most appeared to be held as scheduled. In all, 300 of
1,300 classes set for Wednesday had been scheduled to be taught by
the nontenured lecturers, who are represented by the UC Council of
the American Federation of Teachers.</LD>
<TE>   Fred Glass, a spokesman for the lecturers' union, estimated that a
third to half of all classes were either called off or moved off
campus by lecturers and other faculty who supported the strike.</TE>
<TE>   The unions and the UC administration have accused each other of
unfair bargaining practices. Glass said the main long-term concern of
lecturers is a lack of job security, because many of them work on
one-semester or one-year contracts. He accused UC of a pattern of
dropping many lecturers just before they reach six years of service,
a point at which they are entitled to three-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials have denied those charges and said the system doesn't
have the money to meet the unions' pay demands. The clerical workers,
represented by the Coalition of University Employees, have been
especially focused on pay. They have asked for a 15% increase over
two years, and estimate that the average pay for their members who
work full time is about $27,000.</TE>
<TE>   Many students, including those inconvenienced by the walkouts,
expressed little interest in the union contract issues.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Bhai, 21, a fourth-year philosophy and mathematics major from
Los Angeles, said he wanted matters settled so he could work out his
class schedule. "It's the first week of classes and I'm kind of
stressed about getting things in order," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ivin Arquiza, a freshman from Vallejo studying business, said he
didn't have much feeling about the strikes, but he expressed
annoyance that "no matter where you go around the perimeter, there's
always someone handing out fliers."</TE>

<HD>City's First Church Is a Beehive of Believers</HD>
<DH>It's standing room only, as 12,000 people flock to La
Placita every Sunday. 'This is a great church for Latinos,' one of
them says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The church near Olvera Street does not have five-ton cast bronze
doors or a sticker price of close to $200 million, but its cultural
significance is grand nonetheless.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a minute away from the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels that is set to open Sept. 2, is a piece of the city's cultural
past, La Placita church, which is still inspiring awe and pride in
its tens of thousands of visitors.</LD>
<LD>   "This is my church," said Nellie Banta, who has attended Mass
regularly at La Placita for more than 40 years. "This is the first
church I ever came to in California, and it's going to be my last
church."</LD>
<TE>   For many like Banta, Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in downtown
Los Angeles, as La Placita is formally known, is more than just a
house of worship. Many see La Placita as a "church for Latinos."
Others see it as the church of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to learn about the history of Los Angeles," said Colleen
Conroy, a tourist from Washington, D.C., on a recent Sunday at La
Placita. "I thought it was incredible. The faith of the people at
this church was inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people would stand for more than an hour in the street
for church. Man, they do it here every week for every Mass."</TE>
<TE>   The church, the first ever built in Los Angeles, was erected in
1781 at what is now the corner of Cesar Chavez Boulevard and North
Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   La Placita began as a 1,400-square-foot chapel, which is now used
primarily for baptisms and smaller services. When the adobe church
first opened, donations of cattle and barrels of brandy were its
primary funding.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, a church able to accommodate 500 parishioners was
built next to the chapel. The church has since been expanded to seat
1,000, and the rectory was enlarged to include a social services
office, meeting rooms and a large assembly hall.</TE>
<TE>   While the church has undergone changes over the years, much of the
original furniture and statuary is still around. Two bells that were
lent to the church by the San Gabriel Mission still remain in the
church's possession, according to church officials.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation at La Placita is almost all Latino, with many
immigrants from Mexico and Central America, said Jose Cohen, a layman
who has served in various capacities at the church since 1975. The
church, in the heart of Los Angeles' Mexican birthplace, is one of
the busiest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   With six priests, all of whom speak Spanish, La Placita has 11
Masses every Sunday, serving about 12,000 worshipers within its aging
walls. Others gather outside to listen to Sunday services through
loudspeakers. About 300 children are baptized every week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great church for Latinos," said Eddie Jarillo, who
admits he is not a church regular. "What's great about the church is
that almost all the Masses are in Spanish. But the only thing is, you
just have to come early to grab a seat."</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old South Los Angeles man, who stood through Mass one
Sunday when he couldn't get a seat, said the first time he attended
Mass at La Placita was to have his 4-year-old son, Edmund, and
6-year-old daughter, Ashley, baptized at a fountain in the courtyard
honoring the Santo Nino de Atocha.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of worshippers knelt in front of the fountain, praying to
the Santo Nino, a representation of the Christ child. Some prayed for
a cure to a child's illness, others for success in school. Nearby,
vendors sold everything from religious trinkets to tacos and churros.</TE>
<TE>   La Placita always has been known as a haven for refugees and
illegal immigrants. In the 1980s, it drew fire from Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials when Father Luis Olivares declared
the church a sanctuary for Central American immigrants fleeing
war-torn countries.</TE>
<TE>   The area around the church has long been a target of the INS,
dating back to the 1930s when raids led to the deportation of
thousands of Mexican Americans, many of whom had been born in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesdays and Thursdays, about 100 aging braceros--Mexican
farm laborers--come to the church, not just for a free meal, but to
find a friendly ear. Many support themselves by collecting aluminum
and plastic cans and bottles and are in poor health.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people who need help in the city," said Cohen, who
now serves as the church's social action coordinator. "This church
has always prided itself in trying to help everybody who walks
through the doors."</TE>
<TE>   A mural of the Madonna and child, enthroned with angels, and
framed pictures of saints are some of the artistic features in the
church, which exudes a rustic, charm.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been coming here for 20 years and I can see that this church
is old and has been falling apart for many years," said Salvador
Hernandez, a 66-year-old Glendale resident. "It's still a beautiful
place to be on Sundays. It's the most beautiful church I've been to."</TE>
<TE>   Every Sunday, Banta and her 67-year-old sister, Magdalena Perez,
take a one-hour bus ride from Highland Park to the church, where they
meet their 73-year-old brother, Eddie Perez, for 10:30 a.m. Mass.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a family tradition since Nellie was married in the
church on May 27, 1960, after coming to California from Leon in the
Mexican state of Guanajuato.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, most of Banta's family has died. Of 14 brothers and
sisters, only the three remain. Going to church always has been an
all-day event for the siblings, who sat down and enjoyed a plate of
tacos al carbon and a cup of horchata, thick rice milk, before
boarding their bus back home about 6 p.m.</TE>

Type of Material: Correction</CX>
<CX>   Cathedral doors--A graphic Wednesday in Section A and the
"Surroundings" story Thursday in the California section gave
inconsistent and incorrect information about the weight of the main
doors at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The Great
Bronze Doors comprise the doors themselves, which weigh about 7 tons
apiece, plus the crowning tympanum structure and statue of Mary. The
combined weight of the entire piece is about 25 tons. In addition,
the story Wednesday that the graphic accompanied gave misleading
information about the dimensions of the nave's series of tapestries.
They are 20 feet tall.</CX>

<HD>3 Killed at West L.A. Restaurant</HD>
<DH>Crime: A gunman opens fire in front of a Wilshire Boulevard
eatery, then escapes. One man who is targeted is unhurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oblivious to witnesses, a suspected gang gunman shot and killed three
workers at close range in front of a Wilshire Boulevard restaurant in
an affluent West Los Angeles neighborhood, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The man fired several shots into Mario Cruz, 24; Cruz's brother,
Avelino Cruz, 23; and Jorge Rodriguez, 22, each of whom died.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth man also was targeted, but escaped unhurt by running into
some bushes. He is 24, but police would not disclose his name.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman fled in what various witnesses said was a white
Mercedes-Benz or a pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   The three victims were described as trusted, longtime workers at
the Koo Koo Roo on Wilshire near Bundy Drive. They were wearing their
white restaurant uniforms when they were attacked about 11 p.m.
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The man who escaped is a friend who met the others at the
restaurant for dinner. After eating, all four had walked around to
the front, where one of the group planned to catch a bus at a nearby
stop.</TE>
<TE>   There they were confronted by the killer, who apparently had been
looking for them, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe this was a random act. This was directed at
these four individuals," said LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking into the possibility it was gang related, because
two of the victims have gang affiliations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. George Khoury, head of the Los Angeles Police Department's
local gang detail, said it is almost unknown for gang-related crime
to spill over into this affluent area, which lies just south of the
main business district of Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection where the shootings occurred is at least a mile
from the closest areas known to be frequented by gangs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Violent crime of any kind is rare in West L.A. Until Tuesday
night's shooting, there had been just two homicides to date this year
in the 64 square miles policed by the LAPD's West Los Angeles
Division.</TE>
<TE>   That's just a tiny fraction of the more than 426 homicides that
have been committed citywide since January.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a videotape from a Koo Koo Roo surveillance camera is
being reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Carl, a spokesman for the Irvine-based chain, said the two
Cruz brothers had worked at the restaurant part time for more than
five years; Rodriguez had worked there only about a month.</TE>
<TE>   All were well-liked and respected by co-workers, who were shocked
by the crime, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police are seeking a Latino man younger than 30, about 5 feet 4
and 160 pounds, with a medium complexion, wearing a white T-shirt and
black pants.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that he approached the victims on foot and exchanged
words with them briefly before pulling a handgun from his waistband
and shooting them numerous times in the upper body.</TE>
<TE>   At least two fell where they were shot. A third fled into the
street, where he collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard four quick shots; they sounded high-powered," said a
nearby resident who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife said, 'Those aren't gunshots.' I said, 'Trust me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The incident touched a nerve in the usually peaceful area. Police
reported receiving a number of calls Wednesday from jittery local
residents who asked questions about the murders or offered tips, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rose De Luna, 21, an employee at an adjacent cafe, came to work
Wednesday to find workers cleaning blood off the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought this neighborhood was calm," she said. "And when
I found out, I was, like, 'Oh, my God.' "</TE>
<TE>   A sign with a black ribbon on the Koo Koo Roo door Wednesday read:
"We will be closed for business today."</TE>
<TE>   Well-wishers left stuffed animals, flowers, candles and notes amid
the shattered glass.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hearts go out to the victims and their families," read a
computer printout.</TE>
<TE>   Employees trickled in throughout the day, huddling in the locked
restaurant with a grief counselor.</TE>
<TE>   Several wore expressions of disbelief, and some were crying.</TE>
<TE>   West Los Angeles LAPD Capt. Richard Wemmer expressed surprise at
the brutality of the crime. "We just don't have a significant number
of violent crimes here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police request that anyone with information related to the murders
call (310) 575-8400 and ask for detectives.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors will perform follow-up surgery today on Maria de Jesus Quiej
Alvarez, one of the Guatemalan twins separated Aug. 6 at UCLA, to
inspect surgical wounds and make repairs to her skull.</LD>
<LD>   It will be Maria de Jesus' first trip back to the operating room
since the 23-hour surgery at Mattel Children's Hospital that
separated the conjoined girls. The 1-year-old twins were born
connected at the skull and shared bone and blood vessels but no brain
tissue.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Teresa has had three operations to remove blood that
collected on her brain. During her last surgery one week ago, doctors
were able to inspect her wounds as well, said Dr. Henry Kawamoto, a
plastic surgeon.</LD>
<TE>   Both girls are alert and active, doctors said. Maria Teresa was
removed from a ventilator Tuesday; Maria de Jesus has been breathing
on her own since Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said Maria de Jesus has been observed reaching her hands
over her head. He thought she was trying to pull at her bandages, but
nurses told him she was searching for her sister.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after checking out reports of a noisy party at a west Ventura
gang hangout, police officers returned to find a man lying
unconscious outside his apartment, suffering from severe injuries, an
officer testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Matt Liston told jurors in the Ventura County murder trial
of a gang member accused of participating in the September 1999
beating death of William Zara that he found the 18-year-old lying on
his back, breathing shallowly, after an apparent fight.</LD>
<LD>   Zara, a stagehand at the Ventura Theater, died at a hospital the
next day.</LD>
<TE>   Ramiro Salgado, 23, is the last of five defendants to stand trial
in the death of Zara, who prosecutors say was kicked and beaten by
about two dozen gang members who mistakenly thought he had reported
their party to police.</TE>
<TE>   The four other defendants, who were charged months before police
uncovered evidence of Salgado's alleged involvement, were convicted
of murder last year. They are all serving life sentences.</TE>

<HD>For Some, 1st Day of Class Is Elementary</HD>
<DH>Education: Two new schools are opening as more than 130,000
students across the county begin hitting the books again this week.</DH>

<LD>It was high fives all around Wednesday for Dianne Quimby-Anders,
principal of Camarillo's newest school.</LD>
<LD>   Opening day at La Mariposa Elementary School went by without a
hitch, everyone agreed, as its students joined thousands heading back
to classrooms across Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   "We're up and running! We did it!" third-grade teacher Susan
Webber said as Quimby-Anders passed by Webber's line of students
touring the new campus.</LD>
<TE>   "What a smooth day. Congratulations!" parent and PTA organizer
Melanie Richardson said as the principal walked by an outdoor buffet
of doughnuts, bagels and coffee for parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything went smoothly," Nancy Myers, the school's literacy
coach, said with a smile as she greeted Quimby-Anders on the school
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   More than 130,000 students return to class this week across the
county, including those in Ventura, Moorpark and Simi Valley, where
schools opened Wednesday. Conejo Valley Unified School District in
Thousand Oaks is scheduled to open its doors today.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, where subdivision construction seems as
prevalent as vegetable fields and the Pacific Ocean, schools are
experiencing growing pains, said Quimby-Anders, a 29-year veteran of
the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District.</TE>
<TE>   The new Sycamore Elementary School will open today in the Dos
Vientos neighborhood of Newbury Park. And classes at University
Preparation School, affiliated with Cal State Channel Islands, are
scheduled to start Tuesday in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Quimby-Anders said the Pleasant Valley district consolidated
campuses and shifted school boundaries this year to adjust to
Camarillo's changing growth patterns. The 7,200-student district
closed Valle Lindo Elementary School in central Camarillo--where
growth has peaked and many youths are now teenagers--and opened La
Mariposa in eastern Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big day not only for La Mariposa, but for the whole
Pleasant Valley School District," said Quimby-Anders, who wore a
white sweater with the school's name stitched in red on the front.
"People have been working for more than a year to pull this day off."</TE>
<TE>   The spotless campus with patches of grass still trying to take
hold is surrounded by new subdivisions that have drawn young families
to the Mission Oaks neighborhood. In addition to its permanent
beige-and-green buildings, La Mariposa will use portable classrooms
as part of an overall plan for dealing with growth swings,
Quimby-Anders said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have lots of students, we'll use the portables," she
said. "When there's fewer kids, we'll take them away."</TE>
<TE>   The story is similar throughout the county. At Ventura High
School, 480 more students than expected showed up for the first day
of classes, bringing enrollment to 2,400, Principal Larry Emrich
said. He was not certain of the reason for the unexpected increase.</TE>
<TE>   "If the numbers hold, we'll have to figure out a way to hire more
teachers," said Emrich, whose 64-year-old Main Street campus has
undergone a top-to-bottom restoration over the last 1 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Renovations include new electrical wiring and floor tiles, a new
coat of paint in each classroom, seismic retrofitting and making the
campus wheelchair-accessible. Because all the work has not been
completed, some teachers had to hold classes on the lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the inconvenience, the first day of school unfolded
seamlessly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today was one of the smoothest opening days we've had--and our
numbers were huge," said Emrich, who has been Ventura High's
principal for six years and was an assistant principal three years
previously.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids were here on time, they were in class and teachers got to
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, Sinaloa Middle School hired three additional
teachers this year to handle an expected enrollment of 1,175,
Principal Leslie Franks said. The sixth-through eighth-grade school
serves families from the expanding Wood Ranch housing development in
western Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "All the kids here had a class schedule and we had our helpers out
there showing the new sixth-graders to their rooms," Franks said. "Of
course, there's always a challenge in the parking lot, but in a few
days, things will calm down."</TE>
<TE>   Back at La Mariposa in Camarillo, first-grader Kenton Anspaugh
knew what he liked best about his new school.</TE>
<TE>   "There's bones inside the climbing wall on the playground," Kenton
said after his class toured the campus with teacher JoAnn Reith.
Actually, Kenton was describing a scorpion-shaped indentation inside
the plastic climbing wall meant to resemble an arachnid's skeletal
remains embedded in rock.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the lunch tables," Kenton's classmate, Madison Hodson,
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The monkey bars," offered another student, Alex Littaua.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at their low-slung tables, the children colored a picture
of a butterfly with the words "Welcome to La Mariposa" across the
top. They were impressed when Reith passed out a much-needed item to
each of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought you all an eraser as a gift," Reith said.</TE>

<HD>Ohio's Top Court Bars Local Smoking Bans in All Public
Places</HD>
<DH>Health: Justices rule the Legislature, which exempts
restaurants and bars, can't be overruled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Local health boards are not allowed to ban smoking in all public
places when the Legislature specifically exempted bars and
restaurants from such bans, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-smoking groups said that they would continue their crusade
and take their pleas for smoking bans directly to the voters.</LD>
<LD>   Ohio's highest court, in its 6-1 ruling, called the activists'
goals well-intentioned but said state law does not allow them to
overrule the Legislature, which exempted bars and restaurants from
smoking bans.</LD>
<TE>   "We grant that local boards of health are better situated than the
General Assembly to protect the public health," Justice Andy Douglas
wrote for the majority. "However, local boards cannot act in any area
of public health without prior legislative approval."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Sabetta, project director for Tobacco-Free Ohio, said
anti-tobacco groups will push for bans through ballot initiatives and
legislation instead.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 500 communities nationwide now have total smoking bans or
comprehensive public bans with exceptions for bars and restaurants,
and the national trends show that more bans are likely on the way,
said John Banzhaf III, executive director of Washington, D.C.-based
Action on Smoking and Health.</TE>
<TE>   "As the evidence continues to emerge that secondhand tobacco smoke
kills nonsmokers, people are worried about their health," he said.
"They're worried about dying from everything from cancer to heart
attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Two states, California and Delaware, ban smoking in all public
places. Utah bans smoking in all public places except membership-only
restaurants and bars. Minnesota bans smoking in all public buildings
and most medical buildings, except in specifically designated smoking
areas and in bars. And bans in Maryland and Maine allow smoking only
in restaurants with liquor licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Florida voters in November will decide whether to outlaw smoking
in restaurants, except for outdoor seating areas, and in all enclosed
workplaces, including employee break rooms.</TE>
<TE>   In a victory for Massachusetts' health department, the state's
Supreme Judicial Court ruled last year that a local health board had
the power to ban smoking in restaurants and bars.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio court's decision Wednesday went against backers of a
total ban in Lucas County, approved in June 2001 by the Toledo-Lucas
County Board of Health. The ban prohibited smoking in all indoor
public places, including bars and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie's Eating and Drinking Saloon, a sports bar near the
University of Toledo, and 26 other businesses took their challenge of
the ban to the high court.</TE>
<TE>   County Health Commissioner David Grossman said that his department
likely will begin working with anti-tobacco groups to put a smoking
ban on the ballot in Toledo, which had the nation's highest smoking
rate, according to a federal report released in December.</TE>
<TE>   A vote would be easier than asking local governments to approve
such a ban, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any city councils will want to touch it," he said.</TE>

<HD>FBI Checking Into Corruption in New Orleans Government</HD>
<DH>Crime: Warrants allege malfeasance, bribery, fraud. A city
engineer is charged with extortion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The FBI and other federal agencies are conducting a widespread
investigation into allegations of corruption in New Orleans city
government, a prosecutor announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The statement by U.S. Atty. Jim Letten was the first indication of
federal involvement in a crackdown on corruption that Mayor Ray Nagin
announced in July, two months after taking office.</LD>
<LD>   At least 87 arrest warrants have been issued alleging malfeasance,
bribery and fraud involving the licensing of taxis and routine
private vehicle inspections.</LD>
<TE>   A city engineer was accused Wednesday of extorting about $20,000
from an electrical contractor engaged in business with the city.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors charged Wallace Schief, 49, of LaPlace with
extortion in interstate commerce, alleging an electrical contractor
paid him about $20,000 in kickbacks. Until his resignation Tuesday,
Schief was chief engineer of the city's property management
department.</TE>
<TE>   Schief could not be reached for comment; a recording said his
telephone was out of order.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Jan Mann said the city had paid the
contractor, G&amp;M Electric Co., $6,000 in inflated billings. The
company was not charged but Mann said an investigation was
continuing.</TE>
<TE>   The agent in charge of the FBI's New Orleans office, Kenneth
Kaiser, said he had met with Nagin before the mayor took office in
May and discussed Nagin's concerns about corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been investigating corruption allegations for some time,"
Kaiser said.</TE>

<HD>Milwaukee Archdiocese Installs New Archbishop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Milwaukee's Roman Catholic archdiocese installed a new leader
Wednesday, replacing an archbishop who resigned after acknowledging
he used church funds to pay a settlement to a man who accused him of
sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The new archbishop, Timothy Dolan, alluded to the sexual abuse
scandal that has embroiled the Catholic Church nationwide in a speech
at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, where he was installed.</LD>
<LD>   "We've heard so much in recent months about the Catholic Church in
crisis," said Dolan, who moved to Milwaukee from St. Louis, where he
served as auxiliary bishop. "The antidote for this crisis ... is
fidelity. A fidelity that gives rise to holiness."</LD>
<TE>   Former Archbishop Rembert Weakland attended Wednesday's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II accepted Weakland's resignation and immediate
retirement May 24, a day after he acknowledged paying a $450,000
settlement to Paul Marcoux, a former Marquette University student who
said Weakland sexually assaulted him in 1979. Weakland acknowledged
an inappropriate relationship with Marcoux but said there was no
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, at least 300 priests have either been dismissed
from their duties or resigned since the sex abuse scandal erupted in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Archdiocese serves 685,000 Catholics in 10
southeastern Wisconsin counties.</TE>

<LD>   Martin Luther King III urged Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to support
legislative efforts to remove former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's
name from the agency's headquarters building.</LD>
<TE>   "While it is the legislative right of Congress to pass legislation
dropping the name, it is the moral right of those serious about
justice to have a position on this issue," said King, son of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover, who was director of the FBI and its predecessor from 1924
until his death in 1972, raised questions in later years for using
the agency for political vendettas against civil rights activists
such as King.</TE>

<HD>New Charges Leveled in Hijacking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury on Wednesday returned a new indictment against
five men accused of air piracy and murder for their roles in a 1986
hijacking in which 22 people, including two Americans, were killed.</LD>
<LD>   The new indictment spells out the "aggravating circumstances" that
permit prosecutors to seek the death penalty under the federal death
penalty act.</LD>
<LD>   The 95-count indictment alleges that Zayd Hassan Abd Latif
Safarini, a Jordanian extradited to the United States from Pakistan
last year to face charges, was the ringleader in the 1986 hijacking
of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi.</LD>
<TE>   Safarini has been identified as a one-time member of the Abu Nidal
Palestinian guerrilla group. The United States hailed his extradition
last October as progress in the war on terrorism after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He is the only one of the five in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   The other four named in the indictment are Wadoud Muhammad Hafiz
Al-Turk, Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim, Muhammad Abdullah Khalil Hussain
Ar-Rahayyal and Muhammad Ahmed Al-Munawar. Their whereabouts were not
specified.</TE>
<TE>   Safarini pleaded not guilty last year to the charges accusing him
of taking over the airplane on the ground in Karachi, Pakistan, while
it was loading for a flight to Frankfurt en route to New York.</TE>

<HD>Texas Execution Raises the Issue of Exceptions</HD>
<DH>Court: Killer was 17 at time of crime. Three justices in
Washington say panel may consider capital punishment ban in such
cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A former teenage drug dealer was executed Wednesday for killing a
3-year-old cousin--one of three relatives gunned down--so he could
steal some chrome wheels.</LD>
<LD>   Before he was administered the injection in the death chamber,
Toronto Patterson said he didn't commit the crime, but added, "I am
sorry for the pain, sorry for what I caused my friends, family and
loved ones.</LD>
<LD>   "I ask for your forgiveness and that you will all forgive me,"
said Patterson, 24.</LD>
<TE>   Patterson was 17 when he killed Ollie Brown, 3; her sister,
Jennifer, 6; and their mother, Kimberly Brewer, 25. He was convicted
only of murdering Ollie Brown.</TE>
<TE>   He was the third person executed here this year for a crime
committed while a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "Such executions not only violate international norms, they also
offend human decency," said Steven Hawkins, executive director of the
National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson was the 23rd person executed in Texas this year and the
279th since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982, six years
after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a national death penalty ban.
Both totals lead the nation.</TE>
<TE>   For his final meal, Patterson requested six pieces of fried
chicken, four jalapeno peppers, four buttermilk biscuits, salad with
Italian dressing, six Sprite soft drinks and white cake with white
icing.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, three Supreme Court justices said in Washington
that the court should consider abolishing the death penalty for
killers who committed their crimes as minors.</TE>
<TE>   Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer were outvoted in Patterson's appeal. His attorneys had asked
the high court to delay his execution and consider whether such
executions are unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The three justices, part of the court's liberal wing, said
Patterson's execution should be put off at least until the Supreme
Court meets in September to consider cases for the coming term.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the apparent consensus that exists among the states and in
the international community against the execution of a capital
sentence imposed on a juvenile offender, I think it would be
appropriate for the court to revisit the issue at the earliest
opportunity," Stevens wrote in a dissent.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual statement comes after the court's landmark ruling this
year abolishing executions of the mentally retarded. The court said
it is unconstitutionally cruel to execute those who may be mentally
incapable of fully understanding their situations or unable to help
their lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty opponents predicted the same reasoning could be
applied to the execution of those too young to fully understand their
crimes, and Stevens has predicted that the question will be the next
death penalty issue the court decides.</TE>

<HD>Museum Is Exhibiting Tributes to Flight 93</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.</DL>
<LD>An airplane made of Lego building blocks, a salt shaker decorated
like an angel and other tributes left at the field where United
Flight 93 crashed on Sept. 11 were put on display Wednesday at the
State Museum of Pennsylvania.</LD>
<LD>   Museum officials assembled "Flight 93 Remembered" with the help of
the Somerset County Historical and Genealogical Society, which has
been cataloging and preserving thousands of items from the site.</LD>
<LD>   "We've watched this unfold, so it's very personal. You saw it and
you felt it," museum spokesman Howard Pollman said.</LD>
<TE>   Forty-four people, including the four hijackers, were killed when
the airplane crashed in Somerset County near Shanksville, about 80
miles east of Pittsburgh. Officials believe the plane was heading for
a target in Washington when passengers fought the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibits, gathered from a temporary memorial at the site,
include a note scrawled by an 8-year-old girl in pencil on a scrap of
loose-leaf paper.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to catch the bad guys. I'm so sad," the note reads.
"I can't believe it happened. It is so sad."</TE>
<TE>   "Flight 93 Remembered" will be on display through Oct. 2.</TE>

<HD>2 Groups Seek Exceptions to Limits on Preelection TV Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two nonprofit organizations urged federal regulators Wednesday to
exempt charities and foundations from provisions of the new campaign
finance law that restrict television advertisements before an
election.</LD>
<LD>   The plea from the Sierra Club Foundation and the Alliance for
Justice came as the Federal Election Commission began debating the
law's efforts to rein in broadcast ads, funded by unregulated
donations to special interest groups, that attack or promote
political candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, the unregulated donations--known as soft money--may
not be used to pay for ads that mention a candidate for federal
office 30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general
election.</LD>
<TE>   The authors of the law designed these provisions to crack down on
so-called sham-issue ads that are often used to influence elections.
They feared that the proliferation of such ads would defeat the main
point of the law, which was to prohibit national parties and federal
candidates from collecting soft money.</TE>
<TE>   But the law allows the FEC to create exceptions to the preelection
advertising rule. The two nonprofit groups argued, in written
testimony, that the commission should cut a break for public
charities and private foundations in the interest of free speech.</TE>
<TE>   At stake, they said, was the ability of certain tax-exempt
interest groups to have a voice in public debates before elections.
The groups contend that the tax code already prevents charities from
becoming directly involved in electoral politics.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to run ads that were partisan, we would be in
violation of the tax law," John DeCock, executive director of the
Sierra Club Foundation, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   But DeCock said the foundation, which underwrites the Sierra
Club's charitable activities, ought to be able to fund advertisements
that educate the public about critical environmental issues, even if
the ads mention a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Sierra Club, the Alliance for Justice, an association
consisting largely of liberal advocacy groups, is a major player in
Washington's ideological wars; it has, for instance, campaigned to
block the nominations of some conservatives to the federal judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   In comments posted on the alliance's Web site, www.afj.org, the
groups complained that without an exception to the law, charities
would be barred from broadcasting fund-raising appeals or public
service announcements that feature people who are federal candidates
if the appeals run soon before an election.</TE>
<TE>   "Documentaries and other educational programming featuring
individuals who are candidates would also be banned," the groups
said.</TE>
<TE>   The election commission is not expected to issue regulations on
preelection advertising until late next month.</TE>
<TE>   The debate comes as critics of the commission charge that it has
weakened many provisions of a law designed by Congress to diminish
the appearance of a corrupting influence of big money in politics.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which limits the raising and spending of soft money, is
to take effect Nov. 6, the day after this fall's elections, but
lawsuits are challenging it as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court
will have the final say on whether all or part of the law survives.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, both Democrats and Republicans are continuing to
raise soft money at a blistering pace.</TE>
<TE>   Common Cause, a group that opposes soft money, reported Wednesday
that the two parties had raised more than $300 million in soft money
in the first year and a half of the 2002 election cycle. Of that,
Republicans had raised $180 million and Democrats more than $120
million. The group said the soft money total exceeded by 18% the $256
million raised during the comparable period during the 2000 campaign.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CORSICANA, Texas</DL>
<LD>A man accused of sexually assaulting and strangling his 10-year-old
stepdaughter was found hanged in his jail cell Wednesday about an
hour before his capital murder trial was to begin.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Paul Zoch had not appeared to be suicidal, Navarro County
Sheriff Leslie Cotten said. Cotten said he did not suspect foul play.
Texas Rangers were investigating and an autopsy had been scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   Zoch, 37, was found about 8 a.m., hanging from strips of bed
linen, Cotten said. He said jailers last saw Zoch alive when they
retrieved his breakfast tray at 6:45 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Cotten has said that Zoch signed a confession in August 2001 and
led authorities to the body of April Danielle Bryant in a ravine
about 10 miles from her home in Mildred, about 65 miles southeast of
Dallas. She had been missing two days.</TE>
<TE>   April had been home alone while her mother, Gale Zoch, was at work
at a dance club.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Zoch could have faced death by injection or life in
prison.</TE>

<HD>Antibiotic Is Found in Honey Shipped From China</HD>
<DH>Trade: Product did not get into U.S. It was found during
probe into illegal imports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Traces of an antibiotic were found in bulk honey shipped from China
but detained at U.S. ports, federal authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery was made as part of an investigation into
allegations that the honey had been illegally shipped through
third-party countries on its way from China to the United States in
an effort to evade U.S. anti-dumping duties, the U.S. Customs Service
said.</LD>
<LD>   That investigation has resulted in more than 50 sea containers of
bulk Chinese honey being detained at U.S. ports, Customs said.</LD>
<TE>   Customs spokesman Dean Boyd said the agency did not have a number
on how much Chinese honey was stored in these sea containers. But he
said that a 20-foot container can hold as much as 15,000 pounds
stored in individual drums.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bulk honey in the containers has tested positive for
chloramphenicol, a powerful antibiotic used for human infections,
Customs and the Food and Drug Administration said in a joint release
Wednesday. The United States bans the use of the antibiotic in
animals, food and feed products.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA is unaware at present of contaminated honey being on
retail shelves, but is continuing its investigation into this
matter," the joint release said. "Thus far, no illnesses have been
reported in association with the imported honey."</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown whether trace amounts of the drug in food would
actually harm anyone, an FDA official said.</TE>
<TE>   Customs said it is "stopping all suspect bulk honey imports to
this country for the FDA to determine whether they contain
chloramphenicol. Any shipments containing chloramphenicol will be
detained."</TE>
<TE>   In June, the FDA said it had begun tougher testing for residues of
the antibiotic in shrimp and crawfish following reports that some
seafood with traces of the drug was shipped from China. The agency
tightened testing to detect lower levels of the antibiotic.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the government's anti-dumping investigation, Customs
and FDA agents during the last week executed search warrants on
businesses and homes in cities including Los Angeles and Tampa.</TE>

<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The debate was over, the dazzling TV lights extinguished, and the
onetime college football linebacker and Marine combat veteran was
lounging against the auditorium wall, assessing his performance.</LD>
<LD>   "All I wanted to do was to let people here, the viewers, know what
I cared about and what issues were important to me," Bill McBride
said. "I feel comfortable I was able to do that."</LD>
<LD>   For the past 14 months, the former managing partner of Florida's
largest law firm, Holland &amp; Knight, has crisscrossed the nation's
fourth most-populous state in the unaccustomed role of giant-killer.
His ambition is to be the next governor of Florida, but to realize
it, McBride will have to overcome two proven forces of politics:
Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who is seeking a second term, and fellow
Democrat and former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno.</LD>
<TE>   McBride, 57, got his best chance yet at statewide exposure Tuesday
evening in a televised debate at a community college here with Reno
and the third candidate in the Sept. 10 Democratic gubernatorial
primary, state Sen. Daryl Jones of Miami. It was a genteel affair,
with the Democrats attacking Bush and not each other, and McBride
returning time and again to the centerpiece of his campaign: a
proposed $1-billion plan to improve Florida public education.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to fix our public schools and get our state moving in the
right direction--a direction of hope and opportunity for everyone,"
McBride said. "I'm committed to making our schools among the best in
America. Unlike the current governor, I'll not be content to rank
near the bottom in every meaningful category."</TE>
<TE>   Giving a boost to the chances of the TV repairman's son from
Leesburg is the sober conclusion by many Democrats that despite
Reno's near-100% name recognition, she remains too controversial
among Florida voters for her role in the Clinton administration to
have any real hope of beating Bush in November. McBride, they
believe, has much greater potential to reach across party lines.</TE>
<TE>   Reno is widely associated with the decision to attack the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993 and to send Elian
Gonzalez back to Cuba in 2000. Ann Ralston, 49, a veteran Democratic
campaigner who has been coordinating volunteers for McBride in
greater Fort Lauderdale, said: "Ordinary voters I know don't think
she can beat Jeb; she's too liberal for northern Florida. And the
whole goal is to get Jeb out."</TE>
<TE>   By this summer, McBride, a former University of Florida football
player and Marine platoon leader in Vietnam, had clawed his way up to
41% name recognition and garnered endorsements from the teachers
union and the AFL-CIO. But with less than two weeks to go before the
primary, there may not be enough time for the stocky, soft-spoken
political upstart to eclipse Reno's star power and erode her
grass-roots support, especially among women and liberals in South
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, I'm impressed he has made his presence known,"
said Stephen Craig, professor of political science at the University
of Florida in Gainesville, where McBride also attended law school.
"On the other hand, unless something happens, he is going to" lose
badly.</TE>
<TE>   A June poll among likely Democratic voters in the primary found
that Reno would clobber McBride, 53% to 25%, with Jones picking up
only 3% and the remaining 19% undecided. Political analysts believe
McBride has been narrowing the gap with the former attorney general,
but that he still may trail her by 20 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   "Up here, I don't see his name a whole lot in evidence," said Joan
Carver, professor emeritus of political science at the University of
Jacksonville in northeastern Florida. "You don't hear people talking
much about McBride, except political people who always talk
politics."</TE>
<TE>   "Campaigns in the end, I believe, are not about promises and
personalities," McBride said Tuesday in a tacit reference to Reno's
celebrity. "They are about ideas and about commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Polls have also shown that Bush, the president's sibling, remains
popular among the Florida electorate, but McBride claimed the tide of
opinion had shifted in recent weeks because of scandals in the
state's child-welfare agency and growing discontent about crowded
public schools and poor school performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's already turned," McBride said. "One of the reasons
[Bush] is running negative ads against me is that I think he has seen
the same polls I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   The television spots now being broadcast by the Republicans on
stations across Florida accuse McBride of dancing around the issues.
In a season where the ethical lapses of big business have sparked
popular anger, he may also be vulnerable because of his past as a
board member of the state Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Council
of 100, an advisory group of business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts question what they see as McBride's one-note
campaign, pointing out that an estimated two-thirds of Florida voters
have no children in public schools. "To attract really good jobs from
companies that pay high wages, you've got to have a good public
school system," answered the candidate, who has a son, 14, and
daughter, 13.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study by the Florida Education Assn., which
endorsed McBride, the state ranks at or near the bottom of national
tables on teacher pay, class size, SAT scores, graduation rates and
other indicators of school performance. "In Florida, we've seen the
governor desperately trying to create a positive education image,
where none exists," said Tony Welch, spokesman for the teachers
union.</TE>
<TE>   Bush campaign officials counter that the governor has increased
spending on education by 27%, or $3 billion, since being elected in
1998, and that he instituted the state's first system of school
accountability. They also stress that Bush has been in office for
only 3 1/2 years, while Democrats held the state house in Tallahassee
virtually uninterrupted for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "A public school system the size of ours does not turn on a dime,"
said Todd Harris, communications director for the Bush campaign. "We
all know and understand that Bill McBride does not think that Jeb
Bush should be governor anymore; he has made that abundantly clear.
What is less than clear is why he thinks he would do any better, and
what specific plans and programs he would implement if elected."</TE>

<HD>FBI's E-Mail Search Is Terror Trial Focus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>The FBI might have missed e-mails sent by Sept. 11 conspiracy
defendant Zacarias Moussaoui when it examined computers he used weeks
before the terror attacks, according to the trial judge, who is
demanding detailed explanations from government investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism and murder
federal employees, said he was known on the Internet as "xdesertman"
and used an account on Microsoft Corp.'s free Hotmail service, court
documents showed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The defendant, who is representing himself in court, had asked the
judge weeks ago in a sealed request to force prosecutors to turn over
any data they uncovered about the e-mail account.</LD>
<TE>   Legal experts said it was unclear whether Moussaoui sought the
information to defend himself--by establishing an alibi, for
example--or to determine whether the government might already have
recovered incriminating messages from the account.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, prosecutors told the judge they could find no
evidence of the e-mail account.</TE>
<TE>   Wading into the dispute, U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema
expressed skepticism toward the government's assurances. In an order
made public Wednesday, she demanded that the FBI explain how it
examined the computers Moussaoui said he used and explain why the FBI
couldn't find traces of the e-mail account.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not understand why an immediate and thorough investigation
into the defendant's e-mail and computer activities did not lead
investigators to the ... account, if it existed," the judge said. She
added, "A more detailed explanation from the United States is
warranted."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Brinkema criticized as "impractical" a government
suggestion to prevent Moussaoui from viewing online court papers
produced by lawyers appointed to help him. She ordered that Moussaoui
be given access from his jail-cell computer to a special Web site
containing evidence and other documents related to his case but
cautioned that Moussaoui must not be allowed to visit other Internet
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema's rulings, rare pretrial victories for Moussaoui, were
the latest setback for the United States in its war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the span of a single day, the government:</TE>
<TE>   * Recanted claims that three people and three organizations had
deliberate ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   * Acknowledged that an Al Qaeda leader believed to have been
killed may be alive and operating in eastern Iran.</TE>
<TE>   * Admitted that two confidential sources in its investigation of
another terrorism suspect "have not been completely candid."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI for years has acknowledged it has serious difficulty in
scouring computers for evidence.</TE>

<HD>Luggage Quiz for Air Travelers Ends Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Beginning today, airline passengers will no longer be asked the
routine security questions about whether they have kept a close eye
on their baggage.</LD>
<LD>   Ticket agents have been required for the last 16 years to ask
passengers two questions: "Has anyone unknown to you asked you to
carry an item on this flight?" and "Have any of the items you are
traveling with been out of your immediate control since the time you
packed them?"</LD>
<LD>   The questions are being phased out because they create a hassle
and have never prevented a bombing or hijacking, James Loy, head of
the Transportation Security Administration, said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Over the years, they have lost whatever original value they
contributed and can now be safely eliminated," Loy said.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA, which was created after Sept. 11 to oversee aviation
security, has already begun to notify the airlines of the decision,
Loy said. "They are delighted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Loy, who took over last month, said the elimination of the
questions is part of a larger review of safety regulations. He
announced last week that passengers will be allowed to carry drinks
in paper or foam cups through metal detectors. Next on the agenda may
be random screening of passengers at airport gates, he said.</TE>

<HD>Restricting Flights on Sept. 11, 12 Proposed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators are proposing to restrict foreign aircraft flying
into and from New York and Washington and over Somerset County, Pa.,
on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   A Federal Aviation Administration official said the restrictions
proposed for Sept. 11 and 12 haven't been approved, but they would
ban flights within 30 miles of Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed restrictions also include:</LD>
<TE>   * Banning international flights to and from Washington from 8:30
a.m. to 11 a.m. EDT Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * International flights at New York wouldn't be permitted from 8
a.m. to noon, and 3:30 to 9:30 p.m. Sept. 11. The next day, the ban
would be in effect from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 7 to 10:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   * Small aircraft flying to and from New York would be restricted
from 7 a.m. Sept. 11 to 8 p.m. Sept. 13.</TE>
<TE>   * Flights would not be allowed over Somerset County, Pa., where
one of the four hijacked planes crashed, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the times of the restrictions are
meant to coincide with ceremonies scheduled in those areas to honor
victims of the attacks. Shanksville, Pa., was the community where
United Airlines Flight 93 crashed after being hijacked.</TE>
<TE>   Brown declined to comment about the government's reasons for
imposing the restrictions, but said the procedures were developed
jointly with officials from various national security agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still room for changes in the details," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Other FAA officials said the proposed restrictions were ordered by
national security agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I really can't understand it," one FAA official said. "There are
lots of vulnerabilities out there, but they apply equally to domestic
and foreign airlines. Why single out foreign airlines?"</TE>
<TE>   If implemented, the restrictions have the potential to affect
dozens of airlines.</TE>
<TE>   For example, more than 60 foreign carriers regularly use New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The agency's action is
expected to cover nearly four dozen airports of varying sizes along
the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also would curb flights by regional and commuter
airlines, Brown said, unless they have installed bulletproof cockpit
doors or have taken alternate security measures. Brown declined to
describe those alternate measures.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of several foreign carriers said they were
unprepared to comment concerning the planned restrictions, but a
spokesman for Britain's Virgin Atlantic Airways said discussions are
underway between the FAA and the International Air Transport Assn.,
which represents international airlines.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Rebuffed on Sex-Change Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>An inmate who claims he is a woman trapped in a man's body should
receive treatment for gender identity disorder, but cannot force the
state to pay for a sex-change operation, a federal judge ruled
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Kosilek, formerly known as Robert Kosilek, is serving a
life sentence without the possibility of parole for murdering his
wife. He sued the state Department of Correction, contending its
refusal to provide the surgery and treatment violated his 8th
Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Kosilek, 53, who has legally changed his name, said he suffers
from depression, anxiety and stress because he was denied treatment.
He cited two suicide attempts.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled that the state has failed to
adequately treat Kosilek's gender identity disorder, but said the
mistake fell short of an 8th Amendment violation because the inmate
did not prove Correction Commissioner Michael Maloney had shown
"deliberate indifference."</TE>
<TE>   Wolf ordered Maloney to allow medical professionals to evaluate
Kosilek and recommend treatment, including, at a minimum,
psychotherapy. If therapy fails to ease Kosilek's depression, Maloney
should also consider allowing Kosilek to receive female hormones, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge left open the possibility of Kosilek's receiving an
operation if medical experts deemed it necessary. Unless correction
officials changed their minds about giving Kosilek the surgery, the
inmate would have to go to court again to get it.</TE>
<TE>   Kosilek first began asking correction officials for treatment in
1990, after he was arrested in the killing of his 36-year-old wife,
Cheryl. A jury convicted Kosilek in 1993, finding that he strangled
his wife and left her body in the back of a car parked at a mall.</TE>
<TE>   Kosilek's lawyer, Fran Cohen, said she was pleased with the
ruling. She said it "establishes the principle that if you have
severe mental illness, you're entitled to treatment just as you would
be for any other medical condition."</TE>
<TE>   Department of Correction spokesman Justin Latini said officials
were pleased the judge found they did not violate the 8th Amendment.</TE>

<HD>6 People, All Family Members, Killed in Alabama</HD>
<DH>Crime: The victims represent three generations. A teenager
and her baby are missing. Officials seek two potential witnesses.</DH>

<DL>RUTLEDGE, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Six family members were shot to death at their rural homestead
Wednesday, and a 16-year-old and her baby were missing. Authorities
were searching for the children, a motive and two people they said
were potential witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of the victims, including three teenage boys, were
discovered at a tin-roofed house and a nearby mobile home Tuesday
night, Dist. Atty. John Andrews said.</LD>
<LD>   He said there were no suspects and did not comment as to what
might have provoked the violence.</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney did not identify the victims, but Coleman
Ball of nearby Greenville said law enforcement officials told him
they were all members of his family.</TE>
<TE>   He said his mother, Mila Ruth Ball, 62, who lived in the house,
was killed, as was his sister, Joann Ball, 35, who lived in the
mobile home. He said the other victims were Joann Ball's sons--Jerry,
18, Tony, 16, and John, 14--and Willie Haslip, 40, who was related to
Joann Ball by marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Ball's daughter, Janice, 16, and her baby were missing, Coleman
Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   He said they lived in a second mobile home at the site, and that
her boyfriend sometimes visited her there.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not say whether the 16-year-old and her
boyfriend were the two potential witnesses being sought.</TE>
<TE>   The killings have frightened people living along the surrounding
roads near Rutledge, about 40 miles south of Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to find me another place to live," said Lynn Pickens,
37, who took her children to stay with relatives Tuesday night after
learning of the killings. "I got four young 'uns. I can't put my
children in danger like that."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said two of the bodies were found when officers first
arrived Tuesday night, three others were found later, and the sixth
was found Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators strung crime-scene tape around the area and officers
kept onlookers away from the house, which has a screened porch and is
set on a tree-shaded lawn with the two mobile homes only a short walk
away.</TE>
<TE>   Ball said he went to his mother's home after an aunt called and
said the door to the house was locked and she was concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the six victims, spanning three generations of the Ball
family, a dog was found injured by gunfire.</TE>

<HD>Tuna Canned: Shrimp Hooks the No. 1 Spot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sorry tuna, you're No. 2 now. Shrimp has become the nation's favorite
seafood, boosted by eager etouffee eaters and poppers of popcorn
shrimp.</LD>
<LD>   "For the first time in recorded history, Americans are eating more
shrimp than canned tuna," the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said Wednesday. The agency said records go back to the
mid-1950s.</LD>
<LD>   The National Marine Fisheries Service's annual assessment of the
population's piscatorial preferences showed that people in the U.S.
ate a record average of 3.4 pounds of shrimp last year.</LD>
<TE>   That was up from 3.2 pounds the year before.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period canned tuna--long the reigning
seafood--plunged from 3.5 pounds per capita to 2.9 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Randi Thomas of the U.S. Tuna Foundation said that growing sales
of fresh tuna account for some of the decline in sales of the canned
product.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, delicatessen sales account for a lot of
canned tuna and after the terrorist attacks Sept. 11, there was a
sharp decline in business at delis, especially in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Overall consumption of fish and shellfish dipped last year, from
15.2 pounds per person to 14.8 pounds, NOAA's fisheries service
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Canned seafood consumption fell from 4.7 pounds to 4.2 pounds per
person, while consumption of fresh and frozen seafood edged up, from
10.2 pounds to 10.3 pounds. The amount of cured seafood eaten was
unchanged at 0.3 pounds per person.</TE>
<TE>   Fish filets and steaks--including all types of fish--totaled 3.4
pounds per person, a tenth of a pound increase; while fish sticks and
portions fell slightly, from 0.9 pounds to 0.8 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures from the United Nations, in total sales, the
United States is the world's third largest consumer of fish and
shellfish, behind China and Japan.</TE>

<HD>Victim's Mother Urges Life Prison Term for Skakel</HD>
<DH>Courts: It would be a fair trade-off for the 1975 killing
of her daughter, Dorthy Moxley says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Martha Moxley's mother testified Wednesday that she is haunted by the
knowledge that her daughter died in fear and pain, and she urged a
judge to sentence Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel to life in prison for
the teenager's murder nearly 27 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   At Skakel's sentencing hearing, Dorthy Moxley said she had long
prayed her daughter did not see the first blow from the golf club
used to beat her to death the night of Oct. 30, 1975.</LD>
<LD>   "I know now that's not the way it happened," Moxley said. "I know
she must have been frightened and suffered a great deal."</LD>
<TE>   "Michael Skakel sentenced us to life without Martha," Moxley said.
"I think it's only fair that he serve a similar sentence."</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, was convicted in June of
beating Martha to death when they were 15-year-old neighbors in
Greenwich. Under the guidelines in effect in 1975, which the court
will use in his case, Skakel could receive a minimum sentence of 10
years to life in prison and a maximum of 25 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley spoke after Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. rejected defense
motions to throw out the jury verdict and order a new trial. The
sentencing hearing will continue today.</TE>
<TE>   Martha's brother, John, said the murder occurred a few weeks after
his 17th birthday and forever changed his life. He said his father
could never talk about Martha's death and died relatively young.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother cried all the time for a while," he said. "The
intensity of her emotions were frightening to me."</TE>
<TE>   Skakel listened to the Moxley family without visible emotion, but
wept as his supporters pleaded with the judge to be lenient.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Beck, a neighbor in Windham, N.Y., said Skakel was kind and
a "wonderful father" to his 3-year-old son, George.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Hayden described how he had helped her brother with drug
and alcohol addiction in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe that without Michael's help my brother would not
be alive today," Hayden said.</TE>
<TE>   Kavanewsky rejected arguments that Skakel's defense was hamstrung
by the prosecution's failure to turn over a police sketch during the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   He also rejected claims that the prosecution inflamed the jury by
using an audio-video presentation that included photos of Martha's
autopsy and Skakel's voice on a tape describing his actions that
night.</TE>
<TE>   The defense said the sketch, a drawing of a man spotted by a
police officer the night of the murder, resembles the Skakel family
tutor, Kenneth Littleton.</TE>
<TE>   Littleton, who had started his job the day Martha was killed, was
an early suspect. During the trial, Skakel's lawyers repeatedly
suggested Littleton, who was given immunity from prosecution in the
case, was the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Hubert Santos said the sketch would have been
critical at the trial if prosecutors had turned it over.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Susann Gill said the defense received all of the police
reports that led to the sketch being made, and was given written
notice that the sketch existed.</TE>

<HD>Sprawl Adds to Drought, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Development: Water that would seep into soil now runs off
artificial surfaces and is polluted. The building industry criticizes
the report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The rapid expansion of paved-over and developed land in metropolitan
areas has made already intense drought conditions even worse, a
report released Wednesday says.</LD>
<LD>   Water that used to seep into fields or grasslands now rushes off
new roads, roofs, driveways and parking lots, turning into polluted
runoff.</LD>
<LD>   "Sprawl development is literally sending billions of gallons of
badly needed water down the drain each year--the storm drain," said
Betsy Otto, senior director for watershed programs at American
Rivers, a national environmental organization.</LD>
<TE>   "Sprawl hasn't caused this year's drought, but sprawl is making
water supply problems worse in many cities."</TE>
<TE>   In Atlanta and its surrounding counties--where more than 609,000
acres were developed between 1982 and 1997--development is sending 57
billion to 133 billion gallons of polluted runoff into streams and
rivers each year, according to the report, prepared by American
Rivers; the Natural Resources Defense Council, another national
environmental organization; and Smart Growth America, a group
dedicated to sustainable development.</TE>
<TE>   This water--which the report says could support the average annual
household needs of between 1.5 million and 3.6 million people--would
otherwise be filtered through the soil to recharge aquifers and
provide underground flows to replenish rivers, streams and lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Some government scientists said they agreed with some of the
report's general conclusions, such as that urbanization increases
runoff and reduces the recharging of ground water. But they
questioned the scientific rigor behind the computations.</TE>
<TE>   "They're portraying them as very dramatic; I would be skeptical
that they're so dramatic," said William Alley, chief of the U.S.
Geological Survey's office of ground water.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you have a simple rule of thumb--you pave an area, you
reduce infiltration--you cannot immediately take license to quantify
it," added Harry Lins, the agency's drought science coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the report, which studied the effects of
development on water supplies in 18 rapidly growing metropolitan
areas, said they were not trying to come up with precise numbers for
any region, but wanted to show the magnitude of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   They urged the Geological Survey to embark on a thorough
scientific study.</TE>
<TE>   Other drought experts said they had no doubt that rapid
development was exacerbating water shortages during the current
drought, but they agreed that the extent was impossible to quantify.
About 40% of the country is suffering through a moderate or severe
drought, with the most extreme conditions along much of the East
Coast and in the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a contributing factor," said Mark Svoboda, a climatologist
at the National Drought Mitigation Center, an independent institute
based at the University of Nebraska and funded by the U.S.
Agriculture Department.</TE>
<TE>   The model used in the study to compute the loss of ground-water
infiltration does not apply to Southern California and other arid
regions, where rainfall evaporates quickly and much of the drinking
water comes from snowmelt hundreds of miles away, the report's
authors said.</TE>
<TE>   Otto said she could not say whether Southern California's sprawl
would have a parallel effect on water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists explained that covering the ground with impervious
surfaces, such as roads and buildings, increases runoff and decreases
the reabsorption of rainwater.</TE>
<TE>   This reabsorption is particularly important to streams and lakes
during a drought, because ground water can seep into depleted bodies
of water.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary effect would be on stream flow," Alley said.
"Essentially, the recharge is working its way through ground water.
It sustains streams through very dry periods."</TE>
<TE>   The report's authors said the problem can be mitigated if future
development is concentrated in areas where people already live, new
road building is curtailed and open spaces--such as farms and
forests--are preserved. They also urged the adoption of new
techniques that would facilitate the absorption of storm water.</TE>
<TE>   "By investing wisely in places we live, we can both protect our
environment and improve our quality of life," said John Bailey,
associate director of Smart Growth America.</TE>
<TE>   Local, state and federal governments have a role to play in
reversing the trend, the authors said, because a whole range of
government spending, regulations, subsidies, taxes and policies now
stimulate sprawl by making development outside urban centers cheaper
and easier than building within cities.</TE>
<TE>   The construction industry criticized the report, calling it a
blatant effort by the environmental groups to support their goal of
increasing regulations on development.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is a zero-sum game," said Clayton Traylor, a senior vice
president of the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   "You move it from one place to another; it doesn't actually
disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Traylor said the report takes too much of a leap by concluding
that the increase in runoff depletes water supplies and worsens the
current drought.</TE>
<TE>   Modern developments use "extremely sophisticated" strategies to
contain the water and avoid the traditional perils of runoff, he
said.</TE>

back down to his barstool after another Twins win is to employ a
specific verbal sucker punch--unsportsmanlike but effective: The fans
didn't save the Twins, you remind him. A judge did.</LD>
<LD>   The fairy-tale team of 2002 would likely exist now only in the
record books under major league baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's
so-called contraction plan, but for U.S. District Judge Harry Crump's
order last fall that the team honor its lease with the aging
Metrodome and play through next season.</LD>
<LD>   "I know, I know," said a humbled Alan Green at Hubert's tavern,
across the street from the stadium, following a walloping of the
Seattle Mariners earlier this week. "We got lucky. Now, if they
strike, baseball is done here--really done."</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to find a Minnesota baseball fan who disagrees, from
former Twins stars Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek to Gov. Jesse Ventura
to the guy who answers the phones at the Twins' corporate offices.</TE>
<TE>   If the players strike, they concur, voters will never agree to
help the team build a new stadium--widely seen as a necessity for the
Twins' survival in baseball's 14th-largest market.</TE>
<TE>   The players union has threatened to strike Friday. With little
progress thus far in talks between the union and owners, a walkout
looks increasingly likely.</TE>
<TE>   From the blue plastic seats of the Metrodome, it also looks to be
the death knell for one of history's great smaller-town teams, a club
that lost more often than it won but came through just frequently
enough--with the help of Hall of Famers such as Harmon Killebrew--to
allow major league baseball to survive even in a place where the
number crunchers said it couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   The strike deadline comes as Minnesotans are falling back in love
with their team after many summers of discontent--a club that
embodies so many of the mysterious beauties of baseball and broke
nearly all the rules of baseball-as-business this season.</TE>
<TE>   Together with the Montreal Expos, the Twins were on Selig's
chopping block because they don't earn enough money. They can't
afford star players. Their home is a sterile, covered stadium with
artificial turf and tin-can acoustics that does more to put off fans
than lure them. They draw an average of just 22,000 fans per game,
compared with 27,800 across the majors. And, a year ago, they just
couldn't win.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a bunch of unknown, relatively low-paid players, led by a
manager who was hired just before spring training, started treating
the season like the gift it was.</TE>
<TE>   Torii Hunter had struggled in the big leagues and kept getting
sent down to the minors. He finally figured out the game, hitting 27
homers last year, and this year is a most valuable player candidate
while being hailed as perhaps the best center fielder in baseball.
Third baseman Corey Koskie had been a hockey goalie and volleyball
standout in Canada. Baseball was a hobby. The Twins drafted him in
the 26th round, and he has emerged as a team leader.</TE>
<TE>   Fans have grown so used to seamless double plays they hardly
noticed when the team turned three in a game against the Mariners
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Entering Wednesday's action, the Twins held a commanding 16
1/2-game lead, despite being the fourth-lowest paid team, with
players earning a combined $41 million this year. (The Texas Rangers'
Alex Rodriguez will earn more than half that himself, about $25
million this season.)</TE>
<TE>   It has been 11 years since the Twins found themselves in such a
pleasant late-season situation. They are playoff-bound for the first
time since 1991--unless there are no playoffs. The situation is
similar to that of the 1994 Expos, whose division-leading record went
for naught when a players' strike canceled postseason play. It is
that precedent that terrifies many fans.</TE>
<TE>   The small-market Expos were 74-40, and leading the National League
East by six games when the players went out, canceling the World
Series for the first time in 90 years. The team has had just one
winning season since and, like the Twins, is struggling to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "We barely made it to this season," said Ryan Kuno, the
switchboard operator at the Twins' offices. "Now the state has
started supporting us. We're selling some tickets. It's fun again. If
baseball implodes, people here will just watch the [National Football
League] Vikings again and forget about baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Twins owner Carl Pohlad has said he's tired of dumping money into
the team and would dismantle it if voters would not help buy a new
stadium with more luxury boxes, soda stands and other
revenue-producing amenities. Before the judge stepped in, however,
legislators found it difficult to drum up much support for a publicly
financed stadium. Pohlad, for his part, played the role he has for
years--rich bad guy.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest-paid player will make $300,000 next season, however.
And one of the main sticking points in negotiations has been the
players' refusal to accept salary caps.</TE>
<TE>   This has left fans here reconsidering Pohlad, and fans across the
country second-guessing the players' positing in the whole squabble.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Genrich, a 32-year-old computer programmer, stood outside the
Metrodome before Wednesday evening's game against the Mariners,
hawking a program called Gameday. Along with two brothers and a
friend, Genrich began publishing the slick magazine to compete with
the team's official version, and at $1 per copy, selling it for a
quarter the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it because we love this game," Genrich said. "And I'm
trying to understand what they're arguing over and it's easier to
sympathize, surprisingly, with the owners.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to bring some financial equality to the game, and
the players are trying to protect $250-million contracts like Alex
Rodriguez's."</TE>
<TE>   Genrich sold a boy a program, handed him a free pencil to keep
score, and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets to the point," he said, "where you say a pox on both
their houses."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Suspect Has Brain Hemorrhage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The man named as the top suspect in the abduction of Elizabeth Smart
suffered an apparent hemorrhage and was on life support Wednesday
after a six-hour emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from his
brain.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital officials said Richard Albert Ricci's
prognosis--including whether he suffered any brain damage--wouldn't
be known for 24 to 48 hours. They said the cause of the apparent
cerebral hemorrhage was unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse said his first reaction
upon hearing of Ricci's condition was to swear.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly, if he does not survive, that would be a big impact on
the case," Dinse said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said from the first, this was an unusual case," Dinse said.
"To have another twist come in was exceptional in my experience."</TE>
<TE>   Though authorities have named him as their top suspect, Ricci, 48,
has maintained his innocence and has not been charged in the
disappearance of 14-year-old Elizabeth, who was taken from her
bedroom by a gunman June 5.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci, a former handyman for the Smart family, who is in prison
for violating parole after he was charged with theft and burglary,
told guards Tuesday he was having trouble breathing, state
Corrections spokesman Jack Ford said. As they talked to him, he
passed out.</TE>
<TE>   They began resuscitation, and he was flown to University Hospital
in Salt Lake City, Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Robby Russo said it was too early
to tell whether Ricci suffered brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   No traces of drugs were found in Ricci's cell, and Ford said Ricci
didn't leave a note to indicate suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most bizarre thing that I ever could have imagined,"
Elizabeth's father, Ed Smart, said.</TE>
<TE>   Police hoped that survival would make Ricci more cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an individual who generally speaking never volunteered a lot
of information," Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci had been in court earlier Tuesday, when his attorneys asked
for more time to review theft charges against him. Third District
Judge Paul Maughan granted the request, setting a Sept. 17 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The theft charges include allegations that he took items from the
Smarts' home.</TE>

<HD>Teens' Tobacco Addiction Faster Than Once Thought</HD>
<DH>Health: New study finds that young people get hooked often
after only a few cigarettes and that girls become addicted more
easily than boys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teens become hooked on tobacco much faster than researchers had
previously believed, often after only a few cigarettes, according to
a major new study.</LD>
<LD>   And for reasons that are not yet clear, girls become hooked much
more easily than boys, according to the study of middle school
students in Massachusetts.</LD>
<LD>   Among teenage girls who got hooked, it took only an average of
about three weeks from when they started smoking occasionally. Half
of the boys who became addicted were hooked within six months,
according to the study, which appears in today's issue of Tobacco
Control.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, researchers believe that it takes about two years and
smoking half a pack a day for an adult to become addicted to
nicotine.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we knew [about smoking in teens] was wrong," said Dr.
Joseph R. DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center,
who led the international team that performed the study.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that kids who got hooked quickly would be the exception
to the rule," he said. "As it turned out, the kids who did not get
hooked quickly were the exception.... Some of these kids were hooked
within a few days of starting to smoke."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not good news," said epidemiologist Jennifer O'Loughlin
of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal, who is
performing similar research. "If children are getting addicted very
early on after very low exposures, it means that prevention is going
to become more and more difficult to sell. What we will be talking
about is cessation for children--nicotine patches, inhalers, Zyban
and everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies have shown that 90% of smokers begin before age
19. And for those who started smoking as youths, it requires an
average of 18 years to quit. Researchers have thus focused intensive
efforts on learning how to prevent smoking among youth, but those
efforts have not generally been successful.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, O'Loughlin noted, studies have found that some smoking
prevention efforts have, perversely, actually led to smoking
increases. "We're not helping, and there is nothing obvious that can
be done" to warn off teenagers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   DiFranza is a well-respected anti-smoking activist whose early
research helped demonstrate that the advertising cartoon character
Joe Camel was a strong inducement to children to begin smoking, and
who documented how cigarettes were readily available to youths in
most stores. The latter effort led to new laws to restrict cigarette
sales to minors.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, his
team enrolled 679 seventh-grade students (ages 12 and 13) in two
small Massachusetts towns. Each student was interviewed three times
per year for 30 months. The interviews sought detailed histories of
tobacco use, including dates, duration, frequency, quantity and other
characteristics. Researchers also looked for any one of 11 signs of
nicotine dependence, including smoking in places where you are not
supposed to, like school; finding it hard to concentrate without
smoking; and feeling irritable when you can't smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 332 children who reported using tobacco at least once,
40% reported symptoms of dependence.</TE>
<TE>   The median time to onset of symptoms was 21 days for girls and 183
days for boys. When the symptoms began, the median frequency of
smoking was only two cigarettes, one day per week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's startling to find that kids who are smoking two cigarettes
per week need help to overcome a dependency on nicotine, but the data
shows that youths who showed signs of being hooked at these very low
levels of consumption were 44 times more likely to be still smoking
at the end of the study," DiFranza said.</TE>
<TE>   The team coined the term "juvenile onset nicotine dependence" to
stress that children are different from adults when it comes to the
effects of nicotine. The adolescent brain is still developing, and
thus may be more vulnerable to addiction than adults, he speculated.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting that view is a separate study, released Wednesday, in
which government researchers said the younger people are when they
first try marijuana, the more likely they are to become dependent on
illegal drugs later in life.</TE>
<TE>   DiFranza said that animal research has shown that, at doses
associated with smoking, nicotine causes brain damage in adolescents
that is not seen in adult animals. He noted that "we have begun a new
study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to explore the
differences between the sexes."</TE>

<DH>Angels: They lose to Devil Rays, 8-5, in 10 innings but
maintain their slim lead over Mariners in the AL wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels, for one of the few times in franchise history, find
themselves in an enviable position.</LD>
<LD>   If the season were to end today, they would be in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is there might not be any playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   If that wasn't frustrating enough, the Angels can become the first
team to lose a series to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in two months. The
Devil Rays rallied from a four-run deficit for an 8-5, 10-inning
victory in front of 17,740 at Edison Field on Wednesday, quite a feat
for the team with the worst record in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wasted chances, stranding 11 runners, seven in scoring
position. Second baseman Adam Kennedy made a key error, allowing the
tying run to score in the eighth. Their bullpen, which has the
league's best earned-run average, squandered a big lead for the
second time in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis and Al Levine stumbled when called on.
Schoeneweis let a 5-3 lead get away in the eighth and Levine gave up
three runs in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, another Devil Ray victory today and they will win
their first series since taking two of three from Baltimore at the
end of June.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was one that got away, that's all you can say," Angel
Manger Mike Scioscia said. "We have been very, very good at holding
leads or else we wouldn't be in the position we are in now."</TE>
<TE>   The position the Angels are in now has them four games behind
Oakland in the AL West and a half-game ahead of Seattle in the
wild-card race. But the position that will determine the Angels' fate
is the one that will be taken in New York, where negotiations
continue to head off Friday's strike deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "I focus on today," Darin Erstad said. "Yesterday is over and
tomorrow is too far ahead. We pay people to do the negotiating. I
just play baseball. My focus is on the game tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "Obviously, the closer the deadline gets, the more
it is in your head."</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays would be a team that could benefit from a strike.
At least it would save them the pain of playing the final month of
the season. Beyond that? Well, labor pains and contractions do go
together.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig has talked about "six to eight teams that
could go out of business in 18 months" and the Devil Rays are
believed to be on that list. But for now, they merely remain American
League chum.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even bottom feeders have their feasts and the Devil Rays
chewed up the Angel bullpen Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who let a four-run lead get away in a 10-9 loss to
Boston on Monday, blew a 5-1 lead Wednesday. Jarrod Washburn took the
four-run lead into the seventh but left after giving up a single to
John Flaherty and a home run to Ben Grieve. Washburn, trying to
become the Angels' first 16-game winner since 1993, turned things
over to the bullpen. Nothing went right from then on.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber got through the inning, but only after being hit on the
left shin with a grounder. Weber suffered a contusion and was taken
to UC Irvine Medical Center for X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Schoeneweis faced three batters with no success. He
walked Andy Sheets to start the inning and Randy Winn followed with a
double. Aubrey Huff then tapped a grounder just out of Schoeneweis'
reach. Kennedy charged and fielded the ball but threw wild to first.
Sheets and Winn scored to make it a 5-5 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Levine gave up four consecutive hits to start the 10th, including
Jared Sandberg's booming double that gave the Devil Rays a 6-5 lead.
The Angel bullpen has given up 12 runs in the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "Every bullpen goes through this," Washburn said. "I have 100%
confidence in any one of those guys. They just didn't get it done
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel batters didn't get it done either. They had chances
early to put the game away, but Kennedy's two-run triple was the only
clutch hit they could muster through five innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, the Devil Rays helped out. The Angels had only one
hit in the inning--a run-scoring double by David Eckstein--but scored
three runs. A wild pitch and a hit batter helped set up the inning.
Second baseman Felix Escalona's throwing error on Erstad's grounder
let in two runs.</TE>

<TE>   While baseball talks contraction, college football plows
gluttonously forward like an offensive tackle toward a buffet table.
Everywhere you look, football hotbeds are adding seats to football
monuments, from Oregon to Oklahoma, Ohio State to Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan and Tennessee have gone so mad in their annual race for
stadium-capacity supremacy, "vertigo" has become the most common fan
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Players are bigger, coaches' salaries are up and, if you read
reports out of the Southeastern Conference, chicanery is still in a
bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, college football has been super-sized. This year's
hot-plate special offers more than 700 games over a 135-day stretch.
Thanks to a calendar quirk that features 14 Saturdays from Labor Day
through November, teams can play 12-game regular seasons this year
and next, then again in 2008 and 2019 (Nostradamus saw this coming
centuries ago).</TE>
<TE>   It follows that a really big sport has some really big questions:</TE>
<TE>   Any thoughts on opening (last) weekend games?</TE>
<TE>   Not pretending to be an expert, let's go with Colorado State over
Virginia, North Carolina State over New Mexico, Ohio State big over
Texas Tech, Nebraska in a romp over Arizona State, Wisconsin in a
nail-biter over Fresno State and Florida State escaping against Iowa
State, oh, let's say 38-31.</TE>
<TE>   Are there too many bowl games?</TE>
<TE>   Get real, you. Don't you realize that with 28 bowl games now, that
means 28 coaches will get carried off the field holding some piece of
junk hardware to take back to their drooling boosters?</TE>
<TE>   In what other sport do you get 28 champions? Last year, Clemson
actually paid to go to the Humanitarian Bowl for the chance to stomp
Louisiana Tech. Worth every penny, too, when you're sitting in a
recruit's home and he's asking what you've done lately.</TE>
<TE>   When you sit down and ask why there is no playoff in college
football, this is why.</TE>
<TE>   Can Miami repeat as national champions?</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes are ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press and
coaches' preseason poll, but we're going to say no after taking a
quick check under the hood.</TE>
<TE>   Miami returns quarterback Ken Dorsey but lost 11 players to the
NFL draft, including five first-round picks. The Hurricanes must
replace their entire secondary and Bryant McKinnie at left tackle.
Their most promising back, Frank Gore, ripped up a knee last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Most years, Miami plays a two-game season against Florida State
and Virginia Tech. This year Miami plays Florida State, Florida,
Tennessee and Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Who is going to win the Heisman Trophy?</TE>
<TE>   A quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, the top candidates this year all toss spirals. Rex Grossman
(Florida), Dorsey (Miami), Byron Leftwich (Marshall), Eli Manning
(Mississippi), Chris Simms (Texas), Dave Ragone (Louisville) and
Jason Gesser (Washington State).</TE>
<TE>   The only running back on most preseason lists is Oregon's Onterrio
Smith, who didn't even start last season.</TE>
<TE>   Will fans give Tyrone Willingham a chance at Notre Dame?</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely. You think two games are enough? The most damning note
entering Labor Day has to be Danny Sheridan listing Notre Dame as
100,000-to-1 shots to win the national title.</TE>
<TE>   If you entered Notre Dame in a horse race at those odds, six guys
from the glue factory would be waiting at the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has won 11 national titles, the last in 1988, but 7-5
in 2002 would be a good year. The problem in South Bend remains the
same: The schedule is better than the talent. Gluttons for
punishment, Notre Dame adds Florida State to a ledger that already
includes Maryland, Michigan, Purdue, USC and Michigan State, which
was 5-0 against former coach Bob Davie.</TE>
<TE>   And make sure to circle Stanford's Oct. 5 visit on the calendar.
Rest assured Cardinal players have in the wake of former coach
Willingham's bailout.</TE>
<TE>   How badly will NCAA probation hurt Alabama?</TE>
<TE>   You hate what it's doing to the kids. Example: Instead of going to
a bowl game this year, the Crimson Tide will have to endure a
recently added, season-ending trip to play Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference between the Black Coaches Assn. Bowl and the
Black Coaches Assn. Classic?</TE>
<TE>   The question should be, how come there are only two more black
Division I-A coaches (four) than BCA games?</TE>
<TE>   How much will college football miss Steve Spurrier?</TE>
<TE>   As much as a baseball player would miss spit. Spurrier left behind
a legacy and a ton of talent, but it worries us that new Coach Ron
Zook has already come down with Swamp fever.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sleeping and eating are wastes of time," he told the
Miami Herald. "I've always said that. But you have to do them."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Spurrier's favorite word in the off-season was "Fore!"
Zook opened his regime by refusing to allow anyone to sit down at
practice, reporters included.</TE>
<TE>   Zook says he likes to get four quality hours of sleep a night. He
may cut back to three after September games against Miami and
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Could you please, once and for all, explain the bowl championship
series?</TE>
<TE>   We'd rather pull warm gum off our shoes. We will say this: The
system will be in place for at least the next full rotation of BCS
title games: Fiesta, Sugar, Orange and Rose before the contract
expires after the 2005 season.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial rankings system was tweaked in the off-season,
as margin of victory was removed from the formula, which means
schools such as Oregon will no longer be penalized for winning close
games in a tough conference.</TE>
<TE>   Quality win points will also now be awarded only for victories
against top-10 schools instead of those in the top 15.</TE>
<TE>   Conference commissioners blew it, though, by not insisting a
school must win its conference to be eligible for the BCS title game.
Last year, this would have knocked out Nebraska, which did not even
win its division in the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who is going to play for the national title in this year's Fiesta
Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Logic suggests the Oklahoma-Texas winner on Oct. 12 against
Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma misses Nebraska and Kansas State this year, gets Colorado
at home on Nov. 2 and has had Texas' number the last two years. No
team in the country has more talent than Texas, yet the Longhorns
tend to tighten up when the going gets tough.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State certainly looked vulnerable against Iowa State last
weekend; however, the schedule sets up for another national title
run.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles have to win two key games, at Miami on Oct. 12 and
against Spurrier-less Florida in Tallahassee on Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, though, might want to discover a pass rush before
then.</TE>
<TE>   Is it true Georgia hasn't won a Southeastern Conference title in
20 years?</TE>
<TE>   Yes it is, and thanks for writing in, Herschel Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's drought could end this season, especially now that
longtime Georgia nemesis Spurrier has vacated the SEC East Division.</TE>
<TE>   Will Duke ever win another game?</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, for sure. Football may be another story. Duke has
lost 23 consecutive games and is closing in on Northwestern's major
college record of 34. The ray of hope shines on Sept. 28, when
hapless Duke gets a crack at hapless Navy in Annapolis.</TE>
<TE>   If Duke fails there, well, there's always basketball.</TE>
<TE>   How long will Penn State's Joe Paterno and Bobby Bowden of Florida
State keep coaching?</TE>
<TE>   As long as both can keep a whistle in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Bowden is 72 and Paterno turns 76 in December, but
there's a cat-and-mouse battle for posterity going on here. Paterno
leads all major college coaches in victories with 327, but Bowden is
only three behind at 324.</TE>
<TE>   If Paterno retires, Bowden will zoom ahead and seize the all-time
lead. Bowden might take the lead regardless, unless Paterno can turn
course on consecutive losing seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Is the Big 12 the best conference?</TE>
<TE>   Yes. Let's lower the lights and make the Iowa State presentation.
The Cyclones were perhaps one blown officials' call from taking
Florida State into overtime last weekend, yet may end up fourth in
the Big 12's North Division and scrambling to make a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Why? This is the year Iowa State plays at Oklahoma, at Texas, at
Colorado, at Kansas State and gets to host Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   The Big 12 has four teams ranked in the Associated Press top 10
and three--Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma--have real shots at the
national title (Not this year, Nebraska).</TE>
<TE>   Can Washington State really make a national title run out of the
Pac-10?</TE>
<TE>   Wow, safe to say that's the first time in history that subject has
ever been broached. Amazingly, the short answer is "maybe."
Washington State has a tough question to answer on Sept. 14 when it
plays at Ohio State, but the rest of the nonconference schedule is
Ryan Leaf soft, plus the Cougars get Washington, USC and Oregon at
Pullman this year.</TE>
<TE>   Stranger things have happened, although we can't think of any at
the moment.</TE>

<DH>Dodgers: Perez homers and pitches eight shutout innings;
Gagne gets franchise-record 45th save in 1-0 win over Diamondbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On any other night, Odalis Perez and Eric Gagne would have been the
story at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Perez erased a career of frustration against the NL West-leading
Arizona Diamondbacks by shutting them out for eight innings Wednesday
night in a 1-0 Dodger victory.</LD>
<LD>   And Perez, who gave up five hits and had been 0-4 lifetime against
Arizona with a 6.38 earned-run average, added an exclamation point by
accounting for the only run with a two-out fifth-inning home run, his
first in the majors.</LD>
<TE>   Gagne came on in the ninth and, despite giving up a single and
walk, struck out the side for his 45th save, breaking Todd Worrell's
single-season Dodger record set in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, this wasn't just any night at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It was a night of uncertainty along with elation, of tension along
with the triumph, of hesitancy along with the history.</TE>
<TE>   None of that was evident in the stands. A crowd of 41,115 came out
and exhibited no bitterness or anger. The only clenched fists the
fans exhibited were to hit the beach balls bouncing around the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Their only outburts were cheers when Perez rounded the bases, more
cheers when Gagne clinched the victory with a 97-mph fastball that
blew past Erubiel Durazo and some scattered boos when Dodger Shawn
Green was thrown out stealing to close out the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the clubhouse, the Dodgers tried to act as if it was
business as usual, their 77th victory in their 133rd game, leaving
them 2 1/2 games ahead of the San Francisco Giants, also winners
Wednesday, in the wild-card race and seven games behind Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't it a strange night? Dodger Manager Jim Tracy was asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, not really," he said. "It was a very special night for Odalis
Perez."</TE>
<TE>   As the Dodgers began packing for a trip that might be over before
it begins, for games in Houston that might never be played, reporters
surrounded catcher Paul Lo Duca, the Dodgers' player representative.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just like a normal game," he insisted. "I tip my hat to
the guys. It's not something we can control. It is in [the
negotiators] hands now."</TE>
<TE>   For the eight innings the game was in Perez's hands, he was
brilliant, striking out four and not allowing a walk. In improving to
12-8, Perez threw 109 pitches, 77 strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "He won the game by himself," Lo Duca said. "It was Odalis 1, them
0. You could tell from the beginning he had great stuff."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight I had everything working," he said, "my fastball
especially."</TE>
<TE>   The home run came with two out in the fifth inning against starter
and loser Rick Helling (8-9 and 0-6 lifetime against the Dodgers).
Perez came up to the plate for his 110th major league at-bat with no
home runs over five seasons, four of those with the Atlanta Braves.
He hit Helling's first pitch into the right-field stands.</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to nail down the victory and his place in the record
books, Gagne gave up a leadoff single to Junior Spivey, then struck
out Luis Gonzalez and Matt Williams on six pitches.</TE>
<TE>   But, with the crowd poised to erupt, Gagne walked Steve Finley,
the potential winning run.</TE>
<TE>   Out came Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn to settle down Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   Up came Durazo.</TE>
<TE>   Down went Durazo.</TE>
<TE>   Down went Worrell to second on the Dodgers' all-time save list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of weird to see a little Canadian in the record books,"
said Gagne, who is from Montreal. "You don't see it that often. At
the beginning of the year, I was just hoping to make the team. I had
no idea where I'd be."</TE>
<TE>   Over in the Arizona clubhouse, the strike was Topic A.</TE>
<TE>   "When we take a stand, we take one together," said Diamondback
outfielder David Dellucci. "It's not 15 teams on one side, 15 on the
other. We are all in the same boat. It would be disheartening to miss
a World Series for a strike, but we have to make a stand."</TE>
<TE>   Said Perez: "I'm praying there is no strike because I know this
team has everything. We just need to keep playing."</TE>

<HD>Shuey Suddenly Turns It Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy has a theory why reliever Paul Shuey
struggled in his early outings with the Dodgers but has been nearly
unhittable of late.</LD>
<LD>   "He got acclimated," Tracy said. "His family is now with him.
There is ... a lot involved. We like to dismiss it sometimes, I
think, but transition ... when you're [traded] well over halfway
through a season, that can be somewhat tough.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of work involved there, both mentally and
physically, to make that transition."</LD>
<TE>   Shuey, who was traded to the Dodgers by the Cleveland Indians on
July 28, had a 9.35 earned-run average in his first 11 appearances
with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander has not allowed a run in his last 7 2/3 innings
over five games, giving up one hit, two walks and striking out four
batters. He got the first base hit of his career in Tuesday night's
6-1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just getting ... comfortable and with the family here, we're
in a good situation," said Shuey, who was drafted second overall by
the Indians in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about my family now and I just feel like I can go
out and pitch. Honestly, the ball's just bouncing better for me."</TE>
<TE>   Shuey also said that he's been throwing more fastballs lately and
not relying as much on breaking and split-fingered pitches. Shuey,
though, refused to blame being homesick on his initial struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying that's the reason I was stinking early," he said.
"I was just stinking early. Whether that was from trying too much or
whatever, the bottom line was bad pitching. I don't think I'm a bad
pitcher.... I feel I'm a lot better right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sight Monday night of a motionless Alex Cora, who had collided
with Arizona shortstop Tony Womack's knee while sliding head-first on
a steal attempt, made Dave Roberts shudder. But that doesn't mean the
speedy Dodger leadoff hitter is going to eschew the head-first slide.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," Roberts said. "I've been playing this way for a long
time and I think that with Alex it was a freak injury and I'm just
glad it wasn't too serious. But as far as the way I play the game,
that doesn't change it. I play hard all the time and I think I would
do myself and this team a disservice by playing cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts also said that slowing down his style would leave him
susceptible to injury.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to go on instincts and just play the game the way
you know how to play it," he said. "I dive around, running all over
the place. That's how [I] play this game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, eligible to come off the disabled list Sunday, took
batting practice and soft toss swings Wednesday for the second day in
a row.</TE>

<HD>Sunday Silence Lacked Pedigree, Not Results</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Colt, who defeated rival Easy Goer to win the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was one of America's greatest
racehorses.</DH>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Pat Valenzuela didn't think that death would ever claim Sunday
Silence. After all, the gifted colt had never failed Valenzuela in
the saddle.</LD>
<LD>   "He was always such a fighter, I think he'll get through this,"
said Valenzuela, not long before Sunday Silence, at 16, died from
complications of three surgeries on his right foreleg. The painful
end, on Aug. 19, came on Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan,
far from the U.S. venues where the near-black beauty scored his epic
victories, but in a land where he had become the premier stallion.</LD>
<LD>   American horsemen were always turning their backs on Sunday
Silence, from the time he was a yearling and Arthur Hancock tried to
sell him, to the day when injuries forced his retirement and it was
time to start a stud career. Unwanted in the U.S. as both a runner
and a stallion, all Sunday Silence could do was to keep throwing wins
and successful foals at his detractors. He'll be remembered as one of
America's greatest racehorses, and Japan's greatest sire.</LD>
<TE>   In fairness to the naysayers, the son of Halo and Wishing Well was
not of blue-ribbon breeding, especially on his dam's side, and his
back legs were shaped like parentheses. "Cowhocked" was the operative
word.</TE>
<TE>   "He was weedy in the beginning," said Hancock, son of the
legendary Kentucky breeder Bull Hancock. "He reminded you of a skinny
teenager."</TE>
<TE>   At a Keeneland yearling sale, Hancock thought he had bought the
colt back for $17,000--that's where the bidding stopped--in a deal
with Sunday Silence's breeder, Oak Cliff Thoroughbreds. After the
ticket was signed, though, Oak Cliff's people told Hancock that he
could keep the horse--and the $17,000 tab--with their compliments.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock tried one more time to sell Sunday Silence, at a Hollywood
Park auction of unraced 2-year-olds in 1988, but the bidding stalled
before it reached the pre-sale reserve of $50,000. Hancock's buy-back
that time was $32,000.</TE>
<TE>   If you've got a young horse who you think might contend for the
Kentucky Derby one day, you don't try to unload him on the cheap, or
later send him cross-country, from California to Kentucky, by van.
But after the Hollywood Park nonsale, this was Sunday Silence's lot,
and somewhere in Texas, the van driver suffered a fatal heart attack
and the vehicle overturned. Hancock's colt luckily suffered only
minor injuries. A believer in fate to a fault--he not only looked
downward for lucky pennies, he'd check the penny to see if the year
of the penny was right with the stars--Hancock saw this as a
harbinger of monumental magnitude.</TE>
<TE>   Still trying to cut his losses, Hancock sold half of the horse to
trainer Charlie Whittingham, an old friend, for $25,000. Whittingham
then sold half of his half, for another $25,000, to Ernest Gaillard,
a retired surgeon from La Jolla. Before Sunday Silence ever got to
the races, Hancock and Whittingham had taken on the look of the movie
and hit Broadway show "The Producers," in which the resourceful Max
Bialystock tries to sell more than 100% of his turkey of a play to
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "People going to those sales must have thought I was trying to
sell my culls," Hancock said. "For some reason, Halo was no longer a
popular sire, even though he had sired Sunny's Halo [the 1983 Derby
winner]. Then he also sired Goodbye Halo [Hancock's Kentucky Oaks
winner in 1988]."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, even though Sunday Silence had won the Santa Anita Derby
by a record 11 lengths, the Kentucky Derby was being widely conceded
to Easy Goer, the 2-year-old champion from 1988 whose regal
bloodlines dwarfed Sunday Silence's sketchy pedigree. The Derby would
be Round 1 in a ring-a-ding-ding, season-long rivalry between the
colts.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, it was 3-1, Sunday Silence, but Easy Goer's backers
were a stubborn bunch. By the time Sunday Silence had beaten Easy
Goer for the third time, in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream
Park, the loser's supporters concluded that jockey Pat Day, not the
ability of the horses, was the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Day might have been outridden by Valenzuela at Pimlico, in one of
the best Preaknesses ever, but in reality Sunday Silence won with a
turn of foot that usually left Easy Goer gasping. The exception was
in the Belmont Stakes, over Easy Goer's home track, where he won
impressively and spoiled Sunday Silence's Triple Crown bid.</TE>
<TE>   At the Kentucky Derby, run on a muddy track on a raw, 50-degree
day in Louisville, Whittingham's confidence cup ran over. Three years
before, with Ferdinand, the shiny-headed hall-of-fame trainer had
reached the winner's circle at 73, the oldest conditioner to ever win
the race. With Sunday Silence, a 2 1/2-length winner, he updated that
record to 76 years. Pat Day had won five races earlier on the card,
but with Easy Goer the best he could do was second place.</TE>
<TE>   Easy Goer could still have flip-flopped the horse-of-the-year vote
with a win in the Breeders' Cup. A month before the race, Valenzuela
ran afoul of the Santa Anita stewards, testing positive for cocaine.
Chris McCarron, aboard Whittingham's colt for the first time, rode
him with the confidence of a safecracker. The margin over Easy Goer
was only a neck, but no one--starting with McCarron--ever doubted
that this was going to be Sunday Silence's day.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence ran only twice more, finishing with nine wins and
five seconds in 14 starts and earnings of $4.9 million, which at the
time left him behind only Alysheba and John Henry. Before he was
retired, the late Zenya Yoshida bought one-fourth of the colt for
$2.25 million, and later he bought out everybody for a reported $12
million more. Yoshida's family is still gleeful. Japan has never seen
a stallion like him; it is not unusual for his progeny to earn $30
million a year in purses. Easy Goer was voted into the Racing Hall of
Fame too, partly because of the company he kept.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Season-ending strike would derail a rare chance
for a Freeway World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can you imagine what it would be like if the Angels and Dodgers met
in the World Series this October?</LD>
<LD>   The Angels would actually appear on television ... live
television. Dodger Stadium would be filled with fans ... by the first
inning. Local sports anchors would probably trip all over themselves
trying to find their way to Edison Field ... because most of them
have never been there.</LD>
<LD>   And what about the buzz around Southern California, the excitement
a Freeway World Series would create? Rex Hudler, the Angel
broadcaster, would be so emotionally charged, so bursting with
enthusiasm, he might just go the route of that drummer in "This is
Spinal Tap," the guy who just ... blew up.</LD>
<TE>   "That would be so cool for us, for the Angels, for the community,"
Dodger veteran utility player Dave Hansen said of a potential Freeway
World Series, not the possibility of Hudler spontaneously combusting.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Mets and Yankees made it [to the World Series in 2000],
it was really special for New York, and it would be the same way
here. The whole community would be proud of both teams, it would be
something everyone talked about, it would pull us all together.... It
would be awesome."</TE>
<TE>   It will have no chance of happening if a strike wipes out the rest
of this season and the postseason, as the 1994 strike did.</TE>
<TE>   Fans--and, yes, even most players--in such cities as Atlanta,
Phoenix, Minneapolis and New York will be furious if a work stoppage,
scheduled to begin Friday if a collective bargaining agreement can't
be reached, forces cancellation of the playoffs and World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps no part of the country has more to lose in a strike
than Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have not won a playoff game since 1988, and the
Angels, who have not reached the playoffs since 1986, have never made
the playoffs in the same year--rare is the season in which both teams
even contend for division titles--but 2002 appears to be an
exception.</TE>
<TE>   After their franchise-worst 6-14 start in April, the Angels went
on a torrid 31-10 run from April 24 to June 10, establishing
themselves as a legitimate playoff threat.</TE>
<TE>   They have more pitching depth than those Angel teams that
collapsed in 1995 and fizzled in September of 1997 and '98, and their
offense is so balanced they don't have to lean too heavily on one or
two players.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 78-54 after Wednesday night's loss to Tampa Bay,
four games behind Oakland in the American League West and a half-game
ahead of Seattle in the AL wild-card race, and though September, the
black-hole month in franchise history, is around the corner, this
Angel team has shown few signs of cracking.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have shown a similar resilience. They had a 2 1/2-game
lead over Arizona in the National League West at the All-Star break
before going 8-17 to start the second half and falling seven games
behind the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   But they recovered from that four-week skid with 15 wins in their
next 20 games and are 77-56 after Wednesday night's 1-0 victory over
Arizona. They are 2 1/2 games ahead of San Francisco in the NL
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitchers Hideo Nomo, Andy Ashby, Odalis Perez and Omar
Daal have been brilliant in August, the offensively challenged
Dodgers have developed a knack for coming up with clutch hits, and
the dominance of closer Eric Gagne has been the primary reason they
are 24-11 in one-run games.</TE>
<TE>   Good starting pitching, timely hitting, a reliable closer ... the
Angels and Dodgers seem to have many of the ingredients required to
make an October run--if there is an October track to run on, that is.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has shown everyone we are good enough to go to the
World Series and win the World Series," Perez said. "A strike for us
right now would be devastating. We don't need that."</TE>
<TE>   Not since 1995 have the Dodgers and Angels rumbled down such
parallel playoff tracks. That was the year the Dodgers won the NL
West and the Angels lost a one-game playoff to Seattle to determine
the AL West champion.</TE>
<TE>   But there was little hype for a potential Freeway World Series
that year because the focus in the final two months of the season was
on the Angels' horrendous collapse, when they blew an 11-game
division lead in August and September.</TE>
<TE>   Only two other times since the Angels were born in 1961 have the
Angels and Dodgers stirred hopes of a possible Freeway World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won the NL West with a 95-67 record in 1985, and the
Angels went 90-72 but finished a game behind Kansas City in the AL
West.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won the AL West in 1982, but the Dodgers finished a
game behind Atlanta in the NL West when Joe Morgan hit a game-winning
homer off Terry Forster to help the San Francisco Giants defeat the
Dodgers on the final day of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "The magic of the summer is the fact that this thing is a
marathon," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "The magic of a pennant
race is seeing it to fruition. We're seeing the early birth of a
pennant race. To miss out on it because of a work stoppage would be
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Mead, Angel vice president of communications, is one of only a
handful of team officials who were around in 1986, when the Angels
were one strike away from the World Series when Dave Henderson hit
that fateful homer off Donnie Moore in the ninth inning of Game 5 of
the AL championship series.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox won, 7-6, in extra innings, returned to Boston to win
Games 6 and 7, and the Angels still haven't made it to the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "There are folks in the organization who believe there is still
some unfinished business here, for Gene Autry and Jimmie Reese and
some other good people," Mead said, referring to the Angels' late
owner and late coach. "To be so close and not get a chance to
complete that would probably bother me more than anything."</TE>
<TE>   Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio can't stand the thought of a
season like this "going down the drain," and he acknowledged he'd be
"crushed" if players went on strike.</TE>
<TE>   But he, like every big leaguer, has put his faith in union chief
Don Fehr, and if no labor agreement is reached, Spiezio and the rest
of the Angels and Dodgers will walk Friday--even if that means
Southern California's most promising baseball season in years, and a
potential Freeway World Series, go up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to be a baseball player and concentrate on winning
games and getting to the playoffs and World Series and also keep up
with the intrigue of these negotiations," Spiezio said. "It's
gigantic. It's mind-boggling, all the stuff you'd have to read. I
just have to trust the people who have been doing this for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of when I was in high school and I really wanted to
play football, but my dad said I couldn't play. He could see I had a
future in baseball and didn't want me to risk injury. Sometimes you
just have to trust the advice of people you trust."</TE>

<LD>   Talk about your double standards.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Open clothing police have decided that women are
appropriately clothed for tennis if they are wearing a v-neck,
short-legged, one-piece, tight-fitting body suit. Men who come to
play wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt are summarily told to
change that shirt, pronto.</LD>
<TE>   The absurdity of this became clear when tournament referee Brian
Earley gave a serious interview about how he judged that a sleeveless
shirt Tommy Haas tried to wear was not compatible with a rule that
says clothing must be "customary."</TE>
<TE>   While the ATP Tour has been trying desperately to market some
excitement into its lifeless young personalities, the tournament
referees at the most raucous and unconventional tournament in the
world tell a man he must have sleeves.</TE>
<TE>   The ATP ran its "New Balls Please" campaign that was supposed to
make the new generation of Lleyton Hewitts and Marat Safins and Andy
Roddicks and Tommy Haases pleasing and popular, even if only one of
them has become a consistent winner.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately the winner, Hewitt, has also become a petulant
whiner as well and none of the others has separated himself from the
nameless masses.</TE>
<TE>   So Haas tried something new, something radical, something so out
there that a gaggle of men wearing suits and ties had to put their
gray heads together and confab Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Yes or no. Thumbs up or thumbs down.</TE>
<TE>   Sleeves or no sleeves.</TE>
<TE>   The rebellious Haas, third-seeded at the U.S. Open and pictured
from the waist up on Page 3 of the New York Post wearing nothing and
standing behind his girlfriend, who was also wearing nothing but
Haas' arms around her chest and a silver ornament in her belly
button, had arrived for his first-round match wearing white shorts
and a white, sleeveless shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Earley was asked by the chair umpire to make a momentous ruling.
"Every player shall dress and present himself for play in a
professional manner. Clean and customarily acceptable tennis attire
shall be worn as determined by each respective Grand Slam." That's
straight from the 2002 Official Grand Slam Rule Book.</TE>
<TE>   We know for sure Haas isn't an American because the young German
did not immediately call his lawyer. He obediently changed his shirt
to a nice, green thing with sleeves.</TE>
<TE>   As a little background, defending Open champion Serena Williams
had debuted on Monday night a one-piece "cat suit," as Williams
described her clothing. The black piece of material gave the illusion
of having been painted on. It emphasized Williams' muscular, athletic
body. Or, as Pete Sampras said, "You see all the curves."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' outfit has sparked a debate, as has the outfit of Anna
Kournikova, who wears a very short skirt and an elastic,
midriff-baring top. The women say they are proud to show off their
well-toned bodies. The fans mostly vote thumbs-up. The clothing
companies are thrilled at the hubbub. The photographers can't shoot
enough film. There is the tennis purist here and there who wonder if
it isn't a little inappropriate to show so much skin, but mostly the
cat suit has met with "You go girl" enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   And, as Williams said, "Nobody is going to tell me what to wear."
Or not to wear.</TE>
<TE>   She's lucky. She's a woman. No one dares say no.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Haas. He's a man. He was told no.</TE>
<TE>   The double standard could be taken negatively in two ways.</TE>
<TE>   Why should Haas, who said he had asked his clothing company to
design for him a sleeveless top because he finds sleeves restricting
to his swing, be sent to his room to change, as if he were a naughty
schoolboy wearing a torn T-shirt to first grade, when women can wear
less and less, can show off many different body parts and be
applauded?</TE>
<TE>   Earley, in explaining how his negative ruling on Haas' shirt was a
"gut reaction," also said that "over the years, women have pushed the
envelope. Women's attire has gone all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   This seems almost condescending. It's OK for the little women to
wear the sexy clothes. Bring on the photographers and the oglers and
the buzz and chatter. If the stands are filled with boys who want to
see Kournikova's body, that's fine.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said that Serena had sent in her outfit for pre-approval.
This brings to mind an image of a bunch of men in the back room of
Victoria's Secret, holding up the black cat suit and trying to
picture how Serena would look and then voting a resounding "Yes!"</TE>
<TE>   Haas seemed baffled by the whole situation. What happened to him,
Haas said, "I don't think that's right in my eyes. That's
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick McEnroe, U.S. Davis Cup captain and tennis commentator,
rolled his eyes and said, "Tennis has got to get with the program.
Basketball players wear [sleeveless shirts]. Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   And, as Haas pointed out, "usually, when the sun shines, I don't
wear a shirt at all."</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it. That all-white-shorts-and-collared-shirt,
tasteful-clothing train has left the station. It left when Andre
Agassi showed up in denim shorts and day-glo shirts. It picked up
speed when that crazy Michael Chang came to town with a collarless
shirt. It was careening down the track when Mr. Bland, Pete Sampras,
wore the baggy, baggy shorts and untucked shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Sleeveless? Harmless.</TE>
<TE>   The men's tour needs a shot in the arm. Let them show some skin if
they want. What's good for the women should be good for the men.</TE>

<HD>WNBA Gets Its Dream Finals</HD>
<DH>Basketball: It's L.A. against New York at Madison Square
Garden as Sparks go for their second title in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York. Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   No matter the subject--sports, politics, fashion or music--when
the talk involves these locales, it's not just a matter of comparing
apples to oranges.</LD>
<LD>   Both are the symbols of their geographical coasts, East and West.
Both represent outlandish levels of prosperity, population overload
and urban angst.</LD>
<TE>   Today's topic is the WNBA Finals, a best-of-three series that
begins tonight in Madison Square Garden, whose patrons haughtily
bestow the title "The Mecca of Basketball."</TE>
<TE>   But the Knicks haven't won an NBA championship since 1973. And the
Liberty, making its fourth trip to the WNBA Finals in six years, has
never worn the league crown.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Sparks who are the defending champions, and trying to
become the only team besides Houston to win more than one title. The
Comets won the first four league championships until the Sparks won
last year.</TE>
<TE>   This series would seem to have all the ingredients to raise the
WNBA's profile to new heights. New York and Los Angeles represent the
two biggest sports markets in the country. The teams play contrasting
styles--the Sparks love to run, the Liberty keeps the game in the
half court. They were two of the original eight teams when the WNBA
formed in 1997. And they were expected to meet in a championship
series long before this.</TE>
<TE>   "In many sports leagues, New York vs. Los Angeles is a dream
matchup," WNBA Commissioner Val Ackerman said. "For us, it's maybe
the true East-West matchup. Had it been a Washington-Utah final, we
at the league office would treat it the same. But because of markets
and interest that L.A. and New York typically generate, from coaches
to players, there are a lot of story lines. And I like every one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Even the respective coaches expect there will be more attention to
this series than others.</TE>
<TE>   "The New York vs. L.A. thing is great for the league," Spark Coach
Michael Cooper said. "I think it will be good for the game, good for
the ladies and good for basketball. [The series] heightens the
excitement and generates the excitement of what pro basketball is
about. This could catapult the league to the next level. If you can
continually get the two marquee WNBA teams to meet for the
championship, that's always a plus."</TE>
<TE>   Said Liberty Coach Richie Adubato: "I think everyone was looking
for this series last year, but unfortunately we let Charlotte upset
us. But the traditions of the two NBA teams, the history of
basketball, everybody wants to be part of this series."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks and Liberty split their two regular-season games, the
home team winning each time. But that means nothing now, according to
New York guard Vickie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The playoffs are another season, and the championship is another
season within that season," Johnson said. "L.A. has grown as a team
and New York has grown as a team. We have both jelled."</TE>
<TE>   But what will sell the series, and the league, is compelling
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks enter the finals having won seven consecutive games,
sweeping Western Conference playoff foes Seattle and Utah in the
process. In the four playoff games, the Sparks have averaged 81.3
points, up from their league-best 76.6 average in the regular season.
Lisa Leslie has averaged 21 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.25 blocked
shots in the playoffs and has returned to the dominant form she had
last year when she was the most valuable player of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand Lisa is a great player," said Adubato, when asked
how to defend Leslie. "So we've got to change defenses, the same as
we do with any star."</TE>
<TE>   New York's playoff series against Indiana and Washington both were
extended to three games. Although the Liberty has averaged 74.7
points a game, up six points from its regular-season average, New
York depends more on its in-your-face defense to win the game.</TE>
<TE>   Tamika Whitmore, who averaged 12.7 points during the regular
season, has carried the New York offense at 17.8 points in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I see both of us as two giants, no one stronger than the other,"
said the Sparks' DeLisha Milton. "It will boil down to who wants it
the most. We match up well, a kind of mirror image of each other.
They have a good inside game, we have a good inside game. We have a
good outside game, so do they. They have a good coach, we have a
better one. Now it's who gets the loose balls, controls the rebounds,
and is mentally into the game from start to finish."</TE>
<TE>   Along with overcoming their finals history, the Liberty players
also have to keep out of their minds the notion the front office will
consider breaking up the team should they fail to win the title.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks' Sophia Witherspoon, who began her WNBA career with New
York in 1997, said she sees that happening.</TE>
<TE>   "They know this is the last shot for them, which is why they're
trying so hard to get it," Witherspoon said of the Liberty's title
drive. "But our confidence level is as high as it's ever been. I
think we see [the title] now, we believe it, and there's no stopping
us."</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty players beg to differ.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think of it as 'we're due' or 'we deserve it' because
every season is different," said Sue Wicks, who--like Johnson and
Teresa Weatherspoon--is an original Liberty player. "We have a great
opportunity, and we need to seize that. But it's a three-game series,
both teams have a lot of heart and the best team is going to win."</TE>

<TE>   Season series--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--New York Liberty forward Tamika Whitmore was asked why her
team plays so well in front of its home fans. "Because this is New
York City and this is Madison Square Garden," Whitmore said. "I don't
care how many arenas you go in, there is no other atmosphere like
this one. Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, everyone's been in this
building. At times you walk through and feel there's still a piece of
them in here." The home crowd's effect on the Liberty is as big a
concern to the Sparks as is New York's aggressive defense and strong
rebounding. "We have to really stay focused and make sure we keep the
crowd out of it," Mwadi Mabika said. "I know they would be loud if we
were up by 15, but not as loud as if New York is up by 15. We have to
have a lot of poise." New York is 4-0 in the playoffs at home and 0-2
on the road.</TE>
