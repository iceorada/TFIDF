<LD>It's all beginning to seem familiar. The teach-ins, the candlelight
vigils, the marches, the chants, the confrontations.</LD>
<LD>   The sounds and the scenes float through memory like tendrils of
smoke, evoking images of other places, other times and other threats
to the human family.</LD>
<LD>   What's going on this time is that we're organizing for peace
again, to stop a war before it starts. The world waits in breathless
anticipation to see if our cowboy president turns Iraq into a heap of
ashes.</LD>
<TE>   Old campaigners and young first-timers alike are waving
no-more-war banners in the faces of those in the bomb-first,
talk-later school of thought, who in turn are waving flags in their
faces and demanding that we not forget 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Peace workers gather in increasing numbers, utilizing the
electronics that didn't exist four decades ago, when, after years of
trying, they succeeded in helping to end a war--but not until after
more than a million people had died.</TE>
<TE>   There were just bullhorns in the 1960s, and a lot of yelling. Now
there are fax machines and e-mail and cell phones, humming away in a
cooler climate of protest that is forming, as someone has said,
"under the radar."</TE>
<TE>   Former state Sen. Tom Hayden, in the streets back then, is on the
podium now. "We will create a new peace movement," he promised at a
rally observing the first anniversary of the destruction of New
York's twin towers. He challenged the flag-waving militarism that
followed the attack and warned, "We must not allow the Bush
administration to turn Sept. 11 into a national promotion of war."</TE>
<TE>   It's a danger, all right. Patriotism fires the spirit to seek
righteousness. Tears form. Fists clench. A young man, tense with
anger, said to me that we had to get over there and teach them a
lesson. Them who? He wasn't sure, but he knew that Iraq must be
involved. His passions ignited by the drums and bugles, he was ready
to march, as others have marched before, into the fields of war. Only
after he's there will he discover that, beyond the music and the
oratory, lies a reality filled with pain.</TE>
<TE>   I have mixed feelings. If we can believe Bush, and I'm not sure I
can, Iraq builds for the day it, and others we call terrorists, will
destroy us with a hidden arsenal of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons. "We waited too long to stop Hitler," the hawks warn. "We
can't wait that long this time."</TE>
<TE>   War is high drama in which presidents and generals take center
stage. It allows them to strut and posture and wave swords of words,
knowing that at least a percentage of the audience will cheer. Ego
and vengeance drive the military plot. "Give me enough medals,"
Napoleon Bonaparte said, "and I'll win any war."</TE>
<TE>   I don't trust politicians, and I sure as hell don't trust
generals. But if there is truth in the supposition that Saddam
Hussein plans to equip a secret army for Armageddon, can we afford to
wait? Can we even afford to negotiate with one whose hidden agenda
could plunge us into a new dark age? The only way to appease a tiger,
it is said, is to allow oneself to be devoured. Are we ready for
that?</TE>
<TE>   I'm for peace. I don't care what it takes. And so are a growing
number of those telling Bush to at least wait for an international
coalition. Wait for a United Nations mandate. Wait for the UN weapons
inspectors to do their job. Wait because rage engenders rage and
vengeance creates more vengeance, until it all burns itself out in
the smoking ruins of a postwar world. Wait for a year and avoid a
century of anguish.</TE>
<TE>   A CBS/New York Times Poll indicates that two-thirds of those asked
want the weapons inspectors to go in before any military action is
taken. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll shows sentiment for invading Iraq
down from 57% in September to 53% today.</TE>
<TE>   As the terrible scenes of the twin towers falling grow distant,
we're pausing to consider the consequences of what we might be about
to do. And we're beginning to ask ourselves how many hundreds of
thousands of lives we are willing to lose in a war to avenge the
2,800 who died in New York.</TE>
<TE>   I loathe terrorism and the convoluted logic that says it's OK to
kill children to advance a cause. But I also question the same
twisted rationale that says it's OK to kill the babies of the
terrorists in response. The losses are terrible in both instances. I
keep thinking of those we love who must exist in a world we have
created and how they would fare in any kind of apocalyptic
confrontation. The thought is chilling. Disarm Iraq by force if all
the proof is in and it's the only way to stop a madman. But weigh
carefully the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Rather the rising voices of a growing peace movement than the
screams of the innocents who will suffer if war comes.</TE>

<LD>SWAN</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Frances Mayes</LD>
<TE>   Broadway Books</TE>
<TE>   324 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   From the land of happily-ever-after comes "Swan," the first novel
from Frances Mayes, travel writer and unofficial poet laureate for
all things under the Tuscan sun. Named for a near-perfect Georgia
town--that is not all too dissimilar from those villages Mayes has
described in her memoirs of Italy--"Swan" opens on the steamy days of
summer, the hot "wavy air," "the throbbing of the cicadas" and the
moon angling through the pines.</TE>
<TE>   But something is amiss. An elderly woman discovers an unearthed
body in the cemetery, and in a town where everyone knows everyone, it
doesn't take long for the relatives of the late Catherine Mason to
hear about her violated grave. Mason's children, J.J. and Ginger, are
more confused than frightened. Their mother's death, some 20 years
ago, is still with them; it was marked a suicide by the sheriff after
a brisk once-over investigation. Some people had their doubts, but no
one spoke up. Life in Swan went on, more like an episode from
"Mayberry, R.F.D." than from "CSI."</TE>
<TE>   With their father, Wills, confined to a nursing home and their
late mother something of a mystery woman (no clear motive was
attached to her death), J.J. and Ginger might well be treated as
misfits, but not in Swan. He owns grocery markets and lives like a
hermit in a woodsy cabin. She has spent the last couple of years
dropping out of grad school, getting a divorce and going to Italy on
an archeological dig. Their problems as adults--neither seems able to
make life work--don't include memories of nasty, small-minded
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   For all its charm, Swan does have its share of disturbing,
somewhat gothic secrets. Take the Mason clan. J.J. and Ginger's
grandfather, Big Jim Mason, helped build the town, but he was a man
whose appetites too easily got in his way. Falling in love with the
wife of one of his neighbors and stealing the woman from her husband
certainly didn't help, but then infidelity seems to run in the
family. Big Jim's daughter-in-law, Catherine, had an affair when her
husband was away during the war and, not long after, Ginger was born.
And then there is the truth about Catherine Mason's death. A new
autopsy proves she was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Ginger and J.J, intent upon piecing the family history together,
look for clues and motives for their mother's death. Ginger reads
Catherine's wartime diaries. J.J. tracks down her old roommate, as
well as a lover, and what begins as a simple premise--children
seeking to learn the truth about their family--becomes quickly more
convoluted.</TE>
<TE>   Bit players show up at every turn. Surprise confessions are
elicited at the slightest prompt. Sudden meetings are arranged with
shadowy figures and exposed vendettas drift past like so many dream
sequences. The magnolia-drenched air of Swan seems to work like a
drug that unfortunately may have clouded Mayes' vision of her
material.</TE>
<TE>   Although the residents of Swan have their troubles, it is
impossible to take them too seriously when the best writing in the
book is more evocative of place--of grits and hush puppies, clear
spring water and woodsy scents, ladies' bridge games and garden
weddings--than character. When everything is sorted out, the tension
Mayes had hoped to create evaporates.</TE>
<TE>   Given Mayes' talent for capturing the local atmosphere, you might
finish "Swan" and wonder how her memoir of the Southeast--where she
was born--would read. She lives in San Francisco and Italy, but her
true-life vision of Georgia might just give Tuscany a run for its
money.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "Swan" reads like a string of happy outcomes in a
near-perfect world. But what more should we have expected in a town
where residents end their days in the Magnolia Cemetery and the
visitor who fatefully found Catherine Mason's body in the grass was
only there to pick the flowers?</TE>

<HD>Who Knew Recycling Could Be a Bad Thing?</HD>
<DH>According to one book, all those green clippings are just
sucking up oxygen</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's truly amazing what you can stuff into those green-waste
recycling cans. I managed to put a driveway full of tree prunings
into one last week after I used a step stool to get inside the can to
mash down the leaves and branches. I felt like a magician pulling
endless scarves or bunnies from a hat, only in reverse.</LD>
<LD>   But now I learn that recycling green waste from the garden may be
a bad idea, at least on the municipal level. "What!" you say.</LD>
<LD>   According to author Douglas Kent in "A New Era of Gardening"
(Garden Shed Productions; www. gardeningforoxgen.com), big-time
composting, right along with burning fossil fuels, may be
contributing to the increase of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, and
the decrease in oxygen. The 103-page paperback was one of a number of
new garden books I read during the dog days of late summer and early
fall. It's become a bit of a tradition with me, saving much of my
garden reading for August and September when it is too hot outside to
do much around the yard.</LD>
<TE>   Kent suggests that many common gardening practices hurt the
environment, even if they do make our little piece of it more
enjoyable. This Orange County garden landscaper points out that much
of what we do while building and maintaining a garden adds carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere and contributes to the so-called greenhouse
effect, which causes global warming.</TE>
<TE>   I had a hard time believing that my garden might be contributing
to the poor health of the planet. Why, I compost, I use only organic
products, I have an electric mower and a fairly quiet
battery-operated electric blower. Half of my garden is
drought-resistant, and there's barely any lawn. Trees help cool our
house. Birds bathe in our bath. How could I be harming the
environment?</TE>
<TE>   Kent says that by burning fossil fuels, or that by using products
that require the burning of fossil fuels, we are releasing carbon
dioxide that has been trapped in those fuels for eons. Even the
electricity for my mower must be generated, most often, by burning
gas or coal.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, when we recycle on a big scale--by putting tree
prunings into green cans--we are not burying any carbon dioxide, so
more and more of the gas accumulates. Trees capture carbon dioxide
and in order to compensate for all that we are releasing, he says, we
need to bury some, in landfills.</TE>
<TE>   That's an oversimplification, but you can read the book and take
his energy audit in Chapter 4 yourself. You'll soon see if you are
helping or hurting the environment with your gardening practices. I
actually ended up faring fairly well.</TE>
<TE>   Of the dozens of new gardening books, none was quite as
controversial as Kent's, but here are a few I found intriguing or
useful:</TE>
<TE>   The whopping 705-page "California Master Gardener Handbook"
(University of California; anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu) takes everything
that the experts at the University of California Cooperative
Extension know about gardening and crushes it between two covers.
Edited by Dennis R. Pittenger, this 4-pound paperback is used as a
text in the Master Gardener training program, so it is not casual
reading. But it works as a voluminous reference for the home
gardener, covering most garden topics from soils to poisonous plants.</TE>
<TE>   There's information on soil preparation, weeds, watering,
fertilizer, pests (of garden and home), even on garden design. There
are pruning guidelines for confers, mowing times for ground covers
and lists of plants that are resistant to oak root fungus.</TE>
<TE>   There's a chart that tells the light requirement of indoor plants,
and their most common problems. But it's particularly helpful on the
subject of edible plants.</TE>
<TE>   There's a big vegetable planting guide, the latest information on
fruit trees, chapters on citrus and avocados, even a whole chapter on
grapes and another on berries. There's a ton of information here.
Other garden books should feel threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "The Botanical Garden," by Roger Phillips &amp; Martyn Rix (Firefly
Books), is a two-volume tome that is handsomely photographed and
quite fun to look through because it lists the 1,000 or so genera in
evolutionary order, picturing each with several examples. Volume 1
lists trees and shrubs; Volume 2 lists perennials and annuals. The
excellent photos of leaves and flowers make this a very useful
reference, but it goes one step further. Using the latest DNA
studies, the authors have listed the plants from earliest to most
recent, starting with the primitive tree fern, ginkgo and araucaria,
and ending with hyacinth, hosta and orchids, which are on the top
rung of the evolutionary ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Cycads are on one of the very bottom rungs--the reptiles of the
plant world, as some have suggested. These extremely primitive plants
have long fascinated gardeners in Southern California, and "The
Cycads," by Loren M. Whitelock (Timber Press), provides a detailed
look at these plants in the wild and in the garden, by a pioneering
Southland collector. The book describes nearly 300 species from 11
genera.</TE>
<TE>   Clivia are another popular plant here, and "Clivias," by Harold
Koopowitz (Timber Press), a professor at UC Irvine, is a book for the
clivia-obsessed, of which there are quite a few. For those who only
know that they come in orange and yellow, this may be a little more
than you bargained for.</TE>
<TE>   For those fascinated with angel's trumpets and deadly daturas,
"Brugmansia and Datura," by Ulrike and Han-Georg Preissel (Firefly
Books), takes a detailed, informative look at these two groups of
plants and provides lots of pictures.</TE>
<TE>   On the evolutionary ladder of garden design, Robert Burle Marx
must be near the very top. This talented Brazilian landscape
architect, trained as a painter, designed some of the most stunning
modernistic gardens including those in the capital city of Brasilia.
He loved tropical plants and not only used them masterfully in his
gardens, but also avidly hunted and collected them in the wild before
his death in 1994. A new book, "Robert Burle Marx, The Lyrical
Landscape," by Marta Iris Montero (University of California Press,
Berkeley), shows and explains 26 of his most famous designs. There
are useful plans of each.</TE>
<TE>   Though they are not as bold, the gardens in "Estate Gardens of
California," with photography by Melba Levick and text by Karen
Dardick (Rizzoli), are certainly grand. Most have become public
gardens--such as Filoli, Descanso Gardens, Lotusland and the
Huntington Botanical Gardens--but a few are still private, so it's
fun to get a peek inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Mountains in the Sea," by Phan Van Lit with Lew Buller (Timber
Press), goes in the other direction, examining gardens on a
completely different scale--the Vietnamese miniature landscape of Hon
Non Bo. Using plants and rocks in shallow trays filled with water,
these tiny landscapes can sit on a patio table. The authors tell you
how to make and care for these tiny romantic isles that require no
traveling to see.</TE>

<LD>The Gabrielino Tongva</LD>
<LD>   Do you know who lived in the Los Angeles area before the Europeans
came? The Gabrielino Tongva. The tribe lived in the land between
Malibu and Laguna Beach and from the San Bernardino Mountains to the
Pacific Ocean. One of the Gabrielino Tongva villages was at the
Ballona Wetlands. Today many Tongva families, descendants of those
people, still live in the area.</LD>
<LD>   The Ballona Wetlands were a paradise during the time of the
Gabrielino Tongva people. Fish were abundant, and birds filled the
sky. The people's main source of food was acorns. They also ate many
types of seeds and fruits. Fish were caught from the streams, lagoons
and marshes, and shellfish were collected from the mud. The people
made beautiful baskets often decorated with shells, beads and
feathers. Some of the baskets were so tightly woven they were
waterproof.</LD>
<TE>   Their dome-shaped homes, or kis, were constructed with willow
branches and covered with tall wetland plants such as reeds, or
tules, that sheltered the people from wind and rain. As many as 50
people could live in some of the largest homes.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrate and learn more about the Gabrielino Tongva people and
their culture at "Before Columbus Day," an annual event taking place
this Saturday at University High School, 1439 S. Barrington Ave.,
West Los Angeles. This free festival will have hands-on activities as
well as Native American dancing and music. For more information,
visit www.onionskin.com/gabrieli no or call (310) 397-0180.</TE>
<TE>   To see the site of the Gabrielino Tongva Sa-angna village, a
reproduction of a ki and more, ask your parents or teacher to call
the Ballona Wetlands Foundation and schedule a visit to the wetlands
in Playa del Rey. They can also arrange a visit to your school by the
WOW (Wonders of Wetlands) Team. For more details, call (310)
574-0700.</TE>

<HD>Will Martha's Furniture Sit Well With Consumers?</HD>
<DH>Stewart's stock sale scandal may put nicks and dings in her
Signature brand</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JURA KONCIUS</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be such a Good Thing.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Stewart, domestic powerhouse, hooked up with Bernhardt
Furniture, a respected, family-owned manufacturer, to create a line
of mid- to upper-end furniture to be introduced at next week's
International Home Furnishings Market in High Point, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Then this summer, Stewart, the celebrity CEO, became tangled in a
high-profile insider-trading scandal. As investigations into
Stewart's sale of ImClone stock deepened, the furniture world swirled
with speculation on how this might affect her latest venture. Stewart
has denied any wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a public relations nightmare," says Warren Shoulberg, editor
of HFN, the newsweekly of the home furnishings industry. "It's the
talk of the market."</TE>
<TE>   The 200-piece Martha Stewart Signature Furniture collection is the
latest in a series of coordinated home products--including fabric,
carpeting and paint--that are part of Stewart's evolving Signature
brand. This is not to be confused with her lower-priced Kmart
collection or her high-end catalog and online store Martha Stewart:
The Catalog for Living (formerly Martha by Mail. It was relaunched
under a new name this week).</TE>
<TE>   Plans were already afoot to trot out the slipcovered sofas and
painted furniture next week at a launch party at a bucolic North
Carolina horse farm. But after the scandal broke, the media event was
scaled down to "afternoon tea" with no guarantee the domestic diva
herself would appear. "It is not confirmed that Martha will be in
attendance at this point," says a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation to the Bernhardt High Point press opening next
Wednesday--a series of cards in Stewart's signature colors of tea
green, sage and chocolate brown--mentions two collections: Lily Pond,
"painted woods, easy slipcovers and light colors" based on the look
of Stewart's cottage in the Hamptons. And Skylands, "softly polished
woods, rich fabrics and nature-inspired details" reflective of her
stone retreat in Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart did journey to High Point in August to sneak-preview her
collection with 100 top Bernhardt retailers. Initial reports were
very positive, says a spokeswoman for Bernhardt, and orders have
already been placed.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the collection could depend on the latest
developments in the trading scandal. "Until now, the customer has
been able to separate Martha the individual from Martha the product,"
says Shoulberg.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Bernhardt, chief executive of Bernhardt Furniture, agrees.
"We're convinced that consumers clearly differentiate between the
personal issues in Martha Stewart's life and the products created by
her company," he said in a statement. "Consumers are interested in
decorating their homes in the style inspired by Martha Stewart, and
that hasn't changed because of the current situation."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retailing
Consulting Group, the outlook is not so bad. "I don't think the
situation is going to have a detrimental effect unless she should be
charged and convicted of something. People will judge the furniture
on its own merits."</TE>
<TE>   The new Stewart collection will not hit stores until next spring.
"Whatever happens, Martha Stewart's brand name is very solid,"
Barnard says. "The furniture will have to stand on its own two legs."</TE>

<HD>A Hunk With a Christmas Presence</HD>
<DH>A sizzling Santa is chosen from among a group of potential
ho-ho-ho'ers to bring holiday cheer to adults at the Beverly Center</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Edwards couldn't find his $175 Armani sunglasses. He searched
under chairs, on tabletops, inside a caterer's warming tray. He even
stuck his head underneath a raised stage where minutes earlier the
33-year-old former Chippendale dancer stood victorious,
Christmas-wrapped in a red banner as Hunky Santa 2002.</LD>
<LD>   But as St. Nick's studly alter-ego--6 feet tall, 175 pounds,
cropped brown hair, chin stubble and beefy biceps--Edwards faced his
first image crisis as Santa. He was shamefully shadeless.</LD>
<LD>   After all, this was L.A.--not the humbling North Pole--where the
Beverly Center's sun-kissed rooftop terrace, the Hollywood sign in
the distance, made for a fitting backdrop for the mall's recent third
annual Hunky Santa pageant of pecs and personality. The winner begins
his yuletide rule the day after Thanksgiving and only works
nights--all the better to indulge the Santa fantasies of giddy
grown-ups.</LD>
<TE>   "We mostly get young, single people and a large population of gays
shopping here. We practically have no kids," said Barbara Bach, the
center's marketing director who came up with the Hunky Santa idea.</TE>
<TE>   We're not talking your grandfatherly St. Nick. Think St.
Narcissus. The 11 chiseled contestants did, many of whom couldn't
resist falling in love with themselves as they passed by glass doors
and saw their tattooed, tanned and toned reflections--and often
teased the audience with, well, their assets.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the crowd of 100 acted at times as if they were there to
see "The Full Monty." Instead, they settled for flex and the city as
the hunky hopefuls--most of them actors and models--chased the chance
to reach the rank of almost famous, even as an alternative Mr. Claus.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing Hunky Santa, Richard Peters, 31, landed a theatrical
agent--after years of unsuccessfully trying to get one on his
own--and is busy with soap opera acting and modeling for fitness
magazines.</TE>
<TE>   "I had fun with the whole experience," Peters said about playing
the part last year for kids as well as adults, most of them single
women and a fair share of gay--and bold--men. "One guy came up to me
wearing a boa and sat on my lap. Hunky Santa has to be an open-minded
guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And prepared for anything, which explained why contestants this
year, unlike in the past, were put on the spot with zany stunts to
perform.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Rick hopelessly Hula-Hooped, unable to rotate his hips with
enough momentum to keep the toy up.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Grutter attempted to spell "draggle." "D." Pause. "R."
Pause. "A." Pause forever. Look at your feet. Stare at the judges.
Make puppy eyes at host and comedy writer Bruce Vilanch, who took
pity and announced: "That's good enough!"</TE>
<TE>   LaGrande Powe, whom Vilanch quickly nicknamed "The Big One,"
handily completed 25 push-ups, halfway through raising a leg behind
him. He later placed third runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   And a blindfolded David Rountree, who nailed first runner-up, beat
the clock as he jumped into a Santa suit. He struggled with
drawstring pants, which kept dropping to his ankles. But ever the
quick thinker--hey, he teaches at Los Angeles Trade Tech
College--Rountree cleverly executed a handstand to loud applause.</TE>
<TE>   The men also answered questions--sometimes bordering on the
risque--from a panel of five judges. Naturally, none of the responses
was about wishing for world peace. And a few were right up there in
the Anna Nicole Smith where-did-I-leave-my-brain-today department.</TE>
<TE>   For Joe Galvan, a shoe salesman: "How would being Hunky Santa
change your life?" Answer: "I'd get to wear tank tops all the time."</TE>
<TE>   For Rountree, came the query "Boxers or briefs?" Answer: "It
depends on what time of the year. But, sometimes I just go commando."</TE>
<TE>   For Shea Pesz, "What do naughty people get for Christmas?" Answer:
"Well, Hunky Santa is very forgiving, so I'd give naughty people
forgiveness."</TE>
<TE>   For Cyrus Siminpour, who claimed second runner-up: "What makes you
the best candidate for Hunky Santa?" Answer: "I have a jolly
attitude. I'm open-minded," and then quickly lifting his shirt, he
shouted with glee (what else?), "I have a great six-pack!"</TE>
<TE>   The crowd played into his hands. Um, make that, abs. "You're a
hottie!" shouted a young woman who was too embarrassed to reveal her
name but confessed, "I believe in Santa again! Oh, yeah, baby!"</TE>
<TE>   Got a Date Out of It</TE>
<TE>   Pam Potts, 23, who just moved to L.A. from Missoula, Mont., even
made a date connection with contestant No. 4, brown-haired, blue-eyed
Jason Miller, 24, who swiveled his pelvis like Elvis when asked, "How
would you convince a shy person to sit on your lap?"</TE>
<TE>   "Now that guy has talent," Potts cracked, who gave her phone
number to Miller. "I thought he was hilarious, great-looking and the
best candidate for the job. You can't go wrong if you're hooked up
with a Hunky Santa finalist."</TE>
<TE>   This year's search attracted more than 100 men in July at an
initial call for contestants via fliers at gyms and from casting
agents. Though the paid job is a part-time gig, there are other
benefits: news spots beamed around the world during the holidays,
maybe being spotted by a casting agent strolling through the mall
looking to launch a new face and the potential for snaring plenty of
dates.</TE>
<TE>   Even at his farewell party after the finals, women circled around
Peters chatting him up and checking him out. A stranger slipped her
phone number into his hand and disappeared into the crowd. "What can
I say?" shrugged Peters as he read the business card, smirked and
socked it away in his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted at a Party</TE>
<TE>   Katie Taylor, who owns a casting company, takes credit for finding
the new Hunky Santa. She spotted Edwards, who lives in Marina del Rey
with his dog, Friday at a private party where he was bartending--one
of his many part-time jobs. "Look at him," she said as Edwards, who
works out 2 1/2 hours every morning, posed with women for photos and
signed autographs after his victory. "He's got that pool-boy look
that women love. Of course, kids will just think he's a superhero,"
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Mindy Burbano, entertainment reporter at KTLA Channel 5 and a
judge for the event, couldn't have agreed more. "He had confidence.
He wasn't trying too hard," she said about Edwards' winning style.
"And he has beautiful eyes, great abs and chest. That smile. That
great behind." Down, girl.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards shrugged at the thought of being a sex symbol, especially
during the holidays. "I'm just a regular guy from Ankeny, Iowa, a
small town outside of Des Moines," he said. Yeah, right, a regular
guy, who a year ago was a dancer for the girl band Pop Starr, and
before that was a touring Chippendale in a construction worker
get-up.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, in a red tank top, flannel drawstring pants and trendy
Italian boots, he'll sit in an overstuffed purple chair, mug for the
camera, shake hands, listen and talk about holiday wishes--and
instead of candy, he'll hand out bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   "For four years I had to pose for photos and meet and greet
people," said Edwards of his Chippendale experience. "And I also know
how to hold a smile for an hour-and-a-half."</TE>
<TE>   At the top of his very own Santa wish list? Digging inside a
nearby trash bin, he replied, "Sunglasses."</TE>

<DH>Sue Thomas, who is deaf, inspires a TV show and those who
hear her speak</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Working for the FBI, Sue Thomas was something of an anomaly. She
could stand across an airport lobby while an illicit deal was going
down and take verbatim note of what suspects were saying. Or, perched
on a roof with a pair of field glasses, she could peer into a
building across the way and read the lips of anyone she watched.</LD>
<LD>   Although her first FBI job involved analyzing fingerprints in
Washington, D.C., she was quickly moved to more challenging
assignments when agents there, amazed at her exceptional ability to
read lips, enlisted her for undercover surveillance in white-collar
crime that would include drug and embezzlement cases.</LD>
<LD>   Her unusual skill wasn't something she'd planned. Thomas, who
loves to play classical piano, has been deaf since she was a toddler.
On Sunday "Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye," a television series based on her
life, premieres at 9 p.m. on the PAX TV network. The fast-paced,
one-hour premiere segment opens with Thomas (played by severely deaf
actress Deanne Bray) at work at the FBI.</LD>
<TE>   "We are brought into this life for a purpose," said Thomas, 52, a
deeply spiritual woman who left the FBI after several years and now
travels the country as a motivational speaker, sharing her
experiences and offering a message of hope and perseverance.</TE>
<TE>   Hope has been her message since she came to terms with her
deafness after years of hating it, said Thomas, sitting on a bench at
Richard J. Riordan Central Library with her hearing dog, Amazing
Grace, at her side.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing her story become a television series is the culmination of
years of effort, she said. Indeed, 12 years ago, after her
autobiography, "Silent Night," was published, Columbia Pictures
bought the movie rights but let the option expire, she said. After
that, a Dutch film company bought the rights but couldn't find the
funding to bring it to the screen.</TE>
<TE>   But brothers Dave and Gary Johnson, who wrote a screenplay based
on the book, held onto the script.</TE>
<TE>   When the network contacted them about doing a series, they had the
idea ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas worked for the FBI from 1979 until early 1983, when she
left to attend a seminary in South Carolina because she wanted to
have a "better understanding of my Creator and how he made me."</TE>
<TE>   At the Columbia Graduate School of Bible and Missions, she found
her life's calling. For nearly two decades now, she has earned her
living speaking to hundreds of church, civic, educational and
professional groups in 46 states, bringing them her uplifting
message. In a busy year, she and Amazing Grace are on the road 200
days.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a mouth, will travel," said Thomas, who lives with her
89-year-old mother in Youngstown, Ohio, where her extended family is.</TE>
<TE>   She lost her hearing suddenly and mysteriously when she was 18
months old. "One day I was sitting around watching cartoons with my
family," she said. "The next day I began visiting an endless series
of medical specialists who brought forth the same proclamation of
despair: I would never hear. I would never speak. I would never
matter."</TE>
<TE>   But her parents were determined to help their daughter function in
a hearing world. Thomas learned to speak by feeling the vibrations of
her speech therapist's throat and watching her lips form to make the
words. She had many hours of voice, speech and drama training.</TE>
<TE>   She also mastered figure-skating, becoming the youngest Ohio state
champion freestyle skater in 1957 when she was 7. She learned to
skate to music by keeping her eye on her coach who, like a conductor,
marked the beat.</TE>
<TE>   Her days in public school were miserable, she said, as she was
subjected to relentless teasing by schoolmates. After a long painful
day at school, she cried her way home on the school bus. To hide her
tears, she remembered, she sat so close to the window that her nose
would be squished against the glass. She sang "Silent Night"--the
hymn her mother had taught her as she rocked her on her lap when she
was a child, to ease her sorrow. Inspired by the comfort the song
gave her, she borrowed it for the title of her autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   As a young adult, Thomas said, she went through a long period of
being angry with God and used alcohol and marijuana to ease her pain.
Ultimately she realized that she had "to let God be God and let him
put me back together the way he wanted me to be and for him to give
us the grace to endure."</TE>
<TE>   After overcoming one disability, Thomas is learning to live with
another physical challenge. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis. She is losing some vision, has trouble walking
and has numbness in her right hand so severe it is nearly impossible
for her to play the piano. Yet, even as she copes with the disease in
which the body's immune system attacks the insulation of nerve
fibers, Thomas believes God will prepare her to handle it, even if
she goes totally blind.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes the TV series will help the American public gain a
deeper understanding and respect for the people "who walk the path of
silence," and give hope to families who are struggling with a

and called a dummy. It's their story as well."</TE>

<HD>The Game Is to Save Athletes' Skin</HD>
<DH>Products' aim is expanded from fixing people's hides to
protecting them</DH>

<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeffrey Neal flipped open a thick red binder full of photographs of
satisfied customers. This was no ordinary stack of testimonial
letters. On page after page were before-and-after shots of bloodied
legs, scraped shins and battered calves of  athletes who had tried
Brave Soldier products to heal wounds sustained as they battled
nature, or perhaps asphalt, and lost.</LD>
<LD>   Neal is an avid cyclist who knows from experience about road rash,
the catchall term for skin injuries resulting from bike crashes and
falls. His photos documented the healing time and reduced scarring on
athletes who used Brave Soldier Antiseptic Healing Ointment, a $12
product that he and biking buddy Dr. Ezra Kest developed years ago.
The Beverly Hills dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon had created the
ointment for post-laser surgery patients. Soon they added other
products such as lightweight "crash packs" for hikers and bikers and
a $6 First Defense wound-cleaning spray treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The partners tested their ointments on athletes who crossed finish
lines at triathlons, marathons and bike races, with injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "We've fixed up thousands of people at these events over the past
few years," Neal said. "We wanted to know how they worked on a range
of people." The company soon added three other sports experts as
partners and spent nearly five years developing the concept of skin
care products for active men--and women.</TE>
<TE>   Now relaunched and relabeled, Brave Soldier includes 10 products
the company claims help protect the skin, not just repair it.</TE>
<TE>   With botanical and pharmaceutical ingredients, the line includes
basics such as moisturizing cream and shaving cream, sunscreens for
protection and first-aid products for healing.</TE>
<TE>   One of the products, the Lip Defender, offers 15 SPF protection
and ingredients that are supposed to decrease fine lip lines.</TE>
<TE>   The line of products costs between $6 and $18.</TE>
<TE>   "The product evolved out of need," said Robin Coe-Hutshing, owner
of Fred Segal Essentials, where the new line was launched. In
October, the line will be available at Sephora stores, as well as on
the www.bravesoldier.com Web site. The name, said Kest, derived from
what some moms used to tell children as they salved their wounds: "Be
a brave little soldier...."</TE>
<TE>   Just don't call your injuries "boo-boos."</TE>

<LD>My dad said I should have a positive attitude. He said that when he
was in the Army it was hard to get to know the other guys, but then
he made friends that are still his friends. But I'm not in the Army.
I'm just a kid and I wish I had some forever friends. I mean other
than Margaret and Kathleen and Charlie. I wish I could go to dog
school, like Charlie. At least dogs play together.</LD>
<LD>   Tomorrow is Friday. Friday will be a good day. I just have to get
through Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Friday is my favorite day of the week except for Saturday and
Sunday, because on Friday, you have something to look forward to. My
mom said we're going to go to the bookstore and pick out a new Nancy
Drew book to celebrate my first week at the new school. I think I
need the whole collection!</LD>
<TE>   But something happened today at lunch. They took away the table
where I usually sit. So I had to sit with the other kids. There
wasn't a choice ... there weren't any other places to sit.</TE>
<TE>   I kinda sat down at the end, and I was eating my fruit cocktail
the way I always do, peaches first, then pears then grapes and
finally the cherry. This girl Kathy was doing the same thing. She
said something about fruit cocktail, and I started to laugh. And then
everybody at the table was laughing. But the good part was they were
laughing with me not at me. When we went out to play at recess, Kathy
asked me to play jacks with her. And I did.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow will be even better.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Is Elaine finally making friends?</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped loves to write stories and knows that it's really,
really hard to be the new kid. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<TE>   Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights," "Magnolia") scales
down--smaller cast, shorter running time--for his latest film, the
unusual romantic comedy "Punch-Drunk Love." The inventive director
does return to his native San Fernando Valley for this tale starring
Adam Sandler as a small-business owner with big-time anger issues
derived from growing up with seven abusive sisters. Emily Watson
plays the sweet woman who inexplicably falls for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Punch-Drunk Love," rated R for strong language, including a scene
of sexual dialogue, opens Friday at Pacific's the Grove, 189 the
Grove Drive, L.A., (323) 692-0829; and Mann's Criterion 6, 1313 Third
Street Promenade, Santa Monica, (310) 248-MANN, No. 091.</TE>

<TE>   International and multi-genre performance has been the hallmark of
the annual Eclectic Orange Festival. This year's festival, the
fourth, extends the focus to inter-species interaction, thanks to its
cornerstone event, Theatre Zingaro. The French equestrian troupe
unites the talents of horses, riders and dancers; its 20 performances
of a 90-minute piece called "Triptyk," set to music from Igor
Stravinsky and Pierre Boulez, will take place in a specially built
village, with a 1,500-seat tent, set up near the Orange County
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. The festival's 35 other
performances between now and Nov. 9 include the West Coast premiere
of Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov's "La Pasion Segun San Marcos,"
part of the festival's "Latinworks" subset; world music from Iran,
India and Tuva; jazz from the Wayne Shorter Quartet and Opera
Pacific's production of "La Boheme." Friday's festival launch
features chamber chorus Cappella Romana performing Ivan Moody's
"Passion and Resurrection" at St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church in
Irvine and Ireland's Sean Curran Dance Company at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre. Zingaro opens Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Electric Orange Festival. Performances at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa; Irvine
Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine; Carpenter Performing Arts
Center, 6200 Atherton St., Long Beach; St. Paul's Greek Orthodox
Church, 4949 Alton Parkway, Irvine; and Neighborhood Congregational
Church, 340 St. Ann's Drive, Laguna Beach. Ends Nov. 9. $15 to $125.

<TE>   The wave continues to crest for Hawaiian surfer-turned-
singer-songwriter Jack Johnson. Having moved off the beach and into
concert clubs and festivals since his album "Brushfire Fairytales"
became a left-field hit earlier this year, Johnson moves up to
headliner status at the Greek Theatre with his appearance on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Johnson, Greek Theatre, 2700 N. Vermont Canyon Road, Los
Angeles. 7:30 p.m. $26 to $30. (323) 665-1927.</TE>

<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   Sweeping through three Southland venues in one weekend, Le Ballet
National du Senegal displays its mastery of West African traditions
and traditional instruments in "Kuuyamba," a depiction of initiation
rites in a sacred forest. Through these rites, the initiates progress
from adolescence to adulthood. Sacred songs and dancing invoke the
spirits in the opening "Sama" sequence. But the performance also
includes plenty of secular diversions: "Amiran Miran," a tribute to
African women, for example, and displays by the Peulh Acrobats. The
company was founded in 1960 and has visited North America 22 times
(most recently in 1998)</TE>
<TE>   Le Ballet National du Senegal, Campbell Hall, UC Santa Barbara. 8
p.m. $16 (students) to $30. (805) 893-3535. Also Saturday at Smothers
Theatre, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu.
8 p.m. $35. (310) 506-4522. Also Sunday at Marsee Auditorium, El
Camino College, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. 7 p.m. $16.50

<TE>   From Edmund Kean we learned that "dying is easy. Comedy is hard."
That sentiment is echoed in the new documentary "Comedian," which
follows Jerry Seinfeld as he puts together a new act. On stage, Jerry
tries out new material from his post-TV series career; while
backstage, he bonds with fellow comics Colin Quinn, Chris Rock, Garry
Shandling and Jay Leno.</TE>
<TE>   "Comedian," rated R for language, opens Friday in selected
theaters.</TE>

<LD>Cadiz shares--A story in Wednesday's Business section incorrectly
reported that Debra G. Coy, an analyst for Schwab Washington Research
Group, had maintained a "buy" recommendation on shares of Cadiz Inc.,
which have fallen by more than 97% since June 30. Although Coy stated

<LD>Enrique's Journey--Chapter 4 of the six-part series, published Friday
in Section A, described Teotihuacan in Mexico as an Aztec metropolis.
The Aztecs adopted the site as a ceremonial ground and gave it its
modern name, but it originated and peaked as a metropolis during the
pre-Aztec period.</LD>

<LD>City Subsidy--A Sept. 30 article in some editions of the California
section about downtown Santa Ana redevelopment incorrectly said the
Gypsy Den restaurant received a $400,000 subsidy from the city. In
fact, the city paid $6.8 million to renovate the old Grand Central
building, which is leased to Cal State Fullerton. Redevelopment
Director John Reekstin now says it is impossible to determine how
much of that went for improvements to the portion sublet by the
restaurant. He said the Gypsy Den paid for additional tenant
renovations.</LD>

<LD>The ageless Stones rolled over all of today's young hotshots in this
week's album sales race, but they couldn't generate enough firepower
with their hits collection to unseat another classic rocker: Elvis
Presley.</LD>
<LD>   In its second week in the stores, Presley's "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits"
sold 337,000 copies to bring its total to almost 840,000. The Stones'
two-disc package of old hits, "Forty Licks," sold 310,000 copies to
debut at second place on the chart, according to figures released
Wednesday by Nielsen SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   Rapper Xzibit's "Man Vs. Machine," "American Idol: Greatest
Moments" and the pop-punk band Good Charlotte's "The Young and the
Hopeless" also entered the chart this week, at No. 3, No. 4 and No. 7
respectively. Three other artists also entered the Top 20 with new
albums: LeAnn Rimes (No. 12), Diana Krall (No. 18) and Floetry (No.
19). The other positions in the Top 10 are held by the Dixie Chicks,
Avril Lavigne, Nelly, Eminem and Disturbed.</LD>
<TE>   On the singles chart, Kelly Clarkson's ballad "Before Your Love"
remains No. 1.</TE>

Stravinsky and Pierre Boulez, will take place in a specially built
village, with a 1,500-seat tent, set up near the Orange County
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. The festival's 35 other
performances between now and Nov. 9 include the West Coast premiere
of Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov's "La Pasion Segun San Marcos,"
part of the festival's "Latinworks" subset; world music from Iran,
India and Tuva; jazz from the Wayne Shorter Quartet and Opera
Pacific's production of "La Boheme." Friday's festival launch

rites in a sacred forest. Through these rites, the initiates progress

spirits in the opening "Sama" sequence. But the performance also
includes plenty of secular diversions: "Amiran Miran," a tribute to
African women, for example, and displays by the Peulh Acrobats. The

That sentiment is echoed in the new documentary "Comedian," which

tries out new material from his post-TV series career; while
backstage, he bonds with fellow comics Colin Quinn, Chris Rock, Garry
Shandling and Jay Leno.</TE>

<LD>Blaming the stalled economy, the Children's Museum of Los Angeles is
delaying breaking ground on its Hansen Dam branch and rethinking its
timetable for that branch and a proposed 100,000-square-foot facility
planned for Little Tokyo, Ronald Gastelum, president of the museum's
board of trustees, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Gastelum said ground will not be broken in November, as previously
announced, for the Hansen Dam museum in Lake View Terrace that had
been slated to open this year.</LD>
<LD>   Completion of the project is expected to be delayed until 2004 or
2005, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "Art Park is further away," he said of the downtown branch. No
groundbreaking date has been announced for that facility. The
facilities would replace the downtown Children's Museum, which has
been closed since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "In our current economy, things are much more difficult than they
were a few years ago for fund-raising," said Gastelum, who also is
CEO of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   About $112 million is needed to complete both projects, Gastelum
said. The nature-oriented museum at the Hansen Dam Recreation Area
will cost about $40 million. The museum in Little Tokyo, which will
focus on the urban experience and the arts, is expected to cost about
$60 million, he said. The additional $12 million would be used as a
museum endowment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not close to the $112 million," Gastelum said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The 100,000-square-foot downtown museum, known as Art Park, has
been viewed as a major addition to an increasingly lively arts
district in Little Tokyo, in downtown Los Angeles, at the corner of
Temple and Judge John Aiso streets.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Thom Mayne of the Santa Monica architectural firm
Morphosis has completed conceptual drawings for the downtown museum,
with walls that suggest origami, the Japanese art of folded paper.</TE>
<TE>   The downtown site has been controversial. The Los Angeles Police
Department balked at sharing a planned parking structure with the
museum, and the Japanese American community has expressed a desire to
use the site for a recreation center.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of those issues, Gastelum said, "we're not looking at
another site."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's trustees and governors wanted to raise about $20
million before construction started on the Hansen Dam project.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 75% of the way there," Gastelum said. The money on hand is
from the city of Los Angeles, the state of California and gifts, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The boards are "looking at our timing" and reconsidering budgets
for the projects, he said. A new timetable and fund-raising plan
should be in place by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The Hansen Dam branch of the museum was designed by Los Angeles
architect Sarah Graham, with a 24,000-square-foot exhibition space
designed by Edwin Schlossberg's New York firm. The facility would be
the first major museum in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Partially built into a hillside, the museum will have a roof
covered with soil and plantings. It will be cooled by the earth and
wind instead of air conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial lighting will be kept to a minimum, photovoltaic solar
cells will generate electricity and recycled materials will be used
extensively, said Graham, of the Los Angeles firm of
Angelil/Graham/Pfenninger/Scholl.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Hansen Dam project probably will get underway soon,
Mayne said he believes the downtown project eventually will go
forward and that delays are commonplace in the building process.
"When you're an architect, you get used to this," he said.</TE>

<HD>Dance Music With a Lasting Vibe</HD>
<DH>DJ-producer Miguel Migs believes 'vocals that speak to you'
give life to songs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOMMY NGUYEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many supporters of the '90s underground dance scene rallied behind
the idea of dance-floor globalization, the way predominantly
vocals-free and technologically standardized dance tracks were able
to transcend boundaries of language and culture. And, as their logic
would seem to have it, the bigger the sound and the less important
the vocals, the wider it reached. The problem is that globalizers
seldom considered how wonderfully intimate, local and specific dance
music can be. Or that it might hit with anyone other than dancers.</LD>
<LD>   Take, for instance, the sexy, vocals-rich San Francisco-flavored
sounds of Miguel Migs, a DJ-producer who believes that dance songs
don't have to live only for the moment the way many of the scene's
weekend warriors do.</LD>
<LD>   "A thing with dance music is that it doesn't have a lot of lasting
power," says the Santa Cruz native, who played guitar in a dub band
before he turned to turntables professionally in 1995. "But quality
songwriting is timeless, and vocals that speak to you are a big part
of that."</LD>
<TE>   It's electronic dance music with a face, a personality and a nice
figure. That doesn't just characterize Migs' deep-house sound; it's
the whole sensual vibe of Naked Music, the S.F.-based label that
represents him and that has played a big part in the 29-year-old's
rising popularity.</TE>
<TE>   As a vital player in a world-class Bay Area house music scene
defined by its soul-jazz-tribal aesthetic, Naked Music taps into a
more mature, suave groove of the club underground, one that's
bringing dance floors to a higher ground. You can detect Naked
Music's smooth and sexy vibe just by looking at the label's
illustrated cover art, which often features artistic nudes amid
scenes of social and sexual opulence. Although these distinct
retro-derivative drawings are a marketing come-on, they also show the
label's awareness of the lifestyle-dance-style change taking place
among dance music listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "Club-goers who were listening to harder, tweakier dance sounds
eventually grew up and discovered a love for different kinds of
music, like R&amp;B, soul, dub and hip-hop," says Migs, who produced the
label's first 12-inch single, 1998's "Breakin' It Down," a lush sound
bed of soft percussion, electro-embroidery and full-bodied vocals (by
Ledisi) that's still the standard for the label's productions.</TE>
<TE>   "Naked Music is doing music more on that level: soulful, warm,
textured music with a lot of songwriting. So the people who buy Naked
Music albums aren't just people who are into dance stuff."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, on Migs' Oct. 1 Naked Music/Astralwerks release "Colorful
You," his first full-length recording of original material, it's hard
to find more than four or five songs among the 14 that can be dropped
into a proper house set. "I wanted to keep 'Colorful You' diverse, so
I put in some house, some R&amp;B and some soul-influenced down tempo,"
says Migs. "But even the album's house tracks aren't really
big-sounding club hits. It's more of a listening-pleasure album."</TE>
<TE>   But make no mistake, the pleasures found in Migs' DJ live sets are
definitely for the feet. Although they still show a respect for all
things mature and soulful, his DJ sets allow him to break away a bit
from Naked Music, whose very signature voice and rhythm often run the
risk of sounding too singular. "I don't like to get pigeonholed, so
that's why I make records for other labels as well," says Migs, who
has worked with Deep Dish's Yoshitoshi and Britain-based NRK, among
others. "I'm not going to say that Naked Music is closed-minded, but
it definitely has a formula it likes.</TE>
<TE>   "So when I spin, I play for myself, I play for the crowd. I bring
a very diverse crate," he says, with labels like Soulfuric, Drop and
Defected getting a lot of club time in his sets as of late. But, of
course, he'll spin a Naked track or two, because you cannot deny the
crowd what it wants.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking down the mature appeal, he says, "People can simply
relate to Naked Music on a different level that's not about bouncing
around high at a club."</TE>

<HD>Once a Family Restaurant, Now a 'Cue Joint With Some Real
Kick</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who'd ever imagine that a suburban family restaurant could morph into
a terrific barbecue place? That's exactly what has happened at the
Pasadena restaurant formerly known as Robin's.</LD>
<LD>   Only the menu has changed. Robin's Wood Fire BBQ &amp; Grill, as it's
now called, is still an informal joint with signs from almost every
major brewery (and plenty of minor ones) on its walls. It has the red
imitation leather booths of a family restaurant, and the soundtrack
is retro stuff from the late '50s and early '60s.</LD>
<LD>   Before he surfaced in the area two decades ago, owner Robin Salzer
had been the nation's youngest IHOP manager in Milwaukee, but his
passion has always been barbecue. He has sampled barbecue all over
the country and sold tri-tip sandwiches at various street fairs in
the San Gabriel Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, he finally converted Robin's into a barbecue and
saw many of his regulars desert him. But he soldiered on. This guy is
so committed to barbecue, he puts his home number on the back of the
menu.</TE>
<TE>   Robin's baby backs, beef ribs and chicken are smoked five to seven
hours on hickory and oak until they develop the pink layer just under
the surface that characterizes serious barbecue. Add spicy and
regional sauces to the mix, including a mustard yellow, honey-sweet
sauce from South Carolina and Spicy Mad Dog, a red sauce with the
kick of a camel, and the result is a truly respectable 'cue joint,
the only one in this class in the entire San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just the meats you come here for. There are tasty
starters like buttery blueberry cornbread, beer-batter onion rings
and a coleslaw infused with blue cheese and pecans. You can even get
barbecue for an appetizer: rib tips, smoked, that are charred ends of
pork spareribs, equal parts meat, bone and carbon.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a mistake to overlook the side dishes. Salzer has
always served fine hand-cut French fries fried in peanut oil, but
some other side dishes have been radically improved since his
Denny's-wannabe days. The formerly insipid baked beans are now
complex and spicy, though perhaps a touch too sweet. Garlic mashed
potatoes and corn on the cob are done with the verve of a true son of
the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best salads is baby greens and cucumbers layered with
surprisingly tender, uncompromisingly smoky chunks of tri-tip, all in
a tomato vinaigrette. The tri-tip also appears in a sandwich, in
which slabs of meat are packed into a crusty roll.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the salads and sides, meat is the star here, and it's
smokier than an Oregon forest fire, oakier than a cheap Chardonnay.
I'm not much of a beef eater, but I was won over by Robin's huge beef
rib with nicely marbled, slightly charred meat. I had it with a tart
sauce Salzer calls Memphis red.</TE>
<TE>   I'd definitely go with the baby backs over the spareribs; the meat
is sweeter and more succulent, and seems to handle the smoke better
too.</TE>
<TE>   There's flavorful barbecued chicken too, but one thing Robin's
hasn't mastered is how to make chicken smoky without turning the skin
rubbery. Better pull it all off before you tackle the meat.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few other things to nosh on from the old Robin's menu.
You won't go far wrong with the rosemary-garlic rotisserie chicken,
and the burgers aren't bad either.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts have been notably upgraded. Robin's once served a
huge, gummy chocolate cake without much chocolate flavor. The current
version (named "Death by Chocolate") is much better in this regard
and its sides are studded with chocolate chips. There's a "messy
sundae" served in enormous glass bowls. The peach cobbler has a real
biscuit crust.</TE>
<TE>   Salzer has retained one thing that has been the restaurant's
signature since Day One: his Wednesday and Friday night
all-you-can-eat fish fry. It consists of Icelandic cod, those good
fries and his newfangled cole slaw, and it's an excellent deal at
$10.95. But sign me up for the 'cue anyway.</TE>

birthday girl, who is turning 9, shows off her shiny pink
fingernails. On each thumb she sports a tiny multicolored flower with
a rhinestone center. Now all the girls want rhinestones. Ellen, Mia's
mom, gives the OK. She does not want her last name used, however, for
fear of offending the uninvited.</LD>
<LD>   Although apron-decorating, pizza-making and a movie are planned
for later in the evening, there is no question this will be the
highlight of the birthday party. The girls, suddenly little women,
are positively giddy. Mia pulls the lollipop from her mouth, her
tongue and lips stained candy red, to declare, "I feel prettiful." A
moment later she adds, "I made that up."</LD>
<TE>   Only in Los Angeles? Probably not. Some 7-year-old Manhattanite is
likely being fussed over this very second. But Los Angeles is the
nail capital of the universe. "Southern California is the bellwether
location for the nail business," says Cyndy Drummey, editor and
publisher of Nails, a monthly trade magazine based, not surprisingly,
in Los Angeles. "Whether it's a business trend or a style trend,
things start in California and travel across the country." And it's
been that way for some time. After all, Los Angeles is the birthplace
of the nails-only salon.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Jessica Vartoughian opened Jessica Nail Clinic on Canon
Drive in Beverly Hills. (Today it is in Sunset Plaza, among the
chichi boutiques and Euro cafes.) "When I opened the doors," she
says, "it was the first nail salon in the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   Today there are approximately 50,000 in the United States alone,
according to Nails magazine. Three of them are within three blocks of
my Santa Monica apartment. And this is hardly extraordinary. Drive
down any major Los Angeles street and start counting. Soon you'll run
out of French-tipped fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Cute Nail, Princess Nails, Marvelous Nails, Magic Nails, Sassy
Nails, Happy Nails, Nails Nails, USA Nails, Love Nail. The simple but
catchy names are a hallmark of the Vietnamese-owned salons that
industry estimates put at about 80% of local nails-only business.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are responsible for the
explosion of nail salons in Los Angeles over the last 20 years, the
resulting inevitable price competition and the fact that today nearly
everyone can afford a salon manicure. According to Drummey, the
national average for a manicure is $12. Yet in Los Angeles, many
would be loath to pay more than $6 or $7. And it isn't as if you have
to hunt to find such prices. "There are a lot of discount salons in
Southern California," says Drummey. Take Lanny, which the Guide to
Beauty Los Angeles 2002 (published by Moxly) named "the most popular
inexpensive nail salon in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Located on 3rd Street near Sweetzer Avenue and surrounded by
independent fashion boutiques and pricey lifestyle stores, Lanny
Nails attracts a crowd of stylish twenty- and thirtysomethings who
pile in wearing tank tops and hip-huggers and take seats at the side,
waiting for their turns at a $7 man or $9 ped. While short on
atmosphere, Lanny delivers quick, efficient factory-line service.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street at Susan's Nails, where a manicure is $6 and a
pedicure $10, the mood is more serene. Thirty-eight-year-old Denise
Lawler, who works in movie advertising, used to go to Lanny. But one
day it was booked, so she wandered in here. She's never gone back.
"It's calm. It's fast. It's clean. They're sweet and they do an
amazing job," she says, resting a copy of People magazine on her lap.
"They also have the National Enquirer here," she says. "You don't
want to buy it but you always want to read it." And there's never
enough time in line at the supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   For many women, getting their nails done is their only down time.
Over and over, women say it forces them to sit still and relax. (Of
course there's always that one person yammering on her cell
phone--the double-A type.) No one's reading Dostoevsky at the nail
salon. InStyle is more the right speed. Vanity Fair is too heavy.
Some women close their eyes or simply zone out. Even watching their
hands soak in that moisturizing bath can be meditative, a far cry
from the office, the kids, the 405. Think of it as hand yoga, a
manual om.</TE>
<TE>   For others, the experience is more social. At Susan's, two women
sitting near Lawler discuss the horseradish mashed potatoes at
Campanile in reverential tones. Their conversation turns to the new
cathedral downtown, then the Agape Church. The exchange would be
forgettable except for one small thing. The women are strangers. And
not to get too philosophical--after all, we are talking nails--but
something happens when women get their nails done.</TE>
<TE>   They're comfortable. They're not rushing off anywhere, at least
not till they're semi-dry. The walls come down. And they start
talking. Los Angeles becomes a smaller town in nail salons. The rules
change.</TE>
<TE>   "I think nail salons and barbershops are places where people tend
to talk freely," offers Kamilah Earl, a 27-year-old accountant, as
her toenails are transformed with a sports-car electric blue. That is
certainly the case here, at Nails on L.A., a wildly popular Compton
salon where manicures run $5.99, pedicures are $9.99 and intricate
nail art is the specialty. (A display shows 104 sample designs, from
interlocking rhinestone Cs to tiny watermelon.) It's a nonstop social
hour.</TE>
<TE>   "You see a lot of the same faces," says Earl, who generally drops
by every two weeks on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. "I talk to
everybody. I don't know her," she says, gesturing to the woman
getting a manicure a few feet away. "But I talk to her. We might talk
about, 'look at that color.' Or 'look at her hair.' Women gossip."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, patrons, often with their small children in tow, keep
pouring through the door. It's like Macy's the night before
Christmas. Denise Lee, who has the station closest to the entrance,
greets each person with "Hi honey." Many know her by name. Some women
ask if their favorite manicurists are on. (With 20-plus employees
working in the long, narrow salon at any one time, it's hard to
tell.) If the answer is no, some say they'll come back the next day.
Others settle for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Earl has been coming here for about 10 years, since just after the
L.A. riots when the place burned down. She came here even for a spell
after she moved to Marina del Rey. "I tried a couple other places but
they couldn't shape my nails right or they would pop off," she says.
Besides, she adds, Denise and her husband Michael, who also works at
Nails on L.A., "are like family. I know all her kids. Me and her were
pregnant together. I got my nails done here for my graduation, my
prom, when I was married."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of loyalty is not unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we sit there and we touch them and hold their hand,
there's quite a bond," explains veteran nail tech Dawn Dale of Atocha
in Pacific Palisades. "A handful of my girlfriends who started as
clients came to my wedding."</TE>
<TE>   Certain salons lend themselves to being social more than others.
In part this is simply a matter of how they are set up. At Jessica,
for instance, the chairs in the main room ring the edge and face
toward the center. The Jessica clientele also tends to be from a
certain social strata, which facilitates casual conversation. These
are women who can comfortably afford the $25 manicures and $30
pedicures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the prime example of the ladies-who-lunch crowd," says
Hannah Lee, managing editor of Nails. "You can go there on a Friday
morning at 10 and it's packed. They all have standing appointments.
It's a very social situation." In fact, there is a group of
middle-aged women who met at Jessica years ago. They became friends.
Now they all get their nails done together Friday morning, then head
down the street to Clafoutis, a French sidewalk cafe, for lunch. It's
a sorority.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Nail Design III, at the top of Beverly Glen near
Mulholland Drive in Beverly Glen Circle, also feels very insider. Not
intimidating, just insular. "It's a neighborhood place," says Colette
Ament, a 50-ish mother and former actress who lives nearby. "I almost
always see an acquaintance here."</TE>
<TE>   Ament has tried Jessica and other spots. But she comes here
because it's convenient. "I have my nails done once a week," she
says. "So it has to be convenient. It's not like going to the
hairdresser.</TE>
<TE>   "They do a good a job," she adds. "Why go to Jessica and pay three
times the price? It's stupidly expensive." (For the record, Jessica
is only about twice the price.)</TE>
<TE>   Whether an expensive manicure equals a better manicure is a matter
of some debate. "I believe you get what you pay for," says Dale, at
Atocha in the Palisades, who charges $15 for a manicure and $28 for a
pedicure. On the other hand, says Drummey, "I've had a beautiful $6
manicure and an awful hundred-dollar manicure. Like any service or
product you can buy, there's a wide range. The consumer has to be
very discerning. It's kind of a buyer-beware situation." Even within
a particular salon, some technicians have better reputations than
others.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that generally holds true: The inexpensive manicures and
pedicures tend to be short on extras. If there's any hand or foot
massage, it's usually a cursory thing, over before you can really
sink in and enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   The cheaper services also clock in much faster: 15 or 20 minutes,
instead of the 60 minutes some of the higher-end places advertise.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, there are reasons for going to both the high-end salons
and the discount salons," says Nails managing editor Lee.  Not
everyone wants to spend an hour getting their nails done. In fact,
many women say the reason they bother going to a salon rather than
doing her nails themselves is that it's quicker.</TE>
<TE>   "But sometimes you want to pamper yourself a little more," Lee
says. This is where a place like L.A. Vie L'Orange comes into play.
This West Hollywood hideaway features wicker cocoon-like cabanas,
groovy mood music, aromatherapy candles, blooms of fresh flowers that
would do Martha Stewart proud, afghans for those chilly mornings, the
relaxing sounds of a trickling fountain and an interior right out of
some elegant Southeast Asia resort.</TE>
<TE>   There's an arrangement of lucky bamboo at each station and little
satchels in which clients can stash their jewelry while nails are
done. About one-third of the salon's patrons visit in groups. Often
it's for a wedding shower or baby shower.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's not only women who get manicures and pedicures.
Men are becoming more common fixtures in nail salons these days. And
it isn't necessarily whom you'd expect.</TE>
<TE>   "Real men do get manicures," says Vivien Harrison, a middle-aged
schoolteacher and regular at Hollywood's C.T. Nails II. A couple of
chairs away, CLS Limo driver Nelson Hayes is having his nails done.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our guys do this," says the 57-year-old. "We're around a
lot of high-profile people and we want to have nice-looking hands. I
can never do them as well as the ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Hayes had a manicure in England. He paid $30. "They
didn't even have tables," he says. "She just put a towel on her
knees. I was so used to California. It's an industry out here. It's a
culture."</TE>

<LD>Today's nail techs offer more services than a Beverly Hills plastic
surgeon. We asked veteran practitioner Dawn Dale of Atocha in Pacific
Palisades to define the myriad choices and the most common terms.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Nail tech: The new term for manicurist. It's been around for less
than five years.</LD>
<TE>   French or French manicure: Actually a very American thing. A
manicure with a pink base and a white tip or an off-white tip. Ask
the French about it and they'll just look at you funny.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylic: Similar to porcelain, it's used to extend the nail.</TE>
<TE>   Full set: Basically you're creating a new set of nails. This can
be done by gluing on preformed plastic nails and painting acrylic
over the whole nail. I make my own using a liquid form of acrylic and
a powder form. You dip your brush in the liquid then the powder. Then
you form a ball on the tip of your brush and you place the product on
the nail to form the shape. After a client has this done once,
generally all that is required is a fill every one to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Fill: You're filling in the growth (near the cuticle) with the
acrylic or linen or whatever product you're using so it looks like a
fresh nail. Depending on the product, a fill is generally needed
every one to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Silk or linen wrap: Silk or linen fabric (cut into small pieces)
is affixed to the nails in order to strengthen them and help keep
polish on.</TE>
<TE>   Juliet or liquid Juliet: Twenty years ago when people did liquid
Juliets, they would take paper and glue it on the nail with clear
nail polish and wrap the paper underneath the nail and put a liquid
fiber on top. Today a polish with a milky consistency and fibers in
it is used. You put two or three coats of liquid Juliet over the
whole nail. Then you use regular polish. It's supposed to keep your
nails stronger so your polish will last longer.</TE>
<TE>   Square: Popular nail shape in which the tip of the nail is flat.</TE>
<TE>   Round/oval: An equally popular nail shape in which the nail is
more the shape of your finger: not pointy, but more of a rounded,
tapered look.</TE>
<TE>   Square round: A combination of square and oval in which the tips
of the nails are square but the corners are rounded just a little so
they're not sharp.</TE>
<TE>   Paraffin treatment: You put lotion or mineral oil on your hands
(or feet), then dip them into a liquefied wax that's very warm but
not hot. The wax molds to your hand, then you put your hands in a
mitt to help the lotion or mineral oil penetrate.</TE>
<TE>   Buffing: It makes the nails look shiny but goes away naturally
after about five days. The process involves a three-sided file with
an ultra-fine grit. You're creating different textures. The last side
of the file, which is dull, creates a high gloss. More men have their
nails buffed than polished.</TE>
<TE>   Nail art: When I first got into the business, we used to drill a
hole in the acrylic and put a diamond in, like an earring. You can
also hand-paint things, put decals on, rhinestones, glitter, anything
you can think of. Flowers painted on the big toe are hot right now,
usually with a rhinestone in the center.</TE>

<LD>Becoming a manicurist requires more than a steady hand. We asked Rick
Lopes, an information officer with the California Department of
Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Barbering and Cosmetology to give us the
lowdown on what it takes to earn a license.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Nails Fact Book 2001-2002, a special edition of
Nails magazine published annually, the national average salary for a
full-time manicurist is $23,306. However, in the Western region
(which includes California), it is significantly higher: $33,024.
That's a lot of top coat.</LD>
<LD>   The candidate must be 17 years or older and have completed the
10th grade in California public schools or their equivalent. Also
required are 400 hours of study in the field at a school with an
approved curriculum. Alternatively , those who have practiced in the
profession outside of California must prove they have worked the
equivalent number of hours and achieved similar competency.</LD>
<TE>   The candidate must pass an examination of 100 multiple-choice
questions on matters ranging from bacteriology to hazardous
substances, as well as a practical component. For the latter, the
candidate brings in a live model and performs various procedures on
them. This can be anything from acrylic nails to nail wraps.
(Incidentally, the pass rate for the state's 2001-2002 fiscal year
was 64%.)</TE>
<TE>   The cost of initial license is $35. Every two years, the license
must be renewed at a cost of $40.</TE>

<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A humanizing approach to celebrity adulation underpins a noteworthy
pair of current solo shows. Diametrically different in format and
polish, Kathy Morath's "Day Dreaming: Channeling Doris Day" and Dan
Tirman's "I Live Lucy" provide equally accessible views of their
respective icons.</LD>
<LD>   "Day Dreaming," a bubbling salute to Hollywood's favorite girl
next door, is slightly misleading in its subtitle. The petite
Morath--a ringer for Olympic figure skater Janet Lynn--does not
channel Doris Day; rather, she sketches Day's essence in pastel
tones.</LD>
<LD>   Her smooth set at the Masquers Cabaret in West Hollywood offers an
ingratiating demonstration of piano bar expertise. Morath supplies
just enough biographical information to support her optimistic
mission, avoiding the darker facts of Day's life and career.</LD>
<TE>   Dressed in vintage '60s fashions (including a coat whose fur trim
she hastens to identify as fake), Morath knows celebrity, her father
being ragtime pianist Max Morath. This nominally explains her
effortless ability to charm an audience, working the old-style supper
club room with evident pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Morath deftly replicates Day's phrasing, as in the
audience-participation treatment of "Everybody Loves a Lover," or her
spot-on "Secret Love," wryly introduced by way of same-sex unions.
Her actual vocal timbre is less imitative, a potent, straight-toned
soprano more suggestive of '50s nightclub canary June Ericson than of
Day's sliding alto.</TE>
<TE>   Still, although Morath's banter with able musical director Bruce
W. Coyle seems a tad practiced at times, and her embrace of Day more
decorative than incisive, "Day Dreaming" offers swell entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Tirman's "I Live Lucy," at the Whitmore-Lindley Theatre Center in
North Hollywood, is bare-bones by comparison. However, he acutely
delineates the object of his affection, the immortal Lucille Ball.
She is a lifelong fixation, as his self-directed workshop staging
makes clear from the start.</TE>
<TE>   The autobiographical narrative charts Tirman's first Long
Island-based exposure to the queen of television comedy, teenage
in-person encounters and a psychic link-up with Ball upon her demise.</TE>
<TE>   He interweaves this stream-of-consciousness account with excerpts
from "Bill Frawley Sings the Old Ones," lip-syncing to key passages.
At the finale, Tirman appears in late-period Lucy drag, admonishing
the audience to "love yourself first."</TE>
<TE>   His lower-case Cliff Gorman quality is endearing, and his writing
shows considerable promise and integrity. What he requires for
progression to the next level is an outside eye. Many of the
back-and-forth dialogue passages are unnecessary, obviating points
better left implied.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tirman's restraint is commendable, his impersonation
wants more exaggeration to fully land. For example, his traversal of
the three phases of Lucy--"from squeaky to throaty to
gravel-toned"--lacks definition, reducing comic impact.</TE>
<TE>   This does not diminish Tirman's achievement, nor his work's
potential; as Lucy would say, he just needs a good show doctor.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strangers knock on Judy Brown's front door all the time. They run
their fingers along the clinker bricks jutting from her front wall
and press their faces against her ornamental-glass windows. Once, she
found someone wandering in her kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   They're confused. They think Brown lives in the Gamble House, the
Pasadena manor designed by Charles and Henry Greene that is a
destination for devotees of the American Arts and Crafts movement.</LD>
<LD>   But Brown isn't rattled by these uninvited guests. She understands
that those poking around her property are just turned around. She
directs them across the street to the radiant "winter cottage" built
for one of the Procter &amp; Gamble heirs in 1908, and open to the public
for the last four decades. Brown listens as the intruders explain
that her cedar-shingled California bungalow looks as if it was
designed by the famous brothers.</LD>
<TE>   It was. Brown's home, along with other private residences dreamed
up by the Greenes and other prominent architects before the burdens
of World War I and yearly income taxes, will be open to a limited
number of ticket-holders during Pasadena Heritage's Craftsman
Weekend, Oct. 18-20. There will also be lectures, a decorative-arts
show and docents leading tour groups around some of the neighborhoods
where the brothers' work is clustered. More than half of the 137
structures they built at the turn of the last century are still
standing.</TE>
<TE>   Greene &amp; Greene homes are distinctive in their use of natural
materials and the way the timber, arroyo stone, brick and joints are
exposed. Despite the heft of these materials, the homes have a light
presence.</TE>
<TE>   Overhanging roofs and extended support beams make the structures
seem as if they could be elevated by a strong wind. Wooden railings
have few vertical supports, allowing passersby to peek into open-air
sleeping terraces.</TE>
<TE>   And banks of vertical windows break up the wood siding and invite
breezes in. (Cross-ventilation was important to the brothers, who
once lived in the end unit of a block of three-story houses in St.
Louis.)</TE>
<TE>   The Greenes, along with other Arts and Crafts architects who
embraced the philosophy that everything about a home should be useful
and beautiful, considered the total environment in their plans. They
wrestled with the way the house was situated on the property.</TE>
<TE>   The Blacker home in the Oak Knoll area was built on a corner of
the 5 1/2-acre estate to provide an expansive view of the
Japanese-inspired landscape. The brothers also mapped out the "peanut
brittle" arrangement of boulders and irregular-shaped clinker brick
in garden walls, and designed the artistic furnishings, from the
sturdy built-in benches to the graceful glass lanterns.</TE>
<TE>   At 4,000 square feet, Brown's two-story home is a modest Greene &amp;
Greene (the Blacker home is triple the size). Its original owner,
Mary L. Ranney, was a draftsman in the brothers' firm, and she drew
up the blueprints. Materials and labor fees were $6,500 in 1907, when
the average custom home in the area--including land and design
fees--cost $1,500. Altruistic architects of the time wanted to make
handcrafted homes for the everyman, but the price made them
unaffordable to most.</TE>
<TE>   In a twist on that shortcoming, Heritage Housing Partners, a
branch of the nonprofit Pasadena Heritage preservation group, buys
neglected older homes, restores them, then sells them below market
value to first-time home buyers.</TE>
<TE>   During the Craftsman Weekend, restoration experts will explain the
work completed days earlier on the Merrill House, a one-story
bungalow designed by the Greenes in 1910. After two years of
replacing the redwood siding, rebuilding the brick fireplace and
bringing everything up to code, the home is ready for its new family.</TE>
<TE>   Also during the weekend, more than 60 exhibitors will display
antiques, revival furniture, metalwork, pottery, glass, textiles and
plein-air paintings at the Pasadena Masonic Temple, 200 S. Euclid
Ave. Admission to the decorative-arts show, Oct. 19-20, is $10.
Tickets are available at the door, or in advance over the phone and
online.</TE>
<TE>   Bus, walking and drive-yourself tours sell out early and cost from
$25 to $45. Lectures, which are on Oct. 19 and cost $20, include ones
by design consultant Su Bacon on Arts and Crafts interiors, historian
Paul Duchscherer on the simplicity of the Eastlake and Shingle
styles, and authors Carole Coates and Norman Karlson on tile and
pottery of the period.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Craftsman Weekend event, Pasadena Heritage
offers monthly tours of historic neighborhoods and commercial
districts.</TE>

<HD>Digging a New Activity That's as Old as Time</HD>
<DH>This archeology workshop lets parents and children discover
how much they have in common with those who came before.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the archeologists at the "ancient ruins" overlooking the San
Diego Freeway look a little young to make any significant finds. But
the toddlers with pacifiers, aided by parents with mean trowels,
manage to keep up with the team as we travel more than 3,000 years
back in time.</LD>
<LD>   An archeologist is leading families of would-be scientists on a
hillside expedition behind the Skirball Cultural Center. For 90
minutes, we will dig at Kiryat ha Malachim, Hebrew for "city of
Angels" and a replica of an Iron Age site once occupied by ancient
Israelites.</LD>
<LD>   Erin Clancey, the assistant curator of archeology leading the
family workshop, has clearly been down this pseudo-ancient road
before. She gives simple explanations of what archeology is ("the
study of what people left behind") and how it differs from other
scientific endeavors ("Once you've dug a site, it's gone") before
explaining how to dig up the artifacts.</LD>
<TE>   The group of 26, including a dozen children, splits into teams and
selects one of five shaded sand pits. My children, 14 and 11, are
thankful we have our own 5-by-5 foot area. They'd been fretting that
they would be "digging in a sandbox with a bunch of babies" since the
activity is for ages 4 and up. (The dig ends up topping their list of
"favorite activities our parents dragged us to.")</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, we unearth the first of dozens of discoveries.
"It's a turtle," I shout, when we pull out our first pottery shard
from the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, you do know it's pretend?" my daughter not-so-gently
reminds.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly, we start exposing a cobblestone-like path. Clancey,
making the rounds, asks us what we think it is. "A really nice
driveway?" my ever-helpful husband says. (Eventually, we'll figure
out it is the top of a kitchen wall.)</TE>
<TE>   The entire group fills buckets with fragments of such artifacts as
a tablet with "cuneiform" inscriptions (even with the preschool-heavy
crowd Clancey isn't afraid to use a big word), an olive press and oil
lamps. We find the top of a gate that circled the city and signs of a
corral where live animals were kept in a kitchen. One site shows
signs of animal sacrifice, a broken altar and abandoned weapons. Many
of the artifacts are replicas of pieces that are on display in the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "We learn cultural history from real artifacts. Creating this
space, this outside dig, helps people see how much we have in common
with people who came before us," says Adele Lander Burke, vice
president of museum education who helped design the site six years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Giesberg of Santa Monica brought her son and his friend, who
are 5, to the event.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids love the digging, and they love discovering," she says.
"This helps them conceptualize the past."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the dig, Clancey is leading two of the littlest
scientists through a discussion of their find, a drinking gourd she
tells them was used like a canteen.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it," one yells. "I found it first," the other shouts, in
an argument as old as time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd. Saturday from 2 to 3:30 p.m. Ages 4 and up,

<LD>The British actress co-stars in the HBO comedy "The Mind of the

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Let me get back to you: I've only been here a year, so I don't
know what the amazing things are to do on the weekend. What does
anyone do on weekends? I should have rehearsed this.</LD>
<TE>   Drive: I wanted to drive this weekend. On Saturday I want to get
to Santa Barbara or beyond maybe. Just get out of the town. Or maybe
go south. I need to go to Mexico one day.</TE>
<TE>   I went to Palm Springs; I didn't like it. Everyone looked like
they were about to die in their golf carts. I went to Joshua Tree
once with a friend who has a keen sense of irony.... We'd been told
it was really mysterious. We thought, yeah, this is really
mysterious. We debunked the desert.</TE>
<TE>   I bought a car. I bought a beautiful, beautiful Volkswagen
Cabriolet. It's dark green, which is called British green here. It's
the first thing I've owned in America. I've been renting for a year.
I've been driving a rental car. I don't want to talk about it. I
don't want to talk about the money I've been hemorrhaging into rental
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Sit, Lucy, sit: I do yoga and hikes. I do Pilates. On weekends I
try to hike. I go with a girlfriend. I end up always in Runyon Canyon
because that's where my friend walks her dog. Lucy the dog does need
the walk....</TE>
<TE>   [Sundays are for] sitting quietly with all the newspapers I can
muster. The New York Times, the L.A. Times, the New Yorker that I
haven't read from the week before. If I can get hold of the [London]
Observer, I try.</TE>
<TE>   "Mind of the Married Man" debut: I had nine people coming over. I
made curry. I found an Indian shop because I wanted to make all of
the spices. I got to 7 o'clock and had a complete meltdown. But
luckily, [my friend] Kate called and I pulled it together. It was
fine. I'm not great at watching myself, but it was nice. But I'm not
rushed to repeat it.</TE>

<TE>   The new special-edition DVD of Disney's 1991 animated film "Beauty
and the Beast"  ($30) actually features three versions of the
enchanting adaptation of the classic fairy tale--the only animated
film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Included are the original theatrical release, a work-in-progress
edition that was shown at the 1991 New York Film Festival and a
special edition that was released earlier this year in the Imax
format.</TE>
<TE>   The latter boasts a song, "Human Again," that was conceived for
the original film but never animated. It was subsequently introduced
in the Broadway stage version.</TE>
<TE>   The special edition of the film has been digitally restored frame
by frame and looks glorious. It is also available on VHS ($25).</TE>
<TE>   Chris Carrey, senior vice president of DVD production and
worldwide technical services for Buena Vista Home Entertainment, says
that "Beauty and the Beast" is the most elaborate DVD the company has
produced. Disc 1 includes all three versions of the film and
informative commentary from the filmmakers--directors Kirk Wise and
Gary Trousdale, producer Don Hahn, and Oscar-winning composer Alan
Menken. There is also a sing-along track and a game in which players
look for a secret code that allows them to play another game on Disc
2.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc is divided into three sections: "Mrs. Potts'
Engaging Treats: Fun for All Ages," which includes a look at the
stories behind classic Disney movies, a "making of" featurette with
Celine Dion as host, a featurette on the "Beauty and the Beast"
Broadway production, and several games. "Cogsworth and Lumiere's
Library" is for the film buff and is filled with such goodies as the
early presentation reel, a wonderful alternate version of "Be Our
Guest," a look at the various designs for Beauty and the Beast, and
character art galleries. "Chip's Fun and Games--For the Young at
Heart" offers an MTV-ish tour of Disney's animation studios, as well
as "Chip's Musical Challenge Game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The theatrical version of the classic animated TV series
"Scooby-Doo" may have brought in big bucks at the box office this
summer, but there is no camouflaging the fact that the movie is a
dog. Silly and often tasteless, the film also is thwarted by having a
computer-generated Scooby-Doo. The only saving grace is Matthew
Lillard as Scooby's hippy-dippy friend, Shaggy. Freddie Prinze Jr.,
with a horrible blond hairdo, and his wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar,
also star.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Warner, $27) is available in either the wide-screen or
pan-and-scan version. It offers a behind-the-scenes featurette,
deleted scenes (including a fun animated opening with commentary by
director Raja Gosnell), games, a music video, mindless commentary
with the stars and another track with the director, and seven
challenging DVD-ROM games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New on DVD from Warner Home Video are two MGM classics from
Hollywood's golden age: "The Thin Man" and "The Shop Around the
Corner"  ($20 each).</TE>
<TE>   Produced in 1934, "The Thin Man" is a sophisticated souffle based
on the Dashiell Hammett thriller. It boasts crackling dialogue and
perfect performances from William Powell and Myrna Loy as the married
sleuths, Nick and Nora Charles. The film was so popular it spawned a
long, successful series of sequels. Asta the dog also stars. The DVD
transfer is crisp; the disc includes the trailers for all the "Thin
Man" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst Lubitsch directed the 1940 romantic comedy "The Shop Around
the Corner," starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as two
squabbling store clerks who don't realize they are pen pals. This
absolutely magical film was remade as "In the Good Old Summertime"
and "You've Got Mail," and turned into the Broadway musical "She
Loves Me." The DVD features a beautiful transfer, trailers from the
three versions and a 1940 MGM short.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey, baby. The collector's edition DVD of the comedy "Swingers"
(Miramax, $20) is money. Written by and starring Jon Favreau and
directed by Doug Liman, "Swingers" follows a group of struggling
actors in Los Angeles who spend their nights looking for love and
hanging out at cool nightclubs that specialize in swing music.</TE>
<TE>   Loosely autobiographical, "Swingers" also stars Favreau's friends
Vince Vaughn, Patrick Van Horn and Ron Livingston. The disc features
an original documentary on the making of the film, deleted scenes,
commentary from Liman, very funny and R-rated commentary from Favreau
and Vaughn, and the acclaimed spoof "Swing Blade."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Image's two-disc set "D.W. Griffith--Years of Discovery 1909-1913"
(Image, $40) is manna from heaven for any serious student of film.</TE>
<TE>   During his years at Biograph, Griffith made some 450 films--either
one or two reels (a reel translates to 10 minutes) at the rate of two
or three a week. These short films gave Griffith the opportunity to
experiment with storytelling and camera techniques, which he used in
feature films such as "The Birth of a Nation" and "Intolerance."
These early films also featured actors Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Mary
Pickford, Mack Sennett (who later operated his own comedy studio),
Lionel Barrymore and Henry Walthall.</TE>
<TE>   The set includes such seminal Griffith shorts as "The Musketeers
of Pig Alley," "The New York Hat" and "A Corner in Wheat." Digitally
restored, the discs also feature low-key but well-researched
commentary from film historian Russell Merritt.</TE>

<HD>Branford Marsalis' Many Faces</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Branford Marsalis showed up in a number of different
musical guises at the Roxy on Tuesday night. That's not particularly
surprising, given the personas he's already revealed in his
career--from leading a television band (on Jay Leno's "Tonight Show")
to founding a pop-jazz crossover band (Buckshot LeFonque), from
classical outings (his CDs "Romances for Saxophone" and "Creation")
to periodic straight-ahead, uncluttered jazz performances and
recordings.</LD>
<LD>   His Roxy program fortunately emphasized the latter, although even
in the jazz category, Marsalis offered several distinctly different
musical identities.</LD>
<LD>   In the first two pieces--his own "In the Crease" and "MuphkinMan"
by drummer Jeff "Tain" Watts--the accessible Marsalis was front and
center, punching out R&amp;B-driven lines over supercharged funk rhythms
from Watts and bassist Eric Revus. A bit later, in the poignant "A
Thousand Autumns," a more pensive Marsalis put in an appearance, his
tone now sweetened, his improvisation arcing gently through the
floating harmonies of pianist Joey Calderazzo.</LD>
<TE>   Moving on, Marsalis pulled out all the stops in a wildfire set of
choruses triggered by Ornette Coleman's "Giggin'." Climaxing his set
before a capacity and ebulliently enthusiastic crowd, he offered an
intense re-creation of segments from John Coltrane's "A Love
Supreme."</TE>
<TE>   That's an impressively varied plate of music to include in a
90-minute set. But Marsalis brought it off, for the most part, with
considerable success. Although the opening tunes suggested he might
be paying too much attention to the marketing responsibilities of his
new role as head of his own record company, the second half of the
set made no concessions at all to commerciality. In several rocketing
up-tempo solos, Marsalis was a virtuosic technician, ripping notes
out of his horn with blinding speed while maintaining a remarkable
sense of clarity and focus. As in numerous previous appearances, he
made it clear that he is not a player who plays notes--even very fast
notes--without a purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Marsalis was well served by the other players, whose easy musical
empathy with one another evidenced their continuing work together as
members of his regular quartet. If there were times when Watts seemed
a bit larger than life, if Calderazzo now and then chose flamboyance
over focus, they more than countered for their occasional excesses by
generally providing Marsalis with a stimulating combination of
creative challenge and solid musical support.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mommy Dearest" has nothing on Beatrice, the ferociously embittered,
narcissistic mother in Paul Zindel's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama,
"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds."</LD>
<LD>   It's a meaty role, and Helen Wilson makes a forceful meal of it in
Kindling Theatre Company's otherwise too-earnest production directed
by Ximena Solimano at the Stella Adler Theatre. The torment is
palpable when Wilson's gravel-voiced, chain-smoking Beatrice drips
sarcasm and lashes out in rage at her two teenage daughters, doing
her tormented best to instill them with her own sense of failure,
ugliness and shame before the world does it for her.</LD>
<LD>   As the scapegoat younger daughter, Tillie, who finds her hopeful
path to freedom through a transcendent enthusiasm for the wonders of
science, Marni Raitt is a graceful presence but registers little
angst amid the chaos. Bernadette Guckin is intermittently affecting
as Ruth, the mentally fragile favorite who seems doomed to suffer
most from her nearer proximity to the relentless maternal
dysfunction.</LD>
<TE>   In supporting roles, Danielle De Luca makes an appearance as
Tillie's morbid science-fair rival, and Olga Gorelik, as aged, non
compos mentis Nanny, is much too youthful to be convincing despite a
thick layer of strange, grayish-white mime-face make-up.</TE>

<HD>No Pedestals for 'Idol'</HD>
<DH>Pop tour based on hit TV program is predictable and
amateurish, with the weak performers dragging the better ones down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--The "American Idol" concert tour opened Tuesday at Cox
Arena here minus almost all of the features that made the TV show
such a sensation.</LD>
<LD>   There was no Simon Cowell, the tough-talking judge.</LD>
<LD>   No Paula Abdul, the cheerleading den mother.</LD>
<TE>   No tension over whom viewers were going to vote off the show.</TE>
<TE>   No tears of victory or defeat.</TE>
<TE>   All it had was the show's weakest link: the singers.</TE>
<TE>   There was so little of interest going on for most of the two-hour
affair that they ought to rename the tour "American Idle."</TE>
<TE>   The sophistication level was about that of the Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers tour of the mid-'90s--only the bulk of the audience
Tuesday was 15 to 50 rather than the Rangers' 4-to-6 age range.</TE>
<TE>   When did the "American Idol" brain trust come up with the concept
for this show? On the way down from Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon?</TE>
<TE>   The opening half was devoted to parading the show's 10 finalists
in predictable countdown fashion for one song each, ending with
winner Kelly Clarkson.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning on material from the new "American Idol" album, each
singer was backed by a faceless five-piece band and three spirited
support vocalists. To add some sparkle, the singers' images were
projected on three video screens and several of the numbers were
highlighted by gigantic bursts of fire, a la KISS.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who didn't follow the "American Idol" show, however, it
was hard by intermission to remember just who sang what. Was it A.J.
who sang "My Cherie Amour," or Ejay? or RJ?</TE>
<TE>   I do remember it was Jim Verraros who sang Lionel Richie's "Easy,"
and it wasn't pretty.</TE>
<TE>   This show--which will reach the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim on Nov.
15--may have been a hit in prime time, but those four singers aren't
ready for an arena stage.</TE>
<TE>   They moved about the stage with steps and smiles that looked as if
they came from hours of practicing in the mirror, and the singing
lacked any individual edge. Among the females, Ryan Starr was equally
mechanical.</TE>
<TE>   In this company, Christina Christian, a 21-year-old from Brooklyn
who was the fifth runner-up, came across as downright thrilling. She
not only displayed convincing vocal touches on a soulful version of
Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine" but also moved with charm and
poise.</TE>
<TE>   Even more winning was Tamyra Gray, a former Miss Atlanta who
brought intimacy and fire to the classy Dionne Warwick hit "A House
Is Not a Home."</TE>
<TE>   Nikki McKibbin, a Texan with bright red hair and a powerful voice,
did her best to inject some fire into "Piece of My Heart," but her
version seemed simply moribund next to the classic Janis Joplin
rendition.</TE>
<TE>   Next came Justin Guarini, the evening's chief revelation--at least
for anyone who found the frizzy-haired 23-year-old insufferably
cloying on the TV show. Guarini, the runner-up to Clarkson in the
final voting, showed unexpected restraint Tuesday in the opening
moments of "Get Here," an engaging Brenda Russell ballad that was a
hit for Oleta Adams a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Guarini also displayed a far more disarming manner as he
introduced Clarkson, who has already parlayed her TV show crown into
the nation's biggest-selling single, "Before Your Love."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was clearly in her corner as she walked on stage to
close the opening half of the show. Fans cheered mightily and several
held signs in salute. "I Came All the Way from Vegas to See Kelly,"
read one.</TE>
<TE>   With the all this going for her, Clarkson was curiously
underwhelming as she went into a vigorous but undistinctive version
of "Respect," one of Aretha Franklin's signature hits. She also moved
around the stage uncertainly, showing little of the charisma or poise
of Guarini or Gray.</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of the TV show, many of those seated near me in the
audience took advantage of the intermission to informally cast their
votes on who did best during the hour--which is a point the tour
designers should have recognized.</TE>
<TE>   Why not make each night another contest, allowing fans to cast
ballots as they leave the arena? The results could be released city
by city or week by week, with a winner announced at the end of the
tour.</TE>
<TE>   It would bring some degree of drama to the tour.</TE>
<TE>   My ballot Tuesday would have been Gray, Guarini and Christian, in
that order.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, the performers worked in teams, and this
segment was also numbingly predictable. What styles could be safer
for medleys by this gang, with its funky, R&amp;B leanings, than Motown
and disco?</TE>
<TE>   Besides the predictability, the numbers suffered because the
cast's stronger members were dragged down by the weaker ones.
Guarini's vitality was especially drained by the guys around him.</TE>
<TE>   In between the medleys, the evening's stars got to do solo numbers
again--Guarini offering "For Once in My Life," Clarkson tackling
"(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman" and McKibbin reprising
Stevie Nicks' "Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the show felt like little more than an amateur
production, right down to the the singers' telling us again and again
that they had all formed lifelong friendships and how thankful they
were to the audience for making their dreams come true.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder what Simon Cowell would say about that.</TE>

<LD>   The Chosen--Two Jewish teenagers, growing up in '40s Brooklyn, are
on parallel but very different paths toward adulthood--yet manage to
become best friends. The parallels become tangible in the absorbing
stage adaptation of the late Chaim Potok's popular novel "The
Chosen," now in its beautifully acted West Coast premiere at Miles
Memorial Playhouse in Santa Monica. On one side of the stage is the
kitchen table of yeshiva teacher David Malter (John Herzog) and son
Reuven (Nicholas Downs). On the other side is the home office of a
Hasidic rabbi, Reb Saunders (Robert Grossman), who discusses the
Talmud but does not otherwise talk to his son and anointed successor,
Danny (Adam Silverstein). Sometimes the audience can see action
simultaneously in both homes. The story is smoothly narrated by
Robert Pescovitz, playing grown-up Reuven plus several small roles.
In the second act, the older Reuven briefly counsels the younger
Reuven, like a voice from the future, urging him to concentrate on
what he really wants to do with his life. It's the play's most
pointedly theatrical device in a living stage event by Potok and
Aaron Posner that is not a literal reenactment of the novel.</LD>

<HD>Kids' Films by the Book</HD>
<DH>Weston Woods' movies, soon to be available to the public,
remain true to the titles on which they are based, despite the
expense or time needed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you translate beloved children's books to film? Disney
famously, some say infamously, uses them as a springboard to its own
flights of fancy. For Weston Woods Studios, little known to the
general public but a Disney-like giant in the world of libraries and
schools, the book is sacrosanct.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 50 years, this modest film company has taken
time--three or more years on a single project--to ensure that
animation, narration and music are true to authors, illustrators and
readers.</LD>
<LD>   Now Weston Woods' treasure trove of living books is about to
become widely available for the first time to the general public. In
late September, Scholastic Entertainment began rolling out the Weston
Woods library as the Scholastic Video Collection, distributed by New
Video, with four titles: Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things
Are," Kevin Henkes' "Chrysanthemum," "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" and
"The Night Before Christmas." Other titles will be released annually.</LD>
<TE>   Varied Animation Styles</TE>
<TE>   Weston Woods founder Morton Schindel, who started the company on a
borrowed shoestring in 1953 in Weston, Conn., had one guiding
principle: "The book was always our director," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He maintained that philosophy as his company became a
multimillion-dollar business earning numerous education and film
awards for excellence, including an Oscar nomination for William
Steig's "Doctor De Soto" and the American Library Assn.'s recent
lifetime achievement award for the 86-year-old Schindel.</TE>
<TE>   "Mort had it written in the contracts that he would work with the
editor, or the author and illustrator, and at any point, if they
didn't like the production, he would throw it out and start over,"
said Linda Lee, Weston Woods Studios vice president. "That's what we
do today."</TE>
<TE>   Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are," with its intricate
cross-hatching, is the "Mt. Everest of children's books," according
to its director, Gene Deitch, and it took five years to finish.</TE>
<TE>   "When an artist puts paint on a canvas, it can be painted over
till he's satisfied that it's just right," Schindel said. "That's the
way our films were made. Once we made a commitment to a project, we
threw away the budget and the time schedule."</TE>
<TE>   The films' varied animation styles, matched to the books, include
paper puppets and collage, fine line drawings and watercolor brush
strokes. Until 1964, however, the films were produced--as some still
are today--using the iconographic method that Schindel invented.</TE>
<TE>   With this technique, widely used by filmmakers since, still
pictures are moved in front of a stationary camera, with zooms, pans
and cross-dissolves adding to the illusion of movement.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, wherever possible, the books' creators were
involved throughout the process. They even suggested a composer or
narrator.</TE>
<TE>   "They care passionately about maintaining the integrity of the
book, and for an author and an illustrator, you couldn't ask for
anything more," Henkes said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the Vision Alive</TE>
<TE>   Will Scholastic Inc., which acquired Weston Woods as a separate
division in 1996, continue to support this maverick, noncorporate,
artisan-like approach to children's filmmaking?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," said Linda Kahn, Scholastic Entertainment's senior
vice president of programming and distribution. "Weston Woods decides
what they're going to produce, and it's completely up to them how
[the films] are made. What we're doing is reaching the consumer."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at an age when most have retired from the daily work
grind, Schindel is still working to keep his vision alive, developing
the nonprofit Weston Woods Institute, "where we're hoping more people
can be induced to make this kind of thing and do it well."</TE>

<HD>A Musical 'Dracula' That Brims With Laughter and Shivers</HD>
<DH>The Sacred Fools version makes effective use of showy
theatrical trappings of the 19th century</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacred Fools presentation of "Dracula: A Musical Nightmare" is a
Halloween haunt of a show that tickles the ribs one moment, then
turns around and sends icy fingers up the spine.</LD>
<LD>   The show is presented as a 19th century melodrama, with flourishes
from the English music hall. Its master of ceremonies is one
Chauncey, ahem, DeVille (Joe Jordan), who possesses more than a
passing resemblance to the title character.</LD>
<LD>   Eyebrows waggling like bats in flight, he sinks his teeth into his
comic patter.</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with period conventions, the performances are frankly
theatrical and sometimes outright showy, as when Melinda Cowan preens
through her performance as beautiful vampire-to-be Lucy.</TE>
<TE>   Comic bits involve a nerdy Jonathan Harker (Henry Dittman), who
scrupulously documents his misadventures ("These may be the last
words I ever write. More later"); a lunatic asylum doctor, John
Seward (Bruno Oliver), who seems a more likely candidate for
confinement than the calm, deliciously droll Renfield (Michael
Lanahan); and a Dr. Van Helsing (Brad Friedman) who's slow on the
uptake.</TE>
<TE>   Things turn spooky when Jordan steps in to replace the curiously
indisposed actor who usually plays Dracula. Dressed in black evening
wear and floor-length cape, he seems to glide out of the
semidarkness. At 6 feet, 7 inches tall, he is at once scary and
mesmerizing.</TE>
<TE>   This show was a hit at the Zephyr Theatre in 1978. Its new staging
is by Jessie Marion and Ruth Silveira, daughter and widow,
respectively, of that production's director, Richard Marion.</TE>
<TE>   "Dracula," Sacred Fools, 660 N. Heliotrope Drive, Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 2. $15. (310) 281-8337. Running
time: 2 hours, 45 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Viewing Platform for Siqueiros Mural OKd</LD>
<LD>   A long-time effort to put Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros'
Olvera Street mural, "America Tropical," on public view has finally
moved forward.</LD>
<TE>   El Pueblo Commission, the eight-member board that oversees El
Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument in downtown Los Angeles, on
Tuesday approved plans for a viewing platform, shelter and
interpretive center. Construction is expected to take about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Siqueiros painted the mural in 1932, but part of its subject
matter--a crucified Indian peon with an American eagle perched on the
cross--was deemed offensive and the artwork was whitewashed.
Conservation work already has been done by the Getty Conservation
Institute, which has provided major funding for the $4.5-million
project.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Fire Destroys L.A.'s Lost Studio on La Brea</TE>
<TE>   The Lost Studio, a 72-seat theater and acting studio at 130 S. La
Brea Ave. in L.A., was destroyed by fire Monday morning. It was run
for the last 14 years by Cinda Jackson, who said she hopes to find
temporary quarters and then rebuild at the same site.</TE>
<TE>   The theater was known as the Loft Studio during the 17 years when
it was run by the late Peggy Feury and Bill Traylor, whose students
included Lily Tomlin, Sean Penn and other Hollywood celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the studio was the home of Circus Minimus, a
teaching and producing company that Jackson ran with playwright John
Steppling and Mick Collins in the early '90s. In the last two years,
Jackson produced a series of Harold Pinter plays and Donald Freed's
"How Shall We Be Saved?" at the Lost Studio.</TE>

<TE>   Iran Bans CNN Reporter Amanpour</TE>
<TE>   CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who is not allowed into
Iraq, now can add Iran to the list of places where she isn't welcome.
On Wednesday, Iran barred her from accompanying British Foreign
Secretary Jack Straw, who is visiting the region. She had to get off
the plane in Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Iran Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Amanpour was banned in
retaliation for U.S. treatment of Iranians who want to visit the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Some Iranian journalists and artists, including film director
Abbas Kiarostami, were either denied U.S. visas or left waiting for
months for a decision. We, of course, take this into account,"
Kharrazi told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's 'Just Shoot Me'  Hits a Ratings Low</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Just Shoot Me" didn't pack much firepower in its new time
period Tuesday, attracting less than half the audience that watched
ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" or CBS' "JAG."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Nielsen Media Research estimates, "Just Shoot Me" opened
its seventh season with the show's lowest rating for a new episode,
attracting 6.6 million viewers versus nearly 15 million for "8 Simple
Rules." The comedy aired on Thursdays last season.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   ABC has given a full-season order to its freshman comedy "Less
Than Perfect".... Aileen Wuornos, the convicted killer who was
executed in Florida on Wednesday, and who has been the subject of two
movies, three books and an opera, will be the focus of another film,
"Monster," starring Charlize Theron, the Hollywood Reporter says.
Production is due to begin in January.</TE>

<LD>* Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, "The Last DJ," Warner Bros. Petty
has always seemed to have more in common with Joe Rock Fan than the
larger-than-life stars with whom he shares Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
membership. It's no surprise, then, that the anger, frustration and
sadness over the state-of-the-rock-union in this loosely thematic
album reflect the view of the disheartened classic-rock fan more than
that of the jaundiced rock star. The album works on a number of
levels, but the ambition behind the songs and the off-the-cuff
production don't slap you in the face. Petty brings a disarming,
regular-guy passion to his treatise, invoking many of his '60s and
'70s rock heroes along the way.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: "The Son's Room" is heartbreaking and not. It is a
measured, decorous, at times pat film that manages to be quietly
moving because it touches on something real. Nanni Moretti, known in
Italy for puckish investigations of modern life, not only directed
this quite different film, he also co-wrote, co-produced and stars as
well. Moretti plays a contented paterfamilias, thoroughly involved
with his wife (Laura Morante), and their two teenage children. Then,
typically unexpectedly, the worst thing that can happen to a family
happens to Giovanni's: a tragedy takes place, and in its somber,
unhurried way, "The Son's Room" offers an affecting sense of how that
would be.</LD>

<HD>Piano Sphere Has New Zip in 9th-Season Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The adventurous Piano Sphere series opened its ninth season Tuesday
in a new location: Zipper Concert Hall at the Colburn School of
Performing Arts in downtown Los Angeles. The series moved from its
home at the Neighborhood Church in Pasadena, founder Leonard Stein
said before the program, because Zipper provided a stage and a piano.
"We always had to rent a piano before," he said.</LD>
<LD>   For the opening recital, Gloria Cheng played a typically
challenging and imaginative program, and she played it with typical
sensitivity and virtuosity.</LD>
<LD>   All of the eight works, which included a U.S. premiere by Magnus
Lindberg, bore a title or a subtitle, evoking certain intentions
whether of mood or structure.</LD>
<TE>   Toru Takemitsu's "Far Away," Melissa Hui's "When soft voices die"
and Henri Dutilleux' "Resonances," as well as the subtitles of his
Three Preludes, such as "D'ombre et de silence" (Of Shadow and
Silence), fulfilled those expectations. But in distinct ways:
Takemitsu, through impressionism; Hui, through emotional compression;
Dutilleux, through investigation of the instrument's sonorities.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Lindberg's Etude proved to be the expected technical
tour de force. His "Six Jubilees," receiving a West Coast premiere,
could easily be heard as variations on the trajectories of fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   With its recurring motives of low-lying tremolos and high-pitched
falling sighs, "Seven Mirrors" by Cambodian American composer Chinary
Ung was the program's thorniest, most intense work.</TE>
<TE>   The seven section titles included "Roar, Lion of the Heart" and
"Tatooing Space-Time." A UC San Diego faculty member, Ung was in the
audience to hear the enthusiastic reception of his work.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng's most individual moment perhaps came in her spacious,
poised realization of Earle Brown's "Four Systems," where the
untraditional notation mandates the performer's interpretation for
every element of pitch, duration and dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   For her encore, Cheng played Variation 5 from the supplement to
Schumann's Opus 13 Etudes.</TE>

<HD>Garage Rockers With a Lot of Soul</HD>
<DH>The Detroit Cobras want to hear favorite oldies, so that's
what they play-- with souped-up intensity that's winning raves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Motor City is White-Stripes hot right now, and scores of suddenly
in-demand musicians there are channeling the sonic chaos of the
Stooges and the MC5. The Detroit Cobras' punk-soul music is no
exception, but its emotional radar is fixed on the South. They're
pouring punk energy into the work of such stars as New Orleans soul
queen Irma Thomas and pioneering L.A. folk-pop singer-songwriter
Jackie DeShannon.</LD>
<LD>   "We really love sounds like that," says Cobras guitarist Maribel
Restrepo. Adds vocalist Rachael Nagy, "And we don't get to hear it
unless it's coming out of our record players."</LD>
<LD>   Or out of their own instruments. At the moment, the Stripes and
their New York counterparts the Strokes are making a big pop-culture
splash with new songs born out of the old garage-rock impulse. The
lower-profile Cobras, who will perform two local gigs this week,
don't play originals (yet). But their revved-up takes on old soul and
rock 'n' roll have pricked up some critical ears.</LD>
<TE>   The quintet's 2001 sophomore album, "Life, Love and
Leaving"--released by Long Beach-based Sympathy for the Record
Industry, former indie home of the White Stripes--scored a modest
berth in last year's Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. The
group's taut yet furiously freewheeling live performances have
garnered rave reviews, particularly for former butcher and exotic
dancer Nagy's takes--by turns seductive, brash and torchy--on such
classics as DeShannon's "He Did It," Mary Wells' "Bye Bye Baby," and
Otis Redding's "Shout Bama Lama."</TE>
<TE>   Nagy and Restrepo are the heart of the 6-year-old group, whose
lineup changes almost daily. It often includes Black Crowes pianist
(playing bass) Eddie Hawrysch, and currently includes drummer Ken
Tudrick and touring guitarist Dan Maister.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic-to-extremes pair has such passion for and
understanding of the old stuff, one would think Nagy and Restrepo
could easily distill its essence into their own songs. Yet they seem
reluctant to write their own tunes. "We don't have to worry about
writing the originals till this is really big," Restrepo says with a
throaty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The group recorded more outside material for an EP to be released
later this year by Rough Trade in the U.K., Restrepo says. It also
plans to start on a third album, maybe including its own material,
after completing this West Coast tour.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly, the women think it's impossible to improve on the old
songs, to say nothing of the performances. "We're all a bunch of
burnt-out punk rockers," Nagy says of the group's approach. "It's a
filter. There are certain little things we try to do, but we're not
brainstorming on how to make our mark." Compared with someone like
Irma Thomas, Nagy says, "we don't have that natural thing, where it
just oozes out of you. These women just sing so effortlessly. It's
their soul bleeding all over you." She sighs blissfully.</TE>
<TE>   No 'Whiny' Lyrics</TE>
<TE>   The rambunctious duo prefers attitude mixed with suffering rather
than "whiny woman stuff," as Restrepo puts it. Modern love songs,
Nagy adds, are just too obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "In some songs, you know these people just met, and they're going,
'Oh, baby, I love you so much.' And it's like, whaaat?" says the
singer. "In the soul stuff, these people have probably been fightin'
and lovin' for 10 years. They can't get each other out of their hair,
and they're always gonna be tied together."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit bands have been getting more notice from record executives
as well as journalists, but Restrepo says the attention hasn't had a
huge effect on the Motor City's diverse, insular and decidedly
noncommercial rock scene.</TE>
<TE>   "The weirdest thing is stuff like Seymour Stein coming in,"
Restrepo says, referring to the Sire Records mogul who signed such
'70s punk acts as the Ramones and Blondie. The Warner Bros. exec has
been scouting the area. Reaction among her peers has been mixed, she
says. "Half the people are sort of suspicious, and the other half are
secretly enjoying it." Restrepo says, laughing sardonically. "And the
other half is going, 'Who is Seymour Stein?' "</TE>
<TE>   If people outside their hometown ask the same about the Detroit
Cobras, Restrepo and Nagy are OK with that. Even now they don't spend
much time dwelling on their mainstream potential. But recent
experiences have surprised them.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that I knew most of the people at the shows, and
they were hipsters or whatever," Nagy says. "Now, normal people are
buying the record. They come in raving about the music. I'm
pessimistic about it, and this isn't me fishing [for a compliment], I
swear."</TE>

<HD>DJ Spinna Gets the Anniversary Party Started for
Firecracker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sterling</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after it lighted a fire under the historically segregated
Los Angeles club scene by mixing music styles to match a
poly-glamorous crowd of clued-in artists, scenesters and hard-core
club heads, twice-monthly club Firecracker can still bring the heat.
This Friday's anniversary soiree will be a sizzler, with an exclusive
(and rare) West Coast appearance by New York music master DJ Spinna.</LD>
<LD>   Spinna's signature is his uncanny ability to move crowds with
gritty hip-hop beats and soulful deep-house dance grooves. He's been
making noise with special themed sets like his "Wonderful" parties,
devoted entirely to the music of Stevie Wonder. But it's his newer
"Soul Slamm" set that he'll be showcasing tonight, which is a
rollicking battle between Prince and Michael Jackson. This will be

<LD>BBQ Venture: Leonard Schwartz has left Maple Drive after 13 years as
executive chef and founding partner. He's being replaced by Jeff
Perlman, who most recently worked at the now-defunct Restaurant Muse.
Perlman will keep such Schwartz classics as the meatloaf and the
chili but plans to add his own touches. As for Schwartz, he's joined
Michael Rosen, the former executive chef at Reign, and two players in
the prime beef arena, Ron and Kirk Gelsinger, to create Zek's
Smokehouse, planned as a chain of family-style barbecue restaurants.
The first will open in Montrose on Nov. 1.</LD>

new executive chef, Quinn Hatfield. He was sous-chef at Spago
Hollywood and chef de partie at the Beverly Hills Spago before
heading off to New York to spend four years as a sous-chef at both
Bouley and Jean Georges. For the next month he'll be trying out
specials that will evolve into a new menu by mid-November. They'll
include baked salmon with apple-stuffed endive dressed in hazelnut
vinaigrette, and a date- and mint-crusted rack of lamb served with
chive potatoes and baby glazed vegetables.</LD>

<HD>Festival Makes Strong Case for Cinema From South Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years the South Koreans, like the Taiwanese and the
Iranians, have produced some of the most challenging and provocative
films being made anywhere in the world. Consequently, the UCLA Film
Archive's Seoul Cinema is an important event, presented with the
Korean Cultural Center at the James Bridges Theater in UCLA's Melnitz
Hall tonight at 7:30 p.m. through Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the opening attraction, Song Il-gon's "Flower
Island" is heavy going, especially for the uninitiated. The other
three films screening over the weekend more than make up for it.</LD>
<LD>   As for "Flower Island," Song, who will appear at the screening,
piles on the grief right from the first frame. He introduces us to
three women whose lives have taken horrific turns and who meet each
other as they proceed to get away from it all, if only briefly, for
vacations along the Southern Sea. They wind up instead in
snow-covered mountains, and the film charts their fairly standard
experiences as they make their way to a mythical island where they
can heal. This is one journey that's hard to go along with.</LD>
<TE>   That's happily not the case with Park Ki-young's "Camel(s)," which
screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Park is a master of maximum impact
though minimal means and makes full use of the camera's resources as
he records a woman (Park Myung-shin) picked up at an airport outside
the port city of Wilgot by a man (Lee Dae-yeon) she has never before
met but has clearly arranged to meet. They are in their late 30s,
both in long-term arranged marriages, and they speak of themselves
forthrightly but not confidentially during their brief rendezvous.
What goes unexpressed does not go unfelt, however, and as this
intensely cinematic film unfolds, it leaves the feeling that their
emotional reserve is a way of protecting each other's feelings in a
relationship that may never get a chance to go any further.</TE>
<TE>   "Camel(s)" will be followed by Im Soon-rye's ingratiating,
bittersweet and often ruefully funny "Waikiki Brothers," in which a
faltering rock band heads to the hometown of its lead singer and
guitarist Sungwoo (Lee Uhl), the faded resort Suanbo, for a last
stand at the local hotel that gave the group its name. Sungwoo
apparently has no family left in the town he hasn't visited in 15
years, and discovers that the friends he left behind have not fared
so well; indeed their stories reflect the wrenching changes South
Korea has experienced in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   As the Suanbo gig starts coming apart, Sungwoo inevitably
encounters his first and unrequited love, In Hee (Oh Jee-hae), a
strong rock 'n' roll singer in high school but now a widow supporting
herself by peddling vegetables from a truck. "Now that you're a man
you're not bad for a date," she says to Sungwoo, who is hesitant to
chance getting his heart broken all over again. By the time this
delightful and perceptive film is over, director Im Soon-rye reveals
she understands men very well indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the recent upheavals in South Korea more seriously is
Lee Chang-dong's electrifying "Peppermint Candy" (Sunday at 7 p.m.).
Seol Kyeong-ku, in a stunning portrayal, stars as Yeong Ho, a
ravaged-looking 40-year-old man inappropriately dressed in a suit and
tie for a country picnic, a 20th reunion of a group of small-town
factory workers. The celebrants try not to notice Yeong Ho's
increasingly erratic behavior, which at its climactic point triggers
a series of seven flashbacks spanning 20 years, in which the man's
disintegration mirrors his country's turbulent and repressive
political and industrial history. Lee, who wrote the landmark "A
Single Spark," a broadside against the brutality and corruption in
Korean society, suggests that Yeong Ho is no less responsible for his
fate.</TE>
<TE>   Yeong Ho's curse is that he is too questioning for his humble
station in life as he progresses from sensitive rural youth through a
savage rite of passage in the military that leaves him ripe to become
a violent cop and then a no-holds-barred entrepreneur. Familiarity
with recent Korean history is undeniably a plus, but this bravura
film connects on a timeless personal level, exemplifying why South
Korean cinema at its best generates has generated so much interest.

<TE>   Outstanding documentarian Arthur Dong, whose "Coming Out Under
Fire," recounted the experiences of nine gay soldiers serving in
World War II, and whose "License to Kill" was composed of interviews
with murderers of gay men, continues his exploration of gay life in
America with "Family Fundamentals," which explores the ultimately
unbridgeable chasm between Christian fundamentalist parents and their
gay children.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Bremmer has responded to her daughter and grandson's
homosexuality by becoming a fervent anti-gay activist. Former U.S.
Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a vociferous opponent of gay
rights, has become estranged from his onetime campaign manager and
legislative aide Brian Bennett, whom he had long considered a son,
since Bennett came out. Brian Matthews, an Air Force first lieutenant
who, though honorably discharged, was ultimately stripped of his
top-secret security clearance and all his veteran's benefits, decides
to attend his grandmother's remarriage in an attempt to bridge a
long-standing gap between himself and his father, a Mormon bishop,
and his mother, who believe their son has fallen into Satan's hands.</TE>
<TE>   For gays, "Family Fundamentals" can hold no surprises. Yet the
film is as important and revealing as it is inevitably emotionally
wrenching. First, it reveals how hatred of gays has spread through
ceaseless Internet-age campaigning by the highly organized religious
right to create the climate, indeed, give "permission," as Bremmer's
daughter Nancy says, for gay bashers to commit the kind of gruesome
hate crimes that claimed the life of Mathew Shepard.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the film reveals just how strong many gays, lesbians,
bisexuals and transgendered people have to be to survive in this
society. At Laemmle's Music Hall in Beverly Hills. (310) 274-6869.</TE>

<TE>   The MAK Center for Art and Architecture at the Schindler House and

retrospective of the films of major avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth
Anger. It begins at USC tonight at 7 p.m., and continues Saturday and
Sunday at 8 p.m. at Schindler House, 835 N. Kings Road, West
Hollywood, with a program highlighted by the local premiere of "The
Man We Want to Hang" (2002), a homage to British occult master
Aleister Crowley. USC: (213) 740-3334; Schindler House: (323)

<TE>   One of the staples of the old Kokusai Theater on Crenshaw
Boulevard was the Zatoichi series, featuring the lively adventures of
a blind swordsman, played by the late Shintaro Katsu, a burly man
whose physical presence belied his sensitivity and range. The late
Raizo Ichikawa, Katsu's physical opposite, was a similarly gifted
actor, best remembered for "Band of Assassins."</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque will present a rare opportunity to see
their work when it presents, with the Japan Foundation, A
Double-Edged Sword: The Films of Shintaro Katsu and Raizo Ichikawa,

Donald Crisp, is befriended by Richard Barthelmess' gentle young
Chinese. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<LD>When breast cancer hits women under age 40, it hits them hard.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why it is surprising that Lifetime takes such a soft
approach to the subject in its documentary, "Fighting for Our Future"
(at 7 tonight).</LD>
<LD>   While it is a shock to see such fresh, young faces talking about
mastectomies and metastases, the documentary seems to avoid the
really gritty side of breast cancer in young women. It instead opts
for a theme of hope, while acknowledging the need for more research
and treatments tailored to young women.</LD>
<TE>   We need cold, hard facts if we are to muster the indignation the
documentary seems to be trying to elicit in its viewers.</TE>
<TE>   We are told about the dearth of screening techniques (mammography
isn't very effective for young women) and treatment options
(chemotherapy puts 40% of them into premature menopause), and the
ominous futures for those who have been diagnosed--usually too late.
But it is all talk when the images we see are of young women with the
disease marrying, having babies, kickboxing, river-rafting and
marching in rallies.</TE>
<TE>   The real picture of a young woman with breast cancer might be
closer to that inscribed in my memory, of an acquaintance diagnosed
at 34 and dead at 36 after terrible suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Give it to us straight, Lifetime. We can take it.</TE>

<HD>It's Scream Season</HD>
<DH>Southern California theme parks are welcoming visitors for
Halloween with some frights old and new.</DH>

<LD>The monsters are restless.</LD>
<LD>   After last year's somber post-Sept. 11 Halloween, the monsters at
Knott's Berry Farm are itching to scare the screams out of visitors
to Knott's 30th Halloween Haunt, which started Oct. 3. "Last year,
with 9/11, the crowd was very subdued," said Craig Harreld, a Knott's
manager and 19-year veteran of Halloween Haunt.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this year, people are going to want more of an escape,"
Harreld suggested. "People were uptight, and now they are going to
look for that release. And this is a way for them to release it." And
it's not just the crowd that's ready to let loose. "This is a way for
the talent to release, too--to scare people and get those emotions
and screams and yells and everything out."</LD>
<TE>   Knott's monsters are experts at fright therapy. Talk to Harreld, a
former monster who now supervises them, and prepare for an education
in the dark art of spooking. He spices his conversation with lingo
like "sliders" (the monsters who pop up out of nowhere to startle
you) and "ping-pong effect" (two monsters working opposite sides of
the street, bouncing frightened visitors back and forth between
them). "A lot of our guys are veterans. They know how to pick out
people, how to scope out the right ones" to scare, Harreld said. "The
easiest target is the woman clinging to the boyfriend's arm. But
everyone is a target. Everyone is fair game.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are supposed to be the macho type. But we find that's
not true. We find that large groups of guys that are out there to
have a fun evening, they get scared just as easy as the girls.</TE>
<TE>   "You go down to Ghost Town and, the way they've got the lighting,
with the blues and the reds and the yellows and the fog, you just
don't know what's gonna jump out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Knott's visitors might be even more surprised to discover what
all those monsters do when they aren't scaring people. Turns out that
many of them are not just regular theme park employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are emergency nurses at hospitals. We've got some
lawyers--even a couple of police officers," Harreld said, ticking off
a list of his monsters' day jobs. "We even have a guy who is a
professional stand-up comedian." Whatever their backgrounds,
Harreld's crew gets together each October to make life as deliciously
miserable as possible for the tens of thousands of people who attend
Halloween Haunt.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one group that Harreld doesn't want to see at this
year's Halloween Haunt--little kids. Knott's recommends that no one
under 13 attend. "There's some pretty heavy stuff in there:
decapitations, blood and guts and gore," Harreld warned. "There's one
disembowelment, where blood's coming out of the stomach. I don't
think kids should really be seeing that kind of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Parents looking for Halloween entertainment can find less gory
options at local theme parks. Knott's, for instance, offers Camp
Spooky during its regular daytime operating hours, with not-so-scary
mazes and children's costume contests. And Legoland California will
again offer its annual Brick-or-Treat, with Halloween-themed shows,
Lego creations and a suburban cul-de-sac of scaled-down homes where
kids can trick or treat.</TE>
<TE>   But the best single Halloween attraction at local theme parks is
at Disneyland, where Haunted Mansion Holiday returns for a second
year. Disney has revamped its classic Haunted Mansion attraction with
scenes and characters from Tim Burton's film "Nightmare Before
Christmas." The overlay of the new characters into the old attraction
is seamless, creating a wonderful experience that should delight all
but the most sensitive little ones.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Disney has also added a new musical soundtrack from the
film's composer, Danny Elfman, something that was missing from last
year's otherwise top-notch version of the mansion. Now all the
elements are in place for a complete screamfest.</TE>

<HD>An Even More Radiant 'Beauty'</HD>
<DH>The elegant restoration of Cocteau's romantic classic is as
close to pristine as we're likely to see</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been 10 years since Jean Cocteau's transporting 1946 "Beauty and
the Beast," as romantic a film as has ever been made, played
theatrically in Los Angeles, and a lot has happened to it in the
intervening decade, all of it good.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, as part of France's celebration of the 100th anniversary
of cinema, the film underwent a comprehensive restoration. Its
original nitrate negative was painstakingly cleaned, sprocket holes
were repaired, and missing frames--150 from 49 places in the
film--were replaced.</LD>
<LD>   The rejuvenated print that resulted debuts Friday for a one-week
engagement at the Nuart in West Los Angeles. If you've never seen
this timeless, magical motion picture, there couldn't be a better
opportunity. If you know the film well, you won't need any special
encouragement to see it in a version closer than anyone has a right
to expect to the way it looked more than half a century ago.</LD>
<TE>   Although this "Beauty" has newer, more accurate subtitles ("May
the devil himself spatter you with dung" is a particularly pungent
example), the prime lure is the way the print underlines the film's
incredible richness of atmosphere. Cinematographer Henri Alekan's
images are simple but crystalline, and the film's numerous
heart-stopping moments, like the magical way white curtains billow in
the wind, stand out even more.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, the
story begins with Beauty (the lovely Josette Day) scrubbing floors in
Cinderella fashion while her snobbish older sisters terrorize the
neighborhood. Beauty has a suitor, but she is hesitant about leaving
her penniless father, a merchant whose ships have a habit of not
coming in.</TE>
<TE>   Returning from yet another fruitless journey, Beauty's father
comes across an enchanted castle deep in the forest. He stays the
night without seeing anyone, but when he stops to pick a rose for
Beauty, the magnificent Beast appears. "You may take anything but my
roses," he announces with the magisterial clarity that characterizes
Cocteau's script. "For this you must die."</TE>
<TE>   Jean Marais, a lover and protege of Cocteau's, plays the Beast as
a figure of enormous dignity. Richly dressed and with an extremely
realistic leonine face (created by Christian Berard and requiring
hours to apply), the Beast is a picture of self-command and ironic
self-knowledge. "Don't call me 'Sir,' " he says to the stunned
merchant. "I am called the Beast. I do not like compliments."</TE>
<TE>   Once Beauty takes her father's place at the castle, we see a
different Beast, an ogre with a soul, crueler to himself than to
humans and with a somber, heartbreaking voice that Cocteau described
as that of "a monster in pain." Tortured by a compulsion to kill that
leaves his hands literally smoking, the Beast is sensitive enough to
be capable of dying of a broken heart if Beauty, off to visit her
dying father, does not return at the appointed hour.</TE>
<TE>   Making Cocteau's success with this material even more remarkable
is that "Beauty" was filmed under extremely trying conditions. As
detailed in Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast: Diary of a Film"
(available in English translation from Dover Books), the obstacles
the production had to overcome were formidable. These included an
agonizing combination of flu, burns from the arc lights, and skin
problems that put the director in Paris' Pasteur Institute for a week
feeling "as though my neck were being sawn through with a blunt saw."</TE>
<TE>   Always playful, Cocteau cast Marais as not only the Beast but also
Beauty's suitor, Avenant, and even the Prince who magically appears
in the Beast's place at the close, when it becomes immediately
apparent that Beauty misses her more savage suitor. In this she was
not alone. Greta Garbo's reaction to the finale, or so the story
goes, was equally simple and to the point: "Give me back my Beast,"
she exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jean Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast" plays exclusively at the
Nuart Theater, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310)
478-6379, for a one-week run Friday through Oct. 18.</TE>

<HD>A Three-Course 'Beast'</HD>
<DH>Three versions of the studio's 1991 Oscar nominee are
included in a special edition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new special-edition DVD of Disney's 1991 animated film "Beauty
and the Beast" ($30) actually features three versions of the
enchanting adaptation of the classic fairy tale--the only animated
film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar.</LD>
<LD>   Included are the original theatrical release, a work-in-progress
edition that was shown at the 1991 New York Film Festival and a
special edition that was released earlier this year in the Imax
format.</LD>
<LD>   The latter boasts a song, "Human Again," that was conceived for
the original film but never animated. It was subsequently introduced
in the Broadway stage version.</LD>
<TE>   The special edition of the film has been digitally restored frame
by frame and looks glorious. It is also available on VHS ($25).</TE>
<TE>   Chris Carrey, senior vice president of DVD production and
worldwide technical services for Buena Vista Home Entertainment, says
that "Beauty and the Beast" is the most elaborate DVD the company has
produced.</TE>
<TE>   Disc 1 includes all three versions of the film and informative
commentary from the filmmakers--directors Kirk Wise and Gary
Trousdale, producer Don Hahn, and Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken.
There is also a sing-along track and a game in which players look for
a secret code that allows them to play another game on Disc 2.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc is divided into three sections: "Mrs. Potts'
Engaging Treats: Fun for All Ages," which includes a look at the
stories behind classic Disney movies, a "making of" featurette with
Celine Dion as host, a featurette on the "Beauty and the Beast"
Broadway production, and several games. "Cogsworth and Lumiere's
Library" is for the film buff and is filled with such goodies as the
early presentation reel, a wonderful alternate version of "Be Our
Guest," a look at the various designs for Beauty and the Beast, and
character art galleries. "Chip's Fun and Games--For the Young at
Heart" offers an MTV-ish tour of Disney's animation studios, as well
as "Chip's Musical Challenge Game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The theatrical version of the classic animated TV series
"Scooby-Doo" may have brought in big bucks at the box office this
summer, but there is no camouflaging the fact that the movie is a
dog. Silly and often tasteless, the film also is thwarted by having a
computer-generated Scooby-Doo. The only saving grace is Matthew
Lillard as Scooby's hippy-dippy friend, Shaggy. Freddie Prinze Jr.,
with a horrible blond hairdo, and his wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar,
also star.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Warner, $27) is available in either the wide-screen or
pan-and-scan version. It offers a behind-the-scenes featurette,
deleted scenes (including a fun animated opening with commentary by
director Raja Gosnell), games, a music video, mindless commentary
with the stars and another track with the director, and seven
challenging DVD-ROM games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New on DVD from Warner Home Video are two MGM classics from
Hollywood's golden age: "The Thin Man" and "The Shop Around the
Corner" ($20 each).</TE>
<TE>   Produced in 1934, "The Thin Man" is a sophisticated souffle based
on the Dashiell Hammett thriller. It boasts crackling dialogue and
perfect performances from William Powell and Myrna Loy as the married
sleuths, Nick and Nora Charles. The film was so popular it spawned a
long, successful series of sequels. Asta the dog also stars. The DVD
transfer is crisp; the disc includes the trailers for all the "Thin
Man" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst Lubitsch directed the 1940 romantic comedy "The Shop Around
the Corner," starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as two
squabbling store clerks who don't realize they are pen pals. This
absolutely magical film was remade as "In the Good Old Summertime"
and "You've Got Mail," and turned into the Broadway musical "She
Loves Me." The DVD features a beautiful transfer, trailers from the
three versions and a 1940 MGM short.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey, baby. The collector's edition DVD of the comedy "Swingers"
(Miramax, $20) is money. Written by and starring Jon Favreau and
directed by Doug Liman, "Swingers" follows a group of struggling
actors in Los Angeles who spend their nights looking for love and
hanging out at cool nightclubs that specialize in swing music.</TE>
<TE>   Loosely autobiographical, "Swingers" also stars Favreau's friends
Vince Vaughn, Patrick Van Horn and Ron Livingston. The disc features
an original documentary on the making of the film, deleted scenes,
commentary from Liman, very funny and R-rated commentary from Favreau
and Vaughn, and the acclaimed spoof "Swing Blade."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Image's two-disc set "D.W. Griffith--Years of Discovery 1909-1913"
(Image, $40) is manna from heaven for any serious student of film.</TE>
<TE>   During his years at Biograph, Griffith made some 450 films--either
one or two reels (a reel translates to 10 minutes) at the rate of two
or three a week. These short films gave Griffith the opportunity to
experiment with storytelling and camera techniques, which he used in
feature films such as "The Birth of a Nation" and "Intolerance."
These early films also featured actors Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Mary
Pickford, Mack Sennett (who later operated his own comedy studio),
Lionel Barrymore and Henry Walthall.</TE>
<TE>   The set includes such seminal Griffith shorts as "The Musketeers
of Pig Alley," "The New York Hat" and "A Corner in Wheat." Digitally
restored, the discs also feature low-key but well-researched
commentary from film historian Russell Merritt.</TE>

<HD>Hartke Finds Medieval Links in Modern Compositions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Count Stephen Hartke as one Los Angeles composer whose music is too
rarely heard in his hometown. It was a treat, then, to get a
three-pack of Hartke's chamber music, in honor of his 50th birthday,
at USC's Newman Recital Hall on Tuesday. Hartke has been teaching at
USC since 1987, and members of the USC Thornton School's Contemporary
Music Ensemble gave an avid, involving performance.</LD>
<LD>   As heard here, he can pack a lot into a small space, and
gracefully. Hartke draws on a wide, sometimes pleasantly bewildering
range of ideas and sources, but the result is a coherently voiced
rather than shallow postmodern ransacking. Clearly contemporary, with
a questioning spirit and harmonic puzzles, his music can also convey
the cool, objective air of medieval music.</LD>
<LD>   "The Horse With the Lavender Eyes," for clarinet, violin and
piano, artfully incorporates conceptual tricks such as a movement
played with only left hands. In the movement "Cancel My Rumba
Lesson," a title filched from R. Crumb, an insistent, fractured
rhythm yields to a sad, tender finale. "The King of the Sun,"
commissioned by the Los Angeles Piano Quartet, wonderfully balances
its five elliptical and atmospheric movements with a slippery
emotional core.</LD>
<TE>   After intermission, "Wulfstan at the Millennium" contained the
evening's most intimate and directly emotional content. Here, Hartke
takes his medieval intrigue further, with music that directly, and
disarmingly, links medieval and contemporary writing. The millennium
of the title refers to 1000, not 2000, and Hartke follows a
quasi-liturgical form, neither exactly faithful nor heretical, but
teeming with a strange and delicate beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Things tend to happen, and attitudes tend to shift with little
notice, in Hartke's work. Serious music, he suggests, doesn't
preclude playfulness.</TE>

<HD>New West Starts Off With a French Program</HD>

<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That moment when the New West Symphony strikes up the band for a new
season is always an important juncture on the Ventura County
calendar. This weekend, conductor Boris Brott will lead the opening
program of the season, in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Dynamic pianist Christopher O'Riley is no stranger to the area,
having been a crowd-pleaser at more than one Ventura Chamber Music
Festival. The all-French program is a refreshing deviation from the
norm, its only concession to convention being Ravel's "Bolero," an
agreeable chestnut. O'Riley will perform on Ravel's Concerto (for
left hand only) in D, and Ravel's jazzy Concerto in G, with the
orchestra stretching out on Debussy's "La Mer."</LD>
<LD>   * New West Symphony, with pianist Christopher O'Riley, Friday, 8
p.m.,  Oxnard Performing Arts Center, 800 Hobson Way, and Saturday, 8
p.m., Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd. $8 to
$67; (800) NEW-WEST.</LD>
<TE>   In-House Art: The annual faculty exhibition currently in the two
Ventura College galleries is dedicated to the late Mary Michel, long
an important figure on the local art scene. Several of her delicate,
less-is-more print works are on display, as are two photographic
portraits of the artist: William Hendricks' intimate black-and-white
close-up and Donna Granata's broader color image, with the artist's
work behind her.</TE>
<TE>   The show, like the faculty, is varied, sometimes even among
specific artists. Carlisle Cooper, for example, is represented both
by a neat 1961 realist portrait of Heber G. Williams, most unlike his
characteristic style, while, in a newer piece called "Dictator's
Speech," the sense of figure is almost indiscernible for the
overheated rhetoric of paint and words.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Orr's "Old Mill Building" gains strength from its
Precisionist-like mesh of lines, while Connie Jenkins' "In the Azalea
Woods" is a dizzy photo-realist depiction of leafage and dappling
shadows. Bob Moskowitz's big, odd "Rage in Malibu" finds veteran
show-biz types mugging and romping in the sand, and Debra McKillop's
"Night on Earth" heeds her interest in sequential logic with its
measured array of suspended paper pieces. Vive la difference.</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura College faculty exhibition, through Oct. 18, Ventura
College galleries, 4667 Telegraph Road. Call gallery for hours: (805)
648-8974.</TE>
<TE>   Bard off the Wagon: At some point in the deliciously tipsy play
"Barrymore," actor Ronald Rezac bellows the line "My kingdom for a
line," with his telling, crooked smirk. There's the rub: It's a
crafty, funny and sad play, taking place in a New York theater one
night in 1942, about the twilight of an icon as he rehearses with a
prompter in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Taken from John Barrymore's true story, it expands on the actor's
plan to reprise "Richard III" and so revive his withered reputation.
But he's too far gone to pull it off, and instead blathers on about
his illustrious and notorious past, his insecurities and scattershot
snippets of Shakespeare--as much from "Hamlet" as "Richard
III"--along a booze-lined and frequently witty path.</TE>
<TE>   Rezac, alone, is reason enough to catch the production. He's a
winning force, at once pathetic and bolstered by stubborn charm, in
the role that won a Tony for Christopher Plummer on Broadway. The
egotistical meanderings of infamous legends can make for good theater
and good scuttlebutt, as it does here and in the Maria Callas bio
play "Master Class" (which began in Santa Paula and is now at Simi
Valley Cultural Center through Oct. 20).</TE>
<TE>   * "Barrymore," Santa Paula Theater Center, 125 S. 7th St., Santa
Paula. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., and Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Ends
Oct. 20. $15 general, $12 senior citizens and students; $10 children
12 and younger. (805) 525-4645.</TE>
<TE>   "Master Class," Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, 3050 Los Angeles
Ave. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Oct. 20.

<HD>ABC Drops Two New Shows From Its Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES and BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC's campaign to recapture viewers was dealt a blow Wednesday when
dismal ratings forced the network to cancel two new dramas: "That Was
Then" and the heavily promoted interactive mystery "Push, Nevada."</LD>
<LD>   The cancellations, confirmed by industry sources, would be the
first of the new television season. ABC declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   Although it's not unusual for a network to pull the plug on a
poorly performing show just three weeks into a new season, the
cancellations are especially notable for ABC, a unit of Walt Disney
Co. Disney executives concede that this was supposed to be the lineup
that would help ABC turn around its ratings slide.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the network and Disney's Touchstone Television are
falling short on the drama front. Its third entry, a medical drama
called "MDs," is on life support.</TE>
<TE>   The cast of "That Was Then"--which drew disappointing ratings in
two Friday night airings--learned about the cancellation Tuesday
night. They returned to the set Wednesday to finish filming the
eighth episode, even though it's not expected to air.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed that the show is ending, but it wasn't meant to
be," said James Bulliard, the star of the show about a 30-year-old
man who travels back in time to high school. "But I had the time of
my life doing it.... It was just an amazing experience."</TE>
<TE>   Bulliard, 24, won the role in February, just two weeks after
moving to Los Angeles from Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the town," he
said late Wednesday after wrapping up shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite ABC executives' vows to be patient with new shows and
allow them to catch on with viewers, they apparently couldn't
tolerate the steep drop off in viewers of "Push"--the series from
actor Ben Affleck's production company, LivePlanet--and its failure
to attract its targeted audience of young male viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Canceling "Push, Nevada" is problematic, however, since the series
about an Internal Revenue Service agent looking for lost loot
incorporated an interactive component offering viewers the chance to
win more than $1 million by watching and following the clues.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is obligated to hand out the money, meaning the network must
play the show at least one more time to insert a "master clue" that
will provide enough information for someone to solve the mystery and
claim the prize.</TE>
<TE>   "Push" drew an audience of about 12 million viewers for its Sept.
17 preview, according to Nielsen Media Research estimates. But after
the show moved to its Thursday night slot, its ratings plummeted by
nearly two-thirds in competing against CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" and NBC's "Will &amp; Grace." CBS is a unit of Viacom Inc.
and NBC is a division of General Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   ABC finished third overall last week in prime time among adults
ages 18 to 49, the demographic that is most important to media
buyers, behind NBC and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers, however, remain cautiously optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for "Monday Night Football," have been strong. ABC has
found success on Tuesday night with ratings wins for "8 Simple Rules
for Dating My Teenage Daughter," starring John Ritter. The network
also is pleased with the new "Life With Bonnie," with Bonnie Hunt.
Last week ABC ordered a full season of both series.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC, while still having a number of problems, may have stopped
the bleeding," said Steve Sternberg, director of audience analysis
for advertising buying firm Magna Global USA.</TE>

<HD>5 Adelphia Execs to Help With Rigases Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID VOREACOS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Five Adelphia Communications Corp. executives are helping prosecutors
build a fraud case against indicted company founder John Rigas and
two of his sons, people familiar with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   The executives cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan are Karen Chrosniak, director of investor relations; Luke
Healy, regional budget coordinator; Doug Malone, director of external
reporting; Dean Marshall, director of finance; and Tim Worth,
director of accounting, people familiar with the case said.</LD>
<LD>   Some of these executives may face criminal charges, the people
said. None has been charged.</LD>
<TE>   Former Chairman John Rigas and two sons--Timothy, the former chief
financial officer, and Michael, former vice president of
operations--were indicted Sept. 23 on charges of hiding debt,
falsifying financial reports and concealing their use of company
funds to buy stock and build a golf course. They pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Two other executives, James Brown, former vice president for
finance, and Michael Mulcahey, former director of internal reporting,
also were indicted in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, the sixth-largest U.S. cable-television company, filed
for bankruptcy protection in June and has more than $20 billion of
debt.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC filed a civil lawsuit against Adelphia and the Rigases in
July, alleging that they engaged in "one of the most extensive
financial frauds ever to take place at a public company."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for the government to have eyewitness
participants," said Stephen Ryan, a former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement depends completely on their ability to find
someone who was in meetings and can talk about these events and say
what people said to one another," Ryan said.</TE>

<HD>Abbott Labs to Challenge Amgen With Free Drug</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The move marks the start of competition
for market dominated by rival's similar medication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abbott Laboratories said Wednesday that it will supply an
experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug free to patients who need it,
a direct challenge to Amgen Inc., which is laboring to end a shortage
of a similar medication.</LD>
<LD>   The move by Abbott marks the beginning of a high-stakes
competition for a multibillion-dollar market that is dominated by
Enbrel, the crown jewel in Amgen's purchase of Immunex last year.
However, sales of Enbrel have not grown since the $9.6-billion
acquisition because of a series of production snafus and a shortage
of manufacturing capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Abbott said it is prepared to supply the experimental drug to as
many as 5,000 patients in the United States by the end of this year,
or about one-quarter of the 23,000 people on Amgen's waiting list for
Enbrel.</LD>
<TE>   Abbott said it will continue to supply free medication to patients
until it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, probably by
April. Patients or their health insurance plans pay between $10,000
and $12,000 a year for Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott's action increases the pressure on Amgen to complete a
factory in Rhode Island dedicated to Enbrel production. Amgen has
said that it expects to receive FDA approval to operate the plant in
the first quarter of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Craig West, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said Amgen
must do everything right in 2003 in order to reach its Enbrel sales
target of $1.2 billion. To make that number, he said, Amgen must have
125,000 patients on Enbrel by the end of next year, up from 79,000 in
June.</TE>
<TE>   An Amgen spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott's drug, D2E7, is considered as effective as Enbrel but is
expected to be more convenient to use. Patients must inject Enbrel
twice weekly, but in clinical trials patients used D2E7 twice
monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott is offering the drug to patients through an "open access"
clinical trial approved by the FDA. The company expects to begin
providing the drug to patients next week, Steven Fischkoff, global
clinical director for D2E7, said in an interview. Since announcing
the program to the medical community last week, Abbott has received
inquiries from 300 doctors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott's shares closed at $40.30, up 83 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange, and Amgen shares fell 17 cents to $45.62 on Nasdaq.
Abbott also announced Wednesday a restructuring that includes
elimination of 3% of its work force.</TE>

<HD>Automakers' Stocks Hammered Again</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Concerns about consumers, the economy and gas
prices have investors worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Automakers' stocks were hammered for a second day Wednesday amid
concerns about an expected decline in the auto market this year and
next, and uncertainties over consumers' purchasing power, the
economy, possible war with Iraq and potential instability in gasoline
prices.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the world's two
largest auto manufacturers, both fell 7.7% from Tuesday, when they
hit their lowest levels in nearly 10 years. GM closed Wednesday at
$31.01 and Ford at $7.15, while DaimlerChrysler closed down 6.4% at
$30.17.</LD>
<LD>   "You have a compounding set of uncertainty with respect to the
[possible] war, the overall economy," said David Cole, director of
the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. "You've got
uncertainties over what the election might portend. Wall Street hates
uncertainty and really doesn't know how to deal with it very well."</LD>
<TE>   Credit Suisse First Boston on Tuesday downgraded its target price
for Ford's stock to $10 from $20. In the bond market, speculation was
rife that Ford's credit rating might be cut below investment grade,
to "junk" status, even though the company said its financial picture
was solid.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley on Wednesday cut its 2003 earnings-per-share
forecast for the Big Three, lowering GM from $5.40 to $5, Ford from
55 cents to 45 cents and DaimlerChrysler from 3.40 euros to 3.30
euros.</TE>
<TE>   The last year has been marked by unprecedented incentives from the
automakers, including interest-free financing and generous rebates.</TE>
<TE>   Because the firms lose more money with higher incentives, there
has been concern on Wall Street that sales have been artificially
boosted at the expense of profitability and are unsustainable.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers "are charging their customers less, allowing them more
time to pay off the loan and allowing them to borrow more money
relative to the value of the vehicle," Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Girsky wrote in a report Tuesday. "All else being equal, the auto
companies may be taking on more risk to attract customers."</TE>
<TE>   But the no-interest loans and rebates aren't behind the stocks'
tumble this week and are not likely to lessen any time soon, said
David Littmann, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the market reaction] is more related to the likelihood
of a calendar year 2003 of 300,000 to 500,000 units below what this
year has been," Littmann said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. auto sales streaked to a record high 17.4 million in 2000 and
a second-best 17.1 million last year. Littmann sees 2002 coming in at
about 16.9 million, and 2003 sinking further to 16.6 million at most.</TE>
<TE>   But to Littmann it's the unsustainable boom in home mortgage
refinancing, brought on by historically low interest rates, that is
behind the turbulence in auto stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The frenzy of mortgage refinancing "is equivalent to a tax cut of
upward of $100 billion this year," he said. "The liquidity surge
we've seen all this calendar year simply won't be with us next year
to the same degree, and that I think is what is underscoring the
renewed uncertainty in the auto market."</TE>
<TE>   European and Asian auto stocks also slid Wednesday, but the Big
Three were the big losers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's concerns about a new recession, worry about the
price of gasoline skyrocketing if we get into a war with Iraq,
concern about the pension funding of the companies--all of it
overdone, I think," said Daniel Healy, auto analyst for Burnham
Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Marin, general sales manager at Gateway Chevrolet in La
Mirada, agrees that the worries are overdone.</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday that although he's heard all the negative
reports, he's not seen or heard anything from his customers to back
them up.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the prospect of a war in the Persian Gulf is stemming
what he called "a really good" stream of customers. "But we're a
Chevy dealer, and we have a largely middle-class customer base,"
Marin said. "I don't think that kind of stuff hurts the middle class.
It's the upper end, people with a lot of money in stocks and real
estate, who are affected first."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that he's not sure how long the car makers can
keep luring customers with costly incentives, but he added that "a
lot of times, all this stuff the economists and analysts are saying
turns out to be them talking to each other. They create situations
that unsettle people who are getting ready to go out and make a
purchase."</TE>

<HD>Blue Cross to Rate Doctors</HD>
<DH>Health: The insurer's plan would link bonuses to patient
satisfaction and quality of care. Some physicians have doubts about
efficacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue Cross of California, one of the nation's largest health
insurers, this fall will begin keeping a quality scorecard on
thousands of physicians and pay bonuses to those who meet high
standards of care.</LD>
<LD>   The incentive program, to be announced today, is part of a growing
movement nationally to hold health providers more accountable for the
quality as well as the cost of care. In recent years, almost all of
the quality focus has been on HMOs.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Cross initiative is an expansion of a bonus plan based on
patient satisfaction for HMO doctors that was launched last year. The
latest program is unusual in that it attempts to track the
performance of far more doctors, many of them in solo practice, and
to motivate them to follow the industry's best practices in the
treatment and preventive care of patients.</LD>
<TE>   The program will apply to many of the 43,000 California physicians
in Blue Cross' preferred provider organization, or PPO, which has
more than 4 million members--double the HMO enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   With about half of all insured Americans now enrolled in PPOs,
analysts said such incentive programs could have widespread
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to apply [quality measures] to the PPO side,
because there's a decided market shift to looser PPO networks as
opposed to a tightly managed, closed HMO network," said Peter Boland,
a health-care expert in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The scorecards initially will not be disclosed to consumers, and
the bonuses to doctors will be as much as $5,000 annually. Blue Cross
estimated it will spend $1.1 million to run the program over three
years. The company said it did not know how much it would pay out in
total bonuses, but said the money would not take away from existing
fees paid to physicians for medical services.</TE>
<TE>   Notices about the program, which is voluntary, will go out this
month to an initial group of 15,000 doctors. A spokesman for the
California Medical Assn. was critical of the program, saying it was a
marketing ploy aimed at attracting more members at a time of open
enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Other physicians and medical groups familiar with the program said
the reward amount may not be enough to stimulate significant change.
Others raised concerns that Blue Cross of California, which has had a
contentious relationship with physicians over inadequate payments,
may use the scorecards and reward program to extract lower
reimbursement rates for medical services.</TE>
<TE>   Several doctors and some big medical groups were cautiously
supportive of Blue Cross' plan, saying that many physicians do not
know how they stack up against their peers, and that unlike most
professions in which pay based on performance is the norm, doctors
have few such incentives to improve care.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a bit of a watershed event," said Dr. Robert
Margolis, chief executive of Healthcare Partners Medical Group, which
has 2,500 doctors in Los Angeles and Orange counties. "My guess is
that other PPOs will latch on to this to see if this is a way to
improve care."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Damberg, a senior health policy analyst at Rand, a
nonprofit research institution, said an incentive program like this
is overdue. "We know very little about the quality of care being
delivered in that [PPO] market," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for that, she said, is that PPOs generally don't have
the kind of accreditation process and regulatory requirements of HMOs
to track and publicly report clinical care data.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint Health Networks, which owns Blue Cross of California,
said it could introduce a similar program in other states where it
operates. The Thousand Oaks-based company is one of the nation's
largest health insurers with more than 13 million members.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians' scorecard will be based largely on 16 clinical
measures that are accepted as high-quality care.</TE>
<TE>   They include how well doctors are providing needed childhood
immunizations; screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers;
and effectively managing the care of chronic conditions such as
asthma, diabetes and depression.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would applaud about this is they're looking at appropriate
medical indicators," Boland said. "To the extent that any physicians
adopt these practices, that will save money."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross officials said they can obtain reliable statistics on
treatment practices by examining doctors' claims data, which
generally provide detailed information about services provided.</TE>
<TE>   Endocrinologists who treat diabetics, for example, will be scored
on the percent of their patients who have periodic retinal exams,
which is widely recommended to reduce problems of blindness. Blue
Cross said its current data show that only 40% of PPO members who are
eligible for the exam are receiving it.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors, however, questioned how accurately Blue Cross could
track data for many PPO patients, who frequently switch health plans
and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Cross scorecard also will incorporate other measures,
such as being board certified, opening the practice to new patients
and prescribing generic drugs when appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross said each physician who participates will be able to
see their score on the Internet and compare it against an average for
others in the same specialty and region as well as a target measure
for everyone. Doctors will not be able to view scores of other
individual physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Woodrow Myers, chief medical officer for Blue Cross of
California, said he hoped this information will be incentive enough
for doctors to elevate their game. "There's a little bit of
psychology here," he said, noting that doctors are traditionally very
competitive. "I don't think anybody wants to be in the bottom
quartile."</TE>
<TE>   Myers said the amount of bonus and other aspects of the program
may be adjusted or fine-tuned. He said this incentive program was a
first step in linking doctors' pay with performance.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross officials said they had no estimate of how much the
program might save in reduced medical claims for them, or whether any
of this would translate into lower premiums for employers and
consumers.</TE>

<HD>Bristol-Myers Targeted by Federal Prosecutors</HD>
<DH>Probe: Already under SEC scrutiny, the company says U.S.
attorney is investigating whether it inflated sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., already under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said Wednesday that federal
prosecutors are probing whether the company inflated sales by
offering discounts to wholesalers.</LD>
<LD>   Discounts last year led to swollen customer inventories, forcing
the world's fifth-biggest drug maker in April to slash 2002 profit
forecasts. Bristol-Myers said it intends to cooperate and will
provide information it already has shared with the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey
heaps more pressure on the board and Chief Executive Peter Dolan.
Bristol-Myers shares have fallen 62% in 12 months, punished by
drug-development failures, competition from cheaper generic medicines
and lower earnings forecasts.</LD>
<TE>   "The board seriously has to question the credibility of the
company in light of the fact that Peter Dolan's still there," said
Linda Ray, who helps manage more than $120 million at Northstar Group
Inc. Replacing Dolan "would be a start" for wooing back investors,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors may bring criminal charges against employees or the
company, or they may elect to drop the case, said Paul Fishman, a
defense attorney and former No. 2 federal prosecutor in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "The specter of a criminal investigation is just worse than an SEC
investigation," Fishman said. "The more severe the consequences for
the company, the more people will look to see why management and the
board were not adequately addressing these issues themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers shares fell 70 cents to $21.63 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Bristol-Myers has said its accounting was
appropriate. The company said in August that the SEC might force the
company to restate results.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers, which initially disclosed the overstocking in
April, has said it expects reducing that inventory to cut earnings by
53 cents a share this year and 8 cents in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it sneaky? Yeah. Was it a bit unethical? Yeah. But I don't
know if you could technically say it was illegal," said PNC Advisors
analyst Rita Freedman of the discounting matter.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Christopher Christie, the top federal prosecutor in New
Jersey, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Might Purchase Stake in AOL Time Warner Center</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The big pension fund is in early discussions
with the builders to invest in the $1.7-billion complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER VINCENT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System may buy a stake in
one of the biggest real estate projects under construction in the
U.S.: New York's AOL Time Warner Center.</LD>
<LD>   Builders of the $1.7-billion complex at the southwest corner of
Central Park are looking for permanent financing for the project and
have had discussions with CalPERS and other investors, said Stephen
Ross, a partner in the development and chairman and chief executive
of New York-based Related Cos.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco confirmed that the managers of the
nation's largest public pension fund were considering investing in
the new AOL Time Warner headquarters, but he described the talks as
being at an early stage. He declined to say how much of the project
CalPERS was considering financing.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS manages $135 billion and provides health and retirement
benefits to 1.3 million state workers and their families.</TE>
<TE>   The New York project offers CalPERS "a superior asset, a superior
market and the ability to put a large investment into one asset,"
said Scott Latham, a senior director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a real
estate services company. "That offers efficiencies to funds like
CalPERS that they can't find in other places."</TE>
<TE>   The complex, with 2.8 million square feet, is slated to open next
fall. It will include office space for rent, 191 condominiums, a
251-room Mandarin Oriental hotel, 338,000 square feet of retail
space, production studios for AOL Time Warner's CNN, a concert hall
and a 500-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   Related Cos. is developing the property in partnership with a real
estate fund managed by financier Leon Black's Apollo Real Estate
Advisors. Ross said his team would retain a controlling interest in
the project but was looking for investors to take as much as a 50%
stake in the retail space and 325,000 square feet of non-AOL office
space. Ross did not say how much that portion of the project will
cost.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, which has about $13 billion invested in real estate, may
soon buy more. The investment staff has recommended to the board of
directors that CalPERS increase the percentage of its portfolio
invested in real estate to 9% from 8% by reducing its fixed-income
investments, such as corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities.
The value of CalPERS' asset base has declined in the last three
years.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based MacFarlane Partners would be CalPERS' advisor
in the AOL Time Warner deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Goldman Strategist Cohen Cuts Stock Targets but Still Sees
Gains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. market strategist Abby J. Cohen--long one of Wall
Street's biggest bulls--on Wednesday tempered her enthusiasm for
stocks, though she still predicted out-sized equity gains for share
prices by 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, who despite this year's market slide has maintained
ambitious 12- to 18-month price targets for the Dow industrial
average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, cut those estimates by
12% and 4.4%, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   She now expects the Dow to reach 10,800 in 12 to 18 months, down
from 11,300. Her estimate for the S&amp;P 500 was reduced to 1,150 from
1,300.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, her new targets represent gains of 48% for the indexes
from Wednesday's levels.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was ranked Wall Street's top market guru in the 1990s, but
she has lost that title as the bear market has dragged on, slashing
the S&amp;P 500 nearly in half during the last 30 months.</TE>
<TE>   In a note to clients, Cohen said that despite the "economic
uncertainty" dogging markets, corporate profits are rising and "the
worst is past."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen isn't alone in continuing to cheer on the market. Wall
Street strategists, on average, expect the S&amp;P to end 2003 at about
1,180, according to a recent Reuters poll.</TE>
<TE>   But few strategists enjoyed Cohen's stature in the 1990s as a
market oracle. That has made her a bigger target for critics in the
last two years as her forecasts have proved far off track.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, she said the S&amp;P 500 would rise 25% that year.
Instead, the index fell 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the market's current woes, Cohen said investors have
assigned an ever-higher "risk premium" to stocks since the terrorist
attacks last year. Cohen "did not anticipate the current extreme
reading [of risk aversion], which is near the highs of the past three
decades," she said. Nonetheless, that risk aversion should decline in
the next 18 months, she said.</TE>

<HD>Mature Games Prompt Debate as Sales Jump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Violence is a staple in the adolescent world of video games while sex
traditionally has been taboo.</LD>
<LD>   But a decade after Acclaim Entertainment Inc. rattled parents with
the hyper-violent "Mortal Kombat" series, the publisher again is
pushing the boundaries of taste and propriety--this time by spicing
up its "BMX XXX" with topless female bicycle riders, a racy script
and video clips of strippers.</LD>
<LD>   As the popularity of video games grows beyond children and
teenagers, publishers are beginning to saturate their games with more
mature themes and images. More than half the players of Sony's
PlayStation 2 are older than 18, and the kids who grew up on
squeaky-clean Mario want more-adult fare.</LD>
<TE>   "The Mature-rated games category is far and away the fastest
growing in terms of sales," said Michael Pachter, analyst with
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pachter said sales of Mature, or M-rated, games in the U.S. are
expected to double this year from 7% of overall sales to 14%, thanks
to titles such as "BMX XXX," "The Getaway," and "Grand Theft Auto:
Vice City," the sequel to "Grand Theft Auto 3." That game featured
interactive prostitutes whose services players could buy to boost
their so-called health points.</TE>
<TE>   Scantily clad women of impossible proportions have populated games
for years, but overt sexuality largely has been avoided. Crossing the
frontier to sexier content turns off some in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   BMX athlete Dave Mirra pulled his name from "BMX XXX" this summer.
Redwood City-based Electronic Arts Inc., the world's largest
independent game publisher, attempts to steer clear of M-rated games
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   And game developers often go out of their way to tone down violent
or suggestive themes to win the more commercially palatable Teen
rating.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be a leader for the industry and protect the
industry from heat," said Bing Gordon, a founder and chief creative
officer of Electronic Arts. "With the strip-bar stuff, it's just too
easy to open up the industry to potshots."</TE>
<TE>   But Acclaim Chief Executive Greg Fischbach said he welcomed the
controversy generated by "BMX XXX," which prompted the game
industry's ratings board to introduce the descriptors "nudity" and
"partial nudity" to warn parents of sexual content.</TE>
<TE>   Fischbach--whose career has included stints as a manager of the
Steve Miller Band, an assistant U.S. attorney and the president of
RCA Records--said the debate would help expose what he considers a
double standard for popular entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were film producers, this wouldn't be at all
controversial," he said. "It would just boil down to whether we're
creating a good film or a bad film. This should be no different. Our
goal is to create an entertainment experience, a video game version
of 'American Pie' and Howard Stern."</TE>
<TE>   The company likens "BMX XXX" to films such as "Airplane!" and
"Austin Powers." Glen Cove, N.Y.-based Acclaim hired Hollywood
comedians to write a 400-page script filled with adolescent sexual
innuendo, double- entendres and sight gags. In addition to the
bare-chested characters and strip-club sequences, the game's visuals
include mating dogs and pimps.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that, "BMX XXX" is a standard dirt-bike racing game in
which players perform stunts.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly pushes the limit, but it's really just bathroom
humor," said Geoff Keighley, a writer for GameSpot, an industry news
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no worse than 'South Park.' "</TE>
<TE>   Keighley noted that a handful of games in years past have toyed
with sexual content, including "Leisure Suit Larry," a series of
adventure games published in the mid-1990s, and 1995's
"Phantasmagoria," the first game to suggest sexual intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   Games with overtly sexual themes and content have tended to sell
poorly, but game developers have been pushing the boundaries for
years. Powerful computers and game consoles permit more realistic
graphics and physics, allowing characters in revealing costumes to
look like more than cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   The first blockbuster game to deal with sex outright was "Grand
Theft Auto 3." Even then, the sex was just implied. It consisted of
inviting a prostitute into a car and watching the vehicle bounce.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a puritan society, pure and simple," said Henry Jenkins,
professor of media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are our roots. We have images of violence in our G-rated
movies, and because it's cartoony, it's acceptable. But we have no
way of representing sex in a way that's acceptable for children.
Pokemons fight, but they can't mate."</TE>

<HD>New Execs at Gemstar Face a Big Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has wrested management control
of Gemstar-TV Guide International from its founder, Henry Yuen, the
challenge is to salvage a business from the wreckage.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street reacted favorably Wednesday to the management change
as investors bid up Gemstar's shares by 25%, after Yuen agreed to
resign late Tuesday and be replaced by an executive backed by News
Corp., Gemstar's largest shareholder.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar was considered a technology favorite on Wall Street just
two years ago, but its stock value has plunged 96% since then, beset
by questionable accounting practices and court rulings that
undermined the company's patents for on-screen TV programming guides.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say Pasadena-based Gemstar, which produces TV Guide and
electronic equivalents for navigating through the dozens of channels
on TV, may never be worth what it was in 1999, when Murdoch first
invested in the company. News Corp. has taken write-downs of nearly
$6 billion since March on its Gemstar investment.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage is done," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch, which has a significant equity position in Gemstar.
"It will never be a $75 stock, but it can be a viable business."</TE>
<TE>   A new management team, led by former News Corp. cable executive
Jeff Shell, will take control of Gemstar within the next several
weeks. Shell was dispatched to Gemstar as co-chief operating officer
in April amid concerns about Gemstar's accounting problems as Murdoch
moved to take greater control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Shell, who will replace Yuen as chief executive, says a key to
Gemstar's comeback is to retool the company's electronic guides to
make them friendlier for the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, when you survey subscribers on what they want
from digital cable, the program guide is usually No. 1 or No. 2,"
Shell said.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's interactive programming guide is available in more than
15 million homes, including about 8 million with cable set-top boxes
and 7 million with guides embedded in their TV sets.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say that Gemstar's guide is cumbersome and slow and
cluttered with advertising that detracts from its use as a search
tool.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch teamed up with Gemstar in 1999 to protect his investment
in TV Guide. As digital technology broadened the number of cable and
satellite TV channels, consumers were expected to increasingly rely
on electronic guides for their listings instead of a conventional
resource, such as TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   So Murdoch and his partner in TV Guide, cable mogul John Malone,
sold the magazine to Gemstar in a $8.2-billion stock and debt deal.
News Corp. doubled its stake in Gemstar in 2000 to 42% by buying out
Malone's Liberty Media.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, investors saw Gemstar as a pioneer in the convergence
of old and new media. At its peak in March 2000, Gemstar's stock was
worth $101, giving the company a market value of about $19 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares closed Wednesday at $3.25, up 66 cents, on Nasdaq,
giving the company a market value of $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   TV Guide, still Gemstar's biggest revenue generator, has declined
in circulation from 11 million at the time of the merger to 9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Yuen and his chief financial officer, Elsie Leung, agreed to step
down from running the company in exchange for huge severance
packages. This came months after bitter internal skirmishes and
boardroom disputes, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Yuen will remain nonexecutive chairman. Leung resigned as CFO and
co-chief operating officer but will remain a director through the
next year. Paul Haggerty, a News Corp. executive, will become acting
Gemstar CFO.</TE>

<HD>Genentech Quarterly Net Income Doubles</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The biotech firm posts profit of $89.3
million. Revenue jumps 21% on strong sales of cancer drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. said Wednesday that earnings more than doubled in the
third quarter, driven by higher sales of its cancer drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue grew 21%, led by Rituxan, a treatment for non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, that is on track this year to produce $1 billion in sales.
Only one other cancer drug, Bristol Myers-Squibb's Taxol, has done
so.</LD>
<LD>   Genentech, based in South San Francisco, said net income rose to
$89.3 million, or 17 cents a share, from $42.7 million, or 8 cents a
share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $675.2 million from $556.2
million.</LD>
<TE>   Rituxan, which Genentech co-markets with San Diego-based Idec
Pharmaceuticals, and Herceptin, Genentech's breast cancer drug,
accounted for more than half the company's third-quarter revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Rituxan rose 38% to $293.9 million, up from $212.8
million, at the high end of analysts' estimates for the quarter.
Herceptin sales rose to $96.7 million from $83.8 million, in the
middle of the range analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Genentech's third-best-selling drug, human growth
hormone, rose 14% in the quarter to $77.4 million from $67.7 a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech took a $12.5-million charge related to the $500-million
verdict against it in the breach-of-contract suit with City of Hope
National Medical Center in Duarte. The firm said the charge reflected
litigation related to obtaining a surety bond and that it expected to
take such a charge each quarter while it appeals the judgment.</TE>
<TE>   In after-hours trading, Genentech's shares rose 3.5% to $33 after
closing at $31.88, off 67 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. The
company announced the results after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   Idec, meanwhile, said sales rose 31% in the quarter, also driven
by Rituxan. The company reported third-quarter sales of $269.5
million, up from $205 million a year ago. Sales of Zevalin, a
radioactive cancer drug for patients who don't improve on Rituxan,
were $5 million in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Idec, which plans to release its full results Oct. 16, estimated
third-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share, a penny above Wall Street
estimates. Idec's shares rose 7% in after-hours trading to $38.97,
after closing at $36.42 on Nasdaq, down $1.18.</TE>

<HD>GE, Automaker Downgrades Spark Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Downbeat analyst forecasts, citing profit and
credit worries, fuel a broad rout. The Dow falls to its lowest level
since October 1997.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wave of selling swamped the stock market Wednesday after bleak
comments and forecasts from Wall Street analysts on companies such as
General Electric and Ford Motor fanned fears about corporate profits
and sent investors scampering for the shelter of government bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The rout was unusually broad--even by the standards of the current
bear market, now the deepest since the Great Depression. Losers
trounced winners by almost 7 to 1 in active trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, the worst ratio in four years.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average sank 215.22 points, or 2.9%, to
7,286.27. The Dow is at levels not seen since October 1997 and is
down more than 37% from its January 2000 high.</LD>
<TE>   "Investors are completely losing confidence," said Scott
Schermerhorn, an investment manager at Columbia Management Group.
Investors, he said, are tired of putting money into the market only
to see it disappear in ever-deeper sell-offs. "It's like banging your
head against the wall so many times it hurts ... you are not going to
do it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   There were some glimmers of hope after the market closed, when
Yahoo, Aetna and Bausch &amp; Lomb either forecast or reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings. But analysts remain downbeat
about prospects for corporate earnings overall.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing some of the gap between reality and expectations
closing," said Richard Babson, chairman of Babson-United, which
manages money for wealthy individuals. "There were these hopes for a
fantastic rebound [in profits], but it turns out it's not that
fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   The market got a boost Tuesday on hopes that the 10-day shutdown
of West Coast ports was nearing an end, and indeed dockworkers were
to head back to work late Wednesday after a federal judge approved
President Bush's request to reopen the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts say investors were worried about the long-term
costs of the port dispute, including clearing a backlog of goods that
will take weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern out there is that the retailers do not get the goods
on the shelves in time for the post-Thanksgiving shopping season,"
said Jim Russell, director of core equity strategy for Fifth-Third
Bank in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   In the broader market, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slid 21.79
points, or 2.7%, to 776.76, closing at its lowest level since the
spring of 1997 and 49.1% below its March 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index slipped 15.10 points, or 1.3%, to
1,114.11, carving out a new six-year closing low. Losers led winners
by 5 to 2 on Nasdaq, which is down 78% from its March 2000 high.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on Treasury securities fell to new generational lows as
investors continued to seek safety from falling stocks in government
debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell from
Tuesday's close of 3.63% to 3.57%, its lowest since 1958.</TE>
<TE>   GE fell $1.35 to $22, hurting blue chips and financial stocks too,
after Morgan Stanley cut the stock's price target and said the
conglomerate "could be walking into the most difficult operating
environment that GE has experienced in at least a couple of decades."
Morgan Stanley also cited concerns about losses in GE Capital's
portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   "Seems to me that the story is the financial services areas and GE
and Ford Motor. Investors seem a bit concerned about credit in the
United States," said Val Jensen, president of the Jensen Portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers tumbled again after Morgan Stanley cut its earnings
outlook on Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, a day after
Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded the sector.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks took a hit after Moody's Investors Service cut
J.P. Morgan Chase's long-term debt ratings. Morgan, a Dow stock, lost
$1.15 to $15.45. The Philadelphia banking index lost 4.3%. Citigroup
shed 95 cents to $26.89, Bank of America slid $3.05 to $54.15, and
Bank One lost $2.23 to $32.59.</TE>
<TE>   * Battered transportation and utility stocks fell further. The Dow
transports index dropped 4.8% as airline and rail shares slumped; the
Dow utilities index plunged 9.6%.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug maker Merck late in the session reaffirmed that 2002
earnings would be flat compared with 2001, as slowing sales of
arthritis drug Vioxx and generic competition hurt revenue this year.
Shares of Merck, down 3.5% before the announcement, rose after the
outlook was released but fell again to close at $45.63, down 37
cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Casino stocks plunged on worries that third-quarter earnings
will be lackluster. Harrah's dropped $4 to $44.70; MGM Grand lost
$2.82 to $31.68.</TE>
<TE>   * Boston Celtics scored a rare winner. Shares of the storied
basketball franchise shot up 147%, closing $16.65 higher at $28, on
the first trading day since details of a buyout offer were unveiled
last week.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of major tech companies, such as recently battered Cisco
Systems, rallied and helped keep a floor under the tech-laden Nasdaq.
Cisco, which had fallen for five trading sessions, gained 63 cents to
$9.23 as bargain hunters came out in force.</TE>
<TE>   * In Brazil, government bond prices slid to a six-year low on
concern about the next president's ability to make debt payments. The
nation's currency also slumped, ending at 3.86 per dollar.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 10-day shutdown of the ports has idled factory workers, left
bananas and other crops rotting and caused retailers great worry over
holiday inventories. Now the labor dispute has claimed a new victim:
Los Angeles Opera.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time in two months, opera officials are grappling
with major headaches in their attempt to present the famed Kirov
Opera from St. Petersburg, Russia, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   In September, L.A. Opera had to cancel the highly anticipated
$3-million Kirov production of "War and Peace" because of money
problems. Its replacement, slated to open Oct. 23, is another Kirov
offering, "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk"--about $1 million cheaper, but
still big, still impressive, still the Kirov.</LD>
<TE>   But because of the lockout of West Coast ports, the sets, costumes
and props for the production are literally on a slow boat to Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   The company is scurrying to build its own sets from scratch and
arranging for the costumes and props to be flown back to Los Angeles
on a cargo plane.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, after intervention by the Bush administration,
the ports reopened--but that wasn't soon enough. The ship bearing
five 40-foot containers of goods for "Lady Macbeth," unable to unload
at Long Beach, was steaming toward Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Baitzel, L.A. Opera's director of operations, says that, so
far, trying to present the Kirov here has been unusually operatic.</TE>
<TE>   "I wait for the moment that the dark cloud disappears and we have
bright sunshine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kleeman, the opera company's technical director, said the
plan had been to load the sets and costumes into the theater Oct. 7.
What he learned talking to shipping agents, however, was that the
containers wouldn't even arrive in Tokyo until Oct. 13.</TE>
<TE>   He knew that the costumes, which occupy only about one-fifth of
the space in one container, could be unloaded and brought by plane
back to Los Angeles. The same could not be said of the set pieces,
which are too large to fit on a commercial airliner.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest the set could be returned via ship was Oct. 27--four
days after opening night. Kleeman knew that if the show was to go on,
L.A. Opera would have to start building a new set.</TE>
<TE>   So he contacted Paul Lippe, vice president of Western Overseas
Corp. in Los Angeles, who immediately began negotiating to get the
containers offloaded in Tokyo and unpacked so that costumes could be
removed and reshipped by air. The set pieces will be left aboard
ship, eventually to return to St. Petersburg.Under ordinary
circumstances, it would take only a few days for the items removed
from the ship to clear customs in Tokyo and catch a plane to
L.A.--but as fate would have it, a national holiday would add a day's
delay to the process.The costumes are expected to arrive at LAX on
Oct. 18, more than 10 days behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they have to clear customs, and we won't have our hands on
them until the 19th," said Kleeman. "That leaves us roughly three
days to get it together to open on the 23rd. That's much tighter than
we would normally want. It's about fittings and repairs and
alterations--it takes time to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The new set should be completed and loaded into the theater at
about the same time the costumes arrive.</TE>
<TE>   While Lippe was on the phone to Japan, Kleeman was on the phone to
St. Petersburg, making arrangements to get the plans needed to build
a set.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday at 12:45 p.m, Kirov Opera technical director Igor
Suvorov landed at Los Angeles International Airport, carrying a
30-pound roll of drawings by Kirov set designer George Tsypin.</TE>
<TE>   The Kirov has been transmitting set designs to Los Angeles Opera
and elsewhere via e-mail since 1996, but the "Lady Macbeth" set
designs created in the early '90s aren't digitized. The fact that
Suvorov also could serve as an advisor in re-creating the set in Los
Angeles motivated the decision for him to serve as courier.</TE>
<TE>   And this morning at 7, L.A. Opera's head carpenter, Butch Conroy,
and a crew of 16 carpenters were to assemble at the opera company
scene shop in Santa Clarita to begin set construction.</TE>
<TE>   Conroy--who affectionately refers to the Kirov Opera as "my
problem child"--says the construction will take 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's put everything into a rush--I had to order more tools
because of the number of guys who will be working," Conroy said.
"I've warned my wife that from now until the load-in on the 19th,
I'll be working 14, 16 hours a day. If we get behind, we'll have a
crew of 32, split into two crews of 16, and we'll go 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "This has turned into a full-blown, 10-day grand opera," he said.
"Stuff is going to be trickling in right up to the morning before we
open. But we're going to do our best."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid another Kirov embarrassment, they'll have to. In late
August, L.A. Opera's artistic director, Placido Domingo, was forced
to cancel the production of Tchaikovsky's "War and Peace" when
mega-donor Alberto Vilar, who was underwriting the production,
refused to provide $600,000 in additional funds and to move up the
payment on his $1-million pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Even with recent developments, "Lady Macbeth" will be less
expensive than "War and Peace." The cost of building a new set and
flying the costumes back from Tokyo will add up to about $200,000,
said Baitzel.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether the extra costs will be covered by
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "Placido's first reaction was, 'Oh, thank God it's not 'War and
Peace,' because there's absolutely no way to make copies of its
scenic elements to make it work on our stage," Baitzel said. "Not
only would it cost $3 million to copy it, but we would need a minimum
of three months to do it."</TE>

<HD>Top Democrats Call for Pitt to Step Down</HD>
<DH>Politics: Daschle and Gephardt question the SEC chief's
handling of accounting oversight board's creation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congress' two top Democrats wrote to President Bush on Wednesday
seeking the resignation of Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and questioning the SEC chief's handling of
the creation of a national board to police corporate accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said in the letter that they were
concerned about Pitt's actions in the selection of a chairman for the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that you should replace him immediately as SEC chair,"
the letter said. It was the second time Daschle has called for Pitt's
resignation.</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer dismissed the appeal. "It's a
political charge that has no merit and substance," he said, adding
that the SEC has a record of aggressively pursuing corporate
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said, "The chairman serves at the
pleasure of the president. We've heard enthusiastic endorsements from
the president on the chairman's work." Pitt was unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   As Democrats try to swing voters' attention from talk of war with
Iraq to the sluggish economy and corporate misdeeds, Pitt and his
handling of the accounting board and the SEC are becoming a political
punching bag.</TE>
<TE>   Securities law experts said it was unlikely that Pitt--appointed
in 2001 after a career as a Wall Street lawyer and earlier as an SEC
staff attorney--would resign.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), who co-sponsored
newly enacted corporate reform legislation, called on Democrats "to
stop this outrageous effort of politicizing the [SEC] and undermining
its current chairman."</TE>
<TE>   Congress ordered the SEC to set up the accounting oversight board
this summer after a cascade of corporate and accounting scandals
hammered Wall Street and undermined investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC was moving smoothly to set up the board--with John Biggs,
chief of the TIAA-CREF mutual fund and pension company, seen as the
front-runner to become chairman--until a flap broke out last week,
with Biggs' backers accusing accounting lobbyists of moving to block
him.</TE>

Defense Department contract.</LD>
<TE>   Rival telecommunications firms Sprint Corp. and Global Crossing

questions about its credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the congressional agency that rules
on such protests, said it had qualms about intervening because the
project was well underway, and the Defense Department "has authority
to address the alleged impropriety" if it so chooses.</TE>

<LD>   Aetna Inc. said third-quarter profit would be higher than expected
as the second-biggest U.S. health insurer controlled medical expenses
and increased premiums.</LD>
<TE>   Aetna also said full-year profit would beat estimates. Chief
Executive John Rowe is eliminating jobs and has promised to trim $300
million from operating costs this year.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit will be about 70 cents a share and 2002
profit will be about $2.20 to $2.25 a share, excluding some items,
Aetna said. Aetna was expected to earn 35 cents in the quarter and
$1.48 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna closed down $1.41 to $31.69
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement was made
after the markets closed. In after-hours trading, Aetna soared to

<LD>   EchoStar Communications Corp. probably will abandon its proposed
$16-billion acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp., parent of
satellite TV provider DirecTV, if the deal is not approved by
regulators by Jan. 21, DirecTV's chief executive said.</LD>
<TE>   "If there is no approval by Jan. 21, it is a fair assumption we
would go our separate ways," CEO Eddy Hartenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would combine the two top satellite TV services in the
United States. Critics have complained that the combination would
stymie competition.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision Systems Corp. has proposed that the combined
Hughes-EchoStar sell some of its capacity to Cablevision, which plans
to launch a satellite service next year. But regulators fear that
Cablevision lacks the resources.</TE>
<TE>   In a new possible hitch, a religious broadcaster has notified
regulators that it owns six of the 17 satellite channels sought by
Cablevision. EchoStar subleases the six channels from Naples,
Fla.-based Dominion Video Satellite Inc.</TE>

<LD>   Actor Sean Connery sued producer Peter Guber and his Mandalay
Pictures in Los Angeles County Superior Court over the unraveling
this year of the CIA thriller "End Game."</LD>
<TE>   Connery alleged that Mandalay was "nothing more than a house of
cards," using the film project to mask a precarious financial
situation. The actor said Mandalay agreed to pay him $17 million for
the role but lacked funding to make the film because its German
financing dried up.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hears Copyright Arguments</HD>
<DH>Law: Debate focuses on 'limited time' phrase in
Constitution granting Congress power to decide exclusive rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court justices sounded divided and uncertain Wednesday
about whether they should overturn Congress' power to extend the
copyrights on old books, plays, films and songs.</LD>
<LD>   They debated a multibillion-dollar case that pits the
entertainment industry, which wants to protect its creative works
from the 1920s and 1930s, against Internet activists and librarians
who seek to make them freely available to all.</LD>
<LD>   But the hourlong oral argument focused on an even older work. The
Constitution says Congress can give authors and inventors the
exclusive rights to their works "for limited times."</LD>
<TE>   The first Congress said copyrights and patents extended for 14
years. In the 20th century, however, lawmakers repeatedly extended
the copyright terms so that films, plays and books from the 1920s
remain protected.</TE>
<TE>   "A 'limited' time that can be extended and extended is not
limited. It's the functional equivalent of unlimited," said Justice
Antonin Scalia, who voiced the challenger's argument.</TE>
<TE>   "How does it promote progress to extend the terms?" asked Justice
John Paul Stevens, because the creators of the original works are
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia, Stevens and Justice Stephen G. Breyer said they were
troubled that Congress' repeated extensions of copyright terms
ignored the words and purpose of the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "This flies directly in the face of what the framers of the
Constitution had in mind," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, agreeing
in part.</TE>
<TE>   But she quickly added she was not convinced that Congress had gone
so far as to violate the Constitution. She and others said they were
wary of unraveling the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions?" O'Connor
asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act of 1998 added 20 years to
copyrights, both old and new. If the court were to strike that down,
O'Connor said, would the ruling also apply to the Copyright Act of
1976 that also extended most copyrights for about 20 years?</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said he saw no reason to upset
the 200-year-old American tradition that Congress, not the courts,
decide on the proper terms for copyrights and patents.</TE>
<TE>   He emphasized that the Constitution gives this power to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a general grant [of power] and Congress is free to run with
it. Most people thought there was no basis for challenging this,"
Rehnquist told Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig, who represents
the Internet activists.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court--or at least four of nine
justices--voted to take up Lessig's challenge to the copyright
extension.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's argument squarely posed the dilemma for the justices.
On the one hand, most of them seemed to believe the phrase "limited
times" must have concrete meaning. On other hand, how do they decide
what limited means?</TE>
<TE>   The two competing attorneys, Lessig for the challengers, and
Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson for the government, stuck
strictly to their basic arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is about limits," said Lessig, who once clerked for
Scalia. If the entertainment industry can persuade Congress to extend
the limits whenever old works are about to enter the public domain,
"then there are no limits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said the limits are a matter for Congress alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The authority is vested in Congress, not the courts, to make the
judgment," Olson said. "It's a very broad grant of power" to elected
lawmakers to decide the proper balance between creators and consumers
of cultural works.</TE>
<TE>   The lead plaintiff, Eric Eldred of Derry, N.H., scans books onto
his Web site. He said the 1998 extension prevented him from adding
novels and poems from the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling in Eldred vs. Ashcroft might not occur until June.</TE>
<TE>   If the court strikes down the 1998 law, it would void copyright
protection for most "works for hire" that appeared in the 1920s. The
1998 law extended the copyrights for those works to 95 years from 75.</TE>
<TE>   For individual works, the copyright term was extended to 70 years
after the death of the author.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dispute has been called a true Mickey Mouse case, the
ruling is unlikely to affect Walt Disney Co.'s favorite mouse because
he is protected by trademark law.</TE>

<KH>TROUBLE ON THE WATERFRONT</KH>
<HD>Traffic Has Been Zooming--for the Water Taxis</HD>
<DH>Transport: Stranded crews have been a boon for boats
charging about $180 an hour for ship-to-shore service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's a stranded sailor to do?</LD>
<LD>   Call a taxi. A water taxi.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly 100 ships anchored away from the docks at the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach because of the 10-day shutdown there, the
water taxi business has been booming.</LD>
<TE>   The taxi boats have been running around the clock, delivering
groceries, cigarettes and beer to ships. The taxis also ferry crews
dockside so they can catch a movie in town, buy some clothes or
quench their thirst.</TE>
<TE>   Although the lockout ended with the reopening of the ports
Wednesday night, the three water taxi services plying the nation's
busiest harbor say the cargo backlog is so great that they expect
business to be brisk for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation is a freak anomaly for us," said Matt Pelicano,
harbor operations manager at American Marine Corp. at Terminal
Island.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on a 10-year high, running at full throttle and pressed to
the limits."</TE>
<TE>   "We've even had to turn down a few requests because we just ran
out of boats," Pelicano said.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, water taxis serve only four or five cargo vessels
anchored in the Los Angeles-Long Beach harbor complex. The taxis,
typically 35 to 60 feet long, also shuttle crews to and from oil
rigs.</TE>
<TE>   But now they're serving scores of ships, and the increase in
business may be taking a toll on the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Early Tuesday morning, the helm broke off the 35-foot water taxi
Stephen S, leaving it to drift uncomfortably close to the breakwater
in thick fog.</TE>
<TE>   Then it got lost.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Seely, who was trying to get back to the container ship
Lurline, recalled drifting past "four Navy Seals crammed into a tiny
black dingy, an oil rig and right under the hulls of several of the
wrong ships."</TE>
<TE>   "When the word Lurline emerged from the fog," he said, "I felt
definite relief."</TE>
<TE>   If not for the water taxis, most crews could do little else in
their off-hours besides pine for the shore delights of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As one sailor put it, "It's so close, and yet so far."</TE>
<TE>   Aboard ship, the crews keep busy with a variety of tedious jobs:
greasing engines, swabbing decks, chipping paint off hulls, rolling
new coats of enamel on bridges and cranes, and making sure their
25,000-ton vessels don't sway at anchor and knock into a nearby ship.</TE>
<TE>   A trip ashore is a welcome respite. But not all sailors can afford
the taxi service.</TE>
<TE>   The boats charge about $180 an hour. And because it takes 45
minutes to an hour to get from a dock in Long Beach to a ship
anchored five miles out, the round-trip cost of transporting a single
sailor can run close to $400.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Miller, 59, chief steward on the Lurline, is lucky: His
employer pays for the taxi service. He took a ride ashore Tuesday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It can get boring on the boat," said Miller while heading to
shore. "I decided to go to town to pay my bills and pick up some
stuff for crew members."</TE>
<TE>   The helm on the Stephen S was reattached in about 15 minutes and
was working fine by the time Capt. Bruce Root took command of the
boat later Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Root, a confident seaman with snow-white hair and mustache and
easy smile, seemed unfazed by the sudden extra work.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was one or a dozen passengers, he welcomed them aboard
with a resounding "Capt. Root, at your service!"</TE>
<TE>   "I've been super-busy lately," he said, gunning the engine to 18
knots to pick up a customer a mile away. "Generally, the crews I get
want to go partying, drinking. Maybe see some relatives."</TE>
<TE>   Shipping agent Dennis Tsui, however, had to get an armload of maps
and charts to the captain of a 23,000-ton freighter that was
preparing to divert to the port of Topolabampo, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners have decided not to wait around, given the uncertainty
at this port," Tsui said, as Root pressed the Stephen S beyond the
breakwater toward a fleet of freighters, each carrying thousands of
containers stacked above their decks.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Root cut the power, summoned Tsui to the bridge and
asked, "Which one is your ship?"</TE>
<TE>   "That big one over there," Tsui said, nodding toward a dozen big
ships on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "What color is it," Root asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray," Tsui said. All the ships were gray.</TE>
<TE>   "What's its name?"</TE>
<TE>   "The Rickmers Houston. And there it is," Tsui said with a sigh of
relief.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, Root deftly backed up to the Rickmers' long,
rickety gangplank, allowing Tsui to bound aboard with his documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back in 15 minutes," Tsui yelled over his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had Tsui clambered back aboard the Stephen S than the
hulking Rickmers began pulling up anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be leaving port within 15 minutes," Tsui said. "I've got
four other vessels still anchored out here, and many of them have
crews that would like to go ashore."</TE>
<TE>   "Not a problem," Root said. "We're full steam ahead."</TE>

<HD>Pure Resources Officials Back Share Sale to Unocal</HD>
<DH>Merger: Sweetened offer would give El Segundo firm the 35%
stake in the oil and gas explorer it doesn't already own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After sweetening the deal for a second time, Unocal Corp. of El
Segundo won management's endorsement Wednesday of its bid to acquire
the 35% of oil and gas explorer Pure Resources Inc. it does not
already own.</LD>
<LD>   Pure Resources' top management agreed to accept a bid of 0.74
Unocal share for each of their Pure shares, which combined represent
about a 5% stake in the Midland, Texas-based company.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of the Pure Resources' board also recommended
Wednesday that other shareholders accept the increased offer for
their 30% stake in the firm, Pure Resources said. Company officials
declined to comment further. Board approval isn't needed, because
Unocal made the offer directly to shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   The revised offer is for $370 million, or $21.02 a share, based on
Unocal's closing price Wednesday of $28.41 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Management's agreement to sell was seen as key to ending an
impasse in which some shareholders went to court to block the deal,
arguing that Unocal's initial August offer of 0.6527 Unocal share for
each Pure share was too low.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal had raised its offer to 0.70 share Oct. 2 when its initial
offer was set to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Pure Resources was formed in May 2000 when Unocal spun off its oil
and natural-gas exploration and production operations in west Texas
and New Mexico and merged them with Titan Exploration Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With sole ownership, Unocal would gain control of Pure Resources'
oil and gas assets in the Permian Basin of west Texas, the San Juan
Basin in New Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast. The deal also
would boost Unocal's cash flow by more than $200 million a year,
Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've actually been competing with Pure for properties in some
areas," said Lane, explaining why the acquisition comes just two
years after the company was formed. "And by having the public company
structure there is a lot of duplication. We hope to achieve some
synergies with this."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pure Resources shares fell 26 cents to close at
$20.92 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadening a public service campaign that began on MTV seven years
ago, media giant Viacom Inc. announced on Wednesday the allocation of
$120 million in advertising time to target HIV/AIDS prevention and
education.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom's two-year project is unprecedented in its focus and reach:
It will span all Viacom's media platforms. Its stable of properties
includes broadcast networks CBS and UPN; seven cable networks;
publisher Simon &amp; Schuster; Blockbuster Video; 184 radio stations;
the largest billboard company in North America; and several TV
production companies, including Paramount.</LD>
<LD>   "Never before has a media company across all of its units
committed this much time and space and energy to trying to address a
single issue like AIDS," said Matt James of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, which is helping target messages to those most at risk.</LD>
<TE>   Viacom spokesman Carl Folta said eight TV shows, including NBC's
"Frasier," which is produced by Paramount Television, and "The
District" on CBS, have volunteered to fold in HIV/AIDS story lines by
season's end. Other shows, such as UPN's "Girlfriends," have a story
line ready to roll out in January.</TE>

<HD>J.P. Morgan Chase's Credit Rating Cut</HD>
<DH>Decision by Moody's Investors Service comes amid growing
investor concern that merger has been a failure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The banking sector suffered another blow Wednesday, when J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co.'s credit ratings were cut by Moody's Investors Service
because of concern about the second-largest U.S. bank's ability to
"maintain acceptable profitability."</LD>
<LD>   Moody's, citing a drop in lending revenue, falling stock markets
and rising bad loans, lowered Morgan's long-term debt rating one
level to A1 from Aa3. Morgan shares dropped $1.15, or 7% to a
seven-year low of $15.45 on the New York Stock Exchange, and other
major bank stocks also slid.</LD>
<LD>   The downgrade, which affects about $42 billion of debt,
underscores investors' concern that Chief Executive William
Harrison's merger of Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. two
years ago has failed.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan's trading revenue plummeted in summer, underwriting
business has dried up and the bank no longer can depend on income
from lending to bolster earnings, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The markets are killing them," said Jeff Rode, analyst at Segall
Bryant &amp; Hamill in Chicago. "They have a merger that doesn't work and
management is in denial."</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's cut Morgan's credit rating one level last month
to A-plus. Its rating and Moody's new rating are five levels below
the highest possible grades.</TE>
<TE>   For a bank, a falling credit rating is particularly troublesome
because the institutions are perpetually borrowing money in credit
markets as part of their normal operations. A lower rating raises the
cost of borrowing and may steer some risk-averse investors away from
Morgan's debt.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau declined to comment.</TE>

<TE>   California Muni Sales</TE>
<TE>   Yield Mixed Results</TE>
<TE>   California on Wednesday paid more than it hoped to sell $800
million of long-term general obligation bonds, but the state got a
better deal from investors on $9 billion of short-term notes,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between yields on California bonds maturing in 30
years and yields on higher-rated municipal bonds of other states had
narrowed to about one-tenth of a percentage point earlier this month,
according to Bloomberg data. But on Wednesday, the state paid twice
that margin on the 30-year bonds it sold.</TE>
<TE>   A group of investment banks led by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. submitted
the winning bid for the California bonds. The bonds maturing in 2032
were priced to yield 4.8%. That interest is free of federal and state
income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said concerns about the state's long-term fiscal health
may have pushed investors to demand higher yields.</TE>
<TE>   But strong demand for the state's offering of short-term notes
allowed California to boost Wednesday's sale of those securities to
$9 billion. Money from the notes will help the state pay off a $7.5
billion borrowing in June that was needed until lawmakers passed a
new budget.</TE>
<TE>   The notes, backed by future tax receipts, yielded as low as 1.57%
for the issue maturing June 20. "Yields were a little lower than I
thought they would be," said Todd Pardula, a fund manager at American
Century Investments. Analysts cited strong demand from individual
investors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salomon to Replace</TE>
<TE>   Stock Research Execs</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. said two senior equity research executives who
supervised former telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman would leave
their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   John Hoffmann, global head of equity research for Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney unit, will retire at the end of the year after
38 years with the company, according to a memo sent to employees.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McCaffrey, U.S. head of equity research, will become global
head of sales and marketing for the company's Internet business.
Grubman reported to McCaffrey and Hoffmann.</TE>
<TE>   The management shifts come as Citigroup, which is under
investigation by state and federal regulators, is trying to distance
itself from criticism that it issued biased research to win
investment banking assignments. Grubman, once a star telecom-industry
analyst, quit in August amid allegations he misled investors with
favorable recommendations of stocks such as WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Analysts' reputations have been besmirched, so there's a
reshuffling," said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown
University. "This is certainly not going to hurt Citigroup's
credibility with regulators."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup named Mark Fulton, chief operating officer for worldwide
equity research, to replace McCaffrey. The firm said it's searching
for a new global head of stock research.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo Has 2nd Consecutive Profit</HD>
<DH>Technology: Internet company raises outlook for year,
citing revenue gains from premium and marketing services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENDA McCARTHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. said Wednesday that it racked up its second consecutive
quarterly profit as it added customers and fee-based services,
further distancing itself from the dark days of the dot-com
advertising collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The company also raised forecasts for the full year based on the
momentum it sees in its new premium services as well as its core
marketing services.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it added 500,000 subscribers in the quarter,
bringing its total to more than 1.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Net income for the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Internet and media
giant came in at $28.9 million, or 5 cents a share, in its fiscal
third quarter, contrasted with a year-ago loss of $24.1 million, or 4
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue jumped to $248.8 million for the three months ended Sept.
30, a 50% increase over $166.1 million in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Even the traditional advertising sector showed a healthy increase,
fueled by a 22% jump in sales for the marketing services division,
which includes online ad sales.</TE>
<TE>   The results beat the consensus expectations of Wall Street.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had predicted earnings of 4
cents a share on revenue of $239.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This was great," said Thyra Zerhusen, manager of the ABN
Amro/Talon Mid Cap Fund. "Advertising isn't supposed to be doing
well." Zerhusen said about 3.8% of her fund is invested in Yahoo
stock. Before the results were released, Yahoo shares rose 47 cents
to close at $9.98 in Nasdaq trading. The stock rose as high as $10.55
in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Terry Semel said the results are a strong
validation of the course the company set a year ago: "We're happy
with our solid progress and believe we have a strong base for future
growth." Yahoo continues to add small and medium-sized businesses to
its platform and attract more individuals as it improves its
services, including offerings designed for high-speed broadband
connections. Yahoo expects to benefit as customers become more
accustomed to paying fees for services, Semel said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in the marketing services division rose to $147.4 million, a
22% increase from a year ago. Those results were helped by Yahoo's
partnership with Pasadena-based Overture Services Inc., which
provides paid ads with its Internet search results.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue from listing fees jumped 124% to $83.1 million. Revenue
from transactions grew 118% to $18.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal 2002, Yahoo said it now expects revenue of $930 million
to $955 million, up from its July forecast of $900 million to $940
million.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Turkish Support May Be Illusory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BALL</AU>
<BD>Ben Ball was a Fulbright scholar in Turkey in 1998 and
1999 and worked at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara in 2001 as a Southwest
Asia specialist from the Fletcher School at Tufts University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The road to Baghdad runs through Turkey. As one of Washington's
strongest political and military allies in the region, Turkey seems
to be the only one standing firm with the U.S. in offering its
airspace and territory to launch an attack on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while Turkish leaders voice public support for "regime change"
in Iraq, they do so through clenched teeth. Although Turkey has
problems with Saddam Hussein, it fears internal political and
economic instability far more than weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Turkey is teetering on the edge of a political disaster that could
seriously hurt the Bush administration's plans in Iraq. Polls suggest
that more than six major parties will fail to obtain the necessary
10% support needed to gain entry into Parliament in Turkish elections
in November. All signs point to a bizarre situation in which
Islamists, whom the military removed from power in 1998, attempt to
return to government with a parliamentary majority gained through a
mere 25% of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   This kind of political weakness is eerily similar to the situation
that led to Turkey's crippling 2001 financial crisis. At that time,
Turkey reeled through an unplanned and chaotic float of the Turkish
lira, a huge International Monetary Fund bailout and soaring
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Washington supported Turkey in the IMF on the condition that
massive structural improvements be made. International investors did
not have confidence--most of them removed their capital from Turkish
markets, leaving the economy with a diminished capacity to rebuild.
Investors are still waiting for the reforms of the IMF program to
take root.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Turkey's governmental coalition could deal with the
crisis. After the November elections, it probably will not have that
luxury. An attack on Iraq would only exacerbate the tension that
exists between elected Islamists and the unelected military. This
political tension could lead to more economic trouble. With investors
already skeptical of Turkey's structural reforms, any further
instability will only reinforce their belief that the Turkish economy
cannot recover.</TE>
<TE>   Why should Washington care about Turkey's political and economic
situation? First, if U.S. actions in Iraq cause the political and
economic situation to deteriorate, Turkish popular support for an
attack (which is already very low) will disappear altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Turkey's border with Iraq is the heartland of support for
the Islamists. In the Gulf War, Turkey voluntarily shut off its
profitable oil pipelines and trade with Iraq. This caused the economy
of the area to collapse. It has recovered only with the
reestablishment of trade with Iraq, a move Washington opposed. An
Islamist government that counts on the support of this area will not
agree to such voluntary cutoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Third, this is the region where Turkey fought a bitter civil war
with the Kurds in the 1990s. An attack on Iraq would upset the
delicate balance of Turkey's relations with its own Kurds as well as
with Kurds in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Iraq, Turkey supports a fragile, quasi-independent
Kurdish entity in the hope that it will never become a state. If U.S.
plans include a Kurdish state, Turkey will withdraw its support.</TE>
<TE>   As Turkey heads for elections, Iraq is the only political issue
that unites the country. Leftists, rightists, nationalists and
Islamists all agree that an attack on Iraq now would again unleash
the specter of instability within Turkey and its volatile
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   While Turkey will give lip service to U.S. actions, the Bush
administration may find that even that will evaporate once the true
costs to the Turkish people are revealed. Without a clear plan for
dealing with the consequences of a war in Iraq on their country,
Turks will remain rightfully skeptical about why they are allowing it
to happen from their territory.</TE>

<HD>A Virus-Fed Doomsday</HD>
<DH>'Bio-Armageddon' is a possibility if U.S. hits Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT P. LAYNE and MICHAEL H. SOMMER</AU>
<BD>Scott P. Layne is an associate professor of
epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health. Michael H. Sommer
is a visiting scholar at the Institute of Governmental Studies, UC
Berkeley, and a visiting fellow at Yale University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate among the nation's politicians and the advice they're
receiving from intelligence experts should not focus exclusively on
diplomacy versus preemptive military action against Saddam Hussein.
Instead, there is one nightmarish outcome--the so-called
bio-Armageddon scenario--that is of immediate concern.</LD>
<LD>   It goes like this: We go in to take out Hussein, and his obedient
henchmen pull a "doomsday" switch, releasing contagious biological
agents for which there is no vaccine and no cure. Not only are
hundreds of thousands of American troops wiped out but, if Hussein
wishes to die a martyr's death, the virulent agents are released to
spread around the world and wipe out half of mankind.</LD>
<LD>   Even mentioning this subject may seem like scaremongering, but
it's not. In today's dicey world, this horrific possibility is a
biological, military and political fact of life--or death--that
cannot be dismissed out of hand.</LD>
<TE>   How seriously has the bio-Armageddon scenario been weighed in
councils of war? An Oct. 7 letter from CIA Director George Tenet to
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee,
stated that a cornered Hussein might use "his last chance to exact
vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him."</TE>
<TE>   It costs about $1 million to kill one person with a nuclear
weapon, about $1,000 to kill one person with a chemical weapon and
about $1 to kill one person with a biological weapon. Low cost alone
may dictate that current and future terrorists will opt for the $1
biological killers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a bombshell of a scientific paper, published in the
Journal of Virology, revealed that a bioengineered form of
mousepox--a close cousin of smallpox--was vaccine-resistant and 100%
lethal. It showed that simply inserting one immune-inhibiting gene
into mousepox was all it took.</TE>
<TE>   Is it conceivable that Hussein's well-trained scientists, who
crave to please their boss at any cost, have not read this paper and
applied its findings to smallpox?</TE>
<TE>   This year, another stunning paper in the research journal Science
described the complete synthesis of the poliovirus genome in the test
tube. This feat of bioengineering pointed out that deadly viruses,
such as smallpox, can be resurrected in the test tube. No seed germs
are required, as previously thought, just genetic sequences, training
in molecular biology at the master's-in-science level and a few years
of laboratory work.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to underestimate or sugarcoat these scientific papers.
They offer a blueprint for creating vaccine-resistant and highly
lethal viruses that could, for example, render the current smallpox
vaccine stockpile and the U.S. government's emergency vaccination
program absolutely useless. This biological genie may pose a far
greater threat than 1,000 atomic bombs.</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer hypothetical to bioengineer such an agent. And less
than $1 million would be required to create deadly and contagious
agents.</TE>
<TE>   In the wrong hands, a bioengineered virus could be bottled and
used as an insurance policy against invasion and overthrow. And, if
unleashed, it could change the very fabric of remaining modern
civilization. At a minimum, too many people might be stricken to
continue to operate oil refineries, power plants, airlines and
communications.</TE>
<TE>   A completely new appraisal and posture are needed to deal with
these threats.</TE>
<TE>   First, the U.S. needs to train and place more intelligence agents
knowledgeable in this type of warfare throughout the world, because
the work taking place in a secret offensive biological weapons
program cannot be monitored from airplanes or satellites. It must be
spied on firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   Building our biological human intelligence capabilities will take
years. It will require the scientific, law enforcement and national
security communities to finally work together, which they have shown
little inclination to do.</TE>
<TE>   Second, we need to build a high-speed/high-volume infectious
disease laboratory and information processing system that links the
molecular fingerprints of biological agents to their sources
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Such a system would provide comprehensive and rapid analyses of
biological agents and, when every moment counts, it could help to
save countless lives after an attack--both at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   If we had such a laboratory and biological sample collection
program working, we could test for the combined signatures of pox
viruses and virus-altering proteins. If, for example, the two were
found to reside in the wrong hands or places, we could take
preemptive actions.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the bottom line: Bio-Armageddon and biological blackmail
cannot continue to remain as realistic options for terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Some Pay a High Price for Taking Paid Leave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARYL RIVERS</AU>
<BD>Caryl Rivers is a professor of journalism at Boston
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paid family leave, which goes into effect in 2004 in California, is a
major step toward making the workplace family-friendly. Now what's
needed is an attitude change in the corporate culture.</LD>
<LD>   Family leave won't work if employees don't take it because they
fear they will be stigmatized as slackers. Too often, those who take
such leaves are considered unambitious and are shuttled off to
permanent sidings labeled mommy track, daddy track or
taking-care-of-granny track.</LD>
<LD>   Taking a leave can signal to a superior that you are not willing
to give your all for Consolidated Crankshaft. And there always are
others who are.</LD>
<TE>   Those who take leaves do pay a price. In 1999, management
professors Michael Judiesch and Karen Lyness of the City University
of New York issued the first major study--involving 11,815
subjects--on the effects of family leaves on managers' careers. They
found that those who took leaves over a five-year period, 1990 to
1995, received fewer promotions and salary increases than managers
who did not take them.</TE>
<TE>   If this doesn't change, everybody will lose: employers and
employees, men and women.</TE>
<TE>   Though more women than men take unpaid family leaves allowed under
federal law, it's almost certain that men will be doing so with
greater frequency.</TE>
<TE>   Men increasingly are being called on to care not only for children
but for elderly parents as well. With today's smaller families, men
may have no female siblings who will take on this chore, as sisters
often did in the past. Today, you are as likely to see a son going to
a doctor's office with an elderly parent as a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest-growing segment of the workforce is single fathers.
These men face the "mommy" problems of finding day care and getting
time off for pediatrician's appointments and soccer games.</TE>
<TE>   And more often, family finances dictate that it's Dad, not Mom,
who should take a leave. Forty percent of college-educated women
today earn more than their husbands. One couple I know had their
first child just as the wife was approaching a demanding medical
residency. The husband, who made less than his wife, took time off to
do the major child care for a year.</TE>
<TE>   A recent national survey by the Radcliffe Public Policy Center
found that men between 20 and 39 were more likely than older men to
give family matters top billing over career success. Eighty-two
percent put family first, and 71% said they would sacrifice part of
their pay to have more time with their families.</TE>
<TE>   If companies turn a deaf ear to these concerns, they will be
dramatically reducing their talent pool, turning away valuable
workers who want to have lives outside the office.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Bar Assn. recently put the issue starkly in its task
force report on work-family conflicts: "We are in danger of seeing
law firms evolve into institutions where only those who have no
family responsibilities--or worse, are willing to abandon those
responsibilities--can thrive." This assessment applies to much of
corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Family leave can be a boon to companies as well as employees.</TE>
<TE>   In today's fast-paced, globalized workplace, employee stress is a
major cost to companies. The General Motors strike of 1994, for
example, wasn't about higher wages but about workers' complaints that
they couldn't keep up the pace, physically and emotionally. Recent
nurses' strikes over mandatory overtime reflect the same concern. For
working couples, not having the flexibility to deal with family
issues is a major source of illness-producing stress.</TE>
<TE>   Companies can cut down on costs and retain good workers with
family-friendly policies, including family leaves.</TE>
<TE>   CEOs are starting to see that the family lives of their workers
are their business. Some firms are contracting with day-care
providers for special rates for their employees, and a consortium of
major U.S. companies has called for increased spending on preschool.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that such policies reduce burnout and absenteeism,
improve employee loyalty and reduce turnover. Family-friendly
policies are congenial not only to individual families but to the
health of the American economy, the bottom line and the social fabric
of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, a real bargain.</TE>

<HD>Ports Have to Go With the Flow</HD>
<DH>Our docks need new technology, not Luddites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM THIERER</AU>
<BD>Adam Thierer is director of telecommunications studies
at the Cato Institute, www.cato.org, and editor of the book "Copy
Fights: The Future of Intellectual Property in the Information Age"
(Cato Institute, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ghost of Ned Ludd haunts West Coast ports in a labor dispute that
shut down the American shipping industry until a federal court
intervened at the request of President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Whether Ludd was a real person or a mythical figure made up to
stir the passions of the masses is a subject of debate. What is
certain, however, is that a band of machine-hating textile workers
calling themselves Luddites rose up in England in 1811 and began
destroying the textile frames that they feared would render their
jobs unnecessary. As futurist Alvin Toffler points out in "The Third
Wave," the Luddites weren't the first organized labor movement to
employ such tactics.</LD>
<LD>   Workers in England had razed sawmills in 1663, smashed
ribbon-making machines in 1676 and destroyed stocking frames in 1710.
John Kay, inventor of the flying textile shuttle, fled England after
mobs destroyed his home. History is full of examples of workers
revolting when they feared that machines would replace them.</LD>
<TE>   At the heart of the West Coast labor dispute too is a fear that
automation and technological progress are bad for workers. While
dockworkers have yet to take up arms against port machinery, central
to their demands is a stipulation that their current jobs, which pay
from $80,000 to more than $100,000 a year, will not be replaced by
new systems or technologies. As the Washington Post noted, the
lockout was "less about money than ... about control of new
technology that will determine the efficiency of the ports."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, workers are fighting the use of bar-code readers,
hand-held computers and the Internet. Technologies that made it into
your local grocery store years ago still haven't found their way to
U.S. ports, largely because of union resistance. Shippers must allow
workers to do business the old-fashioned way: carry paper forms on
clipboards from container to container as they are unloaded from
ships.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, port operators around the globe adopted automated
systems and electronic verification and tracking techniques years
ago, leaving the United States in the shipping Stone Age.</TE>
<TE>   So how long can American dockworkers resist such changes? If we're
still living in the pencil-and-clipboard era 10 years from now, what
will it mean for the efficiency and competitiveness of U.S. shipping?</TE>
<TE>   Some dockworkers might not care to ponder this question, but they
should. Basic economics tells us that firms or industries that are
unable or unwilling to adapt to technological change ultimately give
way to those that can and do.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the longshore Luddites do have one thing working in
their favor as they attempt to freeze technological progress: A port
can't be easily moved or replaced. If workers made such
anti-automation demands in another sector, companies could move to a
more hospitable locale and hire workers willing to acclimate
themselves to new systems and technologies. But "voting with your
feet" is not an option for shippers. There is airborne shipping, of
course, but that would not be efficient for getting fleets of new
cars or giant slabs of steel overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements in technological productivity are the key to long-run
growth and prosperity, both for the broader economy and individual
industries. Some jobs may be displaced by technology, but it can also
create new industries and job opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Some Luddites apparently continue to believe the economic fallacy
that every technological advance will forever displace jobs held by
humans. If there were any truth to this zero-sum philosophy, it would
mean almost no one on Earth would have a job today. Doesn't that
prove Ludd and the unions wrong?</TE>

<HD>SEC's Pitt Fouls Up Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent conduct of Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, is a sharp reminder of why the nation's chief
fiscal watchdog needs watching. Despite his promises to clean up the
accounting industry, Pitt is mired in his own flagrant conflicts of
interest. He is also reported to be backpedaling on appointing a
strong independent oversight commission.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Pitt met privately with the chiefs of the accounting
firm KPMG, which Pitt had previously represented as a lawyer, and
Xerox. Both were under investigation by the commission. By meeting
with them, Pitt created the impression that the companies could
influence the SEC's investigations. Once the meetings became public,
a seemingly chastened Pitt hastened to assure lawmakers that he would
not make the same mistake again.</LD>
<LD>   But last month Pitt met with Goldman Sachs Chairman Henry M.
Paulson Jr. without bringing along any representatives of the
commission's enforcement division, even though the SEC is
investigating Goldman Sachs. Reps. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) were right to complain in an Oct. 3 letter
to Pitt that his meeting flatly contradicted his promise to avoid
even the appearance of impropriety.</LD>
<TE>   Add to Pitt's ethical indifference his bobbing and weaving on who
should head the oversight board. In July, President Bush signed an
accounting reform bill that ended the profession's self-regulation
and created an independent oversight board of five members.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times reported this week that two Democratic SEC
commissioners, Roel C. Campos and Harvey J. Goldschmid, urged Pitt to
support John H. Biggs, a champion of reform and chairman of
TIAA-CREF, one of the nation's largest pension funds, to head the
board. Last month Pitt reportedly told Biggs he supported him for the
job but later caved to anti-Biggs pressure from the accounting
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt called the stories false. Biggs might still be selected, but
the brouhaha prompted Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) to ask Bush
Wednesday to fire Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   More than just election-year politics are involved here: At a
moment when Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.) have released a report finding "systemic and catastrophic
failure" by the commission in regulating Enron, Pitt's lack of
leadership is unacceptable. This editorial page has called for his
resignation before. Pitt's recent actions strengthen the case for
removing him before he does more damage to the credibility of the
commission.</TE>

<LD>Peaceful power-sharing in Northern Ireland took a hard hit last week
when Belfast police accused members of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, of possessing documents allegedly
stolen from the British government. The leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party has demanded that British Prime Minister Tony Blair throw Sinn
Fein out of the Northern Ireland Assembly, created in 1998 when
Catholics and Protestants put together their landmark Good Friday
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Before the peace that agreement helped to bolster completely
unravels, everyone involved in this seemingly endless conflict should
take a deep breath and ask: Is Northern Ireland better off now than
when there was routine slaughter on the streets? The answer is yes.
Indeed, since the cease-fire was reinstated in July 1997, the IRA's
guns and bombs have remained silent.</LD>
<LD>   People may wonder why the paramilitary IRA continues to exist when
politics have made so much progress. The unionists are essentially
right in responding that it shouldn't. But at least the IRA has begun
to comply with the peace agreement, twice submitting to a disarmament
process. By the same token, paramilitary groups on the other side
cannot claim a clean slate. As the British secretary for Northern
Ireland has noted, "the majority of the killings and riots have been
the work not of the republicans but of loyalists."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the problems on both sides, self-rule through the
power-sharing assembly has created peace, and that has energized the
economy and made life better for the average citizen, Catholic or
Protestant. The collapse of the assembly would only create a
political vacuum. Those who advocate mistrust, violence and hate
would no doubt step in.</TE>
<TE>   Ulster's police chief has apologized for the way the raid against
Sinn Fein was conducted, but the charges remain alarming. If Sinn
Fein officials were indeed spying for the IRA, gathering information
that terrorists could use, the punishment must be harsh. But the
charges have yet to be proved in a courtroom, and Sinn Fein is
entitled to due process. And while Sinn Fein does its explaining--and
it has plenty of explaining to do--the assembly should keep working
and the peace process should continue.</TE>
<TE>   Cynical hard-liners on either side rejoice at the damage the Sinn
Fein bust has done to the Good Friday agreement. Which makes it all
the more urgent for moderates and those ambivalent Northern Irish the
British press calls "waverers" to come out unequivocally in support
of staying the course for peace.</TE>

<HD>Vote No on Proposition 52</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Voter participation in the United States is declining alarmingly even
though the 2000 presidential election demonstrated anew the
importance of each vote. In California, the turnout for March's
primary elections was the lowest ever for statewide balloting.
Nationwide, people 30 and under are the least likely to vote. Fixing
this is more complicated than opening polling places to voting-day
registration.</LD>
<LD>   In California, anyone who is not now on the voting rolls has until
the end of the business day Oct. 21 to sign up to vote Nov. 5. Even
though that is a shorter deadline than in the past, many election
officials believe that the biggest impediment to voting remains the
voter registration system. Rob McKay of San Francisco, an heir to a
Taco Bell fortune and a thoughtful and conscientious man, also
believes that. He is the prime sponsor of Proposition 52, which would
allow those who were unregistered to walk into a polling place on
election day and vote after showing evidence they resided in the
precinct.</LD>
<TE>   In an ideal world this would be fine; smaller states have such
systems. But there are too many unanswered questions and potential
risks under McKay's plan. Californians should vote no on 52. At the
same time, they should urge the state Legislature and the next
secretary of state to make registration as easy as possible and to
target young potential voters while guarding against fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, a voter not on a precinct roll can cast a provisional
ballot, which is set aside and not counted until election officials
can confirm the voter's registration. Under Proposition 52, the
unregistered who showed up at the polls would cast a live ballot. It
would go into the hopper with everyone else's. There is no way to
fish out that vote, check it and cast it aside as invalid, even in a
recount.</TE>
<TE>   The measure's sponsors contend that there is little likelihood of
voter fraud, which has seldom been a problem in California. But with
same-day registration, one side in a hot local contest could round up
nonresidents or noncitizens and supply them with phony
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 52 requires a driver's license or two other documents
such as utility or credit card bills listing the name and address of
the would-be voter. At present, Californians do not need to show any
identification in registering to vote because the waiting period
allows time to check questionable registrations. Minnesota's
secretary of state says she believes her state's same-day law has
increased fraud but that convictions are hard to get even in
documented cases.</TE>
<TE>   Registration is not very difficult now. Sign-up cards are
displayed in public places from Department of Motor Vehicles offices
to the post office. They're even in supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Potential voters, especially young people, don't bother to vote
for many reasons. Voter registration efforts should focus more keenly
on 18-year-olds because once people vote, they're more likely to keep
voting. For now, however, vote no on Proposition 52.</TE>

<LD>President Bush has abandoned the Kyoto Protocol, which strives to
alleviate global pollution; turned Nevada's Yucca Mountain into our
country's nuclear waste dump; converted our budget surplus into a
deficit with a $300 tax refund, which had no impact whatsoever on our
economy; wants to tap into Alaska's North Slope for oil that won't
make a bit of difference in our reliance on foreign crude; abandons
his own resolve by consulting with his father on more issues each
day; ignores the increasing unemployment and crashing economy;
somehow declared overnight a new enemy, switching from Osama bin
Laden to Saddam Hussein without anyone asking why; and now is
bringing us to the brink of a major war while asking Congress for
dictator-like control over wartime decision-making.</LD>
<LD>   Can somebody please remind me why I voted for this guy?</LD>

<TE>   After 9/11, not reckoning with Hussein would be the equivalent of
the U.S. during World War II not reckoning with Germany and Italy
after being attacked at Pearl Harbor by only Japan. Back then, the
"greatest generation" of Americans had no problem realizing whom they
were at war with. Will it take yet another horrendous act from the
groups and countries sworn to our destruction before this generation
of Americans is willing to follow in the heroic footsteps of their
fathers and grandfathers?</TE>

<TE>   On Oct. 4, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) gave a wonderful,
succinct speech on why the Congress should resist giving this
president any more power than he already has. We must resist any
effort on the part of this administration to stampede Congress into
giving him extraordinary power to begin a war without the consent of
the people. As Byrd pointed out, the ramifications involving future
administrations are mind-boggling.</TE>
<TE>   The war drum beats on as we are warned time after time the
boogeyman is going to get us. But sometimes I wonder who the real
boogeyman is.</TE>

<TE>   I do not like Hussein. I would be delighted if he choked on a
bone. However, there are several other persons, closer to home, who
have through ignorance or occasional malice harmed me in the past and
who could possibly harm me again. I do not have the right to
unilaterally take them out. And that is a good thing. For if I had
that right, so would all other individuals have the right to take
drastic, preemptive action against their perceived enemies. The
result would be lawlessness and chaos.</TE>
<TE>   There has always been and always will be danger in the world. But
we must not give in to fear, and the preemptive strike is a policy of
fear. It will not provide us with a safer world, but with a more
dangerous and lawless one in which fear drives all to commit acts of
preemptive aggression.</TE>

<TE>   In commenting on the possible reactions of other countries to the
implementation of the Bush Doctrine of striking first (Commentary,
Oct. 8), James Pinkerton noted that "future historians will be
studying [Bush's] words closely." If other powerful countries use the
Bush Doctrine, and perhaps nuclear weapons, to deal with perceived
threats, the world, not the Middle East, will be a hot spot. This
leads one to ask the question: What future historians?</TE>

<TE>   Christopher Layne's (Opinion, Oct. 6) preoccupation with "The
Power Paradox"--the baneful effects of America's menacing
hegemony--underestimates a salient lesson of history. Forget about
the inevitable "blowback" from America's "geopolitical preeminence";
wait till you see the catastrophic implosion that occurs when America
abrogates its beneficent responsibility in stabilizing an
increasingly volatile world. The original "offensive realist,"
Winston Churchill, warned us against a government "decided only to be
undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for
fluidity, all powerful to be impotent."</TE>

<HD>Attacks on Gay Men Not Classified as Hate Crimes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "W. Hollywood Attack Ruled No Hate Crime," Oct. 4: Just when
residents of Los Angeles County thought justice might be served,
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley has dealt us a serious blow. The city of
West Hollywood had three hate crime attacks in the past month. In one
case, a man's head was beaten with bats and pipes. His brain swelled
and he was put in a coma. His life changed forever. Two other serious
attacks in West Hollywood followed--crimes where innocent men were
beaten with bats on the street.</LD>
<LD>   The residents and West Hollywood sheriff's station were in shock,
the people of the city frightened and outraged. We saw a police
presence like never before. Citizens were proud that the justice
system was working for them. Many generous individuals donated money
to a reward fund. Soon posters and information flooded the city.
There was an outcry of people desperate for justice.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, a break. Arrests made. The people rejoiced: "The system
works!" Then a shocking announcement: Cooley will not pursue hate
crime charges. No evidence it was a hate crime, he declares. Three
men in West Hollywood beaten near death. Does that sound like a
common mugging? Surely not. By his office's account, the men were
just looking to rob rich white people. Hate crimes are supposed to
protect people when the crime is motivated by race, religion, etc. I
guess white people have no protection.</LD>
<TE>   Troy Bolstad</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After hearing Cooley's reasons for refusing to classify the
attacks on identifiably gay men within view of gay nightspots in West
Hollywood as hate crimes, I'd be more than interested to hear his
take on why the beating of a defenseless human being to within an
inch of his life with a baseball bat is merely "assault with a deadly
weapon" rather than "attempted murder."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the D.A. needs a consult with Treve Broudy's doctors to
set him straight on what was done to the man. Broudy survived with
life-altering injuries solely because the brutal beating was
interrupted and the perpetrators were frightened off by an
approaching vehicle. Otherwise, there would have been no "attempted"
about it.</TE>

<LD>It would have been better to stick with "pests" in "Ridding the MTA
of Pests" (Oct. 7) rather than to go on to describe men who grope in
buses as "perverts," "molesters" and even "sexual predators." In
Italy, half the male population seems to engage in such acts. If it's
as rampant here as the article says, does it make sense to label so
many men "perverts"? Italian women throw screaming fits over such
pests--it stops them in their tracks. Why is it that we prim
Americans, according to the article, utter not a peep?</LD>
<LD>   I'd rather women show some spunk than pay tax dollars to support
the MTA "perv" patrol. After these guys get convicted of felonies and
appear on the Megan's Law list and sex-offender Web maps, are we then
supposed to bite our nails when one of them happens to live down the
street? Puritanism is alive and well in the U.S.</LD>

<TE>   I was disappointed to find, where your article continued on A17,
that a picture of the sign posted in an MTA bus had a graffiti tag
sticker as the central focus. Was there another sign that did not
have graffiti? If not, the photographer could have removed the
sticker before taking the photo. Graffiti in L.A. gets enough
advertisement on the freeways without having a front-page article
lead the reader to more graffiti. I'm sure the sticker artist loved
the free publicity.</TE>

<LD>"Critics See Wasted Time in Punishment of Tardy Students" (Oct. 5)
was incredibly one-sided. You really should have interviewed a higher
percentage of the folks who see "tardy rooms" as a valuable tool in
deterring student tardiness. Our high school (San Pedro High School)
recently instituted a period-one tardy period. It works!</LD>
<LD>   I have taught with the Los Angeles Unified School District for 15
years. Tardiness has always been a correctable problem, but many
schools refuse to be visionary enough to take the plunge. We recently
passed the five-week mark of the fall semester and only one student
has been tardy once to my first-period class. Once! Trust me, that is
a small but glorious miracle! Those tardy rooms are a giant reminder
to students to get to class on time.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, there are no disruptions from tardy, bitter students.
Education flows freely. Let the critics criticize. Our tardy policy
is working!</LD>

<LD>Re "20-Year Sentence for Lindh," Oct. 5: John Walker Lindh was
clearly misguided in joining the Taliban prior to 9/11 and taking up
its cause. He may have unintentionally violated U.S. law, which might
warrant punishment, but the 20-year sentence handed down was
unfortunately wrapped in the hysteria and politics of revenge.</LD>
<LD>   Bringing in the murder of CIA agent Johnny "Mike" Spann and 9/11,
which Lindh had no part in, during sentencing was meant to help
justify this to the public.</LD>
<LD>   It should be noted that almost all of the original Afghan Taliban
soldiers, who were clearly more culpable that Lindh, were released by
the new government back to their villages.</LD>

<HD>Law Doesn't Allow Tracing Bullets to Killers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the killings in Maryland ("Sniper Critically Injures
Teenage Boy," Oct. 8): Thanks to National Rifle Assn. lobbying, law
enforcement officials are forbidden to use technology that could let
them trace bullets used in shootings to the people who bought the
guns--even though such technology exists. Just as fingerprints and
DNA can be used to identify people who commit crimes, unique markings
on bullets and shell casings can be used to trace every bullet
recovered from a shooting to the gun that was used. All that would be
required is for manufacturers, when they test-fire each gun at the
end of the manufacturing process, to keep an electronic record of the
unique markings made by each gun along with the serial number of each
gun.</LD>
<LD>   If such records were kept, law enforcement officials could use
these records to trace the bullets recovered from the shootings (in
Maryland and throughout the country) to the guns that fired them. And
they could follow the gun by serial number from the manufacturer to
the dealer and finally to the person who bought the gun used in the
shooting.</LD>
<LD>   But thanks to lobbying by the National Rifle Assn., Congress
actually outlawed record-keeping of the markings of guns. It's part
of the Gun Control Act of 1968. Thank you, NRA, for making it hard to
find out who fires the guns that kill people.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks for helping to make America safe for serial (and other)
killers.</TE>

<HD>Buddy Lester, 86; Comic Appeared in TV, Films</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buddy Lester, stand-up comedian and character actor on television and
in motion pictures starring Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis, has died.
He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Lester died Friday of cancer in a Van Nuys nursing home, his
family said.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Chicago, Lester was a fixture on the international
nightclub circuit for seven decades. In Las Vegas, he opened for
Sinatra several times and appeared with the singer in such "Rat Pack"
films as the 1960 "Ocean's Eleven" and the 1962 "Sergeants Three."</LD>
<TE>   Later that decade Lester appeared with Lewis in four films, "The
Nutty Professor," "The Patsy," "Three on a Couch" and "The Big
Mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Lester made his film debut playing himself as an entertainer in
the 1959 movie "The Gene Krupa Story," starring Sal Mineo.</TE>
<TE>   The comedian proved even more popular on television, and was a
part of the regular cast of "The New Phil Silvers Show" in 1963-64.
Lester also acted in several episodes of such police series as
"Adam-12" and "Barney Miller," and became a familiar face through his
work in shows such as "Love, American Style," "The New Dick Van Dyke
Show," "The Odd Couple" and "Starsky and Hutch."</TE>
<TE>   A handsome man with dark hair, Lester could assume mockingly
menacing personas because of a somewhat mysterious scar to the right
of his mouth. He delighted in making up various stories about how he
acquired it.</TE>
<TE>   He frequently said he got the scar when he was blown off a barge
at Guadalcanal. He once used it to intimidate beefy rabble-rousers at
a nearby table when he was watching friends on stage in a Chicago
nightclub. And in a New York hotel, he told a group of Germans that
he got the scar in a fencing duel while he was a student in
Heidelberg.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, he confessed to the now-defunct Los Angeles Mirror in
1961, was: "I fell off a chair onto a broken water glass when I was 3
years old."</TE>
<TE>   Lester once considered plastic surgery to erase the mark, but
changed his mind after a movie makeup artist liked it so much that he
enlarged it for Lester's scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Lester is survived by his son, Paul; daughter, Sylvia Jensen; four
grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</TE>
<GT></GT>

but got it in a fall at age 3.</CP>

<HD>2 High-Profile Cases Heard by Appeals Panel</HD>
<DH>Rights: The 2nd District appellate jurists listen to trial
issues concerning a Simi Valley rapist and an Oxnard man who was
cleared in a Santa Barbara shooting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking up two high-profile cases from Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties, a state appellate court heard arguments Wednesday on the
rights of crime suspects to avoid jury trials versus the rights of
prosecutors to pursue their cases in court.</LD>
<LD>   The cases involve a Simi Valley serial rapist who wants to plead
guilty to murder without specifying a degree of the crime and a man
cleared in a Santa Barbara shooting whom prosecutors want the right
to retry.</LD>
<LD>   After being rejected by a lower court, attorneys for serial rapist
and accused killer Vincent Sanchez are asking justices at the 2nd
District Court of Appeal in Ventura to allow their client to plead
guilty to murder.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez could face the death penalty if a jury finds him guilty of
first-degree murder and special allegations that he killed
20-year-old Megan Barroso during a kidnapping and rape attempt last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has admitted killing the woman. But he denies that he
tried to abduct or rape her.</TE>
<TE>   On three occasions he has attempted to plead guilty or no contest
and accept a life prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors, who want the death penalty, say they cannot
fathom how the case would proceed if Sanchez were allowed to plead to
"plain" murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant contemplates that he can plead guilty to murder
without specifying degree, notwithstanding that the people have
[alleged] murder in the first degree," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela
Henke-Dobroth argued Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County prosecutor told the justices there is no legal
precedent for Sanchez's request. And she argued that the public has a
right to a jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn said the law does
allow for such a plea and urged the justices to grant his request.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old handyman, already is facing life in prison
after pleading guilty to numerous sex-assault charges last year.</TE>
<TE>   After Henke-Dobroth and Quinn stepped away from the podium, the
justices called a second murder case in which prosecutors in Santa
Barbara are also fighting for the right to a jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly five years ago Oxnard resident Efren Cruz, now 28, was
convicted of second-degree murder, attempted murder and possession of
a dagger in connection with a shooting at a downtown Santa Barbara
parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, Cruz filed a petition of habeas corpus alleging
that new evidence would prove his cousin, Gerardo Reyes, to have been
the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-month hearing, Santa Barbara County Superior Court
Judge Frank Ochoa, who presided over Cruz's first trial, found the
new evidence persuasive. Ochoa set aside Cruz's conviction and
ordered him set free.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors dismissed the case, but outside the courtroom insisted
that they still had a right to retry Cruz as the shooter. Ochoa then
issued a supplemental order barring prosecutors from such a retrial
based on double-jeopardy protections under state and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara County district attorney appealed that ruling
and posed an unprecedented question to the appellate court: Can
prosecutors retry a man for pulling the trigger in a deadly shooting
after a judge ruled he was innocent?</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald McC. Franklin told the justices
that a judge's ruling in a habeas corpus hearing is a far cry from a
jury's verdict and does not equate to an acquittal, which would bar
prosecutors from a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura defense attorney Kevin DeNoce argued that Ochoa's
finding that Cruz was not the shooter constitutes an acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   DeNoce said that when prosecutors dismiss a case on grounds of
insufficient evidence, the law precludes them from a retrial.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Fans Have a Guardian Angel to Ride Along With Them</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Gene Autry, the team's first owner, is still an
emotional keystone for the franchise during its playoff run. 'The
Cowboy' died in 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball is a game of statistics, but fans will tell you it's also a
game of superstition, in which changes in ritual invite changes in
luck and fresh socks can suck the life out of a winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   So it's not that much of a leap for high-flying Anaheim Angels
fans to believe late owner Gene Autry is still around, a
guitar-strumming angel in the outfield shepherding his beloved team
through its surprise run for the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "I do feel it," said Russ Frazier of Lake Forest, a board member
of the Anaheim Angels Booster Club. "I think there's an emotion that
has been carrying on for a long time to see it done, to see them win
one for the Cowboy. They've got an angel up there negotiating with
St. Peter to do something for us down here."</LD>
<TE>   If the team has a guardian angel, it's Autry, the onetime Oklahoma
telegraph operator who mixed a gentle singing voice and a
romanticized vision of the Wild West to create an entertainment
juggernaut.</TE>
<TE>   When he was done singing and acting, Autry made the conversion to
entrepreneur, amassing a fortune through investments, broadcast
outlets and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But before the money, almost before the singing, there was
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   As a youth, Autry was such a promising player that the St. Louis
Cardinals offered him a tryout. Music and the movies became his
career, though.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with "In Old Santa Fe" in 1934, Autry appeared in more
than 90 films and made more than 600 recordings, including the first
certified gold record, "That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine," released
in 1932, and the first platinum record, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," released in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   When Autry became rich enough, he indulged his early love and in
1960 bought his own baseball team--the expansion Los Angeles
Angels--in a roundabout effort to gain sports programming for his
radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Autry styled himself as the kind of owner who hired people to run
his team, then let them do their jobs while he enjoyed the games.
Autry became a fixture, sharing the bench with managers and
ballplayers during batting practice, then keeping score from the
owner's suite during games.</TE>
<TE>   It was a vexing love. The Angels reached the playoffs three times
during Autry's tenure and lost each time. In 1996, advancing age and
a quantum shift in the economics of the game led Autry to sell to

<TE>   He died two years later on Oct. 2, 1998, a week after the Angels
were eliminated from the American League West playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Even in death, Autry remains the soul of the team for many fans,
an affection that grew from his overt love for the game and his
openness.</TE>
<TE>   "He had such a personable attitude with both the players and fans
that he was like a father figure, really," said Barbara Phillips, an
Angels fan since the early 1980s. "That's kind of the feeling that
has carried over with the fans when they say to win one [World
Series] for Gene."</TE>
<TE>   More than an owner, Autry was the visible face of the team in a
sport dominated by athletes chasing the next big contract. The
players came and went, but Autry was always on hand, sharing the
annual disappointments with fans.</TE>
<TE>   Autry's entertainment background helped bridge the customary
divide between owner and customer. At ease with fans, Autry sought
out their company. Longtime Angel boosters tell of running into Autry
in Palm Springs and then Tempe, Ariz., during spring training, where
they shared late-night drinks and cowboy songs in hotel bars and
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, under Autry's ownership, also arranged off-season
ocean cruises in which fans--including Phillips--mingled with players
and their wives, forging deeply rooted connections. To this day, many
fans have autographed pictures of Autry to go along with those of
favorite players.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, the boosters had a get-together up in his dining room
in the stadium," Phillips said. "He came up to see what was going on,
and he was such a delightful man he even sang for us. How down to
earth is that?"</TE>
<TE>   The number 26, representing Autry's symbolic standing as 26th
player on a 25-man roster, hangs in the outfield at Edison
International Field, and a life-size Autry statue--right hand thrust
forward in a welcoming greeting--stands inside the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels were an extension of him," said Jeff Horel, 26, of
Huntington Beach. "He was more than an owner, he was folk hero."</TE>
<TE>   Autry's continuing popularity, even after his death, adds an extra
texture to the predictable fan yearning for a successful season.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think they are all hoping and praying that this year will be
what Gene had hoped for all along," Phillips said. "But the memories
that Gene implanted in the club, that will probably always be there
even if they don't win."</TE>
<TE>   Eli Grba was Autry's first Angel, taken from the Yankees in the
1960 expansion draft and the starting pitcher in the Angels'
inaugural game, a 7-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on April 11,
1961.</TE>
<TE>   From his home in Athens, Ala., Grba has watched the Angels'
playoff progress--including their surprise elimination of the
Yankees, a series that gave Grba two teams to root for. He leaned
toward the Angels, in part because of Autry's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been a guy that sticks for the underdog, and when we
got there [in '61] we were the underdogs," said Grba, who ended a
sporadic career as a minor league coach in 1997. "And Gene Autry was
a wonderful man. He treated me very well. He used to come to my house
when I lived near LAX and we were playing at [Los Angeles'] Wrigley
Field."</TE>
<TE>   That ballpark, which used to stand in South-Central Los Angeles,
was torn down in the mid-'60s after the Angels moved on, first
sharing space at Dodger Stadium then heading to Anaheim in 1966.
Grba's affection for Autry and the Angels remains, and he sides with
the faithful in their belief that 41 years of jinxes,
under-performances and physical flops are over.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboy will sing again.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the hereafter and all that, within reason," Grba

<HD>'Win One for the Cowboy' Is Still a Battle Cry in Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Gene Autry, the Angels' first owner, remains an
emotional keystone during the team's playoff run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball is a game of statistics, but fans will tell you it's also a
game of superstition, in which changes in ritual invite changes in
luck and fresh socks can suck the life out of a winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   So it's not that much of a leap for high-flying Anaheim Angels
fans to believe late owner Gene Autry is still around, a
guitar-strumming angel in the outfield shepherding his beloved team
through its surprise run for the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "I do feel it," said Russ Frazier of Lake Forest, a board member
of the Anaheim Angels Booster Club. "I think there's an emotion that
has been carrying on for a long time to see it done, to see them win
one for the Cowboy. They've got an angel up there negotiating with
St. Peter to do something for us down here."</LD>
<TE>   If the team has a guardian angel, it's Autry, the onetime Oklahoma
telegraph operator who mixed a gentle singing voice and a
romanticized vision of the Wild West to create an entertainment
juggernaut.</TE>
<TE>   When he was done singing and acting, Autry made the conversion to
entrepreneur, amassing a fortune through investments, broadcast
outlets and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But before the money, almost before the singing, there was
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   As a youth, Autry was such a promising player that the St. Louis
Cardinals offered him a tryout. Music and the movies became his
career, though.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with "In Old Santa Fe" in 1934, Autry appeared in more
than 90 films and made more than 600 recordings, including the first
certified gold record, "That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine," released
in 1932, and the first platinum record, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," released in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   When Autry became rich enough, he indulged his early love and in
1960 bought his own baseball team--the expansion Los Angeles
Angels--in a roundabout effort to gain sports programming for his
radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Autry styled himself as the kind of owner who hired people to run
his team, then let them do their jobs while he enjoyed the games.
Autry became a fixture, sharing the bench with managers and players
during batting practice, then keeping score from the owner's suite
during games.</TE>
<TE>   It was a vexing love. The Angels reached the playoffs three times
during Autry's tenure and lost each time. In 1996, advancing age and
a quantum shift in the economics of the game led Autry to sell to
Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   He died two years later on Oct. 2, 1998, a week after the Angels
were eliminated from the American League West playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Even in death, Autry remains the soul of the team for many fans,
an affection that grew from his overt love for the game and his
openness.</TE>
<TE>   "He had such a personable attitude with both the players and fans
that he was like a father figure, really," said Barbara Phillips, an

<HD>Help May Be on the Way for Health System</HD>
<DH>Finance: Although no commitments are made, state and
federal officials say they may be able to help close Los Angeles
County's funding gap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials received encouragement from state and
federal officials Wednesday that aid may be coming for their ailing
health system but got no financial commitments to patch a massive
projected deficit.</LD>
<LD>   They also were urged to delay a vote on closing hospitals and
making other cutbacks until after the November elections.</LD>
<LD>   The county Department of Health Services faces a deficit projected
to reach between $500 million and $750 million in three years.</LD>
<TE>   The county's top officers met in Washington with federal health
financing officials to present a multiyear $1.4-billion bailout
proposal that a key Bush administration official had dismissed last
week. Though federal officials were noncommittal, they said they did
not want to see hospitals closed and urged that supervisors delay any
major decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis, amid a campaign for reelection,
huddled in Los Angeles with Supervisors Gloria Molina and Zev
Yaroslavsky. He had earlier been chastised by fellow Democrat Molina
for not being attentive enough to the woes of the nation's
second-largest public health system.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Davis said that he was open to calling a
special legislative session in January to address the Los Angeles
County health-care crisis and that he hopes to put together some aid
for the county by mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to keep the public system together, viable and
serving the people of L.A. County," Davis said during a telephone
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Later, however, a spokesman clarified that the governor had not
committed to holding a special session.</TE>
<TE>   "He's open to it if he sees a need for it," Davis spokesman Steve
Maviglio said. "If there's a way to avoid it, I think he will. Much
of it depends on what the feds do between now and then."</TE>
<TE>   Despite requests to delay further cutbacks, county officials said
late Wednesday that they were not ready to call off their scheduled
Oct. 29 vote on closing Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-UCLA Medical
Centers.</TE>
<TE>   County health analysts say that in order to realize savings from
shutting hospitals, the lengthy process of closing them must start
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "A vote on Oct. 29 is reversible," Yaroslavsky said, if state or
federal aid comes through. "A delay of two or three months is not
reversible" if aid is not forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   The county may also get political benefits from moving forward
with cuts, though Yaroslavsky denied that was a motive. It may be in
a better position to pry funds out of Washington and Sacramento, and
voters may be more likely to approve a $168-million parcel tax that
supervisors placed on the November ballot to fund emergency and
trauma care.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky called Wednesday's meetings incremental progress,
saying that much work remains to be done. "This is all part of a
mosaic that we have to piece together," he said. "To save the Los
Angeles County health system, there are federal, state and local
components."</TE>
<TE>   The immense deficit results from the cost of providing medical
care to 600,000 uninsured patients annually and delays in reforms
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Immediate cuts approved in June, including closure of 11 clinics,
brought the projected deficit down by about $50 million, to $750
million in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Other cuts expected to take effect over time could pare it to
about $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   County health planners had expected Wednesday's meetings to be key
in determining whether supervisors should proceed with another round
of far more dire cuts. But after a 2 1/2-hour meeting in Washington
with federal health financing officials, they said it is too soon to
tell.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it went reasonably well, and we don't have any
commitments," said county health Director Dr. Thomas Garthwaite after
the meeting. "We do have a commitment to work further, dig into the
data and explore any alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   David Janssen, the county's chief administrative officer, said
that a week of follow-up meetings is needed. "You can't imagine how
complicated all of this stuff is and how many moving parts, between
the state, the county and the feds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County officials went to Washington with trepidation. Tom Scully,
administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, last
week ruled out a significant bailout. But the county said the meeting
was not decisive. "No doors were closed," county health spokesman
John Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   Scully has indicated that he would rather see Los Angeles County
get its money from the state, but California is wrestling with a
projected $15-billion budget deficit next year.</TE>

<HD>Bail Denied for Blake, Held Since April</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Judge says prosecutors showed enough evidence that
actor killed his wife. Defense lawyer will ask high court to
reconsider.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County judge denied bail for Robert Blake on Wednesday,
saying that prosecutors presented adequate proof to show that the
actor killed his wife last year in an ambush near a Studio City
restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash said he would reconsider
Blake's motion for bail after the preliminary hearing, now set to
begin Dec. 11 in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, said he would ask the state
Supreme Court next week to override Nash's decision and grant bail to
the 69-year-old defendant.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think that is what the Supreme Court had in mind," Braun
said outside the Van Nuys courthouse. Last week, the state high court
ordered Nash to hold a hearing to determine whether Blake was
entitled to a bail hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has been held without bail at Men's Central Jail in downtown
Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest in the murder of Bonny Lee
Bakley, 44. The former star of the 1970s television series "Baretta"
has pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting murder,
conspiracy and the special circumstance of lying in wait.</TE>
<TE>   Without the capital murder charge, Blake would be eligible for
release. He faces life in prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick Dixon argued that the
evidence against Blake is substantial. He said Blake asked two
retired stuntmen to kill Bakley, and when they refused, the actor
told one of them he would do it himself. Blake also suggested a
scenario for killing his wife that is stunningly similar to what
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said Blake told a stuntman that his wife could be killed
while waiting in a parked car, possibly near a restaurant, like
Vitello's in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley was shot twice on May 4, 2001, inside Blake's car a few
blocks from the restaurant. Blake told police he left Bakley in his
car and returned to Vitello's after dinner to retrieve a handgun he
left. When he got back to the car, he said, he found Bakley bleeding
from the head.</TE>
<TE>   "She was taken by ambush. She was taken by surprise," Dixon said.
"Robert Blake is the person who did this."</TE>
<TE>   But Braun said prosecutors lacked physical evidence linking Blake
to the crime. He also charged them with providing "misleading"
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, police found a 100-count box of 9-millimeter
cartridges with three missing at Blake's home. Three 9-millimeter
shells were found at the crime scene, but Braun said they did not
match the ones found at Blake's home.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be incredibly incriminating evidence if they matched the
gun," Braun said outside court. Earlier, he suggested to the judge
that someone was trying to frame Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Braun also rejected tests that show Blake had gunshot residue on
his clothing. He cited a police report stating that "the presence or
absence of gunshot residue on surfaces other than bare hands is
unfounded and possibly misleading."</TE>
<TE>   And Braun discounted the prosecution's effort to link a
German-made World War I-era pistol found in the home of Blake's
co-defendant, Earle S. Caldwell, with the murder weapon, a
German-made World War II handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, Irvine attorney Eric J. Dubin, who
represents the Bakley family, said he plans to depose Blake in the
next few months--probably from inside jail--in the wrongful death
lawsuit filed on behalf of Bakley's four children.</TE>

<HD>Simon Error Enough to Send Him Back to the Minor Leagues</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's one thing not to hit a home run. It's disastrous to hit a weak
grounder with the game on the line and fall down running to first.</LD>
<LD>   Or, to switch metaphors: Bill Simon needed to land a knockout
punch. Instead, he swung wildly and stumbled into the other guy's
corner on his butt.</LD>
<LD>   Simon was cruising along in Monday's televised debate at The
Times, bobbing and weaving. He seemed relaxed and was landing an
occasional jab, although Gov. Gray Davis clearly was ahead on points
with his command of details.</LD>
<TE>   Then Simon swung wildly. He should never have asked Davis the
question: "Have you ever accepted a campaign contribution in the
state Capitol or in any of your government offices? ... Yes or no?"</TE>
<TE>   That would have been illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Davis: "I have conducted myself within the law."</TE>
<TE>   Simon: "You didn't answer my question.... "</TE>
<TE>   Right there, two things came to mind:</TE>
<TE>   * This is a question Simon strategists had been trying to plant
with reporters for months. The reporters I know didn't bite,
realizing they were being set up. We aren't into reckless
accusations. If Simon had the evidence, let him produce it.</TE>
<TE>   * So Simon must have the evidence, I thought, sitting there as one
of the debate questioners. And he was about to lay it out. Why else
would he suggest the governor was guilty of a crime during a debate?</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because he was desperate and irresponsible, as it turns out.</TE>
<TE>   The best you can say for Simon is that he and his advisors were
delusional, believing what they desperately wanted to believe. The
worst is that this former federal prosecutor realized his evidence
was weak, but thought he'd let the jury sort it out and maybe get
lucky. Irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   Simon might have gotten away with it. But, says one advisor, "he
got a little bit out in front of himself."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate himself never should have accused Davis. Instead he
should have deferred to the actual accuser, the California
Organization of Police and Sheriffs. COPS would have thrown the first
blow and, after seeing the impact, Simon could have decided whether
to pile on and pummel away.</TE>
<TE>   But at a post-debate news conference, Simon announced he did,
indeed, have the evidence. An aide soon produced a letter from COPS
to the state Fair Political Practices Commission. It alleged that in
1998, a former COPS executive gave Davis a $10,000 check in his
lieutenant governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Davis denied it. The former COPS exec denied it. So did Davis
strategist Garry South, who also allegedly was there, but insists he
wasn't. Some case: no eyewitnesses.</TE>
<TE>   But COPS claimed it had two pictures of Davis accepting the money
in his Capitol office. Photographs don't lie, Simon proclaimed. And
right he was: Those were not pictures of the lieutenant governor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   They were taken in the Santa Monica home of a Davis supporter, the
governor said unequivocally Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon didn't know what he was talking about and never bothered to
check.</TE>
<TE>   One result: the California Prosecutors Assn. on Wednesday endorsed
Davis. "With his reckless and unfounded accusations [Simon] exhibited
the type of leadership that California does not need," said Jim
Shore, the prosecutors' president.</TE>
<TE>   COPS and its consultant have received nearly $445,000 from the
Simon camp, presumably to promote the candidate. The outfit endorsed
Simon after Davis rejected its demand for $100,000 to promote him on
a "slate mailer" in the primary, South says.</TE>
<TE>   Which is worse? Receiving campaign money in a state office or cops
working a political protection scheme?</TE>
<TE>   What was Simon thinking? Maybe not much. But his advisors were.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 strategist Ed Rollins, a veteran of many election battles,
knew reporters would write that underdog Simon needed a home run--or
a knockout punch--to catch Davis. But Rollins figured they'd see
Simon as only holding his own, at best.</TE>
<TE>   So he devised the Capitol contribution strategy. Shake things up.
Focus more attention on Davis' unsavory fund-raising. Back in New
Jersey, after all, Sen. Robert Torricelli had just been forced out of
his reelection race because of an ethics scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the issue we have to drive," Rollins told me before the
photos fiasco. "In the end, people are going to say education's
cruddy, roads are cruddy, the governor's cruddy. He's cruddy because
he spends all his time raising money."</TE>
<TE>   But in a debate, never ask your opponent a question unless you're
sure of the answer.</TE>
<TE>   It was another self-inflicted wound by Simon, and this one's
probably mortal.</TE>
<TE>   Simon had railed about wanting a debate in prime time, rather than
at noon when it was held. But that unfortunate question--and
post-game interview--showed he's not ready for prime time.</TE>
<TE>   He's not ready for the bigs. Still needs work in rookie ball.</TE>

<HD>Death Wasn't Intended, Defense Insists</HD>
<DH>Trial: Oak View teen's role in transient's beating doesn't
warrant first-degree murder conviction, lawyer argues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View teenager accused of beating a homeless veteran to death
is guilty of taking part in the attack, but he had no intention of
killing James Clark, defense attorneys said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a whodunit," lawyer James
Farley told jurors Wednesday during closing arguments in the trial of
Robert Coffman, 19. "He did commit the crime. It's up to you to
decide what is the degree of this crime."</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys are asking for a second-degree murder
conviction, while prosecutors maintain Coffman is guilty of
first-degree murder. A first-degree conviction could result in a
decade more in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Coffman is one of four teenagers accused of kicking and throwing
rocks at Clark, who was 58, as they headed to a beach party June 30,
2001. Clark died of blows to the head as he lay in a sleeping bag
near the Ventura River bottom.</TE>
<TE>   All four defendants, ages 14 to 19, were charged with murder. The
youngest was convicted earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Using a high-tech presentation and several graphic photographs of
the victim and crime scene, a prosecutor called for the jury to find
Coffman guilty of first-degree murder. Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy
Ratner argued that his willful, deliberate and premeditated actions
made his crime a first-degree offense.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman is also charged with robbery and attempted murder in the
stabbing of Daniel McGrath, 19, at the Ventura beach promenade a day
after Clark's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "It is, I think, an understatement that they had a conscious
disregard for this man's life," Ratner said. "You can't stand around
and watch people kick someone over and over in the head and not
expect that they won't die."</TE>
<TE>   Farley countered that if Coffman had intended to kill Clark, he
would have used the knife he carried that night.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, jurors saw a police videotape in which Coffman admitted
to repeatedly kicking Clark, whom he called "the bum."</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Clark's family began to cry when enlarged
photographs of his battered skull were shown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shocking," said sister-in-law Janet de Spain. "We keep
thinking about how James suffered."</TE>
<TE>   The boys argued with Clark over a marijuana pipe, Coffman said,
and they all began kicking Clark until he was coughing and spitting
blood.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman said he left shortly after, but testimony played for the
jury last week contradicts that version of events.</TE>
<TE>   A girl, now 16, told police that Coffman described the attack to
her and others, telling them that after the group beating, he
returned to the scene and asked a bleeding and snoring Clark, "You
want a deeper sleep?"</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant left the scene of that beating and then went back,"
Ratner said. "There's only one reason to go back and that's to kill."</TE>
<TE>   Ratner tried to offer a motive by saying Coffman was a "racist"
who, according to skinhead ideology, believed homeless people are
worthless.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time we saw any emotion ... was when he was worried
about his own well-being," Ratner said, referring to the police
video. Even after the police were interrogating him about the slaying
of Clark, who was white, "he still can't get himself to consider Mr.
Clark more than a bum."</TE>
<TE>   Farley has denied that his client is a racist. Although Coffman
told police he adhered to skinhead ideology when younger, two of
Coffman's biracial friends testified that the defendant was "like a
brother" to them.</TE>
<TE>   "At 18, sometimes you think you know all the answers," Farley told
the jury. "The problem is you can't know all the answers because you
don't even know the questions."</TE>

<HD>Simon a Major Customer of COPS Group</HD>
<DH>Campaign: He's paid $444,000 to its political consulting
arms. The group made a false fund-raising allegation against Davis,
which Simon repeated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gubernatorial campaign of Bill Simon Jr. has paid at least
$444,000 to organizations closely tied to the group that falsely
accused Gov. Gray Davis of illegal fund-raising, state records show.</LD>
<LD>   The payments--a relatively large sum for a campaign barely able to
sustain television advertising--reflect the high value that Simon has
placed on support of the group COPS, the California Organization of
Police and Sheriffs.</LD>
<LD>   The payments also illustrate the lucrative consulting business
that is an integral part of the COPS political operation.</LD>
<TE>   Simon is the latest in a long line of politicians to trumpet a
COPS endorsement, making use of the acronym to appear tough on crime.</TE>
<TE>   But the political fiasco that Simon stepped into by repeating
COPS' allegation against Davis has raised new questions about a group
already dogged by controversy.</TE>
<TE>   COPS is a relatively small organization of public safety officers,
but has gained outsized clout in California politics. A mainstay of
its operation is an offshoot that collects money from candidates in
return for featuring their names and photographs in mailings to
voters. The practice has led to accusations that the group's
endorsement is for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "They're mercenaries," said Dan Schnur, who was Gov. Pete Wilson's
spokesman in 1994 when COPS broke with other law enforcement groups
and endorsed Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown over Wilson, who
had made his name as a tough-on-crime Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley M. Moran, COPS' political affairs director, denied that the
group sells endorsements. The group interviews candidates about their
stands on law enforcement before offering its support, he said. Those
who win endorsements, he said, are offered the chance to buy a spot
on COPS' mailings to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for people who support local law enforcement and
public safety," Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   The group endorses both Republicans and Democrats. It endorsed
Davis for years as he campaigned for a succession for state
offices--most recently in the March Democratic gubernatorial
primary--before breaking with the incumbent. Davis campaign
strategists said the breach occurred after they refused to pay for a
spot on the group's mailer to voters.</TE>
<TE>   The group then turned to Simon, but his entanglement with COPS has
led to a major embarrassment for the Republican nominee.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, COPS called on the state Fair Political Practices
Commission to investigate its charge that Davis accepted a $10,000
campaign donation in his state Capitol office in 1998 when he was
lieutenant governor. That would have constituted a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the group held a news conference where it released two
photographs purporting to show Davis accepting the check in his
Capitol office.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, COPS released a statement saying: "It now
appears that our original belief was erroneous." COPS withdrew its
request for an investigation, but it did not apologize to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "We regret the impact this erroneous information has had on the
Simon campaign and on the distraction of their message to the voters
of California," the statement said. "We also apologize for
questioning the character of our former executive director."</TE>
<TE>   The former executive director, Al Angele, was shown handing Davis
the check in the photograph, apparently taken at a private home in
Santa Monica. Since Monday, Angele had angrily denied the allegation
that he was party to a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Before this week, Simon had treated the COPS endorsement as a
major coup. He toured the state with COPS leaders in June when the
group announced its endorsement. COPS is one of the few law
enforcement groups that has endorsed Simon. Davis, a pro-death
penalty Democrat, has snagged the vast majority.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's ties to COPS are spread among three groups which have one
thing in common: Moran. The first, COPS, is the nonprofit advocacy
group that endorsed Simon; Moran is its political director. The
second is COPS Voter Guide, owned by Moran. The third is Moran &amp;
Associates, his consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few weeks, COPS Voter Guide plans to feature Simon
as the prominent candidate in a mailing to a million California
households. To get that billing--and a similar display on a mailing
during the GOP primary--Simon's campaign has paid $300,000 to COPS
Voter Guide, according to finance reports filed with the secretary of
state.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign has also made $144,952 in payments for
consulting and other services to Moran &amp; Associates. Jeff Flint, a
senior Simon advisor, said the payments were for Moran's firm "to
advise the campaign on obtaining additional law enforcement
endorsements" and to set up a program to urge public safety officers
to vote for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   When it was founded in 1975, COPS had a board of directors that
included officers from big and mid-size city police departments,
including Compton, Long Beach, Cathedral City and San Francisco. Its
original goal was to be an umbrella labor organization for local
police officer associations. It is best known now for its political
operations, but says it also provides officer training in labor
relations, legal defense, anti-terrorism tactics and other areas for
its estimated 5,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said the
group was the target of complaints two years ago alleging that
telemarketers doing its fund-raising used "misleading and
threatening" tactics, including suggesting to people that their 911
service could be terminated if they failed to donate.</TE>
<TE>   Barankin said the Department of Justice did not pursue charges
because the group agreed to fire its telemarketer and because the
case would have been difficult to prove.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy Faria, president of the rival Peace Officers Research Assn.
of California, called COPS a "fringe law enforcement organization
that has a great name and very little substance."</TE>
<TE>   "This exposes them for what they are," Faria said. "If it wasn't
for that name, they would have dried up and blown away a long time
ago. They have a product they're selling, and it's that name."</TE>
<TE>   The group's secretary of state filings show that candidates
continue to pay thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars to
appear on the slate mailers, which are sent primarily to Republican
voters perceived to be conservative on law-and-order issues.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants like gaining a place for their candidates in
the mailer, largely because of the COPS name.</TE>
<TE>   "Compare the name 'COPS' and the name 'PORAC,' " said Democratic
consultant Darry Sragow, referring to the police union organization
that has roughly 50,000 members--10 times the size of COPS. "COPS
will look much better in your mail."</TE>
<TE>   COPS' slate mailer is particularly attractive to candidates for
judge and sheriff. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, for one, has
appeared on the COPS slate, paying the group $10,000. This fall's
slate will include several Democrats running for statewide office,
including Atty. Gen. Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   Consultants said they doubt they will seek to have their
candidates removed from the slate card.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already made our payment and will be appearing on that
slate," said Greg Larson, manager of Steve Westly's candidacy for
state controller.</TE>
<TE>   Westly paid $75,000 to be included on COPS' primary slate and
$17,000 for the general election mailer. Lockyer spokesman Barankin
said some slate operations are "above board." But he added: "It is an
industry populated with many colorful if not shady characters. This
perhaps just adds to the lore."</TE>

<HD>Angel Fans Play a Waiting Game</HD>
<DH>Baseball: About 20,000 unexpectedly show up for a chance
at buying World Series tickets--just in case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unprecedented crowd of about 20,000 Anaheim Angel fans, gambling
on the chance to buy World Series tickets, swarmed Edison
International Field early Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The massive turnout took Angel officials and Anaheim police by
surprise. Police hurriedly called in about 80 officers--some in riot
gear--to help manage the line, which had wrapped itself around the
stadium twice before numbered wristbands were distributed at 6 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   "We expected to have large crowds, but we did not expect to have
this many," Sgt. Rick Martinez said.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd occasionally grew impatient, but the sales were mostly
orderly. Many in the crowd passed the time lounging in lawn chairs,
reading newspapers and chatting on cell phones as they waited to buy
tickets to four possible home games ranging in price from $60 to
$175. Fans were limited to four tickets per game.</TE>
<TE>   Some wily fans avoided the crush altogether, instead jamming
telephone lines and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Parks of Chino started strategizing Tuesday. She stayed
home and tracked down out-of-state phone numbers for Ticketmaster,
figuring the California lines would all be busy.</TE>
<TE>   She settled on Orlando, first calling at 6 a.m. with hopes the
tickets would go on sale at 9 a.m. Eastern time. No, a Ticketmaster
agent said, call back in three hours.</TE>
<TE>   She called a couple minutes early, allotting just enough time to
run through the lengthy automated system. At 9 a.m., she was ready to
buy World Series tickets. She charged about $2,000 to her credit card
and bought 16 tickets--four to each game. She was off the phone by
9:21 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tried to figure out what everybody else would be doing,"
said Parks, a fan for 11 years. Then she did the opposite. It paid
off--for now, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee the Angels will advance past the Minnesota
Twins and into the World Series for the first time in the team's
42-year history. The Angels had not been to the playoffs since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Parks secured her tickets, 34-year-old Matt Russell of
Laguna Beach was still waiting at the stadium, with a book--"Art and
Propaganda in the 20th Century"--in hand. He's not even an Angel fan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I ever bought tickets for an event like
this," Russell said. "I'm looking to make money. Tell all my friends
to call me."</TE>
<TE>   Even among the fans, there was no shortage of deal-making. James
Orosco, 25, of Anaheim sold his wristband for $50. A family friend
was buying his tickets. He made a beer run in the midafternoon to
help pass the time and said the whole experience was less than fun.
But he wouldn't have it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Series is once in a lifetime," Orosco said. "If they do
make it, I'm not going to sit at home and say, 'Darn, I wish I would
have gotten in line.' "</TE>

<HD>Davis' Friends Fall Away, Ambition Endures</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor says he's 'going forward in life.' But
even wife says he's consumed by work.</DH>
<SE>First in a series profiling Gov. Gray Davis.</SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running the state of California keeps Gov. Gray Davis far too busy to
make time for things that no longer matter--such as staying in touch
with old classmates.</LD>
<LD>   That is one theory among Davis' former fraternity brothers at
Stanford. Another holds that Davis is too guarded about his image to
maintain ties with the rabble-rousers of Zeta Psi, an "Animal House"
whose pledges liked to dump water from the roof onto unsuspecting
coeds, and whose antics ultimately got the fraternity kicked off
campus soon after Davis graduated.</LD>
<LD>   For whatever reasons, a number of ex-classmates who were among
Davis' best friends during the wild mid-1960s now consider themselves
cut off from the 59-year-old governor. Phone calls go unheeded.
Handwritten notes are answered with form letters.  They watch the man on
television--his hair now gray but still perfectly coiffed--and they see
only a stiff, impenetrable facade.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a cipher," said Nick Chickering, a former close friend who
talks bitterly about futile attempts that he and other fraternity
members have made in recent years to contact Davis. "Everything he
does in life is to climb another rung on the ladder."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' former friends are either alienated--in several cases--or
largely consigned to the governor's memory. Though he feels bad about
that, Davis said, his priorities are now elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Life takes you in different directions--and, frankly, it's all I
can do to muster the energy to discharge all the responsibilities of
this job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of pieces of pending legislation, appointments, money to
raise, campaign stops to make, the world's sixth-largest economy to
run--those things all add up. "It's hard to overstate the demands and
pressures that a governor has to cope with.</TE>
<TE>   "They were great guys," Davis said of his former classmates.
"[But] you have to keep ... going forward in life."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' attention to what matters now, to the endless calculations
that shape the future, is obsessive and unwavering. It is his
signature trait, the hard shell of a man seared by early
disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   The world might be fickle, unfair, war-torn, chaotic, but there
was stability to be found in the spartan pursuit of achievement.
Davis learned to filter out the extraneous, to channel his energies
into the one man on whom he could most depend: himself.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the political sphere, where relationships and personal
promises often help define success, he holds himself apart,
cultivating few real friendships, forming alliances that he maintains
until they are no longer practical or useful. Nothing about him is
charismatic or accessible.</TE>
<TE>   "He's totally consumed," said his wife, Sharon Ryer Davis,
who tells a story about an encounter with former Gov. Pat Brown many
years ago. The garrulous Brown demanded to know when they were
getting married. Sharon surprised him by saying Gray was already
married. "To his work," she told him. "He's married to his work."</TE>
<TE>   Davis married Sharon, too, in 1983. He and the former flight
attendant live in a small West Hollywood condominium when Davis is
not in Sacramento. Sharon, by far the more outgoing of the two,
describes him as a typical working husband.</TE>
<TE>   He flies home on weekends. He is an incessant watcher of baseball,
football and "SportsCenter." He likes action movies. He's a
fastidious dresser. He runs late to meetings. He's a lousy driver
but, thankfully, has a state-sponsored chauffeur. He loves golf but
rarely finds time to play, except on vacations to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   He's even quieter at home than in public, she said, but in social
settings he jokes and laughs easily. When they go out, she said, it's
usually with other couples they have met over the years at political
gatherings and charity events.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an incredible sense of humor," Sharon said in
an interview. "He doesn't mind the caricatures of himself being
stiff.... He kind of accepts that. He's comfortable with who he is."</TE>
<TE>   Like Bill Simon Jr., his Republican opponent in the November race,
Davis is a scion of affluence, the product of tough private schools
and strict Catholic discipline. Born in the Bronx, N.Y., but raised
mainly in Brentwood, Davis' idyllic upbringing slammed to a close
with two traumatic events: his alcoholic father, Joseph, abandoning
the family for another woman while Gray was at Stanford, and Gray's
tour of duty in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   How much those events shaped the young governor-to-be is hard to
gauge. Davis is not one to reflect publicly on such deeply personal
matters. In a 20-minute telephone interview that took more than a
month to schedule, he glossed over the particulars of the
estrangement with his father, but acknowledged that the rift lasted
more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   It was a painful fracture that ended largely by chance--in
1996--at a family wedding in New York where the two found themselves
together. They reconciled and spent three days salving their scars.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two months later, Joseph Graham Davis Sr. collapsed on a
Florida golf course and died of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "It rocks your boat," Davis said of their shattered relationship
and the splintering of the family. "Thank God for bringing us back
together.... Suffice to say, I loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon believes the schism, during Gray's sophomore year, coupled
with many small disappointments that preceded it, strongly influenced
Davis' character. "I think it made Gray realize that was absolutely
the person he would never be."</TE>
<TE>   Snide pundits like to cite "Gray" as an apt nickname for so bland
a person, but the original purpose was to distinguish father from
son. "I didn't want a Big Joe and a Little Joe," recalled Davis'
mother, Doris Morell, 79, who coined the nickname when Joseph Graham
Davis Jr. was an infant. "Out of Graham, I got Gray."</TE>
<TE>   His temperament, even then, was exemplary, she said. "He wasn't
given to temper fits or screaming or any of that," she said. "I
thought, What are [young mothers] complaining about? This is easy!"</TE>
<TE>   Gray would herald the way for five siblings: three boys and two
girls. At a time when Norman Rockwell was still painting covers for
the Saturday Evening Post, the Davises seemed a real-life embodiment
of postwar innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Doris, a stay-at-home mom, made sure that each child was tucked in
at night, and that they said their prayers. Joseph Sr. was moving up
the hierarchy at Time Inc., commuting into Manhattan before being
asked to head a new ad office in Los Angeles as the company launched
Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   Relocating in 1954, the Davises settled in the Santa Monica
Mountains near what is now the Getty Center. Not much existed there
at the time, and the children missed their friends to the point that
special vacation visits were arranged, Morell said.</TE>
<TE>   Gray was 11, well-mannered, athletic, the type of kid who formed
strong friendships but was rarely the center of attention. He was a
huge fan of baseball and, in particular, the Brooklyn Dodgers, who
would soon follow him West. He'd had his picture taken with slugger
Gil Hodges, a memento he proudly hung in his new bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   One longtime family friend who met Gray in those days called
him "an absolutely admirable young man. You'd want your own son to be
like Gray."</TE>
<TE>   Doris, an avid golfer who would claim several club championships,
taught her son the game. Gray played regularly at the Bel-Air Country
Club, winning a pair of junior titles before joining the golf team at
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gray's father also played golf, Joseph was a less reliable
influence than the rock-solid Doris. The elder Davis was more likely
to say, "Yeah, I'll be at your game today--and then not show up,"
Gray's wife said.</TE>
<TE>   But his mother was dependable. Her belief in education and
discipline governed the household. She enrolled Gray in the finest
private school she could find: Harvard Military School (now Harvard
Westlake Academy) in North Hollywood, then an all-boys institution
where uniforms were mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   A tough curriculum prepared the privileged offspring of attorneys,
corporate founders and entertainers for Harvard, Stanford and other
top-tier universities.</TE>
<TE>   Davis excelled as an athlete and a student. He played on Harvard's
baseball and basketball teams and competed for fun in football, golf
and tennis. His first attempt to make the baseball team ended in
failure, resulting in a lecture from the coach. He had the talent, he
was told, but not the drive. He had to apply himself.</TE>
<TE>   The message got across. Davis worked on his game until he was good
enough to be named captain.</TE>
<TE>   "He's often told ... [people] that changed his life," Sharon Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   He would also graduate from high school magna cum laude.</TE>
<TE>   "If I got all A's and one B, my allowance was a dollar," Davis
once said of the rigid standards at home. "If I got all Bs and one C,
my allowance was 50 cents." Lower than that, he stood to get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Chores and attendance at church were factored into the allowance
equation. Rooms had to be picked up. His mother posted a chart in the
kitchen: "Gold stars, silver stars, red stars," she recalled. "A bad
job would be an X." For an X there would be fines. "I had them
buffaloed," she said. "You have to have some leverage."</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Davis readily obeyed. At worst, Davis
was "inclined to leave a sock where it dropped," Morell said.
Fresh-faced, with a brush cut, tie and military bars on his breast,
he looked and acted the good soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Midnight would roll around and Gray would often be up, finishing
homework. He was enough of a hustler to trade on his academic
talents.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd say, 'I'll translate [your] Spanish if you polish my shoes,'
" said Dede Ross, a sister two years younger who remains close to
him. Gray was not above pulling pranks, she said. He'd pin her down,
making her laugh. "He'd say, 'As soon as you stop laughing, I'll get
up,' " Ross remembered. Yet the other side of Davis, the deliberate,
carefully controlled part of him, was already dominant.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take him an hour to blow-dry his hair," Ross recalled.
At the cusp of young adulthood, Davis let his thick, brownish-blond
hair grow in something of a pompadour. "One New Year's Eve he was
going out," Ross said, "and he took so long to get his hair done he
missed New Year's. He took so long it was past midnight."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' fastidious manner earned him another nickname at Stanford:
"Woogie." Woogie is a vague term as used by ex-members of Zeta Psi,
but it stood for the Ivy League look--golf shirts and slacks--at a
place given to jeans and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Woogie suggested the perfect Davis posture, a certain air he
possessed. He was popular, but also someone to be teased. He
generally took the razzing with good humor, said Richard Ashby, a
former fraternity mate who played with Davis on the golf team.</TE>
<TE>   The hair was one target. "It was puffed up, sort of like it looks
today ... [and] it looked like he was putting hairspray on it," Ashby
said. "You've got to remember, this was the early '60s. He spent an
inordinate amount of time combing his hair."</TE>
<TE>   On the golf course, Davis was known to endlessly grip and re-grip
his club, much as he would later dawdle over bills and appointments.
"He'd take 20 minutes to take a shot," Ashby said. "We'd say, 'Come
on, Gray, hit the damn golf ball.' He was an excellent golfer and
could have been a lot better, but his time was spent studying. He was
serious, whereas most of these other guys ... were there for a
party."</TE>
<TE>   Pledging at Zeta Psi seemed an unlikely thing for Davis to do. The
house was populated by athletes, and Davis gravitated to it because
of his golf and because a number of friends from Harvard Military
School had gone, or were going, there.</TE>
<TE>   To most who entered, the house was a venue for one long, wild
bacchanal. Davis never quite seemed to fit. Sometimes he joined in
the high jinks, sometimes he tried to talk sense into his frat
brothers. He took part in pranks and was the target of pranks.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby remembered one occasion when four or five guys, Ashby
included, grabbed their surfboards and headed for Santa Cruz in
Davis' car, a stripped-down, fire-engine-red Chevy. Not only did they
neglect to get Gray's permission, they lost the keys, had to hot-wire
the car, and were gone past nightfall. It didn't take Hercule Poirot,
with the surfboards gone, to figure out where the car was.</TE>
<TE>   "He ended up calling the police on us--'stolen
automobile,' " Ashby said. "He probably had a date or something. We just
thought, 'My God, Gray.' So he's always been big on law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Racial unrest, the Cold War and the escalating conflict in Vietnam
were beginning to germinate seeds of activism on college campuses in
the early 1960s while Davis was at Stanford, yet few at Zeta Psi
delved deeply into political affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most serious members of the house were Davis and
then-roommate Peter Collis, who would later serve as Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Medical Readiness during the Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   As Collis remembers, Davis talked little about South Vietnam, then
the location of initial U.S. Special Forces operations. He showed no
inclination toward protest, but was galvanized by the Cuban Missile
Crisis of 1962, which thrust the nation to the brink of nuclear war.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a history major who would go on to law school at Columbia,
"took part in all the [campus] events just like everyone else,"
Collis said, citing in particular the dumping of water on legions of
unsuspecting female freshmen. "And [we] managed to stay out of
trouble, always, by the skin of our teeth."</TE>
<TE>   While he was making his way through Stanford, however, Davis'
family was disintegrating. News of the divorce reached him in a
letter. He soon learned the magnitude of his mother's problems: His
father had run up bills. Collectors were calling.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden financial straits threatened Davis' enrollment at
Stanford; he was forced to take a job busing tables, and joined ROTC
for its monthly stipend. Meanwhile, his mother decided to leave her
friends and her beloved Bel-Air Country Club, and return East to Rye,
N.Y., where her sister lived.</TE>
<TE>   Divorce in the 1960s carried more stigma than today, especially
among Catholics. Davis sided with his mother. He wrote off his father
as if he never existed, and attended law school a short drive from
his mother's new address.</TE>
<TE>   She would later remarry, as would Joe Sr., though not to the woman
he had left home for. No one can say whether Davis, once burned,
became quick to sever ties, or that he found reason to distance
himself from the carousers he had known.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Davis grew no less serious after dealing with life's
harsh realities. He seemed to be on a mission, as one ex-fraternity
brother put it. Davis left the Zetas, and during his final two years
at Stanford he rented a home away from the hubbub with Dick Hillman,
a studious friend he had known since Harvard Military School.</TE>
<TE>   Hillman, who owns an investment firm, remembered "sitting around,
like young adults do ... having a couple of beers, and he was very
clear: He said, 'I want to be president of the United States.'</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anything at Stanford or his home life shaped him,"
Hillman added. "It was him who shaped him."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the idea of entering politics really seized him only
after he returned from Vietnam, but there is evidence that he was
setting himself apart even as a member of Zeta Psi. Packed away
somewhere, said wife Sharon, is an old photograph of a toga party.</TE>
<TE>   "And everybody's in a toga except for him," she said.
"He's wearing jeans and a white shirt. It's quite amazing. It's almost as
if he knew--he was not going to be photographed in a toga. But how
does he know?"</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Cite Utility Bills</HD>
<DH>Debate: Separatists see suggestions that water and power
rates could rise as scare tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Dalton often winces when she opens the water and power bill for
her lushly landscaped home on half an acre in Sherman Oaks. The
charge for the latest two-month period was $300.</LD>
<LD>   Hotter months have sent her bill into the $500 neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Dalton, a retiree on a fixed income, plans to vote against San
Fernando Valley secession--in part because she worries that a
municipal split would bring higher and higher utility rates. "It's a
concern," she said.</LD>
<TE>   As the debate over carving up Los Angeles enters its final month,
the anti-secession campaign led by Mayor James K. Hahn is intent on
making water and power rates a breakout pocketbook issue.
Secessionists are just as determined to paint Hahn as a fear-monger
who distorts the facts on utility rates to distract attention from
City Hall's broader shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides know that water and power pack a punch with voters
still jittery from the state's electricity crisis and forever
sweating the next drought.</TE>
<TE>   The message of the Hahn forces is stark: If the Valley and
Hollywood cityhood proposals win at the polls on Nov. 5, residents of
the new municipalities could lose the relatively stable rates and
plentiful supplies offered by the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power. Sprinkling the lawn and cranking up the air conditioner would
soon become expensive luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists contend that Hahn has grossly misrepresented the
state-mandated terms of a breakup. They note that the Local Agency
Formation Commission, which approved both cityhood measures for the
ballot, has directed the DWP to continue serving an independent
Valley or Hollywood at rates no higher than those charged in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Under LAFCO's formula, the DWP would become a contractor for the
new cities, unless they chose to buy their water and power from other
providers.</TE>
<TE>   "I see no chance that we would not get water on the same terms and
conditions as the rest of the city," said Richard Close, an attorney
who heads the secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Question of Authority</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession camp, however, insists that LAFCO overstepped
its authority by including that utility-rate provision in the
secession proposals. Hahn and other Los Angeles officials say the
state Constitution and the City Charter give the DWP sole power to
set rates. And opponents argue that the laws require the DWP to
provide the cheapest possible service to its Los Angeles customers,
even if that means higher costs for Valley and Hollywood cities.</TE>
<TE>   They say it already costs more to serve the Valley, which has
generally larger home lots and higher temperatures than the rest of
the city, placing more demand on the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   Legal challenges over utility rates are considered likely if
secession prevails. LAFCO itself has suggested the courts might have
to resolve the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely inevitable that it will end up in court," said
Steve Erie, a water expert and political science professor at UC San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Water originally brought the Valley and Los Angeles together. In
1915, the Valley agreed to be annexed by Los Angeles in exchange for
access to the then-2-year-old Los Angeles Aqueduct. The aqueduct
piped snowmelt from the eastern Sierra to the parched Valley floor,
irrigating farms and later making possible the explosion in home
building.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders say that the Valley is now entitled to future
DWP service at reasonable rates because the region has paid its share
of building the utility's infrastructure for 87 years. The
secessionists initially demanded that an independent Valley get an
ownership stake in the DWP, but LAFCO rejected that arrangement as
unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   The agency determined that, unlike streets and parks and city
buildings, the DWP's massive generation and delivery systems are too
complex to divide up between Los Angeles and the Valley, not to
mention Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO decided that Los Angeles would continue to own the system,
but could not jack up rates for the Valley or Hollywood if secession
passes.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP already provides water by contract to other cities and
communities, including West Hollywood and Universal City, but charges
them higher rates. That's because the DWP acts as a middle agent for
those cities, buying supplies from the Metropolitan Water District
and delivering them on Los Angeles-owned pipelines. MWD water costs
as much as 25% more than water from the L.A. Aqueduct, and the DWP
passes those higher rates along.</TE>
<TE>   Contract Arrangement</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionists say the DWP could demand a similar arrangement
with a new Valley or Hollywood city. That would mean steeper bills in
the breakaway areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see the DWP violating the City Charter and selling its
cheapest water to an outside agency, such as a Valley city," said
Larry Levine, who heads the anti-secession organization One Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn echoed that view. "We don't think LAFCO has the ability to
supersede water law or the City Charter," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think if our cost goes up, we ought to be able to recover the
cost.... There is a risk. Why take the chance of higher water and
higher power rates?"</TE>
<TE>   The City Charter says Los Angeles' water rights cannot be sold,
leased or disposed of without the approval of two-thirds of the
voters, according to a former DWP attorney, Kenneth Downey. He said a
simple majority vote on secession does not supersede that
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Former DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, now the state's power
czar, said Los Angeles is also unlikely to give the Valley or
Hollywood the cheapest electricity the utility generates, which comes
from its hydroelectric plants. Instead, the DWP would probably sell
the secession areas more expensive power from inefficient, gas-fired
plants, Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's against human nature" to do otherwise, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fight for Business</TE>
<TE>   Competition could play a role in stabilizing water prices. A
Valley or Hollywood city could look elsewhere for water and power--to
private utilities, for example--if the rate ceilings the commission
imposed on the DWP were thrown out by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say that would give Los Angeles a financial
incentive not to raise rates for the breakaway cities.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles needs the Valley as customers," Close
said. "It's like Ralphs saying they don't need 40% of their
customers. They would be shutting down stores if they said that."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn concedes that Los Angeles would be hurt if the secession
regions ditched the DWP. But he adds that such a scenario is another
argument against a breakup, because rates would rise for DWP
customers in a smaller Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly there are economies of scale, so if a significant
customer base was removed somehow, those costs would have to be
absorbed, and the only way I can see that is if we pass higher rates
for the remaining customers," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   In the state's recent energy crisis, the DWP was able to supply
relatively cheap power and avoid the market gyrations and blackouts
that afflicted other parts of California.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that experience, Hahn said it is unlikely that Valley and
Hollywood residents would want to turn to private utilities, such as
Southern California Edison, because the deregulated rates of those
utilities are much higher than the DWP's.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists, though, say the new cities would be free to
negotiate lower electricity rates.</TE>
<TE>   And some cities in Los Angeles County already get better water
prices than those charged by the DWP. A 2001 survey by the
engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch Corp. found that DWP's residential
customers were billed an average of $29.88 a month. In comparison,
Long Beach averaged $27.28; Redondo Beach, $23.68; Santa Monica,
$23.64; and Pasadena, $13.73.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica got 82% of its water from MWD and Pasadena received
60%.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Currie, a former DWP official who heads the Pasadena
utility, said its low maintenance costs have kept prices low. Los
Angeles ratepayers must subsidize costly DWP improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Gewe, who oversees the water side of the DWP, said other
cities can charge less because they have access to cheaper
groundwater supplies. He said the groundwater under the Valley is
owned by Los Angeles, and a Valley city would have to build a water
collection and distribution system if it went somewhere other than to
the DWP for water. That would increase rates, Gewe said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and DWP General Manager David Wiggs said they have no plans
to raise water and power rates as a knee-jerk reaction to secession.
But they predicted that major rate-paying institutions, such as large
businesses and colleges, might force the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "If rates go up for customers because of secession, I think it
would be very likely that customers who believe their rights are
jeopardized will seek their legal remedies in court," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   One factor that could trigger a court fight, city officials say,
is that the current rate structure allows Valley properties to use
more water before they exceed the threshold for basic rates and are
charged higher prices. A decade ago, the DWP adjusted rates to allow
more water use by customers who live in areas with higher
temperatures, including the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs says that rate-relief formula might be challenged if the
Valley becomes a separate city. "I certainly think that is an issue
that can be and probably would be raised by customers," Wiggs said.</TE>
<TE>   The result, he added, could be higher rates in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Another wild card is whether the new cities would move to charge
the DWP a franchise fee for providing them water. Wiggs said Los
Angeles would have to determine if such a fee should be paid by
ratepayers only in the secession areas or in the remainder of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuit Doubted</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, co-chairman of the Valley Independence
Committee, said secessionists have no plans to impose a franchise
fee. He also expressed doubts that major DWP customers would sue over
rate equity.</TE>
<TE>   "That would only happen if the DWP was out there stirring things
up," said Katz, who serves on the state Water Resources Control
Board.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed the anti-secession rhetoric on utility rates as
"scare tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from all the lawyers arguing about everything," Katz said,
"once the city is created, a lot of this rhetoric goes away. Because
the bottom line is the cities will cooperate more than fight."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Close Most of the Cleveland Forest Friday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because of the continuing fire hazard from the driest season in
history, most of the Cleveland National Forest will be closed Friday
until the onset of substantial rains, the U.S. Forest Service said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third Southern California forest closure in two weeks,
which combined will cut off or severely restrict access to more than
2 million acres of mountainous timber and brush lands between Ventura
County and the Mexican border.</LD>
<LD>   "Fires this summer have burned with such intensity that they are
almost impossible to control," Anne Fege, the Cleveland forest
supervisor, said Wednesday. "Fuel moisture is at historic record
lows. We must do whatever possible to prevent additional large
fires."</LD>
<TE>   She said state and county roads through the forest will remain
open to through traffic, but areas on both sides of the roads will be
closed. Recreation will be allowed in developed areas, but remote
campgrounds will be closed and campfires will be prohibited
everywhere in the forest. Hunting will be restricted to the Agua
Tibia Wilderness and Forest Service lands adjacent to Indian Flats.</TE>
<TE>   The closure does not apply to private lands within the boundaries
of the Cleveland forest.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, officials closed vast stretches of the San Bernardino
National Forest, including the timbered areas surrounding such
popular recreation communities as Big Bear Lake, Lake Arrowhead and
Idyllwild. Most roads remained open, but campfires, hiking, horseback
riding and off-road vehicle use were prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   More severe restrictions were imposed a week earlier in the
Angeles National Forest, where a stubborn wildfire destroyed more
than 70 buildings and blackened more than 35,000 acres above Glendora
and San Dimas in late September. The entire 656,000-acre forest was
closed to all recreational uses.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Angeles is the most heavily used national
forest in the nation, with about 3.5 million visitors annually.</TE>

<HD>Board OKs Reduced Version of Music Center Enhancements</HD>
<DH>Plaza: The $12.5-million project calls for a realigned
Grand Avenue, wider sidewalks and new trees between Disney Hall and
cathedral.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has taken modest steps
toward revitalizing the area around the Music Center to make it more
pedestrian-friendly.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors approved a $12.5-million plan Tuesday that will
realign Grand Avenue between 2nd and Temple streets and widen
sidewalks along those two blocks.</LD>
<LD>   The approved project, supported by the Music Center, retains a
fraction of the changes proposed in an ambitious plan developed in
2000 by then-Mayor Richard Riordan, billionaire businessman Eli Broad
and a team of influential architects.</LD>
<TE>   That plan was intended to create a more attractive, accessible
plaza linking the Walt Disney Concert Hall, scheduled for completion
in 2003, with the recently completed Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   It called for a 20-acre park extending from Grand Avenue through
the Civic Center Mall to City Hall, a children's theater, the
rerouting of traffic from a county garage off of Grand and other
major renovations. But it was prohibitively expensive and met stiff
opposition from preservationist groups such as the L.A. Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   At the time it was unveiled, backers emphasized that plans for the
project were preliminary. Indeed, Music Center officials said they
eventually decided to push a scaled-back version with better chances
for approval.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a more modest approach, but it still accomplishes
a lot of things," said Joanne Kozberg, president of the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   She hailed the board's approval of the Music Center plan as a
"significant milestone."</TE>
<TE>   There are several components to the approved project, according to
county plans and Music Center officials. The existing roadway will be
realigned to an average of 20 feet east of its existing location, and
sidewalks will be widened to as much as 40 feet deep in front of
Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Ficus and jacaranda trees that now line the sidewalk--causing the
concrete to buckle in some places--will be replaced with seasonal
trees that will "change color and character with the seasons." Three
small "pocket" parks will be constructed on the east side of Grand,
and new street and pedestrian lighting will be installed.</TE>
<TE>   The changes were welcomed by some political and cultural leaders
who for years have lobbied for the creation of a grand public space
in Los Angeles. "It's helpful that they're moving forward," Broad
said.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, a member of the Grand Avenue Committee, a public-private
partnership that continues to push for components of the more
ambitious original concept, said, "This is in line with our plans."</TE>
<TE>   John Edmonson of the county auditor-controller's office said
funding for the plan approved Tuesday was cobbled together mainly
from Metropolitan Transportation Authority grants for pedestrian and
road improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve a motion next week
to advertise and award a construction contract for the work, Edmonson
said, and workers were taping removal notices to trees along the
proposed construction site Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other improvements and alterations to the Music Center
Plaza were also approved by the board, but have not yet been funded.
Those include raising sunken portions of the Music Center Plaza,
widening the stairway from Grand Avenue to the plaza, and
construction of a glass-walled, two-story educational center.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is being done with money in hand," said Martha
Wellborne of the Grand Avenue Committee. "We started out with a
vision and our job is to make that vision a reality. We still haven't
given up on that."</TE>

<HD>Campus Dispute Comes to a Head</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Teacher's choice of hats leads to shuffling of
special ed students, his removal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANNING</DL>
<LD>He swept into the desert a decade ago like Patch Adams on a
renaissance kick. Next thing this Riverside County community knew,
Bach and Beethoven were booming from John Maurer's special education
classroom. There were Shakespeare performances, even a "Sonnet of the
Day" club, and Maurer's disabled students were taking part right
along with the rest of the school. To hear their parents tell it,
life will never be easy for Maurer's students--but it sure was
better.</LD>
<LD>   And then, one day last spring, Maurer wore a hat to school, the
wrong kind of hat, and the whole thing fell apart.</LD>
<LD>   Maurer's relationship with school administrators has dissolved
into a bitter dispute that seems to have begun with his choice of
head wear and continues to separate him from his special education
class.</LD>
<TE>   The children, meanwhile, may be affected more than anyone. Not
only have they been separated from their teacher, but they've been
forced to change schools at least three times. Some of their parents
say they now have to ride buses that take three hours, round trip,
each day. One mother goes so far as to say she believes that the
stress boiled over for her son--leading to a seizure from a heart
condition that she said previously had never surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't understand why his teacher isn't coming back," said
the mother, Marcelle Shelton, a Cabazon resident whose 17-year-old
son, Richie, suffers from a syndrome that attacks his nervous system.
"He keeps asking me: 'Why? Why?' And I keep telling him: 'I don't
know.' I think the whole thing is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Banning Unified School District Supt. Kathleen McNamara and Robert
Nunez, the Riverside County Office of Education's assistant
superintendent for personnel, declined to discuss the case, calling
it a private personnel matter.</TE>
<TE>   The saga began a year ago, when Maurer, now 56, was beginning his
10th year at Banning High School, between Beaumont and Cabazon along
Interstate 10. A new principal, Dr. Jim Broncatello, had just
arrived. With him, some teachers say, came a strict approach to
education--and a policy that hats worn on campus could only be one of
the school colors: white, black, green or yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Maurer said he was unaware of the policy and showed up on campus
one day wearing a beige hat.</TE>
<TE>   Maurer said special education children, because of disabilities,
often have a hard time getting enough exercise and can suffer from
weight problems. So he tries hard to get them outside. To protect
himself from the sun, he often wore the wide-brimmed beige hat.</TE>
<TE>   Broncatello, Maurer said, asked him not to wear it anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me into his office," Maurer said. "And he called it a
bonnet. A bonnet! He said: 'John, the bonnet is unacceptable.' "</TE>
<TE>   Broncatello and other school officials declined to discuss the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Maurer said that at first he agreed not to wear the hat, and he
began abiding by the policy by wearing a white hat.</TE>
<TE>   "But it bothered me," he said. "It just got under my skin.
Finally, I just said, 'Forget it.' "</TE>
<TE>   In February, he wore a blue Dodgers hat to school. Broncatello
spotted him again and reiterated the policy, Maurer said. And that,
the teacher said, is when the silly turned serious.</TE>
<TE>   Maurer had been preparing to put together a Shakespeare festival,
and needed Broncatello's permission to use space at the school on
weekends to rehearse. Suddenly, after the hat incident, Maurer said,
the principal told him he was being stubborn and confrontational and
then told him he couldn't have the rehearsal time he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Maurer's response the next morning: a red hat.</TE>
<TE>   "Broncatello blew a gasket," alleged Mark Blankenship, Maurer's
Riverside attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 29 years of education, you are the most unprofessional
person I have ever met," Broncatello reportedly told the teacher,
according to Maurer's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, Maurer said, a truck "just backed up to my
classroom." The special education program, he and the students were
told, was being moved to the nearby Milo P. Johnson Center for
Learning--a so-called alternative school that serves teenage parents
and students who have been expelled from other schools.</TE>
<TE>   After years of struggling to devise ways of bringing his students
together in after-school activities, from drama clubs to piano
recitals, Maurer said, the move to the new campus was devastating. He
said his class was segregated and ostracized; his students had a
separate lunch table.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Diggs, principal at the Johnson Center, declined to comment,
referring telephone calls to the Riverside County Office of
Education, which had previously declined to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   Under some interpretations, federal law requires educators to
perform assessments on special education students before moving them.
That wasn't done in this case, parents and Maurer's attorneys allege.
Maurer was quick to point out that alleged failing to the parents of
his 10 students, and they, by all accounts, threw a fit.</TE>
<TE>   So, in May, the class was moved back to Banning High School. By
then, Maurer said, he had been labeled a troublemaker. He was told he
would not be moving back with his students. Instead, Maurer said, he
was sent to an administrative office, where he was told to answer
phones and make copies until the end of the school year.</TE>
<TE>   When the current school year began, Maurer said, he was assigned
to a new special education class at Mountain Shadows Middle School
near Hemet. And his old class was moved again, this time to Beaumont
High School, parents say.</TE>
<TE>   Nunez, the Riverside County Office of Education's assistant
superintendent for personnel, confirmed that the students were moved
amid differing opinions of where they should be placed, but declined
to discuss the matter further.</TE>
<TE>   "I go to my work, and I do my job, and I love these [new] kids,"
Maurer said in a telephone interview. "But I just want everything the
way it was. And I would like these people to acknowledge, or
recognize in some way, that they have done something wrong, both
against the kids and me."</TE>
<TE>   In September, Maurer filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Riverside, saying that school officials retaliated against him and
violated his constitutional right to free speech. He also says his
due process rights were violated.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks financial damages, but Maurer and his attorneys
say their fight is not about money.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an altruistic perspective on this, believe it or not,"
said Blankenship, the attorney. "I respect the fact that they kept
him working, and that he at least is still in a job. But it's
unfortunate that he's not teaching the same people and that Banning
has lost the benefit of his efforts. This is not a money grab, I
assure you. This is about principles. Someone's got to stand up for
something."</TE>

<HD>State Warns Parents of Home-School Edict</HD>
<DH>Education: A teaching credential or public school ties are
needed, but enforcement is dicey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Department of Education is warning that parents should
not home-school their children without teachers' credentials or
affiliation with a public school.</LD>
<LD>   That ruling could potentially affect thousands of households and
has triggered protests from home-schooling parents who contend the
state is harassing them. But the ability of officials to enforce the
rules remains unclear.</LD>
<LD>   The warning, which the state says is based on long-existing
truancy laws, is directed at families operating private schools out
of their homes. Since the state does not require private school
teachers to have educational credentials, home-school parents say
they are complying with the rules.</LD>
<TE>   So far, state officials say no one has been prosecuted, and school
districts say they don't have the capacity to sniff out parents
claiming to run private schools. Still, many home-schoolers say the
state is scaring parents in an effort to quash educational
alternatives and garner as much federal money as possible based on
daily attendance in the public school system.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach resident Pam Scaia, for example, said that she has
run a private school for 12 years but that the recent attention has
made her uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm nervous that they're going to come knock on my door and say,
'Why aren't your kids in school?' '" said Scaia, who home-schools her
six children who range in age from 6 to 19. "Home-schooling has
increased so dramatically that we're in the limelight now."</TE>
<TE>   As a believer in bilingual education, now mainly abandoned in
public schools, Scaia teaches in English and Spanish and infuses
Latino culture into her lessons. And like many home-schoolers, she
doesn't keep to a fixed class schedule but says her children will
learn any time of the day. Scaia said she will continue to declare
her home a private school despite the concern triggered by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Taylor, president of the Web-based California Homeschool
Network and a home-schooler for seven years in Victorville, called
the state warning a form of intimidation and said it is intended to
draw "attention away from failing public schools."</TE>
<TE>   When the state sent directives to its 58 county offices of
education in July restating the policy on home-schooling, Taylor was
one of the first to raise the alarm with other parents through her
tight Internet community. Parents then inundated the state Department
of Education with angry e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   In response, state Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin
wrote a letter to California's state senators last month asking for a
legislative solution to the issue and saying the state was wrongly
accused of harassing home-schoolers.</TE>
<TE>   Eastin has made no formal judgment about the educational value of
home-schooling, but says all schooling needs to be supervised by
professionally trained staff. "Home schools are not even subject to
competition from private schools, where the marketplace would
presumably ensure some level of quality and innovation," she said in
the letter.</TE>
<TE>   The warning in July accompanied a change in how institutions
seeking private school status are supposed to register. In the past,
they did so through counties, but now, in what state officials say is
an attempt to streamline matters, the schools must contact the state
Department of Education directly.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-Growing Movement</TE>
<TE>   Once considered on the fringe, home-schooling has grown in recent
years as more parents are disillusioned with the quality of public
schools. Advocates estimate there are up to 100,000 home-schooled
children in the state and 2 million nationwide, figures that
education officials could not confirm. Home-schooling has spawned a
cottage industry of educational materials that are often sold and
discussed at large annual conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Home-schooling is considered legal in California only when
students are taught by a credentialed tutor, a state-approved charter
school, or enrolled in an independent study program supervised by a
public school district. The public school affiliation requires
home-schoolers to sign a contract of their involvement and entitles
them to access to school resources. Aside from helping to account for
children, the programs also keep the state eligible for some federal
funding based on pupil attendance at home.</TE>
<TE>   Though she'd rather be completely independent, Heidi Swale chose
to home-school her 10-year-old daughter through a publicly-funded
charter program sanctioned by the state. She said she was too
intimidated to declare herself a private school after encountering
difficulty attaining the needed form from the state earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I attempted it, but I couldn't deal with the uncertainty," the
Canyon Country resident said. "I didn't have it in me to put up a
fight."</TE>
<TE>   However, the state says it is easy to register as a private
school. The form asks for basic information such as the school's
address and the list of grades being taught, but does not require any
investigation into the school's legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   California exempts private school teachers from having to earn the
credentials required of public school teachers. David Kopperud, of
the state Student Attendance Review Board, said truancy officials
have historically left home-schoolers with private school status
alone because it was rare to find a family that neglected to educate
their children. He said school districts were already burdened by
regular truancy cases in which officials were certain children were
not learning.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, a truancy investigation can be opened based on
information gathered from private school forms that tellingly list
the number of teachers as "one" and students as "one." Few school
districts, cities and counties, however, have the resources to do
that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult," said Hugh Pickrel, superintendent of the
Gorman School District. "While the law has the best intentions, it's
very difficult for the district attorney to work in concert with all
the school districts to monitor attendance. They're up to their
eyebrows in things more heady than 'Billy won't go to school.' "</TE>
<TE>   In many counties, parents can be fined up to $500 for violating
truancy laws. Los Angeles County has some of the strictest laws,
calling for fines of up to $2,500 or a year in jail if parents refuse
to comply.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the handful of truancy
tips usually come from neighbors. Once discovered, home-schoolers are
encouraged to join a home-schooling program administered by the
district. No case in recent memory resulted in a home-school parent
being prosecuted for failing to meet the state law, said Mike
Skolnik, an L.A. Unified official who counsels home-schoolers.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, with concerns over budget deficits and classroom
overcrowding, it's questionable whether many school districts could
accept an influx of home-schooled children.</TE>
<TE>   "If every case was brought to our attention overnight, it would
paralyze us," said Hector Madrigal, director of pupil services at
L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Some policy watchers say the state's interest in home-schooling is
a product of the heightened attention placed on educational
accountability, as advocated by the federal No Child Left Behind Act.
Lawmakers in California and elsewhere have recently placed more
restrictions on charter schools, a burgeoning area that mirrors the
unrestricted growth of home-schooling.</TE>
<TE>   'A Huge Backlash'</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge backlash" toward alternative education, said
Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform, a
Washington, D.C., group that advocates school choice. "You have
increasing numbers of home-schoolers, charter schools, virtual
schools and satellite schools. Now you have a federal law that says
if public schools are failing, students can leave [for another
school]. The threat to the status quo is enormous."</TE>

<HD>Fountain Valley Plans Prostitution Cleanup Using New State
Law</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fountain Valley plans to become the first city to use a new state law
aimed at cracking down on prostitution rings that operate out of
chiropractic offices.</LD>
<LD>   The law was inspired by a string of cases in Orange County. It
gives cities the power to require licensing and training for massage
therapists who work for chiropractors.</LD>
<LD>   Fountain Valley on Tuesday will vote on an ordinance that requires
therapists to obtain 500 hours of training, pass a national
certification test and undergo a background check. Other cities are
expected to follow suit in the coming months.</LD>
<TE>   The law is being greeted with a mixed reaction from chiropractors,
who have long fought to elevate the image of their profession. The
rash of arrests for prostitution at chiropractic offices hasn't
helped that image, but some believe the law goes too far.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a typical overreaction," said Beverly May, director
of government relations for the California chapter of the American
Massage Therapy Assn., which has 3,200 members in the state.</TE>
<TE>   May said that the kind of licensing the law allows isn't needed
and that many massage therapists undergo extensive training. The law
would make them go back for more training, which could cost as much
as $400.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very expensive," added Sue DeCant, who runs her husband's
chiropractic office in Mission Viejo. "For someone who's been
legitimately in the business for 20 years, they'd have to get more
training. That's almost like a double blow to them."</TE>
<TE>   She said the law is picking on the entire profession for
"something that a few did."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the rules will help them monitor activities at the
offices. Some prostitution rings have hired chiropractors to work as
fronts, placing prostitutes to work as "therapists."</TE>
<TE>   "We have had many chiropractic offices that have used that
exemption to run houses of prostitution," said Alan Burns, Fountain
Valley city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty big deal because this may fix the problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, more than 40 chiropractors have been accused of
allowing or sponsoring prostitution in their establishments. Fountain
Valley, Anaheim and Westminster police have made several arrests of
chiropractors and prostitutes in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Burns cited a four-month investigation into a Fountain Valley
office that led to the conviction of three chiropractors and an
office manager.</TE>
<TE>   Chiropractic offices have been attractive as fronts for
prostitution because of the way they are regulated. Although
chiropractors must be licensed, the state has allowed them to hire
unlicensed assistants.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, assistants at massage parlors often are required to
hold massage licenses and register with city officials. The new law,
sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Harman (R-Huntington Beach) and signed
by Gov. Gray Davis, extends those requirements to therapists at
chiropractic offices.</TE>

<HD>Arbitrator Orders Newspaper Owner to Pay Her Ex-Boyfriend
$14.8 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Billionaire Wendy McCaw of Santa Barbara News-Press
is also hit with punitive damages. Plaintiff said she tried to ruin
him. She may appeal, lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire environmentalist and Santa Barbara newspaper owner Wendy
McCaw has suffered a stinging legal defeat at the hands of an
arbitrator who awarded her former boyfriend and business associate
$14.8 million.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, revealed in documents filed Wednesday in Santa
Barbara Superior Court, not only gives nothing to McCaw but also
rebukes her with a $100,000 penalty in punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   "The award of punitive damages against Wendy McCaw is a damning
indictment of the way she conducted her business," said Gregory
Parker, the ex-paramour who accused her of trying to ruin him after
he broke off their relationship.</LD>
<TE>   In an accompanying statement, Parker's attorney, Thomas G. Foley
Jr., said punitive damages are awarded only if there is "clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud or malice."</TE>
<TE>   McCaw's attorney, Sue McCollum, said she hadn't seen the documents
but indicated that her client is likely to appeal the ruling. "If she
intended to let [the award go unchallenged], she would have paid it
before the numbers were made public."</TE>
<TE>   For McCaw, the owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press, the
arbitrator's award is just the latest legal setback. She has been
battling the California Coastal Commission for years to stop it from
opening to the public a stretch of beach beneath her 25-acre
bluff-top estate.</TE>
<TE>   After losing in state courts, she has appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. She has also paid $460,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw is the former wife of telecommunications visionary Craig
McCaw, who made billions in the cellular phone industry. Although her
holdings have declined in value from their peak worth of up to $4
billion, she remains one of the Central Coast's premier
businesswomen.</TE>
<TE>   She and Parker, a Santa Barbara attorney, met while she was
house-hunting. He went to work for her exclusively. In 1997, as her
marriage unraveled, Parker and McCaw began dating. Soon they made
plans to be married, but the relationship eventually fell apart,
Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   After that, he said, she forced him out of her business and
mounted a campaign to destroy him financially. She filed a complaint
with the State Bar of California that has since been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Parker filed suit seeking $11.4 million, in part to compensate him
for the work he did that added to McCaw's net worth.</TE>
<TE>   She contended that Parker was only after her money all along, but
he said it was her idea to give him an interest in her assets.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration hearings were held in April and May before David
N. Eagleson, a retired state Supreme Court justice.</TE>
<TE>   The award was made in August but remained confidential until now.
The fact that the arbitrator awarded Parker and his attorneys more
than they requested, along with punitive damages, was a surprise,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. McCaw attempted to excuse her dishonorable actions with sham
allegations of misconduct on the part of Mr. Parker," Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   If McCaw does appeal the ruling, the details of the award,
including the arbitrator's specific findings, will also become
public. A hearing is scheduled Nov. 4. Foley said the employment
contracts drafted by McCaw's own lawyers said any arbitration award
would be "final, binding and non-appealable."</TE>

<HD>Convicted 'Panty Bandit' Is Arrested in Burglary</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who was released from prison this year after serving 15 years
for robbing women of their underwear has been arrested on suspicion
of burglarizing an ex-girlfriend's workplace, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Allen Lyons, 47, once dubbed the "panty bandit," is being
held at Orange County Jail without bail, said Jim Amormino, spokesman
for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Lyons, who police said was stalking his ex-girlfriend Oct. 4,
broke into her workplace at a medical office in Aliso Viejo that
night, Amormino said. Authorities said they found Lyons with
personnel files, printouts of computer searches on people and two
stolen cell phones.</LD>
<TE>   The items implicate Lyons in more than 40 armed robberies in
Culver City, Los Angeles and Santa Monica, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases, the robber went into businesses carrying a box,
then forced employees at gunpoint to dump their belongings--including
cell phones, credit cards, watches and jewelry--in the container
before fleeing, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons was convicted in 1988 of 22 counts of robbery. Police said
he pointed a gun at women and ordered them to remove their underwear.</TE>
<TE>   He served his sentence and was released from prison but failed to
register as a sex offender as ordered by a judge, police said.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana to Investigate Claims of Fraud in Recall</HD>
<DH>Education: School board trustees vote 3 to 1 to spend
$30,000 to examine allegations of deception in the campaign to oust
member Nativo Lopez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana school board jumped into the middle of a raging recall
battle against one of its members by voting to spend up to $30,000 to
examine allegations that voters were deceived when they signed
petitions calling for the ouster of trustee Nativo Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-1 vote, cast in a closed session late Tuesday night,
immediately touched off a flurry of reaction from recall supporters
in the district.</LD>
<LD>   Recall backers, who blame Lopez for academic failures in the
62,000-student district, say the move is a thinly veiled attempt by
the trustee's allies on the board to stop a special recall election,
which could take place as early as January.</LD>
<TE>   Board members Nadia Maria Davis, John Palacio and Sal Tinajero,
who voted for the motion, denied the decision was politically
motivated.</TE>
<TE>   They said an examination is necessary to make sure an eventual
election, which would cost the district $125,000 to $200,000, is not
voided because it was on the ballot illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Rosemarie Avila voted against the motion. Lopez recused
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we can use public funds [for the election] is if we
have a legal mandate to do that," Davis said. "That duty has been
questioned because the district has received allegations that the
recall signatures were gathered based on fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Orange County registrar of voters certified 9,685
recall-petition signatures, about 1,000 more than the minimum needed
to qualify for an election. Among the 14,826 signatures submitted,
the registrar invalidated 4,476 and found 359 duplications.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, dozens of Lopez supporters showed up at a
school board meeting, demanding an investigation into allegations
that recall campaigners lied to voters and gathered signatures
improperly. Recall backers deny they did anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Tom Crofoot, Orange County senior deputy district
attorney, said he reviewed documents submitted by Lopez supporters
and found no evidence of election-law violations. Palacio suggested
more evidence may be forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Davis said the district has a duty to make sure the
allegations are not true and won't derail any special election.</TE>
<TE>   About $8,000 of the amount approved Tuesday will be used to file a
court petition to get access to the petition signatures, now under
seal with the registrar. If a judge grants permission, a paid
consultant will randomly call 400 petition signers to determine if
the signatures are legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   The board is scheduled to set a date for the special election at
its next meeting, Oct. 22. Davis said trustees expect to resolve
questions about the signatures by then.</TE>
<TE>   The latest development marked yet another milestone in this year's
pitched battle for control of the severely overcrowded Santa Ana
Unified School District, Orange County's largest. Lopez, first
elected in 1996, has dismissed the recall campaign as the effort of a
few disgruntled parents fueled by support from residents at the
city's wealthier north end who oppose a new elementary school in
their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio and Davis, viewed by many as Lopez's ideological allies on
the board, face tough reelection contests Nov. 5. Lopez was reelected
to a second four-year term in November 2000.</TE>

<HD>Man Shot by Police in Redondo Is Identified</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Native American man from Minnesota who had lived in California for
six years was identified by authorities Wednesday as the unarmed car
chase suspect accidentally shot to death by a Redondo Beach police
officer who mistook a shotgun for a beanbag gun.</LD>
<LD>   Nathan Lee Rossbach, 40, of Red Lake, Minn., was fatally wounded
Sunday evening, said David Campbell of the Los Angeles County
coroner's office. Family members said Rossbach, who had a prior
assault conviction in Minnesota, worked as an independent commercial
fisherman.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Michael Strosnider, 30, shot Rossbach on Sunday at the
conclusion of a high-speed chase through three South Bay cities.</LD>
<TE>   A preliminary investigation found that a senior officer at the
scene ordered the use of a beanbag shotgun when Rossbach at first
refused to follow orders to get out of the vehicle, according to
sources. Strosnider was handed a weapon by Officer Mike Martinez,
according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   That weapon did not have the yellow tape the Redondo Beach Police
Department uses to distinguish those carrying beanbags rather than
live ammunition, according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at her home in Minnesota, Rossbach's sister Mamie Rossbach
said that family members were considering hiring an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like he was shot in cold blood, because he wasn't a
dangerous person," she said. "They [Redondo Beach police] haven't
provided any answers when we call down there."</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach city officials said they would not comment on the
shooting until an investigation is completed.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting, which was recorded on a police videotape, is being
investigated by the district attorney's office and the Los Angeles
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when Redondo Beach police received a call at
6:50 p.m. Sunday about a reckless motorist on Pacific Coast Highway
in a 1992 Ford Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Rossbach led police on a high-speed chase north
through El Segundo. He then turned west onto Imperial Highway and
crashed into the curb, leaving the Bronco disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The Ford Bronco was involved in a hit-and-run incident Sunday
morning in Hermosa Beach. The Bronco rear-ended a Mercedes and then
drove away, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A witness reported the license plate, and when police contacted
the Marina del Rey owner, she realized her vehicle had been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Mamie Rossbach said her brother was the youngest of five children
and had worked as a logger as well as a fisherman. He moved away from
the Red Lake Indian Reservation after his father died following a
lengthy illness.</TE>

<HD>Slain O.C. Girl's Mom Begins Drive to Prevent Abductions</HD>
<DH>Crime: The mother of 5-year-old victim Samantha Runnion
releases a brochure providing safety tips that is being sent to
schools countywide.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of a 5-year-old Stanton girl who was abducted and killed
in July unveiled a brochure on kidnapping prevention Wednesday that
will be distributed in schools across Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The brochures "will give our children the ideas to be aware [of]
the red flags, like a grown person should never ask you for
directions, or help or personal questions about your home life," Erin
Runnion said at a news conference with Orange County Sheriff Michael
S. Carona and William Habermehl, county superintendent of schools.</LD>
<LD>   "These are ways predators try to gain access to our children,"
Runnion added.</LD>
<TE>   "But if our children are aware, they have a better chance of
getting out of a situation. It's our duty to watch out for our
children, to protect them."</TE>
<TE>   Officials began distributing some of the 500,000 brochures
Wednesday to elementary and junior high schools, libraries, police
stations and city offices. The Sheriff's Department and the
Department of Education paid for the brochures, which cost $25,000.
The handout provides tips on avoiding abduction and information on
resources available to children and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our children to be aware of their surroundings, not
afraid of them. The brochures ... are as much for parents as they are
for children," Runnion said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we want to empower our children to have confidence and trust
in their instincts. But we must know that it is our responsibility to
protect them."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend near a
row of garages at her Stanton condominium complex. Her body was found
the next day along a mountain road between Orange County and Lake
Elsinore. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Alejandro Avila, 27, of Lake Elsinore, awaits a
preliminary hearing Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   After her daughter's murder, Erin Runnion started the Joyful Child
Foundation. She said she discovered that most people want to help and
be involved in their communities but lack guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very least, let Samantha's example [increase] your
awareness," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do read these brochures, do talk to your children," she said.
"Don't let this be in vain."</TE>

<HD>One Ryder Count May Be Tossed</HD>
<DH>Courts: The D.A.'s office asks the judge to drop a
drug-possession charge, but says it's ready to try the actress on
three theft-related allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors asked a judge Wednesday to drop a drug-possession charge
against Winona Ryder but said they are ready to go to trial on
shoplifting and theft charges as scheduled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, hailed it as a partial victory. He
had maintained for months that the actress had a prescription for the
pills seized by police after she was arrested on suspicion of
shoplifting last year at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said dismissal
would be in the interest of justice, based on a sworn statement
Geragos gave. Prosecutors said Ryder lacked the "criminal knowledge"
needed for a conviction.</LD>
<TE>   Although prosecutors would not elaborate, Geragos said the
statement was from a physician confirming Ryder's prescription, which
had been given to prosecutors earlier. Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle
filed a motion Wednesday saying the "declaration, if true, raises a
question as to whether the defendant possessed the requisite criminal
knowledge necessary" for a violation of state law. The law does not
apply to a person who possesses the drug with a doctor's written
prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox will consider the request
Tuesday, when Ryder's shoplifting trial is scheduled to begin in the
Beverly Hills courthouse. Ryder is accused of taking about $6,000
worth of merchandise from the Beverly Hills store. Prosecutors say
she stole purses, hats, hair bands, socks, a sweater and a shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged Ryder, 30, with possession of a controlled
substance in February after Beverly Hills police searched her bag and
found the Oxycodone tablets. The drug is a strong pain reliever
similar to morphine. Geragos has said his client was taking
painkillers because of an arm injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud their decision and obviously I'm very happy," Geragos
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   During Ryder's preliminary hearing in June, a criminalist
testified that the pills were Endocet, a generic brand of the
painkiller Percocet, which contains Oxycodone.</TE>
<TE>   Fox determined after the hearing that there was enough evidence
for Ryder to be tried on four felony charges, including the
drug-possession count.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors still plan to try her on charges of grand theft,
burglary and vandalism. She could face up to three years in state
prison if convicted. "The other three charges remain, and we are
ready to go to trial," district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, star of such films as "Girl, Interrupted" and "Little
Women," is free on $20,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Liberals Outline Their Platform for Proposed Valley City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaunn Cartwright wants voters who think that only conservatives back
San Fernando Valley secession to know that she's a liberal--and so
are 16 others running for office in the proposed new Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   "We're proud liberals," said Cartwright, a candidate in District 1
in the proposed new city. "We're liberals with a big, loud L on our
shoulders. We're doing this to let the Valley citizens know this
isn't some Christian Coalition, right-wing fundamentalist takeover of
the Valley."</LD>
<LD>   The secession movement was launched by conservatives, many of them
veterans of the anti-busing and Proposition 13 campaigns of the
1970s. And of 111 candidates on the Nov. 5 secession ballot, just 17
joined the Valley Alliance of Liberals--and only 10 showed up at a
news conference held Wednesday to release the group's platform.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance's proposals include continuing Los Angeles'
rent-control and living-wage ordinances after secession, and
recognizing domestic partnerships. The group also called for more
parks and public landscaping, and for opening day-care centers at
city offices.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Libs, as they informally call themselves, also want to
hire more veterinarians for the Department of Animal Regulation and
build art museums and other cultural institutions in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a moderately liberal agenda," said candidate Terry Stone,
who helped draft the platform. "It's nothing terribly scary."</TE>
<TE>   It was a day of campaigning for other Valley city candidates as
well. Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who is running for
mayor of the Valley city, released a series of proposals that he said
would improve public education.</TE>
<TE>   Richman acknowledged that a new city, like Los Angeles, would have
no jurisdiction over schools. But he said he would hire a liaison to
work with the Los Angeles Unified School District for programs and
reforms that city officials feel are important.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Richman said, he would encourage the establishment of
elected parent councils at all schools, and would push the state
Legislature to require that the school district use more funds for
classroom needs and less for bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The city does not, and would not, have direct jurisdiction over
the schools," Richman said. "So what is available to us is the bully
pulpit to move the schools toward improvement."</TE>
<TE>   If schools have not improved after two years, Richman said, he
would lead an effort to break up L.A. Unified and create a Valley
school district.</TE>

<HD>Simon Not Apologizing, but GOP Strategists Are Left in
Sorry State</HD>
<DH>Politics: Debacle over Davis photo fuels fears that other
candidates will pay for blunders by their standard-bearer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis called on Bill Simon Jr. Wednesday to quit the race for
California governor, as the GOP nominee stumbled for a second day
over a misfired attack on his Democratic rival.</LD>
<LD>   A thick gloom settled over Republicans, from Simon's inner circle
to party donors, with strategists fretting that Simon's troubles
might spread to the rest of the statewide ticket.</LD>
<LD>   Traditionally, down-ballot candidates have counted on a strong
pull from their party's gubernatorial nominee to sweep them into
office. That could be especially important this year, with all seven
GOP candidates for offices such as lieutenant governor, treasurer and
attorney general trailing their Democratic opponents in fund-raising.</LD>
<TE>   "All over California today, Republican leaders are banging their
heads against walls and asking, 'Why, why, why?' " said Jack Pitney,
a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College and a former
Republican National Committee operative.</TE>
<TE>   Simon scrapped a public event that had been tentatively scheduled
for Wednesday, but aides said he had no plans to quit the race.</TE>
<TE>   As stunned GOP insiders questioned how his campaign could so badly
bungle its attack on Davis' controversial fund-raising practices, the
group that started the flap withdrew its complaint to the state's
political watchdog agency and apologized--to Simon, but not Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The group, the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, had
been feuding with the Davis campaign after endorsing Simon months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, meantime, broke his silence over the brouhaha, which
began Monday when Simon accused him of illegally accepting a campaign
check in his state office while lieutenant governor. Simon's campaign
cited the COPS complaint as his source.</TE>
<TE>   A photo released Tuesday as proof boomeranged on the GOP hopeful
when it became clear that the office pictured was not Davis'. On
Wednesday, one of the governor's longtime supporters, developer Bruce
Karatz, stepped forward to say the photograph was taken in the den of
his former Santa Monica home.</TE>
<TE>   The blunder was just the latest to beset the Simon campaign, which
has been buffeted for months by internal dissension and controversies
over the candidate's taxes, business dealings and his shifting
position on gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   "He should drop out," Davis said of Simon. "His whole campaign has
been an embarrassment."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on KGO Radio in San Francisco, Davis offered further
evidence to undermine Simon's attack, pointing out that the date
stamped on the disputed photo--Jan. 31, 1998--was a Saturday.
Government offices were closed that day, Davis noted.</TE>
<TE>   On another radio program, Simon renewed his call for an
investigation into his allegations against the governor, even as
aides prepared a statement acknowledging doubts about the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see what the FPPC comes up with," Simon said during an
interview on KSFO Radio in San Francisco. He was referring to the
state's political watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices
Commission, which fielded the complaint filed by COPS on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," Simon said. "This is just one more in a series of
troubling episodes in the Davis administration."</TE>
<TE>   In a second interview, on KTVU-TV in Oakland, Simon would not say
whether he still believed the photograph was taken in the lieutenant
governor's office, despite evidence to the contrary. "I have no
reason to believe that it was or it wasn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon implied that any mistake was not his doing.</TE>
<TE>   "The photograph shows the acceptance of a check," Simon said. "You
know, it's purported to be in the lieutenant governor's office. Once
again, this isn't my complaint."</TE>
<TE>   But within a few hours, Simon appeared to further back away from
his allegations regarding the COPS picture, which purported to show
Davis accepting a $10,000 check from the group during his first run
for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "The location where the governor received this contribution is now
in question," the candidate acknowledged in a statement issued by his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the statement reiterated Simon's attacks on
Davis' aggressive fund-raising, saying that was why "it did not seem
far-fetched" to accuse him of a crime. "Even if the specific claims
... are not sustained" there should be a thorough investigation,
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in yet another statement issued Wednesday night, the
candidate conceded his allegation was mistaken. "It now appears that
the complaint of the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs
was unfounded," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republicans searching for some good in the odd episode
suggested the flap could hurt Davis by highlighting his intensive
fund-raising throughout his governorship.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds people Gray Davis runs around taking every $10,000
check he can get," said GOP strategist Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Hoffenblum echoed many Republicans who wondered how
Simon, who worked for three years as an assistant U.S. attorney in
New York, could have made such an explosive charge without airtight
substantiation.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon probably believed it was true when he said it," Hoffenblum
said. "But why a former prosecutor didn't have 100% of all the facts
and 100% assurances before he made the claim, I don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   According to campaign sources, Simon was never supposed to be
entangled in the photo's release.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign learned of the picture earlier this year. But top
Simon advisors got a glimpse of it only in the last two weeks, when
COPS officials told them they planned to file a complaint against
Davis with the FPPC. The original plan was to let COPS issue the
photograph and limit Simon's role to pinning down Davis during
Monday's candidate debate, the insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   But during a post-debate news conference, the candidate grew
flustered under aggressive questioning and went further than planned,
telling reporters the campaign had "evidence" that Davis had broken
the law.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, campaign staffers got their first extensive look at
the photograph when COPS released the picture at a Los Angeles news
conference. In Sacramento, a campaign advisor dashed over to the
state Capitol, where it was evident the photograph could not have
been taken in the lieutenant governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's aides failed to warn the candidate of the discrepancy
before his own press conference started. In North Hollywood, the
candidate declared that the photographs provided "proof" that the
governor broke the law, only to be pummeled with questions from
reporters. At that point, Simon backed away from the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   The turn of events dismayed and angered Simon staffers, who had
been hoping that Monday's debate would signal a new phase for a
campaign that has struggled for months to get off the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "People were just shaking their heads with disbelief that this
could happen, that Bill could be this far out on a limb without the
photo being vetted," said one strategist.</TE>
<TE>   But for outsiders long critical of the Simon campaign--including
the White House and Republican Party leaders in Washington--the
episode only served to reinforce their doubts. "This is the pattern
of a campaign that just doesn't have a clue," said one GOP
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is set to receive a desperately needed infusion of campaign
cash this week from the national party. The $1-million donation,

<HD>Jury Urges Execution for Stayner</HD>
<DH>Courts: Panel rejects arguments about his tortured
childhood and testimony by 50 character witnesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>A jury declared Wednesday that Yosemite murderer Cary Stayner should
be executed for the slaying of three women tourists, killings that
rattled the serenity of the Sierra woods in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The jury pushed aside arguments that Stayner, 41, should be spared
a trip to death row because of dogged mental health problems and a
loveless childhood rife with dysfunction and family tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Stayner faces a Dec. 12 sentencing before Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Thomas Hastings in the murders of Carole Sund,
42, of Eureka, her 15-year-old daughter, Juli, and Silvina Pelosso,
16, a family friend visiting from Argentina.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors avoided eye contact with Stayner as they stepped into a
packed courtroom after less than six hours of deliberations over two
days. As the verdict was read, Stayner sat motionless and the
courtroom remained hushed.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Marcia Morrissey, said afterward that she would
request a new Superior Court trial in addition to the appeal
automatically filed in capital punishment cases. Morrissey, who
jousted repeatedly with Hastings throughout the trial, had hoped even
more evidence of Stayner's troubled past might be presented.</TE>
<TE>   "This fight won't be over for Cary Stayner until he gets a fair
trial," Morrissey said. "Obviously I'm very disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   But the family of Carole and Juli Sund countered that a mountain
of evidence had been presented--and a just verdict reached.</TE>
<TE>   "Condemning Cary Stayner to death is not happy for anybody," said
Carole Carrington, whose daughter and granddaughter died at Stayner's
hands. "But it's justice."</TE>
<TE>   The Sunds and Pelosso vanished in February 1999 from the Cedar
Lodge in El Portal, a tiny community in a deep river gorge outside
Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest searches in state history ended four weeks
later and a county away when the torched hulk of their rental car was
discovered on a forest logging road with the charred remains of two
victims in the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Note Led to Body</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous note--Stayner later admitted to sending it, even
asking someone else to lick the stamp--led authorities within days to
the shore of a nearby lake, where they found the nude body of Juli
Sund, her neck sliced open.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the FBI focused on a group of methamphetamine addicts
in Modesto, and by summer felt solid enough about the case to
publicly announce that it was safe again to return to the woods.</TE>
<TE>   But five months after the tourists disappeared, Joie Ruth
Armstrong, 26, became Stayner's fourth victim. Her beheaded body was
found near the Yosemite nature guide's cabin in a remote corner of
the park in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the gruesome killing, authorities caught up with
Stayner. He pleaded guilty in federal court to Armstrong's murder to
avoid the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   State prosecutors refused to budge in the killing of the tourists,
a case tried in a state Superior Court because it occurred outside
the national park. The trial was moved from Mariposa County to San
Jose because of pretrial publicity in the Sierra foothills.</TE>
<TE>   George Williamson, the lead prosecutor, described Stayner as a
methodical killer who carefully hatched a plan to hunt down young
women like prey, sexually assault them and kill them.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, he noted, even left wet towels in the motel room to make
it look as if the three women had showered and left, hardly the moves
of a mind clouded by mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   In a taped confession played at the trial, Stayner admitted that
he used the ruse of a leaking pipe to get into the motel room of his
victims. He strangled Carole Sund and Pelosso, then took Juli Sund on
a winding journey that ended on the shore of Lake Don Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner confessed to FBI agents that he carried the high school
cheerleader from the car like a "groom carried a bride across the
threshold," then sexually assaulted her. Stayner told Sund that the
gun he wielded at Cedar Lodge never was loaded. Then he slit her
throat.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-week trial played out in three parts, with the jury in
August finding Stayner guilty and in September declaring that he was
sane during the killings. The penalty phase stretched over 12 days,
as jurors weighed whether Stayner should die by lethal injection or
live out the remainder of his life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   From the trial's first day, defense lawyers conceded that Stayner
killed the three women. But they said he suffered mental health
problems that should keep him off San Quentin's death row.</TE>
<TE>   Asking Jury for Mercy</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey, the defense attorney, noted that Stayner had shown
remorse and pleaded with jurors to "overcome the cruelty of Cary
Stayner's acts with understanding, mercy and love."</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey said a lethal mix of mental health
issues--obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and sexual
dysfunction--boiled over in 1999. Visions and voices Stayner
experienced for years--ranging from Nazi death camps to
beheadings--took over, she said. The man who had been a passive and
kind presence for 37 years turned into a killer.</TE>
<TE>   During the penalty phase, the defense called on more than 50
character witnesses: Stayner's parents, sisters, former girlfriends,
classmates and co-workers. All portrayed him as the antithesis of the
coldblooded killer.</TE>
<TE>   Blown-up photographs showed a gaptoothed boy with freckled face.
Stayner, friends said, was the kid who sat at the end of the bench in
Little League, the high school cartoonist caught up in his own little
world, the teenager who didn't retaliate when other kids picked on
him. He refused to hunt, one relative recalled, rationalizing that
the birds had never done anything to harm him.</TE>
<TE>   But the Stayner family was deeply troubled, a clan that considered
the display of emotions taboo, friends said. Their lives were torn
asunder when Stayner's younger brother, Steven, was abducted in 1972
at the age of 7 by a pedophile and held hostage for seven years
before escaping with another young boy. Their return out of the mists
of time caused a national media stir in the family's hometown of
Merced, culminating in a book and TV miniseries.</TE>
<TE>   During his brother's absence, Cary Stayner and his three sisters
were virtually ignored, the parents testified. Delbert Stayner, the
father, said he mostly just yelled at Cary. The children endured
family vacations devoted to following up one crackpot tip after
another about Steven's alleged whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   When the brother returned, life didn't improve much for Cary,
relatives said. Affection was showered on Steven, but the others were
still ignored. Later, Steven Stayner died in a motorcycle accident,
sending Cary spinning into depression.</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists who examined Stayner said he had experienced vivid
imagery of sex and violence since an early age. His family tree, they
said, is laden with relatives suffering from mental illnesses,
including depression and pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Stayner pulled out his own hair. In grade school, he
was molested by an uncle, the jury was told.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, Stayner had a fixation with Bigfoot and the
apocalyptic prophesies of the 16th century astrologer Nostradamus.
Though he was tall, burly and handsome, friends said he rarely dated
or even flirted. One former girlfriend testified their romantic life
had been troubled by his sexual difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Defense experts contended during the trial that Stayner's brain
may have been damaged in the womb, probably in a region that controls
emotional impulses, an assertion that a prosecution expert discounted
as unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   Described as a Predator</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Stayner was a predator, not a man driven by
mental health problems. During final arguments, Williamson told
jurors there was no compelling evidence demonstrating that at the
time of the murders Stayner was "mentally or emotionally screwed up."
He questioned whether Stayner's life, though troubled, was "so tragic
that he's deserving of your sympathy and forgiveness."</TE>
<TE>   To drive the point home about Stayner's deeds, the prosecutor
displayed photos of Armstrong's headless body and played Stayner's
confession of the murder's brutal details. Stayner, Williamson also
noted, slept soundly the night after he killed the three sightseers.</TE>
<TE>   While incarcerated after the killings, Stayner was asked by an FBI
agent to write a letter to the families of his victims. Instead, he
penned a note to Juli Sund that was read to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed his sorrow to the teenager, and talked of the years
she would miss. He said she was in a good place, and that he would be
going somewhere far worse.</TE>
<TE>   "I know right from wrong, and I don't think that I am insane," the
letter concluded, "but there is a craziness that lurks in my head,
thoughts I have tried to subdue as long as I can remember. I'm just
sorry that you were there when the years of fantasizing my darkest
dreams became a reality in the flesh."</TE>

<HD>The Bradbury Sparkles as Jewel in City Landscape</HD>
<DH>A century old, the building retains its mystic,
awe-inspiring interior presence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bradbury Building is renowned mainly for its elaborate black
wrought iron and the extraordinary play of light and angles in its
vast atrium. The iron latticework fills five floors within the
century-old brick building, running like dense ivy along the indoor
balconies, wrapping around the twin "bird cage" elevators.</LD>
<LD>   Sunlight filters through a pitched glass ceiling, creating an
ambience that glows golden by day and darkens, by evening, into an
eerie beauty.</LD>
<LD>   The mystical feel is appropriate, for mysticism played an integral
role in the building's stunning design--at least according to legend.
The structure is the legacy of Lewis Bradbury, a 19th century
gold-mining and real estate tycoon who, late in life, decided to
erect a monument to himself in downtown Los Angeles. His chosen
architect, the eminent Sumner Hunt, drafted plans that proved
uninspiring, so Bradbury instead offered the job to one of Hunt's
young draftsmen, George Wyman.</LD>
<TE>   Leery of usurping his boss' work, Wyman is said to have consulted
a planchette, a precursor of the Ouija board. A message from his dead
brother, Mark, made the choice clear: "Take the Bradbury assignment,"
the board supposedly spelled out. "It will make you famous."</TE>
<TE>   It did. Wyman is credited with designing a masterpiece that one
critic labeled "a fairyland of mathematics," a jewel concealed behind
a rather drab brick facade at Broadway and 3rd Street. Completed in
1893 for $500,000--nearly triple the original budget--the Bradbury
Building endures as one of the city's most admired spaces. It remains
in use for offices and figures prominently in ambitions for reviving
the Broadway corridor, once a thriving theater district.</TE>
<TE>   The Bradbury atrium's ornate latticework, its huge paneled
skylight, its Belgian marble staircases and scalloped oak railings
offer a mesmerizing degree of symmetry and visual complexity.</TE>
<TE>   To stand at one end and look across the atrium is comparable to
standing alone in an old-growth forest or gazing toward the ceilings
of Westminster Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awe-inspiring, cathedral-like," said Stephen Kanner,
chairman and co-founder of the Architecture + Design Museum of Los
Angeles, which occupies ground-floor exhibit space in the Bradbury
Building.</TE>
<TE>   The suites and balconies have been used in a long list of films,
including "Pay It Forward," a 2000 release starring Kevin Spacey, and
"Wolf," a 1994 feature with Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Most famously, the Bradbury's carefully darkened lines established
the haunting noire tone of Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner," the 1982
classic about life in a bleak Los Angeles of the distant future.</TE>
<TE>   "The real point about the Bradbury is it's timeless," said
Francine Lipsman, the building's general manager, who concedes that
filmmaking in the structure has waned due to excessive exposure. The
Bradbury's look is far too distinctive to keep using it over and
over.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike some other places," Lipsman said, "when you're here,
there's no doubt you're here."</TE>
<TE>   Walking in from the Broadway entrance, the full grandeur of the
interior does not strike the visitor right away. The narrow lobby,
framed by high brick walls, has the look of a Parisian alley of
arched windows and doorways. One strolls some distance before gaining
a full view of the wonders overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Looking up then, one sees that the open area is somewhat V-shaped,
like the steel structure of a boat hull. The gap between the second
floor balconies is far wider than the floor of the lobby. The gap
between the upper floor balconies is wider still. At the very top are
rows of windows, which open with hand cranks for ventilation, and
long, rectangular panes of glass that make up the skylight, supported
with wire mesh.</TE>
<TE>   Many fixtures, such as the iron wall sconces, are original,
despite a $7-million renovation completed 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds echo through the atrium--voices, doors slamming--but the
hand-operated, open-cage elevators glide up and down with a beguiling
noiselessness. Atop the shaft cages, huge wheels spin, moving cables
and counterweights. They are really an elaborate ruse, Lipsman said,
since the elevators were converted to hydraulic power many years ago.
The 28 large bricks that are bound into each counterweight are now
painted Styrofoam.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned from the film industry," she quipped.</TE>
<TE>   A report filed years ago with the Library of Congress calls the
Bradbury "an early and excellent example of a break with facade
architecture and the acknowledgment of the unpleasantness of a busy
city street." Once inside, in other words, Broadway and its heavy
traffic all but cease to exist. The art nouveau iron work--briefly
displayed at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair--is "a remnant of the Cast
Iron Age, which began with the iron bridges in the early half of the
19th century," the historical report notes.</TE>
<TE>   Glazed and unglazed yellow bricks cover much of the interior
walls. Along with the golden oak railings, decorative terra cotta and
pale pink bricks, they account for the warmth of the interior light.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe Wyman was inspired by Edward Bellamy, whose 1887
novel "Looking Backward" described a building of some future time. "A
vast hall of light," Bellamy wrote, "received not alone from the
windows on all sides but from the dome, the point of which was a
hundred feet above.... The walls were frescoed in mellow tints, to
soften without absorbing the light which flooded the interior."</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about light," said Francis Krahe, founder of a lighting
design firm that moved into the Bradbury more than a year ago. He
uses the atrium as a laboratory, seeing how the light might fall, for
example, on a piece of outdoor sculpture. He likes the building best
near sunset, when the sunlight and shadows toy with the geometry, and
he likes to see the reactions of people who casually wander in off
the street.</TE>
<TE>   "They're sort of in awe by what they've discovered," Krahe said.
"It's a truly extraordinary experience."</TE>

elaborate interplay of light and shadow, softened by the glazed and
unglazed yellow bricks and woodwork that cover the surfaces beneath
the soaring skylight.</CP>

<HD>Ex-County Planner Jailed in Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Emmet Taylor, 64, is charged with 97 counts of
forgery, falsification of land records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office arrested a former
county planner Wednesday night who is charged with 97 counts of
forgery and falsification of public records in an alleged massive
land fraud case that has cost the county hundreds of thousands of
dollars to correct.</LD>
<LD>   Emmet Taylor, 64, was arrested as he returned to his Fullerton
home from knee surgery, according to Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for
the district attorney's office. He was taken into custody without
incident and, as a precaution, booked into the jail ward at Los
Angeles County-USC Medical Center, Gibbons said.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have spent more than a year investigating Taylor, who
county officials say issued hundreds of illegal certificates allowing
land to be developed without the required environmental and public
review. Officials have said Taylor, who ran a real estate consulting
business out of his home, issued the documents, called certificates
of compliance, in exchange for bribes.</LD>
<TE>   The certificates are obscure but powerful planning documents that
allow land to be developed without the standard public hearing and
environmental review process required by modern zoning laws.</TE>
<TE>   They apply to parcels that have development rights that predate
more recent growth restrictions. Certificates of compliance are
issued only after the owners of the parcels can produce evidence that
they were legal lots before those development laws were enacted.</TE>
<TE>   But the county has alleged that Taylor gave certificates to
property owners who did not qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was fired by the county in late 2000 after auditors
reviewed 57 certificates he had issued and found all were improper,
according to legal papers. Prosecutors were alerted to the case in
January of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's attorney, Richard Shinee, could not be reached Wednesday
night. He has said his client followed county procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Planning officials say Taylor issued the phony certificates to a
wide array of landowners in various rural pockets of the county,
predominantly in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The county has spent more than $300,000 to fund a task force that
is reviewing the more than 1,000 certificates Taylor issued. In
several cases, the county has forced property owners to halt
construction and reapply for permits.</TE>

<HD>Cold War Bioweapon Tests Included California</HD>
<DH>Defense: Secret trials in six states, from '62 to '73, were
to track dispersal patterns, officials say.</DH>

<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon sprayed biological and chemical agents off the coast of
San Diego during the Cold War, part of a series of previously
undisclosed tests in several states that exposed troops and perhaps
thousands of civilians to the compounds, defense officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 27 newly disclosed secret tests were conducted in
California, Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland and Utah, officials
said. The tests, conducted from 1962 to 1973, were also carried out
in Canada and the United Kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   In February 1966, a Navy vessel in the Pacific Ocean off the coast
of San Diego was sprayed with methylacetoacetate, or MA, a chemical
that irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract but is not
considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency.</LD>
<TE>   In a second test in the summer of 1968, MA and Bacillus globigii,
or BG, were released in the same waters. A bacterium related to
anthrax, BG was later found to infect people with weak immune
systems. No civilians are thought to have been exposed to harmful
agents in those tests because they were carried out over the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the Pentagon has acknowledged that it used
the agents on U.S. soil and that civilians may have been exposed
during the tests. The Defense Department previously revealed that 10
tests were carried out during the Cold War on U.S. ships to determine
how they would perform under chemical or biological attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department released the information at a House
Veterans Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday; some elements were
leaked to reporters Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials insisted that none of the agents used near
civilians was thought at the time to be dangerous, although
some--including E. coli bacteria--were later found to be harmful,
even deadly.</TE>
<TE>   In 21 tests on land and six newly reported tests at sea overseen
by the Deseret Test Center at Ft. Douglas, Utah, live biological
agents and lethal chemicals--including sarin and VX--were sprayed not
only in the six states, but at or near military facilities in Puerto
Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Marshall Islands, Baker Island
and over international waters in the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The 37 tests disclosed so far affected about 5,000 service members
at sea and 500 on land from 1962 to 1973, defense officials said. The
Pentagon has notified about 1,400 of those soldiers about the secret
testing regimen, dubbed "Project 112."</TE>
<TE>   The Deseret test center reported that four people were infected at
the time and successfully treated. Veterans Affairs officials said
they were studying the phenomenon; 53 veterans have filed health
claims since the 1990s. The claims blame what they say was their
exposure to the chemical or biological agents for a variety of
ailments, including muscular, skeletal, digestive, hearing, skin and
cardiovascular disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said the Pentagon has no process for notifying
civilians who may have been exposed in the U.S., including those
possibly numbering "into the thousands" on Oahu, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials believe local authorities were notified of the
tests at the time, said William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant Defense
secretary for health affairs, but most citizens apparently were not.
Veterans advocates said lower-level soldiers also were unaware,
although defense officials insisted the soldiers were protected by
chemical gear and masks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making this information available so that anyone who
believes there may have been some ill effect could come forward,"
Winkenwerder said.</TE>
<TE>   Civilians were not believed to have been affected in California
because the four tests conducted there--including two first reported
Wednesday--were all conducted off the San Diego coast in the Pacific
Ocean, according to the Pentagon analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials insisted that civilians were exposed only to
live biological agents that simulated more deadly agents in the way
they spread, but were themselves believed to be harmless. However,
the simulated substances included E. coli and other agents that were
later found to be harmful or fatal to young children, the elderly and
those with compromised immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Even soldiers and sailors exposed during the tests "may not have
known all the details of these tests," Winkenwerder said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these people didn't have a clue what they were part of,"
said Kirt Love, a veterans advocate with the Desert Storm Battle
Registry who contended that in many cases only senior officers were
aware of the tests. "These were not safe agents at the time."</TE>
<TE>   After the report was released of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee hearing, it was detailed at a Pentagon briefing. Defense
officials said the tests were conducted for potential offensive use
against U.S. enemies and for defense against the Cold War biological
and chemical weapons arsenal amassed by the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy trials tested the ability of ships and sailors, clad in
chemical defense gear, to perform under a chemical or biological
attack at sea. The land-based tests were done to evaluate how the
agents dispersed, officials said. Desert tests such as those in Utah
helped the Pentagon amass much of the information the military has on
how chemical and biological agents would perform in desert areas such
as Iraq, said Anna Johnson-Winegar, the Pentagon's assistant
secretary for chemical and biological defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of these operational tests was to test equipment,
procedures, military tactics, etc., and to learn more about
biological and chemical agents," Winkenwerder said. "The tests were
not conducted to evaluate the effects of dangerous agents on people."</TE>
<TE>   The United States ended its biological weapons program in the
1960s and in 1997 signed a treaty agreeing to destroy all of its
chemical weapons. Funding and disposal issues have delayed much of
that process, leaving stores of lethal chemicals at several military
sites throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Today, defense officials insist that the only testing of toxic and
biological agents in the United States is given to chemical
specialists among the armed services at a tightly contained testing
facility at Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo. So-called stimulants still are used
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures are unlikely to be the last from Project 112. The
military had planned 134 tests; 46 were conducted, 62 were canceled
and the status of the remainder is unclear. The newly disclosed tests
used a variety of agents under various conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Tests in the late 1960s in Porton Down, England, and Ralson,
Canada, used tabun and soman, two deadly nerve agents.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1965 Oahu test, BG was sprayed in a simulated attack called
"Big Tom." Near Ft. Greely, Alaska, researchers tested how deadly
sarin gas, the toxin members of the Aum Supreme Truth cult used in
1995 to kill commuters in the Tokyo subway, would disperse after
being released from artillery shells and rockets in dense forests in
a test dubbed "Devil Hole I" in 1965. A year later, VX agent, which
lingers like motor oil in deadly pools, was released by artillery
shells in "Devil Hole II."</TE>

<HD>After Fall, Adam Won't Be the Same, Expert Contends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After singing the nursery rhyme about how Humpty Dumpty could never
be put together again, a leading Renaissance scholar said Wednesday
that a priceless marble sculpture of Adam by the Venetian sculptor
Tullio Lombardo will never recover fully from a fall Sunday at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The piece was "the country's most important Renaissance sculpture,
unfortunately," said Colin Eisner, a professor of fine arts at New
York University who works across Fifth Avenue from the Met.</LD>
<LD>   Once damaged, a work of art "is not the same," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Lombardo lived circa 1455 to 1532, and the sculpture is dated
1490-95. Standing 6-foot-3, it depicts a youthful Adam standing, his
arm resting on a tree trunk. The museum acquired it in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   The statue is valued as the first monumental nude of the
Renaissance, reviving the idealized forms of Greek and Roman art. It
was on a 4-foot-tall plywood base just 3 years old that apparently
buckled without provocation. The accident caused extensive damage to
the figure's arms and legs as well as to the tree trunk; the head and
torso were relatively unharmed, officials said. One local preparation
specialist--an expert in packing and shipping similar
sculptures--estimated that the piece weighs 1,800 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, who has written extensively on Michelangelo, compared the
damage to that suffered by Michelangelo's famous Pieta, which
underwent extensive repair after being attacked in 1972 by a vandal
with a sculptor's hammer.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a kind of cosmetic appearance where it's been restored,"
Eisner said of Michelangelo's marble depiction of Mary and Jesus,
displayed in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The vandal severed Mary's
arm at the elbow, took a chunk off her nose and chipped one of her
eyelids. "Because it's marble, even if they use an almost invisible
adhesive, it looks cosmetic."</TE>
<TE>   If scholars doubt that Lombardo's Adam can be fully restored,
those who do the work are more optimistic. They agree with
Metropolitan museum director Philippe de Montebello's prediction that
after repair--expected to take two years--only the "cognoscenti" will
recognize a change.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact they are clean breaks is a plus," Virginia Greene, a
leading sculpture conservator at the University of Pennsylvania, said
Wednesday. "And there has been no previous repair, no adhesives, no
messing around with the joins." (Joins are areas where two pieces of
marble meet.)</TE>
<TE>   She cautioned that "depending on the nature of the stone, it is
difficult to tell how invisible the repairs will be." But she added:
"I would expect that the results would be pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest difficulty will be areas where the marble has
powdered on impact. This will have to be done with fills. There are,
however, modern resin-based fill materials which mimic the
translucency of marble," Greene said. "So the possibilities are
really quite good that the results will be entirely satisfactory."</TE>
<TE>   Areas that have been repaired will be visible with an ultraviolet
light, she said, but likely not noticeable to most observers. Harold
Holzer, the Metropolitan Museum's chief spokesman, said the sculpture
was discovered shattered after 9 p.m. Sunday by a guard making
routine rounds.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday and much of Tuesday, museum staff gathered the broken
pieces. As each shard was retrieved, it was bagged, numbered and
identified. The torso was later taken to the museum's conservation
laboratory. "At the same time this was happening, an assessment of
the pedestal was made, which was clearly, as far as we can tell, the
area of the problem," Holzer said. One side of the base had
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Holzer said sculpture bases throughout the museum were being
reinforced and rechecked for safety. Conservators and museum
professionals around the country said they were doing the same at
their institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a wake-up call for many institutions," said
Victoria Blyth-Hill, director of the conservation center at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. "You can't take these things for
granted."</TE>
<TE>   Because of earthquake dangers, Los Angeles museums already are
very cautious about securing objects, making fluke accidents like the
one at the Metropolitan unlikely here. "I am happy to say that we are
so careful," said Brian Considine, conservator of decorative arts and
sculpture at the J. Paul Getty Museum. "Because the forces that an
object or a pedestal would experience under dynamic loading in an
earthquake situation are so much greater than the static loads, we
really overbuild things. We prepare for the worst.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already doing the kinds of things the Met might think
about doing now."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Alert Israeli passengers prevented a Palestinian suicide bomber from
boarding a bus near Tel Aviv this morning, but five people were
injured when the bomber blew himself up as he was pursued.</LD>
<LD>   The incident took place shortly before 8 a.m. in Bnei Brak, a
religious suburb of Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   The bomber had attemped to board the bus through the back door,
but passengers pushed him off and the driver closed the door, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, from the Dan Bus Co., and several passengers,
including two soldiers, reportedly ripped open the suspect's shirt,
revealing wires.</TE>
<TE>   As police were trying to arrest the bomber, he detonated his
device and was killed. Of the five injured, one was seriously wounded
and four were moderately hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The attempted attack took place in the midst of an Israeli
crackdown on Palestinian militants in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Gaza, 20 Palestinians have been killed this week, 17 of them in an
Israeli incursion Monday morning in Khan Yunis that drew harsh
rebukes from the international community. Overnight, Israeli forces
swept through the West Bank, arresting more than 70 people.</TE>

<LD>A new, 50-mile section of the Great Wall of China has been discovered
in the nation's north, centuries after being buried by sands that
blow across the area each year, the government said. The segment, on
the southern slope of Helan Mountain, sits about 25 miles west of
Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province, the official New China
News Agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-foot-high chunk of wall, 20 feet wide at its base and 11
feet wide at the top, was built in 1531, the agency said. The Great
Wall, from the north-central province of Gansu to China's east coast,
is believed to span up to 3,700 miles.</LD>

<HD>Security Council Works on Iraq Compromise</HD>
<DH>U.N.: Proposal being hashed out would allow for a single
resolution but not automatically allow the use of force if Hussein
fails to comply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After weeks of haggling with fellow Security Council members, the
United States and Britain are moving toward acceptance of a single,
compromise U.N. resolution that would call for "consequences" if Iraq
defies international weapons inspectors but would not automatically
authorize the use of military action, according to U.S. officials and
U.N. diplomats involved in the negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush called French President Jacques Chirac on
Wednesday, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair is scheduled to meet
in Russia today with President Vladimir V. Putin, in an effort to
press the two permanent members of the Security Council that have
most strongly resisted signing on to military action against
President Saddam Hussein's regime.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative compromise, still being negotiated, would include an
understanding that the United States would consult with its Security
Council partners if Iraq obstructs the inspectors, although
Washington would already feel free to act militarily based on its
interpretation of both the new resolution and past resolutions, the
sources said.</LD>
<TE>   The compromise would break the impasse after a month of often
contentious negotiations. And while it would fall short of what the
Bush administration is seeking, it would provide a form of
international "cover" if the Security Council does not come to
agreement on a second resolution formally authorizing the use of
force.</TE>
<TE>   France has been proposing a two-step process: a resolution guiding
new weapons inspections, with the Security Council forced to vote on
a new measure if Iraq balks at complying. The goal of the compromise
is to avoid a prolonged debate over a second resolution, which could
bog down the pace of events should Iraq try to forestall any action
before hot weather beginning in March makes a military campaign more
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We've basically had to decide between two options. It came down
to making a choice between one faulty, imperfect resolution now that
allows the U.S. some control over the situation--because we can argue
this one resolution gives us enough to act--or a longer process which
might meet all our needs more clearly but also creates a situation
which we don't control," said a well-placed U.S. official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The two key words in the compromise--echoed Wednesday in
statements by Bush as well as other pivotal players in the U.N.
debate--are "consequences" and "automatically."</TE>
<TE>   As now outlined, the U.S. and Britain would accept wording that
includes "consequences" for Iraq for failing to cooperate with the
weapons inspectors but would drop references to the right of U.N.
member states to "automatically" have the right to use "all necessary
means"--the euphemism for force.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said Wednesday that there is growing
agreement on the idea of Iraq facing "appropriate consequences,"
although officials noted that the specific text is far from settled.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some convergence on the idea that the council needs to
express clearly in the resolution its determination to draw the
appropriate conclusions and consequences should Iraq fail to comply,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, initially opposed to any resolution, showed flexibility
Wednesday. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Fedotov said Moscow could
accept a new resolution as long as it didn't stipulate the automatic
right to use force against Iraq. Blair will probe the compromise with
Putin today, according to U.N. envoys and U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   France, which has been the most steadfast in opposing language on
the automatic right to respond with force, is standing firm, Chirac
made clear during a half-hour conversation with Bush on Wednesday,
according to U.S. and French officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bush countered that the stronger the resolution, the more likely
the Iraq situation could be resolved peacefully, a National Security
Council spokesman said. But the U.S. president said it was important
that a new U.N. resolution include a statement of "consequences"
should Hussein continue to violate the will of the world body.</TE>
<TE>   And in the end, the two leaders appear to be trying to find common
ground. In New York, however, maneuvering to have the last word
continues.</TE>
<TE>   France has presented the U.S. with a proposal demanding that Iraq
fully disclose its weapons capabilities and even "non-prohibited
items" such as drone aircraft that could be used for dispersing germ
or chemical weapons. Yet the plan also calls for the U.N. to respect
a controversial agreement allowing weapons inspectors into Hussein's
sprawling "presidential compounds" only in the presence of several
foreign diplomats, which Washington rejects.</TE>
<TE>   The French paper also included Russian proposals on suspending
tough economic sanctions if Iraq cooperates with inspectors--an issue
that the United States does not even want on the table.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte on Wednesday rejected the
French proposals. "We're not interested," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council unanimously agrees that inspectors should
return to Iraq as soon as possible, and most members say that an
agreement reached last Thursday between Iraq and the U.N.'s chief
weapons inspector, Hans Blix, should be the basis for a stronger
mandate for inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, described in a letter Blix sent to the Security
Council on Tuesday, focuses on issues that hampered inspections in
the past. It says that inspectors, not Iraq, will determine how many
experts are needed to evaluate a site; the Hussein regime must
destroy material in the presence of U.N. officials; inspectors will
decide how to best interview people so they won't feel intimidated by
the Iraqi government; Iraq may not interfere with surveillance
equipment installed by inspectors; and Iraq may not deny entry to
inspectors based on nationality.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. draft goes further, insisting that inspectors may take
people and their families out of the country for interviews, which
Iraqi officials view as an invitation to defect. It also demands that
the five permanent members of the council be empowered to send
representatives along with the inspectors to gather information for
their home countries, a provision the Hussein regime regards as a
license to spy.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the council's 15 members think that those provisions
are asking too much, U.S. officials say they will stand firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had 16 resolutions in the past that haven't worked," said
Richard Grenell, spokesman for the U.S. mission at the U.N.</TE>

<HD>Kashmiris Want Focus Put on Daily Needs</HD>
<DH>India: With vote results awaited in security- conscious
region, residents feel forgotten.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>As India and Pakistan trade charges over the legitimacy of a bloody
election just held in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and
analysts ponder the implications for the global war on terror, taxi
driver Mohammed Ramzan Dar worries about school fees, why none of his
neighbors have jobs and how to afford his daughters' weddings.</LD>
<LD>   For many people in this beautiful but strife-torn region, the
outside world is missing the point. With election results expected
today, they say far too much attention has been paid to security and
geopolitical issues and far too little to the sorts of
bread-and-butter concerns affecting them most.</LD>
<LD>   "The politicians don't give us anything," said Mehrajdin Bhat, a
25-year-old student who voted against the government on material
rather than ideological grounds. "We need roads, services, jobs.
That's what's really important."</LD>
<TE>   Shopkeeper Sunawra Mallik, 65, wants power-sharing--literally. "We
need electricity," he said outside the Khumrayl Town polling station
shortly after casting his ballot. "Our living conditions are so
backward. How can I get more customers if they can't see what I'm
selling?"</TE>
<TE>   The Kashmir region, with its predominantly Muslim population, has
been divided between mainly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan
for more than five decades. The two nations have gone to war twice
over the embattled area.</TE>
<TE>   The current fighting, which has gone on for more than a decade,
has devastated Kashmir's economy, undermined people's confidence in
the future and left, by some counts, as many as 60,000 people dead,
mostly civilians. Few believe the politicians are addressing these
issues.</TE>
<TE>   India has heralded the election's 44% turnout as a significant
achievement in the face of so much violence. It sees the
voting--spread over four days, beginning last month and ending
Tuesday--as a way to bolster its legitimacy in Kashmir. Pakistan has
termed the election a sham, calling instead for a U.N.-sponsored
plebiscite on secession.</TE>
<TE>   With hardly a family left untouched by the violence, most
Kashmiris dream of peace. Still, many find it's far easier to focus
on concrete local issues rather than elusive negotiations far beyond
their control.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are issues for big people," said Tanveer Ahmad, a local
civil servant. "Seventy percent of young people here are unemployed,
social problems are increasing, and people are stressed. We just want
a bit of bread and a normal life."</TE>
<TE>   At the Government Psychiatric Diseases Hospital here in Srinagar,
the state's summer capital, doctors say they're seeing up to 200
patients a day with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and
related problems, a tenfold increase since the current bloodshed
started.</TE>
<TE>   "People are exhausted," psychiatrist Maqbool Dar said. "They need
a rest. And most go to faith healers, so we're only seeing the tip of
the iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   Locals say all too often they feel like pawns being attacked by
both sides, pressured one minute by Pakistani-backed separatists to
shutter their shops in economic protest and forced the next to open
them back up by Indian government soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling National Conference, a pro-India party that could see
its majority slip or even disappear today, is viewed by many as inept
or worse. National Conference officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted against them because they're a dynastic party and
extremely corrupt," said Hilal Ahmedpir, 25, owner of a small public
telephone business that was fired on during the election. "We really
need a change."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani-backed Kashmiri militants fighting for secession aren't
much better, others say. "In the early '90s, most of them enjoyed a
lot of sympathy with the local people, but then opportunists took
over," said taxi driver Ramzan Dar. "Now, many wear nice clothes,
ride expensive motorbikes and extort money from rich Kashmiris.
They've lost their ideals. We're suffering, and they're not sharing
the pain."</TE>
<TE>   Money spent on about 1 million soldiers positioned along the
India-Pakistan border and all the security forces in Kashmir could be
far better spent on hospitals, social issues and regional
development, said Saier Rasool, 25, a carpet salesman. "The money is
being wasted, along with our futures."</TE>
<TE>   Jammu and Kashmir Police Chief A.K. Suri said Wednesday that 310
civilians, 370 militants and 150 security force members had been
killed in violence since Aug. 2, when the elections were announced.
Another 500 civilians and 213 security force members were injured, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest fighting Wednesday, militants killed two soldiers
near the town of Doda, police said. Three former rebels who had
earlier switched sides to work for Indian security forces were shot
to death in Khag, west of Srinagar, an officer told Associated Press
on condition of anonymity. Four civilians were wounded after rebels
threw a grenade at an army convoy in Pattan, north of Srinagar.</TE>

<HD>5 Japanese Abducted by N. Korea to Visit Homeland</HD>
<DH>Asia: Victims' children will not be allowed on two-week
trip. The survivors are among 13 kidnapped more than two decades ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>North Korea will permit five Japanese kidnapped more than two decades
ago to visit their homeland next week, although their children born
in the Communist nation will not be allowed to accompany them,
Japanese officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea has said the five victims, whose trips will be paid
for by the Japanese government, can stay only two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came as Japanese and North Korean officials
prepare for talks Oct. 29 and 30 in Malaysia aimed at establishing
diplomatic ties between their countries.</LD>
<TE>   The five kidnapping victims are the only ones alive among the 13
Japanese whom North Korea last month admitted abducting in the 1970s
and '80s. The survivors include two couples who married and had
children after they were brought to North Korea. Hitomi Soga, who
married U.S. defector Charles Robert Jenkins in North Korea, also
will return.</TE>
<TE>   The five victims have a total of six children.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea maintains that the other kidnapping victims died in
incidents ranging from suicide to traffic accidents. Their families
have said they doubt the reports.</TE>
<TE>   In a summit last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il admitted
that his nation kidnapped the Japanese to steal their identities and
force them to train spies in their language.</TE>
<TE>   Though relatives have demanded that the five survivors be allowed
to remain in Japan, the victims told Japanese diplomats in North
Korea last week that they were uncertain about returning home

familiar with their parents' birthplace.</TE>
<TE>   The victims' families fear that the survivors might refrain from
speaking freely while in Japan because their children remain in North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "They should come back with the entire family. Leaving behind the
kids--my grandchildren--is like leaving behind hostages," Tamotsu
Chimura, whose son Yasushi was kidnapped in 1978 at age 23, told a
news conference.</TE>

feared that the kidnapping victims would not be able to speak freely.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Again Face Guns in Kuwait</HD>
<DH>Gulf: No Americans are hurt and the would-be assailants
escape, a day after slaying of Marine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American soldiers encountered gunmen Wednesday in the second such
incident in Kuwait in two days, defense officials said, intensifying
security concerns in a Persian Gulf ally that would be likely to play
a prominent role in any U.S. attack on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   One of two men in a pickup truck aimed a rifle at soldiers after
pulling abreast of their Humvee, a defense official said. The
soldiers fired at the car, forcing it off the road before driving on,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another
Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. fire hit the hood of the other
vehicle and that no one was injured in the incident.</LD>
<LD>   The two men later claimed to have held only a cell phone, not a
gun, Associated Press reported. There was no immediate confirmation
of that assertion.</LD>
<TE>   The confrontation was the latest in a series of incidents--some
believed to be linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network--that have
prompted officials to increase security for troops around the globe
and consider the prospect that the episodes might mark a coordinated
series of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's incident followed the fatal shooting Tuesday of Marine
Lance Cpl. Antonio Sledd, 20, of Hillsborough, Fla., and the wounding
of a second Marine on a Kuwaiti island. The two gunmen were shot and
killed by Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said Tuesday's assailants apparently trained at
Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agents believe that
at least one is related to a Kuwaiti being held at the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, a senior defense official said on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwaiti officials said Wednesday that they had rounded up 50
people suspected of conspiring in Tuesday's shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a motorcycle bomb killed American Green Beret Sgt. 1st
Class Mark Wayne Jackson and injured a second U.S. soldier in the
southern Philippine city of Zamboanga, where U.S. forces are training
local soldiers in counter-terrorism measures.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear whether an explosion on a French oil tanker
off the coast of Yemen was an industrial accident, as the Yemeni
government contends, or a terrorist attack similar to the October
2000 bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in the same waters.</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. officials expressed concern that American soldiers were
being targeted in Kuwait, a staunch ally, where even comparatively
radical Muslim groups have declined to condemn the presence of U.S.
troops, who have been there since 1991, when a U.S.-led coalition
drove Iraqi soldiers out of the small Persian Gulf nation.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official familiar with Kuwait said that in 2000, Kuwait
revealed that it had uncovered a group with connections to Al Qaeda
whose members had used novel means to arm themselves: They had
scoured the desert and recovered U.S. and other weapons left behind
in the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "There was tons of stuff left behind," the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   The materiel included long-range rockets. Though some pieces of
equipment were not operational, they could be used for parts.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 10,000 U.S. troops and more than 400 British
soldiers in Kuwait, including regularly stationed soldiers and U.S.
Marines who are training local military personnel.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Warns Politicians</HD>
<DH>Asia: While promising to transfer power in today's
election, the president also says he'll never give up the right to
protect Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Insisting he is putting power in the hands of the people, President
Pervez Musharraf warned Wednesday that he would be closely watching
politicians elected today to keep them honest and Pakistan stable.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after the polls opened, turnout across the country was low.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf addressed the nation in his army general's uniform and
dismissed charges of election rigging leveled by opposition parties
and human rights activists. He promised a free and fair balloting
that would help build "a sustainable democracy."</LD>
<TE>   He also promised to transfer full executive powers to the new
prime minister. However, he will remain president and commander of
the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   "One power I shall always keep with me, and there shall be no
compromise on it," said Musharraf, who sat between a bowl of roses
and the flag of Pakistan. "That is the solidarity and survival of
Pakistan, and running of government free from corruption and
dishonesty. This shall be my demand on the future government."</TE>
<TE>   In the first national election since Musharraf seized power three
years ago, hundreds of candidates from more than 60 parties and
alliances are competing for 342 seats in the National Assembly and
for 728 seats in four provincial legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   The main contest is between candidates of former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and those of a pro-Musharraf
faction that broke away from deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
Pakistan Muslim League.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf imposed decrees and a constitutional amendment to
prevent Bhutto and Sharif from running in the election. Both exiled
politicians threatened to return to Pakistan and campaign, but they
later backed down.</TE>
<TE>   Without the two most popular politicians to choose from, voters
are left with lesser-knowns. That has quashed much of the hoopla that
normally goes with Pakistani elections. If voter turnout is low,
party organization could prove crucial as rivals struggle to get
their supporters to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Only 34% of eligible voters cast ballots in 1997, during
Pakistan's last general election, when Sharif won a second term as
prime minister. India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons the
following year, intensifying an arms race that has made South Asia
one of the world's most dangerous tinderboxes.</TE>
<TE>   The wild card in today's National Assembly elections is a loose
alliance of six Islamic parties called the United Council of Action.
It continues to back the Taliban, the regime in neighboring
Afghanistan that was driven from power last fall by U.S.-led military
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The parties' main political power base is in ethnic Pushtun areas
of northwestern Pakistan, where anger runs deep toward U.S. military
and intelligence support for Pakistani security forces still
searching for suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   With their narrow regional base, the religious parties have little
chance of winning control of the National Assembly. However, they
could end up sharing power in a coalition government if none of the
mainstream parties wins a majority of seats.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's military has close ties to Muslim militants, and
Musharraf has been able to keep the parties' leaders in check since
allying the nation with the U.S.-declared war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's mainstream opponents say that, despite some
high-profile arrests of Al Qaeda and other suspected terrorists
sought by the U.S., the president has been soft on Islamic extremists
to build support for his domestic political allies.</TE>
<TE>   The religious right has demanded that Musharraf maintain support
for militants battling Indian rule in roughly two-thirds of Kashmir,
a territory to which both India and Pakistan lay claim. The region
has been at the heart of Pakistani politics since the country was
born at the end of British rule in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   India says Musharraf has broken a promise to end what New Delhi
calls "cross-border terrorism"--the infiltration of Indian-controlled
territory by militants based in Pakistani areas--and the military
standoff between the nations has kept them on the brink of war.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf overthrew Sharif in a bloodless coup Oct. 12, 1999.
After spending time in a dank jail cell, Sharif agreed to go into
exile for 10 years in Saudi Arabia in exchange for a pardon on
corruption and treason charges.</TE>
<TE>   After Sharif left the country, a member of his Pakistan Muslim
League broke away and formed the PML-Q. The new faction is so closely
allied with Musharraf that critics call it the "king's party."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan
said PML-Q leader Mian Mohammed Azhar has admitted he had little say
in the choice of his party's candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar told party workers that "he was being made to send up
relevant files to the government officials, leaving them to dictate
such party matters," claims the commission's report on what it called
preelection rigging.</TE>
<TE>   "The blatant manner in which the electoral process is being
vulgarized and the will of the people mocked is extremely worrying,"
the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government denies it is meddling in the election and
called the commission's assessment biased.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 foreign election observers plan to report on their
conclusions after watching the voting today.</TE>
<TE>   Raja Zafar ul-Haq, chairman of Sharif's party, has joined Bhutto
and the rights commission in accusing operatives from Musharraf's
Inter-Services Intelligence agency of coercing opposition candidates
to join the PML-Q by threatening them with corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   If the PML-Q manages to form a majority in the National Assembly,
Azhar would be prime minister. But he would face a tough fight to
prove his credibility as a democratic leader with a mandate, while
the opposition would work to paint him as Musharraf's puppet.</TE>
<TE>   Despite suffering several defections to Azhar's party, Bhutto
insists her party can still win the most seats in the National
Assembly, if not an outright majority.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf said Pakistanis have lost confidence in old-guard
political leaders "who indulged in loot, plunder and misgovernance"
and won't return them to power.</TE>

<HD>American Terror Suspect Deported From Malaysia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>A suspected American Islamic militant was deported today from
Malaysia to face charges of conspiring to fight with Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan, U.S. and Malaysian officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal was on a flight to the United States.
Officials would not disclose the exact destination, but he was
indicted last week in federal court in Portland, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Bilal turned himself in Sunday. He had been in Malaysia since
January, studying at an Islamic university, but he dropped out of
sight after his indictment.</LD>
<TE>   A Malaysian judge cleared the way to deport Bilal by ruling
Wednesday that he was an illegal immigrant since his passport had
been revoked by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling put the case in the hands of immigration authorities
and enabled the United States to avoid potentially lengthy
extradition proceedings. The two countries have no extradition
treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Malaysian and U.S. governments had expressed eagerness to
have Bilal deported.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Embassy spokesman confirmed today that Bilal had left the
country. Malaysian officials said on condition of anonymity that the
deportation to the United States had taken place.</TE>
<TE>   The departure was carried out secretly and occurred at midmorning,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Bilal was believed to be aboard a direct noncommercial flight. The
armed U.S. marshals who normally escort prisoners are not allowed to
fly on foreign carriers. No U.S. airline flies directly from Kuala
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said on condition of anonymity that Bilal would
have been escorted to the airport in the custody of both police and
immigration officers "to make sure he boards the plane."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government says Bilal and five others tried to get into
Afghanistan to fight U.S. troops. Four of the suspects were arrested
last week in Oregon and Michigan. The remaining one is still at
large.</TE>
<TE>   Bilal allegedly was one of five members of the ring who tried to
travel to Afghanistan, though none made it that far. Bilal's brother
has been arrested in Michigan and three others in Oregon. Another
suspect, Habis Abdulla al Saoub, is being sought overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against them include conspiracy to levy war against
the United States and conspiracy to provide material support and
resources to Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>A Command Center Rises From the Desert</HD>
<DH>Gulf: Flurry of U.S. activity at an air base hints at role
Qatar might play in an Iraq strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar</DL>
<LD>For months, U.S. and Qatari officials denied there was anything
special going on. But the frantic activities of earth-moving machines
and hundreds of engineers have been too successful to keep the secret
hidden.</LD>
<LD>   Just 700 miles from Baghdad--almost in its backyard, given the
reach of modern aircraft--the U.S. Air Force is rapidly enlarging
this base, which could become a key command center for any strike
against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a fairly robust operation," said Col. Timothy W. Scott,
commander of a group of 24 jumbo refueling and cargo planes. On
Wednesday, the military, with the approval of the Qatari government,
allowed reporters to visit.</LD>
<TE>   Scott said he could not speculate on how the base might be used if
President Bush decides on military force to topple Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein. But looking at the 12,000-foot runway, the officer
noted that there is plenty of space for fighters and bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "You could put a lot of smaller airplanes here," Scott said,
adding with a laugh, "I'm a big-airplane guy myself."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond its runway and command center, Al Udeid can also serve as a
supply center for the equipment, munitions and weaponry needed by
U.S. forces throughout the Persian Gulf. Huge warehouses--off limits
to reporters--are maintained by a U.S. civilian contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., will send 600
personnel here--about a quarter of its staff. The training mission,
called Internal Look, is designed to test the command's ability to
rapidly establish a forward command post. Some analysts believe that
many of the people sent for the exercise will end up staying here.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go to war with Iraq, the commanding officer should be in
the region, not halfway around the world," said Ivan Eland, military
analyst with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "There
were problems in Afghanistan when the command in Tampa was unaware of
the situation in the theater."</TE>
<TE>   The base, owned and operated by the Qatar Emiri Air Force, is a
testament to the increasingly close relationship between the United
States and Qatar. In a region where the U.S. sometimes has trouble
finding friends, the emir of this tiny Persian Gulf nation has
welcomed the Americans and not been reluctant to let the world know
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't say we have carte blanche, but anything we want, they're
very responsive," said Scott, a navigator on a KC-135 Stratotanker.
The planes are currently doing midair refueling missions for U.S.
operations over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Stratotankers and the KC-10A Extenders perform the unglamorous
but essential mission of midair refueling, which allows planes to
stay longer over targets, waiting for the complex coordination
between ground spotters and aircraft that is part of the modern
method of waging war by air.</TE>
<TE>   At the Qatari base, the U.S. is duplicating the computer-laden air
operations center at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. The
Saudis have suggested that they will not allow the U.S. to use the
base to organize and fly sorties into Iraq unless such an operation
is sanctioned by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Qatar's ruler, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al
Thani, is eager for closer ties with the U.S. and has set no such
limitations. The Al Udeid Air Base also houses some of Qatar's dozen
French Mirage jets.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Al Udeid, 20 miles southwest of Doha, the capital,
looks like a giant construction site. A 400-person Air Force
engineering squad from Pennsylvania and New York is working at top
speed.</TE>
<TE>   The buildup began in the latter years of the Clinton
administration but was kicked into high gear after the Sept. 11
attacks. A tent city for personnel was erected in 21 days; more than
2,000 Air Force personnel live in 300 air-conditioned tents. The tent
city is named Camp Andy for Master Sgt. Evander Earl Andrews, a civil
engineer who died here last October in a construction accident. He
was the first war zone casualty for the U.S. after it launched its
anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Americana have sprouted in the desert: a basketball court, a
volleyball court, tents festooned with Halloween decorations and a
recreation area called the Wagon Wheel.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Qatari guards stand side by side. The former are young
and cleanshaven, the latter are older and bearded. The Americans are
treated to occasional trips into Doha, but only after being warned
about the conservative customs of this Muslim country.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what most of them want more than anything?" Scott said.
"They want to take a shower that lasts more than five minutes. That's

<TE>   In the summer, the temperature on the runways can approach 140
degrees. "It's hot and very challenging," said Staff Sgt. Chamaco

Master Sgt. Tony Pinkney, 48, of West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>

<HD>A Doctor's Healing Journey</HD>
<DH>After 12 years in exile, a patriarch returns to Afghanistan
with his family. The needs are great--but so is the hope for a better
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PULI CHARKHI, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>All that Abdul Bashir Mansoor held dear--his family, his every
possession--was stuffed inside a dust-coated bus that chugged through
a rocky pass in the foothills of the Hindu Kush. He was leaving his
comfortable home in Pakistan for a new life in the ruins of his old
home in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the bus cleared the pass and thundered down toward Kabul,
Mansoor felt a sense of elation. He was bone-weary and filthy after
two days on the road, but he was certain that coming home after 12
years in exile was what Allah had planned for him. For the first time
in those 12 years, he had found a reason to believe in Afghanistan
again.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the bus pulled onto the desert floor amid dozens more
buses crammed with thousands of other returning refugees, and even as
he was overwhelmed by the stench of open latrines and rotting meat,
Mansoor was smiling and raising his arms in joy.</LD>
<TE>   "I am happy from here to the sky," he said, and he threw back his
sweaty head to feel the warm Afghan sun on his face.</TE>
<TE>   Since March, 1.7 million Afghans have returned home as part of the
world's largest repatriation in 30 years. They are returning to a
country where security is tenuous at best, where the economy is a
shambles and where most of the population lives a medieval existence.
They have overwhelmed a fragile government that cannot provide jobs,
electricity, clean water or passable roads.</TE>
<TE>   And still they come. After peaking at 412,000 returning refugees
in May, 196,000 returned in August, and thousands more came in
September. About 88% have come from Pakistan, 11% from Iran and the
rest from Central Asian nations. About 600,000 internally displaced
Afghans also have returned to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Like other refugees who have chosen to return so late in the year,
Mansoor faces a deadline. With the brutal Afghan winter closing in,
he has to scramble to find food, heat and shelter. The United Nations
is planning to shut down its repatriation program to concentrate on
helping returnees prepare for subfreezing temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   A dust storm was howling and the sun was baking the desert as
Mansoor and his family tumbled off their bus. Mansoor had gambled on
his family's future, and the lives of 10 people were in his hands. He
had brought his wife and three children, two brothers, a
sister-in-law, a nephew, a niece and his sickly mother.</TE>
<TE>   They had fled Afghanistan in 1990, part of a wave of 6.2 million
people who gave up on the country and left that year to escape fierce
fighting among warlords. The bulk of those now returning are
illiterate peasants who survive on subsistence farming. Fewer than 5%
are professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor, 40, is a physician, and he stood out among the waves of
ragged paupers at the U.N.'s "encashment center" 20 miles east of
Kabul, the capital. He is university-educated, speaks English and
lived a middle-class life in Pakistan. He ran a small medical clinic
there and worked for two Western aid agencies.</TE>
<TE>   One brother, Nazir, 36, is a civil engineer. The other, Abdul, 34,
is an anesthesiology technician. The Mansoor brothers knew they would
probably be reduced to working menial jobs in Afghanistan, if they
could find jobs at all.</TE>
<TE>   And they knew through relatives in Kabul that the family home had
been ransacked and wrecked over the years.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pushtun tradition, Dr. Mansoor, as the eldest, was
entrusted with making the decision to return. He weighed the odds and
calculated that the time had come, that the security level, though
marginal, was acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   His three children were born in Pakistan; he wanted them to grow
up at home, in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes eventually to find work with a Western aid agency and,
inshallah--Allah willing--to open a clinic. Afghanistan is desperate
for doctors. The country has just one physician for every 50,000
people, compared with 140 per 50,000 people in the United States. But
for now, Mansoor was just another refugee waiting in the sun to be
processed under the U.N.'s "voluntary repatriation program." He
carried a creased paper, a VRF, or Voluntary Repatriation Form, that
bore a faded photo of his family and the sum of their lives expressed
in vital statistics such as date and place of birth and father's
name.</TE>
<TE>   The Mansoors seemed dazed as they waited in endless lines,
answering questions and pressing their thumbs onto inked pads. They
listened to a lecture on the dangers of land mines, complete with the
visual aid of a miniature minefield studded with defused mines,
rockets and grenades. The children wailed and squirmed as they were
given oral polio vaccine and injections of measles vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor, as the head of the extended family, was handed five crisp
$20 bills to defray transportation costs. He owed 8,500 Pakistani
rupees ($145) to the driver who had brought them from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the family was handed three bags of wheat marked
"U.S.A.," two wool blankets, four sections of heavy plastic sheeting
and four thick bars of coarse laundry soap.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was time to go home.</TE>
<TE>   The family piled back into the rickety bus for the trip to Kabul.
The vehicle lurched away in a storm of dust, piled so high with chairs and
bicycles and wood planks that it seemed ready to topple over as it rocked
and pitched across the potholed highway into town.</TE>
<TE>   As Kabul came into view, Mansoor stared out the bus window. "Oh,
what a destroyed city," he said. "Nothing left. I have such deep
sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor tried to direct the driver, a Pakistani, but they got
hopelessly lost. The doctor had lost his bearings. Nothing was the
same. After several wrong turns, they finally found their way south
of the capital to Mansoor's old neighborhood of Chehel Sotoon.</TE>
<TE>   At last Mansoor recognized Police Station No. 7, the old Turkish
park, the chaotic bazaar and the bombed-out shell of his old high
school. The bus lurched into a dirt alley, and everyone aboard fell
silent. They were home.</TE>
<TE>   They got out and stared in silence at the old family home. It
was a mess. Thieves had stolen the electrical wiring and water pipes.
There was no glass in the windows.  The roof was studded with holes.  The
well was dry.  The stucco walls were cracked and smeared with grime.  The
grape arbor was shriveled.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks so different. It's so badly damaged," Mansoor said,
holding back tears.</TE>
<TE>   But then he gathered himself and told his brothers to unload the
bus. They were moving in. They unloaded the doctor's
computer--useless without electricity--his medical texts and a blue
metal sign from his clinic in Pakistan that read "Dr. Abdul Bashir
Mansoor, M.D."</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor inspected the house. He found what he called his "bachelor
room," where he had lived as a young man.</TE>
<TE>   His father had built the house 40 years ago. Now he was dead,
killed by liver cancer three months ago while in exile in Pakistan.
It pained Mansoor that his father had not died at home, and that he
himself had married in Pakistan and not at the family homestead.</TE>
<TE>   He sighed deeply. "Life is unstable," he said. "Everything
changes, and I believe almighty Allah has made this change for me."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly there was a loud cry and Mansoor's uncle appeared,
shouting with joy. He embraced the doctor and showered his whiskered
face with kisses.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you came back! Now my life is complete!" said Mohammed Zarif.</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor asked about the security situation.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I think. Not so bad," the uncle said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and relatives emerged from their adobe homes and hugged
the doctor. They began rounding up buckets, paint, plaster, brushes
and tools for cleaning and repairing the house. They helped stack
planks and timbers that the Mansoors had brought from Pakistan for
rebuilding. They told Mansoor where to buy glass for the windows and
wood stoves for heating.</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor thanked them and said, "My new life starts today."</TE>
<TE>   But the house was not yet a home. "A home is where the father has
a job and the children are in school and there is heat and food," he
said. "Soon, this will be a house."</TE>
<TE>   The doctor was exhausted. His wife and sister-in-law cleaned a
bedroom and spread the U.N. plastic sheeting on the floor. Mansoor
sat down wearily and sipped at a cup of hot green tea.</TE>
<TE>   "I am never going back to Pakistan again--never," he announced.</TE>
<TE>   Out the bare window frames, he could see that some things had not
changed. His neighbor was still raising pigeons, and they fluttered
and swooped in formation against the darkening sky. Beyond them were
the familiar mountains, serene and eternal, painted scarlet by the
setting sun.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much to do. The doctor had to repair the house, buy
food, find a school for his children, jobs for himself and his
brothers, medical treatment for his ailing mother. He needed to go to
the mosque and pray. Somehow, he believed, Allah would provide.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor closed his eyes. His spectacles were askew on his round
face. He longed to sleep the deep sleep of a man in his own bed.</TE>
<TE>   He put down his tea. "I am home at last," he said wearily. "My
heart is healed."</TE>

<HD>Have Times Changed Since '89? Russia Asks</HD>
<DH>Census: The last head count was during Soviet times.
Organizers have gone to great lengths to allay public fears of
interrogation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Inquisitive state agents began checking up on millions of Russians
rich and poor Wednesday. But, unlike in the past, there was no cause
for alarm. It was just the 10-year census--three years behind
schedule due to lack of funds.</LD>
<LD>   The national head count is the first across Russia's vast
territory since 1989, and economists, politicians and advertisers are
eager to fill in the gaps in their knowledge of what has changed for
Russia and Russians since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   Census organizers mounting the $180-million project have gone to
extra lengths to convince members of the public that there is no need
to fear the data collectors and that no information gained will be
used against them. Even so, polls have shown that 5% to 15% of the
population is wary about cooperating.</LD>
<TE>   In part to allay the fears, the census bureau has hired mostly
clean-cut college students to fill out its three-page questionnaire.
And, in a public relations coup, one not-so-typical Moscow
suburbanite was shown on television going painlessly through the
10-minute process.</TE>
<TE>   "What is your occupation?" the interviewer asked.</TE>
<TE>   "President of the Russian Federation," Vladimir V. Putin replied.</TE>
<TE>   Nature of profession? "I render services to the people."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes, and he does speak Russian (as well as German).</TE>
<TE>   In the last census, 146 million Russians were counted. This time,
statisticians believe the population may have fallen below 144
million because immigrants from other former Soviet republics have
not offset a high mortality rate, low birth rate and the emigration
of many Russians to Western countries.</TE>
<TE>   But no one knows for sure. And that is why Irina Medvedeva and
Andrei Klyukin, both 19-year-old students at Moscow State
Technological University, set out Wednesday morning from the city's
Census Station No. 2. The two are part of an army of 600,000
temporary workers being paid less than $16 a week (plus academic
credit in some cases) for three weeks of 14-hour days to collect and
check data.</TE>
<TE>   Their first stop was a household in a relatively well-to-do
apartment building just off Moscow's Garden Ring, home to three
generations of Muscovites. Answering the door, after leashing their
Doberman pinscher, were Yelena Romanova, 48, an economist and
co-owner of a building company, and her 73-year-old mother, Galina
Samilo, a retiree.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, times have changed," Romanova said. "For us
personally, life has gotten better. The last time there was a census,
we had not even one car. Now we have two."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother offered a different view. "Life has changed, but it is
complicated to say for the better or not," Samilo said, standing in
their corridor wearing a modish hairstyle and designer T-shirt. "The
gap between the rich and poor is much, much greater now. Before, we
all lived more or less the same. I think this stratification is not
so good."</TE>
<TE>   But both women said they had no problems answering the
interviewers' questions. "We feel safe. Normal, non-criminal people
have nothing to fear," Romanova said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the total number of Russians, the census takers want to
find out how the population is distributed across the world's largest
national territory, about the state of housing and standards of
living, and about the ethnic makeup.</TE>
<TE>   However, questions on religion were banned--a disappointment to
some minority religious groups that believe their sects are more
numerous than is widely perceived and deserve more recognition from
the state.</TE>
<TE>   Census organizers pledged that names and personal information
would be kept private and that only the raw statistics would be
tallied. Police and tax collectors were not to be given access to
individual questionnaires.</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike in Soviet times, there is no compulsion to answer
the questions and no need to provide passports or other documents
that support the answers. Everyone is to be taken at their word.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, census takers do not even need to go door to door
because people voluntarily show up at neighborhood offices or other
census locations. To urge people to take part, the state statistics
committee has mounted a big publicity campaign, with bright, cheerful
posters showing a cross-section of Russian citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The dispersal of Russians across their 11 time zones presented
some unique problems.</TE>
<TE>   In parts of sparsely settled Siberia, census takers had to travel
by boat and on foot. Questions were sent up to the cosmonauts aboard
the International Space Station.</TE>
<TE>   And in war-torn Chechnya, the questioning was limited to two days
amid heavy security, and only female interviewers were hired because
officials believed that strange men approaching could be seen as
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Local disputes also could play a role. Several women in
Vladivostok blockaded their building and said they would not admit
census takers until the broken water system was repaired. But Anatoly
Petrov, chairman of the Census Commission in Moscow, said such
problems were few.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, one could see young people walking in the streets of
Moscow, as well as all other cities and towns in Russia, carrying
distinct bags on their shoulders. They looked pretty much like
schoolchildren who start their school year Sept. 1--the only thing
that was missing was flowers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of the people think that the census is an important
and useful thing. As a rule, the people who are negative about the
census are mostly youths who lack even secondary education."</TE>

<HD>Tapes May Portend Al Qaeda Attacks, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Bin Laden has foreshadowed strikes before. A top
aide's monologue seems recent.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A taped monologue by Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant, Ayman
Zawahiri, broadcast this week threatens new attacks against the
United States and provides the first evidence Zawahiri may still be
alive, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The tape cites the current debate over Iraq and other events of
the last three months, suggesting that the Egyptian-born doctor and
Islamic militant survived the war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   A separate tape that surfaced this week is believed to contain the
voice of Bin Laden, also threatening new attacks, but provides no
clue when it was made. It thus doesn't indicate if the chief of the
global Al Qaeda terrorist network is still alive.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe it to be Bin Laden's voice," said a U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it's not time-specific. It
could have been done any time in the last year or so."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Bin Laden often issued a public statement shortly
before launching a terrorist attack. But not every broadcast signaled
an attack, so it's unclear if the new tapes indicate an impending
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "If legitimate, the tapes are both of concern," the U.S. official
said. "It's the kind of thing that can foreshadow future attacks."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe they last heard Bin Laden on a radio
broadcast rallying his fighters in December during the Tora Bora
battle with American-led coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan. He
then disappeared despite an international manhunt.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials say they believe Bin Laden is still
alive somewhere along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. Other
experts are skeptical, however, saying the Saudi-born terror
mastermind would make new videotapes to taunt Washington, rally his
forces and recruit new followers if he were alive.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters Monday that
the Bin Laden tape, which was broadcast Sunday by the Qatar-based Al
Jazeera television network, did not prove or disprove anything.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, he said, is "either alive and well, or alive and not
too well, or not alive."</TE>
<TE>   The Zawahiri tape, obtained Tuesday by Associated Press Television
News, refers to the current U.S. standoff with Iraq and an American
aerial bombing attack in Afghanistan on July 1, and accuses
Washington of trying to subjugate the Arab world on behalf of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've established it authoritatively, but the
initial take is that it probably is him," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also identified a senior Al Qaeda figure who President
Bush said Monday had received medical care in Baghdad this year. He
cited the case as evidence of Iraq's alleged ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The man was identified as Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian-born
operational commander for Al Qaeda who lost a leg during the Afghan
war. U.S. officials consider Zarqawi to be among the 20 most powerful
Al Qaeda figures.</TE>
<TE>   Zarqawi reportedly was arrested in Jordan in 2000 as part of the
"millennium plot" to blow up tourist sites but was later released.
Other reports indicated that he went to Iran after leaving
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said Zarqawi was treated about two months ago in
Baghdad but is no longer believed to be in Iraq.</TE>

<HD>2 Americans Share Economics Prize for Contrarian Work</HD>
<DH>Research: The findings of professors Daniel Kahneman at
Princeton and Vernon Smith at George Mason challenge tenets of
classical theory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two American academics won the Nobel Prize in economics Wednesday for
applying psychology and experimental research to such conundrums as
why stock markets form "bubbles" and why people think they can sell
an item for more money than they will pay to buy it.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Kahneman, 68, a psychology professor at Princeton
University, and Vernon L. Smith, 75, a professor of economics and law
at George Mason University in Virginia, will share the $1.1 million
that goes with the prize, awarded annually by the Swedish Academy of
Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   "He is more than deserving of it," said Caltech economist Charles
R. Plott of the award to Smith. "His work was a key step in
transforming economics into a laboratory, experimental science."</LD>
<TE>   "It's extremely well-merited," said Brookings Institution
economist Henry Aaron of the award to Kahneman. "Unlike a great many
creative people, not only is Danny Kahneman smart, he's a very sweet
man."</TE>
<TE>   Economists have long thought both men were in line for a Nobel
Prize. Asked Wednesday what it felt like to be chosen for one, Smith
quipped: "Well, I'm glad my friends were finally right."</TE>
<TE>   Each man's work represents a distinct challenge to classical
economic theory, in which individuals always act rationally and there
always is a single price on which buyers and sellers can agree.</TE>
<TE>   Kahneman's work, together with that of his longtime collaborator,
the late Amos Tversky, focuses primarily on individuals and seeks to
ferret out peculiarities in the way people make economic decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In a demonstration inspired by their writings, University of
Chicago economist Richard Thaler gave one group coffee mugs and a
second group money, then offered to buy mugs from the first and sell
mugs to the second.</TE>
<TE>   Classical theory would predict that students selling the mugs
would ask for about the same price as the buyers would be willing to
pay. But, in fact, the sellers asked for twice as much.</TE>
<TE>   "The willingness to accept payment is always greater than the
willingness to pay," Aaron said.</TE>
<TE>   That might seem obvious to lay people. But such systematic
divergences from classical theory are important when it comes to
financial decisions. Kahneman and Tversky found that people make such
decisions on the basis of hunches, shortcuts and rules of thumb,
rather than a careful calculation of risks and rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's work focuses on markets more than individuals and poses a
double-barreled challenge to classical economics.</TE>
<TE>   His method involves constructing controlled experiments to see how
people behave, rather than advancing theories about how a whole
nation's economy functions. He is widely known as "the father of
experimental economics."</TE>
<TE>   His experiments have led Smith to conclude that most markets for
goods, services and labor can operate with far fewer controls and
even fewer people than is generally supposed. But a few markets,
especially financial ones, are nearly impossible to stabilize.</TE>
<TE>   "I can show you bubbles and crashes in the lab, but it's not clear
what we can do about them," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's experiments have been used by companies such as IBM Corp.
and Hewlett-Packard Co. to test changes in corporate policy before
instituting them. They have been employed by agencies such as the
Federal Communications Commission to organize spectrum auctions.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he now is out to show that electricity can be
successfully traded, California's recent disastrous experience not-
withstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Kahneman was born in Tel Aviv in 1934 and has dual citizenship in
the U.S. and Israel. He has an undergraduate degree from the
University of Tel Aviv in psychology and mathematics and earned a
doctorate in psychology at UC Berkeley. He has been at Princeton
since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, Kahneman singled out his old
friend Tversky.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Nobel Prize, he said: "Such an award seldom
reflects the contributions of a single individual. This is
particularly true in my case, since the award is given largely for
work that I did many years ago with my close friend and colleague
Amos Tversky who died in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of his missing this day saddens me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was born in Wichita, Kan., in 1927, received a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering from Caltech in Pasadena and a
doctorate in economics from Harvard. He spent years at the University
of Arizona before being lured to George Mason last year with six
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Awards for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, peace and
literature were established by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of
dynamite, in 1896. The economics prize was added by the Swedish
central bank in 1969.</TE>

<CX>   Nobel--A story in Section A on Thursday about the Nobel Prizes should
have reported that the prize in economics was established in 1968,
not 1969. Also, economics prize winner Daniel Kahneman earned his
undergraduate degree from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, not the
University of Tel Aviv. And in some editions, the death of Alfred
Nobel, who established the prizes in his will, was incorrectly
reported as occurring in 1986. He died in 1896.</CX>

<HD>Ports Get Back to Business</HD>
<DH>Trade: Shipping lines begin cleaning out a mountain of
backlogged cargo after a court order ends a lockout of dockworkers
for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON, LOUIS SAHAGUN and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast ports began the slow process of digging out from under a
mountain of cargo containers Wednesday, the day after an emergency
injunction ended the 10-day lockout that had shuttered ports from San
Diego to Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Dockworkers mobbed hiring halls. Railroads shipped extra
locomotives to the coast to attack the backlog of containers that
will soon be moving to the rails. Shipping lines fielded calls from
anxious customers jockeying to get their containers of goods moved
first off the docks.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite the sense of urgency, the giant Los Angeles-Long Beach
port complex crawled to life Wednesday night, with heavy equipment
and workers still idled at some terminals. Both dockworkers and
terminal operators said the slow start was to be expected because the
docks are so jammed with cargo that too many workers would simply add
to the confusion until more space can be cleared. By early evening,
Pier 400 was operating at about 50% of capacity, said a manager at
the Maersk Inc. shipping line.</LD>
<TE>   The gradual ramp-up was intentional, said Steve Sugerman, a
spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping
companies. The association and the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union agreed to a staged resumption to avoid overwhelming
the facilities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, truckers began lining up hours before the
scheduled opening of the terminal gates at 6 p.m. Walfred Gordillo
was first in line at the Port of Los Angeles' Pier 400.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't made a penny in 10 days," said Gordillo, who was
picking up a container of Asian-made Christmas toys to take to a
warehouse in Ontario. "Being first in line means I might be able to
leave early and make another trip tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Outside an open-air hiring hall in Wilmington, wedged between oil
tanks and an auto-wrecking yard, hundreds of job seekers lined up in
hopes of securing longshore work.</TE>
<TE>   But union bosses, and the security guards who blocked the iron
gates of the hiring hall, dissuaded the longshore hopefuls. The only
workers allowed in were those with "casual cards" designating them as
members of the formal pool of laborers who take the dock jobs
unfilled by union members. Most hope to join the union when there is
an opening.</TE>
<TE>   "People without a casual card, go home. You're not going to get a
job today," came a voice over a loudspeaker. "For the rest of you
guys, welcome back."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department officers were on hand to control the
crowd and traffic. Vendors sold hot dogs and work gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like a very good opportunity for all of us," said
Alfonso Guillen of Lakewood, who has been a casual worker for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's reopening came just a day after President Bush
intervened in the bitter labor dispute between the longshore workers
and port management that stranded billions of dollars worth of cargo
at 29 ports at the height of the holiday shipping season.</TE>
<TE>   Using his authority under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, Bush won a
federal court order Tuesday forcing the ports to reopen on grounds
that the nation's economy and security were threatened. U.S. District
Court Judge William Alsup next week will consider extending his
temporary order, which would mandate an 80-day cooling-off period
retroactive to Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. locked out ILWU dockworkers Sept. 29,
claiming the union was using go-slow tactics to pressure management
after months of fruitless contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,500-member union said delays were related to a crush of
holiday season cargo and efforts by their members to observe strict
safety procedures after the deaths of five union members on West
Coast docks this year.</TE>
<TE>   The union had vehemently opposed federal intervention on grounds
that it gives management little incentive to bargain, while
subjecting the union to court sanctions for port bottlenecks. ILWU
leaders Wednesday accused the Bush administration of siding with
employers and predicted that the Pacific Maritime Assn would go to
court at the slightest hint of a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "These 80 days will not be a cooling-off period," said ILWU
International President James Spinosa. "PMA will start alleging
slowdowns by Thursday.... We expect the employers will be dragging us
to court daily, trying to bankrupt the union and throw our leaders in
jail."</TE>
<TE>   The court order requires the union to work at a normal pace, but
union leaders say they will insist that their members adhere strictly
to safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we are going to start work in very congested terminals
among many vessels fully loaded and rails backed up to the state
line," said Ramon Ponce de Leon Jr., president of the union's Local
13 in Los Angeles. "Therefore, we must first think of our safety."</TE>
<TE>   Ponce de Leon disputed management's assertion that calls for
safety were actually coded messages exhorting union members to resort
to a work slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Safety is not a gimmick with us," he said. "We've had too many
deaths on the docks. Besides, we have far too many other pressing
concerns right now than to even think about any kind of a job action.
Our concern is to move this cargo and go home in one piece."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Maritime Assn. officials said Wednesday that they would
monitor the union's performance and reserved the right to pursue
court sanctions for any slowdowns. But they said they hope to avoid
going back to court.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the last place we want to be right now," spokesman
Sugerman said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day Wednesday, shipping lines and terminals
prepared their operations for the resumption of work in the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's largest harbor complex.</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics serviced hundreds of utility trucks and other equipment
used to move cargo around terminals. They also turned their attention
to the towering cranes that load and unload container ships.</TE>
<TE>   Big rigs began arriving in port to pick up stranded loads and
ferry them to their destinations. The diesel trucks queued up by the
score to pick up freight for anxious retailers and manufacturers,
which had pressured Bush to impose Taft-Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   "They all want their cargo as soon as possible," said Scott
Dailey, a spokesman for Singapore-based APL, which operates 80 cargo
ships and three West Coast terminal facilities, including one in the
Port of Los Angeles. "... But we've got containers stacked everywhere
you can stack them. We're going to do our best, but there are going
to be some real constraints."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pasha Stevedoring &amp; Terminals facility in the Port of Los
Angeles, the company began contacting longshore workers, preparing
cargo records and checking its inventory of equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all trying to deal with a sensitive situation and be adults
about it," said Jeffrey Burgin, Pasha's senior vice president. "There
are bigger things than us. There is the U.S. economy. The Middle East
situation. We can't put ourselves in a box and think we are the top
of the pinnacle. It's time to move forward with the temporary
restraining order and abide by it."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, companies that prepare customs declarations for
arriving cargo geared up for the enormous amount of work ahead. At
Global Transportation Services Inc. in Redondo Beach, Executive Vice
President Guy Fox said his firm had to process about 2,000
declarations for retailers and manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to locate the ships, get their arrival times, determine
the customs duties and pay them," Fox said. "This is a massive job.
We will be working around the clock."</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 cargo ships are waiting to be unloaded in ports from
San Diego to Seattle, with about 120 vessels either docked or at
anchorages in and around the Los Angeles-Long Beach harbor complex.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had estimated that the shutdown cost the U.S. economy $1
billion to $2 billion a day in lost sales, wages and productivity.
But with logistics experts predicting that it may take six to eight
weeks to sort out the mess on the docks, the ill effects are likely
to linger for months.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Gardena-based Nissan North America said the lockout
caused a backlog of almost 15,000 Nissan and Infiniti cars shipped
from Japan. As a result, the automaker expects its October sales
volume in the U.S. to be down as much as 15% from a year ago.</TE>

<DH>Terrorism: House lawmakers say closer scrutiny by INS might
have prevented killings by Egyptian immigrant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A House panel debated the possible terrorist connection between
Egyptian immigrant Hesham Mohamed Hadayet and an Islamic extremist
group Wednesday, saying that a higher level of immigration scrutiny
might have prevented the July slayings of two people at Los Angeles
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, border security
and claims called the hearing in light of an Immigration and
Naturalization Service document made public Tuesday showing that
officials doubted Hadayet was a peaceful man when he requested
political asylum in 1992 yet allowed him to remain in the country.</LD>
<LD>   "A careful examination of the immigration history of Mr. Hadayet
reveals that fundamental failures in our immigration system also
played a critically important part in allowing him to commit his
heinous crime," Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for
Immigration Studies, told subcommittee members.</LD>
<TE>   On July 4, Hadayet opened fire at an El Al Airlines ticket
counter, killing two people before being shot to death. Federal
investigators have determined that the Orange County resident chose
an Israeli target because he was outraged at that nation's policies
toward Palestinians. But they said he acted alone and was not
connected to any terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   Although legislators at Wednesday's hearing did not directly
question that conclusion, several of them, including Rep. Darrell
Issa (R-Vista) expressed shock that immigration officials reviewing
Hadayet's case did not perform a more thorough background check,
including asking the Egyptian government to substantiate its claims
that he belonged to a terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   In a five-page letter dated May 7, 1995, the INS listed a slew of
inconsistencies in Hadayet's remarks during an asylum interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of these inconsistencies is suggestive of concealment,"
reads the denial of Hadayet's request. "And call into question your
assertion that all you wish for the government of Egypt is that it be
overthrown by peaceful means."</TE>
<TE>   William Yates, INS deputy executive associate commissioner, said
that at the time the INS reviewed Hadayet's application there was no
evidence linking him with terrorist networks. He acknowledged,
however, that neither the FBI nor the CIA were involved in conducting
a criminal background check of Hadayet.</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "Even today, no evidence has been located suggesting
this individual, who lived peacefully in the United States for 10
years, would suddenly commit such a horrible crime."</TE>
<TE>   Yates said that at the time of the request, the State Department
had not yet designated certain militant groups as foreign terrorist
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Such designations would have alerted them to Hadayet's alleged
ties to al-Gama'a al-Islamia, an Islamic extremist group. In his
asylum application, Hadayet claimed that the Egyptian government was
falsely accusing him of being a terrorist as a pretext to persecute
him for his religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the INS denied his request, Hadayet managed to remain in
the U.S. with a temporary work permit until his wife won an INS
lottery that gave the family legal residency in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the INS did not consult the Egyptian government at the
time, Yates answered that doing so could have compromised the safety
of Hadayet's family in Egypt. Officials later learned that his wife
and children were already in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we go back without putting people at risk?" Yates said.

<HD>Vietnam Service Is but a Memory, Except During Races</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a 25-year-old, Gray Davis accepted service in Vietnam with
resignation, as a duty and the fulfillment of an obligation he made
to the Reserve Officer Training Corps. He spent six months and 25
days in Vietnam without fanfare but with competence and modesty. And
as he reflects on it today, it is with care not to exaggerate his
role, along with pride in the service he performed.</LD>
<LD>   But his memories of military service are philosophical and
ideological, not personal: Davis can't recall the name of his
commanding officer, does not keep in touch with anyone from those
days, much as he has shed his college friends. He attends events for
veterans but ignores reunions of his old comrades.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't go--just like I haven't been able to do justice to the
people I went to school with," he said in a recent interview. "But I
do--if I get an invitation to do something. I mean, I went out of my
way to help raise money for the construction of the Vietnam Memorial
on the Capitol grounds, and went to several fund-raising events to
help do that, made sure I was there when it was dedicated."</LD>
<TE>   In Vietnam, Davis adds: "I pretty much kept to myself."</TE>
<TE>   If the war did not leave its impression in that sense, it did,
Davis says, sear him politically. It was in Vietnam that he rubbed
elbows with poor men, most of them minorities, who were drafted into
that conflict. By the end of his tour, Davis, raised an upper-crust
Republican, had become a determined Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty naive growing up, and I just thought everyone did
their duty," Davis said in 1998. "America was fighting a war;
everyone kind of had to share the burden. The burden of this war fell
disproportionately on minorities and whites who were less
well-educated. That's why I'm a Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   Those democratic impulses did not drive Davis to Vietnam. He was
compelled by a simpler issue: His family ran out of money while he
was in college. His father abandoned Davis and his mother and four
younger siblings while Davis was a student at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   To stay in school, Davis began working as a waiter and joined the
local ROTC for its monthly stipend.</TE>
<TE>   It was a painless commitment when first made. It was 1960, and the
war in Vietnam was still nascent, confined to a few American advisors
in a faraway conflict, unknown to most of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis used the money to help complete college and then to attend
law school at Columbia University. But when he was finished there, it
was 1967, the United States was fully engaged in the Vietnam War and
his number was up.</TE>
<TE>   He was sent to Long Ben, and assigned to the Signal Corps. His
work--maintaining radio communications among the troops--required him
to shuttle across dangerous areas by helicopter, though not to engage
in infantry combat.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was ever in a difficult spot, Davis says: "On a
few occasions, yes. I don't want to overstate the case, but whatever
was happening at the division headquarters or the maneuver brigade
headquarters I was visiting, I was a part of. A couple of times we
were under rocket attacks, a couple of times in Long Ben."</TE>
<TE>   Through the winter of 1968 and the spring and summer of 1969,
Davis spent his time shuttling radio equipment in and out of combat
areas. Even from there, he says now, he could see the limits of the
war.</TE>
<TE>   "It became clear to me that we were just basically guarding
facilities we already had possession of," he says. "We were not
advancing on the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis kept his head down, did his work. He says he never saw
evidence of drug use, never witnessed any racial tension. His Bronze
Star was awarded for meritorious service. Nearly seven months later,
he flew home, satisfied that he had done his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I did my duty," he says. "I did what my country asked--I
signed a piece of paper. I committed myself to serve. I served."</TE>
<TE>   He returned to find veterans, including himself, spit at--though
he offers no details. He was torn by the student protests,
increasingly sympathetic to the contention that the war was
unwinnable, angry that veterans were blamed for decisions made by
political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged it off, and now says he is pleased to see veterans
hailed again. Vietnam helped make Davis a Democrat. It also gave him
a shield against future Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Davis scrapped his way through a primary against
better-funded opponents and earned the right to run against
Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a conservative whose appeal ran
strongest in agricultural areas and Republican-leaning suburbs. But
Lungren was vulnerable in at least one sense: He had never served in
Vietnam, because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Through that campaign, Davis repeatedly tweaked Lungren for his
lack of service, sometimes by specific mentions of it, more often by
merely touting his own and suggesting the contrast.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of his approach was one speech to Fresno veterans early in
the race, even before Davis won the Democratic nomination but when he
and Lungren were the only announced candidates in either party.
Speaking to 400 members of the California Veterans of Foreign Wars,
Davis said: "You have a chance in 1988 to elect a governor who not
only served in Vietnam but is a member of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars. Do you think that's a good idea?"</TE>
<TE>   Once he had won the nomination, Davis focused more intensely on
Lungren, sometimes drawing the contrast between their military
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Lungren is in for the fight of his life," Davis told a Long
Beach group. "Dan Lungren has never been tested. Dan Lungren is going
to run against a Vietnam veteran."</TE>
<TE>   Then, Davis unleashed a television ad that his consultant, Garry
South, described as the campaign's "secret weapon."</TE>
<TE>   It was a 30-second spot that trumpeted Davis' military service and
medals, aired mainly in Southern California and the Central Valley.
Helicopters and images of Davis reminded viewers that Davis was a
veteran--and that Lungren was not.</TE>
<TE>   That was a campaign full of contentious issues, as the candidates
battled over immigration, affirmative action, abortion. But the
veterans ads were intended to remind centrist and conservative voters
that Davis was no hippie; he was safe.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronze Star ad notwithstanding, Davis has resisted any
temptation to oversell his service. Repeatedly, in interviews over
the years, he has stressed that he never faced the danger that
infantry troops confronted.</TE>
<TE>   At veterans' rallies, he emphasizes his solidarity with other
vets, but does not suggest superiority.</TE>
<TE>   "I just say that I served," Davis says. "And I did what was asked
of me, and I'm very proud of everybody who answered the call."</TE>
<TE>   A version of the Bronze Star ad is running this year, as Davis
faces another opponent who is more conservative than he is and who
also has no war record to boast of--Simon received a student
deferment that lasted until the end of the draft.</TE>
<TE>   The ad features a photograph of Capt. Davis. There are shots of
helicopters, of Davis with veterans.</TE>
<TE>   This time, those images are contrasted with pictures of Simon and
headlines about his personal financial and business dealings. "Duty
and service have been the guiding principles" of Davis' life, the ad
states. Simon, by contrast, is "out of step, and out for himself."</TE>

<CX>   Gov. Gray Davis--A story in Section A on Thursday on Gov. Gray Davis'
military service during the Vietnam War erroneously identified a
location in that country as Long Ben. It should have said Long Binh.
The story also misstated the year of Davis' victory over Republican
Dan Lungren as 1988. It was 1998.</CX>

<LD>The City Council has postponed voting on a master plan for 75-acre
College Park.</LD>
<LD>   The current plan does not include the Rainbow Recovery Center, a
drug and alcohol treatment center for women that has been at the park
for 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the women at the recovery center would be evicted to
make room for an agricultural heritage museum.</LD>
<TE>   City officials said they would like to wait for a legal opinion
from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on whether a deed that
transferred ownership from the county to the city makes it illegal to
use park land for a recovery center.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is expected to take up the issue again in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Manuel Lopez, who has asked city staff to look into the
possibility of placing the farm museum at another location, said he
saw no need to rush to a decision until the city receives
clarification from the county.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Won't Seek Death Penalty After Promise Is Discovered</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors have learned that a gang member accused
in a Ventura girl's slaying was offered leniency if he cooperated in
the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors said Wednesday they will not seek the
death penalty against a skinhead gang member charged with killing a
teenage girl four years ago, after revelations that someone in the
district attorney's office had promised the suspect leniency.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities previously said they would pursue a death sentence
against Michael Bridgeford, 25, who is accused--along with fellow
skinhead David Ziesmer--of fatally stabbing 17-year-old Nichole
Hendrix of Ventura in a motel bathroom in October 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Bridgeford's preliminary hearing is set Dec. 9.</LD>
<TE>   In preparing for the case, prosecutors came across transcripts of
tape-recorded interviews with Bridgeford during the original
investigation, said Patricia Murphy, chief deputy district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   She said the transcripts show that someone from her office assured
Bridgeford that if he cooperated in the investigation, penalties
against him would be lenient. Bridgeford gave a full statement to
authorities and worked as an informant in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this crime and this defendant are worthy of the death
penalty," Murphy said. "But we have to be fair. And if statements
were made that could be construed as promises, we just have to live
up to that."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Powell, Bridgeford's attorney, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeford, Ziesmer and Bridget Callahan were indicted by the
grand jury in August 2000 on charges of first-degree murder and
special allegations that they killed Hendrix during a robbery and
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Ziesmer's indictment was thrown out after a
Santa Barbara County judge ruled that Ventura County's grand jury did
not reflect the county's population because it lacked representative
numbers of women and Latinos. New complaints on the same charges were
immediately filed.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said rather than deal with whether Bridgeford's grand jury
indictment would be tossed out, attorneys on both sides agreed to
start over with a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Bridgeford faces life in prison without the
possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney will still seek the death penalty against
Ziesmer, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, whom authorities accused of standing guard while
Bridgeford and Ziesmer allegedly stabbed Hendrix to death, is
awaiting trial after charges were also refiled against her and a
judge ordered her to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy would not reveal who promised Bridgeford leniency, saying
that information is "not important."</TE>
<TE>   Promises are often made to defendants in exchange for cooperation
that could result in a stronger case, she said. The problem here,
according to Murphy, was that top district attorney officials did not
know such assurances had been given to Bridgeford.</TE>
<TE>   "With this as the penalty, we have no room for error," she said.
"Someone's life is at stake. We have to be beyond reproach."</TE>

<HD>FBI Says Agents Broke Rules in Spy, Terror Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI agents broke the rules in at least a dozen terrorism and
espionage cases before the Sept. 11 attacks, including illegally
videotaping suspects, intercepting e-mails without court permission
and recording the wrong phone conversations, according to an internal
bureau memo disclosed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The two-page memo focused on cases requiring secret warrants under
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including the most
sensitive terrorism and espionage cases that the FBI investigates.</LD>
<LD>   The top-secret court that monitors FISA operations recently issued
an unprecedented public admonishment of the FBI for its handling of
many surveillance warrants, saying agents provided inaccurate
information to justify the warrants and made other mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   But the April 2000 memo referred to cases that indicated other
problems, according to FBI officials. Among them: agents conducting
unauthorized searches, executing search warrants with wrong addresses
and allowing electronic surveillance to operate beyond legal
deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press, which first reported on the memo Wednesday, said
it was given the document by a member of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, FBI officials said the mistakes happened in about a
dozen cases in early 2000, out of more than 1,000 FISA warrants
issued that year. Problems in such a small percentage of cases are
nearly impossible to avoid, one FBI official said, adding that
although the mistakes were serious enough for several agents to be
disciplined, no one was fired for their transgressions. "None of the
mistakes were intentional. Most problems were due to overlooking
something," said the FBI official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The memo was written by senior FBI lawyers, and it said that
although none of the mistakes was known to the public, they garnered
the attention of the "highest levels of management" within the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   One senior lawmaker in charge of reviewing how the FBI implements
changes to the FISA law in the aftermath of Sept. 11 was critical of
the bureau's missteps.</TE>
<TE>   "Honest mistakes happen in law enforcement, but the extent,
variety and seriousness of the violations recounted in this FBI memo
show again that the secret FISA process breeds sloppiness unless
there's adequate oversight," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), head
of the Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The memo "is not a full picture but a snapshot of how the law is
being implemented," said an aide to Leahy. "These are not minor
incidents."</TE>
<TE>   Congress approved changes to FISA last year under the USA Patriot
Act, providing FBI agents with new powers to use the special FISA
terrorism and espionage warrants. But Leahy and some other lawmakers
have complained that they were not adequately informed of problems
under the old rules.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who sued Gov. Paul E. Patton for alleged sexual harassment
amended her lawsuit to also allege he defamed her by initially lying
about their relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the governor filed requests in Frankfort to dismiss
parts of Tina Conner's suit, arguing she cannot sue for retaliation
and harassment because she has never been a state employee.</LD>
<LD>   The amended complaint said Patton's denials had the effect of
"degrading, defaming and belittling" Conner.</LD>
<TE>   She sued the governor and the state Sept. 18, alleging she and
Patton had a two-year affair beginning in 1997. She alleged that she
got preferential treatment for businesses she operated while the
affair went on, but that she was treated harshly by state inspectors
after she ended the relationship.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The killer of former Beatle John Lennon was denied parole for a
second time, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Releasing Mark David Chapman after 22 years in prison would
"deprecate the seriousness" of the crime, the parole board said in a
statement in Albany. The board said Chapman had "acceptable" behavior
in prison but that didn't guarantee he wouldn't pose a threat to
society.</LD>
<LD>   State parole division spokesman Thomas Grant said the timing of
the notice on what would have been Lennon's 62nd birthday wasn't
intentional.</LD>
<TE>   Chapman, 47, is serving 20 years to life for shooting Lennon
outside his Manhattan apartment in 1980.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in Tacoma formally sentenced serial killer Robert Lee Yates
Jr. to death by injection for the murders of two women.</LD>
<LD>   On Oct. 3, the same jury that found Yates guilty of murdering
Melinda Mercer, 24, in 1997 and Connie LaFontaine Ellis, 35, in 1998,
agreed on the death sentence for the 50-year-old father of five.</LD>
<LD>   Yates already is serving a 408-year sentence under a plea
agreement two years ago with Spokane County, in which he admitted
murdering 13 other people since 1975. Ten were women who, like Mercer
and Ellis, died after encountering Yates while working as
prostitutes.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court in Frankfort rejected a plan to display the
Ten Commandments near the state Capitol, calling it a thinly
disguised effort at government endorsement of religion.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion noted that the state could display the biblical
directives by presenting them in the context of other historical and
nonreligious material.</LD>
<LD>   Republican state Sen. Albert Robinson, who sponsored the General
Assembly resolution calling for the display, said the ruling ignores
the commandments' historical role and infringes on his own practice
of his Christian faith. But he also indicated that the ruling could
lead legislators to a presentation the court could accept.</LD>

<HD>Calif. Overstepped Authority on 'Clean' Cars, U.S. Contends</HD>
<DH>Policy: State's revision of 'zero emissions' rule intruded
on federal jurisdiction, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For three decades, the federal government has allowed California to
plot its own course in its war against air pollution.</LD>
<LD>   But on Wednesday, the Bush administration sided with
DaimlerChrysler and the General Motors Corp. in a lawsuit charging
that California had overstepped its authority in revising its "zero
emissions" vehicle rule last year.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an impermissible intrusion into the federal government's
jurisdiction," said Chet Lunner, a spokesman for the U.S. Department
of Transportation, explaining why the federal government intervened
in the case before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   State officials and environmentalists said the action was
significant because it marked a departure from the federal
government's long-held practice of supporting California's efforts to
clean up its smoggy air.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed that the federal government would intervene
with our efforts to protect our air quality," Gov. Gray Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   California is the only state in the nation that has the right
under federal law to set its own standards, and the state has the
nation's toughest pollution regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government has never stood in California's way
before," said David Doniger, policy director for the Natural
Resources Defense Council's Climate Center.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a federal judge temporarily blocked California from
moving ahead with the revisions while the case was being heard. These
revisions would give auto companies options in how they meet their
quotas for "zero emissions" vehicles, including granting credits for
hybrid vehicles, which are powered by a combination of a gasoline
engine and electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In its brief, the federal government argued that granting credits
for hybrids "preempted" the federal government's sole authority to
set fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, because the criteria
for hybrids are defined in reference to fuel-economy standards.</TE>
<TE>   State officials and environmentalists said that the Bush
administration action is likely to bolster the companies' legal
effort, which has caused havoc with a 12-year-old California program
designed to put smog-free electric cars on the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the
state attorney general's office. "We believe the federal government
should work with California to meet clean-air requirements imposed on
the state."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists criticized the government for the latest in a
string of Bush administration actions that take the side of industry
in disputes over environmental policy. Many top officials in the
administration have worked for energy interests in the past; Andrew
H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, formerly was a top
lobbyist for the auto companies.</TE>
<TE>   Doniger said the Bush administration sent a clear message in its
brief: "Given the choice between clean air in California and car
makers, they choose car makers. Given the choice between states'
rights and car makers, they choose car makers."</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the automakers said company officials had not had
time to read the brief, which was filed late in the day, and would
have no specific comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the support of all of the organizations that have
filed briefs on our behalf," said Kathy Graham, a spokeswoman for
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One senator is a Democrat, the other a Republican. One is from the
West Coast, the other from the East. Both are agonizing over war with
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   As the Senate nears its vote on a resolution that would authorize
President Bush to attack Iraq, Dianne Feinstein of California and
Susan Collins of Maine are officially undeclared. Senate handicappers
figure that Collins, a Republican, will ultimately support the
resolution while Democrat Feinstein, depending on the measure's
wording, may not.</LD>
<LD>   But it is one of the peculiarities of the debate on Iraq that
these two senators, who may find themselves on opposite sides of the
final tally, share similar concerns--a preference for multilateral
action, an unease about preemptive strikes, a hope for diplomacy.</LD>
<TE>   Constituent feedback to both offices is running heavily in the
same direction--in Feinstein's office, the latest phone call tally is
597 in favor of a unilateral attack, 24,169 against. E-mails and
faxes to Collins' office are far fewer in number but in about the
same proportion: 40-1 against war.</TE>
<TE>   But no constituent has yet provided an answer to the question that
haunts the two senators most: How imminent is the threat posed by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's suspected weapons of mass
destruction?</TE>
<TE>   And so, Feinstein is reading everything she can get her hands
on--her latest bedside book is Sandra MacKey's "The Reckoning: Iraq
and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein." Collins, meanwhile, is taking
calls at home from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Both senators
talk of a wrenching decision, with war in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision on whether or not to authorize military force,
knowing that it would be putting young men and women in harm's way,
is the most difficult decision I've had to make as a senator," said
the 49-year-old Collins, a onetime aide to former Sen. William S.
Cohen (R-Maine). "That's why I'm taking my time with it."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, the 69-year-old former mayor of San Francisco, and a
member of the powerful Intelligence Committee, has weighed the
decision with intellectual intensity.</TE>
<TE>   To determine how soon Hussein could have a nuclear weapon,
Feinstein flew to Austria in August to talk with experts at the
International Atomic Energy Agency. She learned that if Hussein were
able to obtain enriched uranium, his nation could acquire nuclear
capability within a year. If Iraq makes its own uranium, estimates
are that it could take longer, from five to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein has interviewed a retiring general of the Israeli armed
forces about how difficult it could be for U.S. troops to fight their
way into Baghdad. She has looked at all the classified briefings
available. And she has tried to weigh the likelihood that Hussein
would use biological and chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   She concluded that Hussein's decision to put Iraq's presidential
sites off limits to U.N. inspections suggests that he is hiding such
weapons at his compounds. "It indicates that he's going to
prevaricate again," she said. "It strengthens the case [to move
against him] dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   For both senators, assessing Hussein is much more difficult than
measuring his arsenal. "I'm convinced on [Iraq's weapon] capability,
but I don't know Saddam's intent," Collins said. "I don't know
whether he can be contained by other processes short of military
force, but I think we ought to try that first."</TE>
<TE>   Said Feinstein: "This is a man who has no scruples about killing
people, whether his own family or members of the military or former
leaders or the Kurds."</TE>
<TE>   Though both senators prefer to exhaust the diplomatic track first,
they come to that view from different perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein worries about the war's potential course, predicting a
"pitched battle in Baghdad." She also thinks about war's aftermath:
whether the United States will "stay the course," whether Iraq can
become a democracy, whether an attack will only breed more, not
fewer, young terrorists eager to die in a holy war against America.
"War should be the last alternative," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, called to the White House for a CIA briefing on Tuesday,
seems swayed by the Bush administration that the best way to push the
United Nations Security Council toward muscular, meaningful weapons
inspections in Iraq is for Congress to give the president authority
for war.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary of State, for whom I have enormous respect, is
adamant in arguing that unless Congress passes the authorization for
use of force, the Security Council will find a way to sidestep the
issue," she said as she walked up the marble steps toward her office
in the Russell Senate Office Building. "It is the threat of
unilateral action by the United States that will prompt the Security
Council to act. I think that's a very valid argument."</TE>
<TE>   Both had hoped to support an alternative resolution, now unlikely
to be offered, that focused more on disarmament and less on regime
change. And both are uneasy about the doctrine of striking enemies
before they have attacked.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a palpable dislike for America," Feinstein said of her
summer trip to Austria and France. "It is really tragic that all of
the positive feelings generated toward the United States following
9/11 have been effectively dissipated. I think we can get past it,
but it's got to be done with our allies, not by going out and for the
first time in history invading another sovereign country."</TE>
<TE>   So the debate comes full circle, back to the issue of how imminent
a threat Iraq poses to the U.S.</TE>

<HD>'Sopranos' Role in Parade Raises a Racket in New York</HD>
<DH>Columbus Day: Mayor invites actors. Some Italian American
leaders object.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's a case of life imitating HBO.</LD>
<LD>   When New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg invited two stars from
"The Sopranos" to march with him in next week's Columbus Day Parade,
he thought he was simply saluting two well-known New
Yorkers--Lorraine Bracco and Dominic Chianese--who have done
important volunteer work for the city.</LD>
<LD>   But he stirred up angry opposition Wednesday from Italian American
leaders, who said the show glorifies violent New Jersey mobsters and
conveys the false impression that all Italian Americans are
criminals.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not the mayor's parade," said Larry Auriana, president of
the Columbus Citizens Foundation, which helps organize the event and
has vetoed requests to include other members of the hit HBO show in
the parade. "The show stereotypes the Italo American family in the
worst way."</TE>
<TE>   Others said the mere presence of Bracco and Chianese would somehow
taint Monday's festivities and besmirch the dignity of the Columbus
Day Parade. Bracco plays Dr. Jennifer Melfi, a psychiatrist helping
mob boss Tony Soprano cope with stress. Chianese plays Tony's aging
but feisty Uncle Junior, a North Jersey mobster facing charges.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, who also invited New York Yankee manager Joe Torre and
city Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta to march with him, tried to
downplay the furor, saying: "I didn't invite them [Bracco and
Chianese] as members of 'The Sopranos.' I didn't invite any other
members of 'The Sopranos' cast. These are two nice people who have
gone out of their way to help the city."</TE>
<TE>   Bracco has been a spokeswoman on city environmental issues, and
Chianese has taped public service announcements for tourism, the
mayor noted.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize if anyone's offended," Bloomberg added. "If you are
offended, don't wave back when they wave to you."</TE>
<TE>   Bracco tried to rise above the fray, saying through an HBO
spokeswoman: "I am glad the mayor has acknowledged me as a successful
Italian American actress. As a native New Yorker and activist, it is
a privilege to march next to the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Chianese said he, too, was honored and planned to attend the
parade, which begins at 42nd Street and marches up Fifth Avenue in
Manhattan to Columbus Circle. Thousands of New Yorkers typically line
the route.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is an old argument that goes back to the release of
"The Godfather," "GoodFellas" and other critically praised movies
about the mob: Are these films great art or ethnically offensive
moneymakers?</TE>
<TE>   For "Sopranos" aficionados there's added irony. In a recent
episode, Tony Soprano's crew members become incensed when they learn
that a Native American group plans to disrupt the Columbus Day
parade, on the grounds that Columbus was a genocidal maniac.</TE>
<TE>   "This is anti-Italian American discrimination," muttered one
character, infuriated by such allegations. "We have to protect our
honor."</TE>
<TE>   William Fugazy, president of the Coalition of Italo-American
Assns., called the inclusion of Bracco and Chianese a disgrace,
noting that Columbus Day is a sacred occasion for Italian Americans.
"Our parade is about heritage and pride," he said. " 'The Sopranos'
haven't done much for heritage and pride in our community."</TE>
<TE>   Others might disagree, saying the New Jersey-centered show has--in
a bizarre way--boosted the pride of many state residents. And how do
you explain the brisk sales in "Sopranos" T-shirts at last month's
San Gennaro Festival in New York, the nation's largest Italian
American street fair?</TE>
<TE>   As Tony Soprano might say, "Whaddyagonnado?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from Wednesday's debate in the House and Senate on whether
to grant President Bush authority to use force against Iraq:</LD>
<LD>   Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):</LD>
<LD>   "I will be voting to give the president of the United States the
authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein
because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
and that of our allies in the Persian Gulf region.... The
administration may not be in the habit of building coalitions, but
that's what they need to do and it's what can be done. If we go it
alone without reason, we risk inflaming an entire region and breeding
a new generation of terrorists, a new cadre of anti-American
zealots--and we will be less secure, not more secure, at the end of
the day, even with Saddam Hussein disarmed."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.):</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot support the resolution for the use of force before
us.... I agree that Saddam Hussein is exceptionally dangerous.... We
retain and will always retain the right of self-defense, including,
of course, self-defense against weapons of mass destruction. When
such a threat requiring self-defense would present itself--and I am
skeptical that that is exactly what we're dealing with here--then we
can, if necessary, act alone, including militarily.... I am concerned
that the president is pushing us into a mistaken and
counterproductive course of action. Instead of this war being crucial
on the war on terrorism, I fear it could have the opposite effect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.):</TE>
<TE>   "The resolution now before the Senate goes well beyond what the
president said on Monday about working through the United Nations. It
would permit the administration to take precipitous, unilateral
action without following through at the U.N..... I can count votes,
and I can see that the Senate will pass this resolution and give the
president the authority to send U.S. troops to Iraq, if he chooses.
But before he takes that step, I hope he will consider the questions
that have been asked here. I hope he will consider the concerns
raised by former generals, senior diplomats and intelligence officers
in testimony before Congress. Above all, I hope that he will listen
to the American people, who are urging him to proceed cautiously and
to not act alone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa):</TE>
<TE>   "A decade ago, I opposed war with Iraq because I felt we had not
exhausted all the other alternatives available to us. Today, I
support this resolution because we have exhausted other remedies.
After years of evasion and defiance, the time has come to stand firm
and enforce the resolutions to disarm Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward):</TE>
<TE>   "I am deeply troubled that lives may be lost without a meaningful
attempt to bring Iraq into compliance with U.N. resolutions through
careful and cautious diplomacy.... Make no mistake, we are voting on
a resolution that grants total authority to the president, who wants
to invade a sovereign nation without any specific act of provocation.
This would authorize the United States to act as the aggressor for
the first time in our history."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Randy Cunningham (R-San Diego):</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine New York, Chicago or Los Angeles like Nagasaki or
Hiroshima.... Imagine millions of Americans dying with ebola,
smallpox, anthrax or even nerve gas.... As a member of the Committee
on Intelligence, I would say it is highly probable if we wait and do
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley):</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 has tragically taught us the price of not acting when
faced with a clear and present danger. And there should be no doubt
that, today, we face a clear and present danger in the form of
weapons of mass destruction in the possession of Saddam Hussein. We
know after the 1991 liberation of Kuwait, Iraq unequivocally agreed
to eliminate its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs
and agreed to allow international weapons inspectors to ensure that
be accomplished. But as we all know, Iraq has willfully, and in
direct violation of its own agreements and those of the U.N. Security
Council, thwarted over and over again the efforts of the inspectors
to find and destroy those weapons. This can only mean one thing:
Saddam intends to hold on to these weapons and use them at the
appropriate time and in the manner he deems necessary."</TE>

<HD>Gene Combo Raises Blacks' Heart Disease Risk, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A genetic abnormality rarely found in whites dramatically increases
the risk of congestive heart failure in blacks and might help explain
why they are more likely than whites to get the disease, researchers
said in a study published today.</LD>
<LD>   The genetic combination plays a role in a quarter of the cases of
congestive heart failure diagnosed each year among blacks, said Dr.
Stephen B. Liggett of the University of Cincinnati College of
Medicine, who was a leader of the study.</LD>
<LD>   The study found that a pair of genes that does nothing bad by
itself can double the risk created by a second pair, generating a
tenfold risk for heart failure in black people who have both.</LD>
<TE>   About 5% of U.S. blacks have that combination, Liggett said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Roger J. Hajjar of Massachusetts
General Hospital called the study provocative but said the
researchers had not proved cause and effect.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have long known that blacks are more likely than whites to
suffer from heart diseases and certain other illnesses, and are more
likely to die because of them. Some researchers have suggested that
blacks receive inferior care, perhaps because of unconscious
prejudice among doctors.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an analysis of 81 studies, released Wednesday as part of
a campaign by major health foundations to close the racial health
gap, found that the evidence that minorities receive inferior cardiac
care is compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Liggett's study, however, is part of growing research indicating
that at least part the racial gap can be explained by genetics.</TE>
<TE>   Discrimination, lack of access to care and other societal
inequities are indeed a problem--but might not be the main reason for
the gap, said Dr. Clyde W. Yancy of the University of
Texas-Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "When you control for those variables, there is still more heart
disease in African Americans. Particularly this disease called heart
failure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yancy said the next step is to find what other genes are involved
and how they affect patients' response to various drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 4.8 million Americans have congestive heart failure. It
affects about 3.5% of all black men, 3.1% of black women, 2.3% of
white men and 1.5% of white women, according to the American Heart
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean about 733,500 blacks have the disease. It shows up
earlier and is more likely to have serious complications in blacks
than in whites. Also, blacks do not gain as much benefit from or need
higher doses of two groups of medicines for heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   There is no one explanation for those differences. What patients
do and where they live also can increase the risk. High blood
pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity all make
heart disease more likely.</TE>
<TE>   That means people who have both gene pairs should do everything
they can to eliminate the risks they can control, Liggett said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the gene pairs in question increases production of a
chemical that increases blood pressure, heart rate and the heart's
contraction and relaxation. The other gene pair makes heart cells
that take up the chemical, norepinephrine, more sensitive to it.</TE>
<TE>   Since the pair producing excess norepinephrine is 10 times as
common among blacks as among whites, the combination is also far more
common among blacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, two of the 84 healthy blacks had the combination,
compared with 15 of 78 blacks with heart failure. Two out of 105
healthy whites and three of 81 with heart failure had the gene
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it was a rare combination in whites, the fact that it
was present is important, Yancy said. He said that indicates that the
risk might be in genetics, not race.</TE>

<HD>Panelists Question Informant for Bureau</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The subject rented rooms to two hijackers.
The hearing is said to have been so productive that another is
scheduled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As part of their probe of intelligence failures surrounding the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, congressional investigators have submitted
written questions to an FBI informant in San Diego who rented rooms
to two of the hijackers, a congressional source said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The source also said that the FBI agent who was the informant's
handler in San Diego was among the officials who appeared before a
joint congressional intelligence panel in closed session Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The session was said to have been so productive that lawmakers
decided to continue pursuing the matter in a second closed hearing
today.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, members postponed until next week a widely
anticipated public hearing with CIA Director George J. Tenet and FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III. The two men instead will appear in
closed session today to answer questions about the San Diego
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The developments underscore the extent to which lawmakers are
focusing their probe on what intelligence agencies knew about Khalid
Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, who lived in San Diego and were among
the hijackers who seized control of the American Airlines flight that
crashed into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers recently disclosed that the CIA had identified the two
men as Al Qaeda operatives 18 months before the attacks and had
tracked them as they traveled into the United States, but had failed
to notify the FBI or immigration authorities about them until shortly
before Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has also come under scrutiny regarding Almihdhar and
Alhazmi because the two men had rented rooms from a bureau informant
in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional source said that the informant has not appeared
before investigators, but that the intelligence committees have
worked out a preliminary arrangement in which they will present
questions to the informant and receive answers in writing.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers have been pressing for access to the informant. But the
FBI has been reluctant to make him available, sources said, because
exposing him might make it more difficult for the FBI to recruit
other sources in the Arab American community.</TE>
<TE>   In previous interviews, FBI sources have declined to identify the
informant by name, but they stressed that the two hijackers blended
into the community so effectively that they might not have aroused
suspicions of even a reliable bureau informant who came into contact
with them.</TE>
<TE>   ''Let's face it, the hijackers were in the country a long time and
fooled everybody,'' said one FBI source.</TE>
<TE>   ''So if we had an informant [near] them ... and I am not
confirming we did, that says more to me about how well these guys
blended in'' than how an informant may have missed their plans.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA on Wednesday also sent a letter to Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
informing him that the agency had decided to deny his request for the
declassification of additional material on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction or ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the CIA found itself in the middle of a political
tussle after releasing new information in which it said Iraq was
unlikely to launch an attack against the United States unless
provoked. Some Democrats said that analysis undercuts assertions by
the Bush administration that Iraq poses an immediate threat.</TE>

<HD>Thurmond Assails 'Egregious' Delay of Judicial Vote</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP senator is outraged over the postponement
of a decision on a former aide. A key Democrat says the move was made
because nomination was too contentious for quick action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a resumption of bitter Senate warfare over judicial nominations,
Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina took the chamber floor
Wednesday for a rare speech expressing outrage at Democrats for
delaying a confirmation vote for a former aide tapped by President
Bush for a federal appeals court judgeship.</LD>
<LD>   The White House joined in the criticism, inviting Judiciary
Committee Republicans to meet with Bush to discuss strategy for
getting a vote on the nomination of U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "I am hurt and disappointed by this egregious act of destructive
politics," said Thurmond, 99, reading a brief but angry speech that
could mark the Republican's final Senate address before he retires at
the end of the current session.</LD>
<TE>   He said Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) had
promised a vote on Shedd and then violated panel rules by removing
the nomination from the agenda of a Tuesday committee meeting. "In my
48 years in the United States Senate," Thurmond said, "I have never
been treated in such a manner."</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said Tuesday that he was delaying action because the
nomination was too contentious for a quick vote and could stall
action on 17 other judicial nominations awaiting action.</TE>
<TE>   "It has always been Senator Leahy's intention to schedule a vote"
on Shedd, and he plans to do so this year, "if it's possible to do
so," a Leahy aide said after Thurmond's speech.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the
judiciary panel, called Leahy's action an affront to Thurmond, Bush
and Shedd. Hatch said Republicans seek "just a stinking, solitary
vote" on the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Some groups, including the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, have criticized Shedd, a former chief of staff for
the Judiciary Committee, for his handling of cases dealing with civil
rights. Majority Whip Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said letters are pouring in
from South Carolina and elsewhere from African Americans and Latinos
complaining about Shedd's rulings. Reid said he understood Thurmond's
disappointment but noted that the Senate has already confirmed the
senator's son as U.S. attorney for South Carolina and approved
another former Thurmond aide for a judgeship.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Wednesday,
"Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity. Senators deserve to
have their commitments upheld. And the people deserve better,
especially when there is a vacancy crisis in the United States
courts."</TE>
<TE>   At a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration in Washington, Bush also
accused the Senate of delaying action on the nomination of Miguel
Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
"There are senators who are playing politics with this good man's
nomination," Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Mormon Speech Curb Rejected</HD>
<DH>Law: Appeals court says church can't make Salt Lake City
sidewalk a '1st Amendment-free zone.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mormon church cannot restrict free speech on the sidewalks that
run through its plaza on the city's Main Street, the U.S. 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The court held that the sidewalks are a traditional public forum
and restrictions on free speech on those sidewalks are
unconstitutional. The sidewalks that used to line the former block of
Main Street are open to pedestrians but not to free speech.</LD>
<LD>   "The city cannot create a ' 1st Amendment-free zone.' Their
attempt to do so must fail," the court ruled.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute arose after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints imposed rules restricting protests, demonstrations and other
activities on the one-block stretch of Main Street in Salt Lake City
it bought from the city.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing that the
restrictions were unconstitutional because the city retains an
easement across the block to ensure pedestrian access.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's lawsuit was earlier dismissed in U.S. District Court.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court ruling overturned a decision by U.S. District
Judge Ted Stewart that the collection of fountains, reflecting pools,
plants and statues in downtown Salt Lake City had turned a public
sidewalk into a private religious garden, exempt from 1st Amendment
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The list of rules was written by city and church attorneys and
approved by the City Council in April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The city argued that it had cleared itself of any obligation
because the restrictions were set out when it got the easement.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon church had no immediate comment on the ruling and their
lawyers were reading through the decision Wednesday afternoon, said
spokesman Dale Bills.</TE>

<HD>Privacy Sought on 9/11 Tapes</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Pilots request a closed courtroom if recordings
are played at Moussaoui trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>An airline pilots union requested Wednesday that the courtroom be
closed to protect victims' privacy if cockpit recordings are played
at the trial of accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   The Air Line Pilots Assn. told a judge that public release of the
tapes and transcripts would violate a federal law designed to protect
privacy in airline disasters. Moussaoui's twice-postponed trial is
set for June 30.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema for
permission to play recordings from United Airlines Flight 93, which
crashed near Shanksville, Pa., and a private jet that picked up the
cockpit radio transmissions. Passengers on the United jet are
credited with attacking the hijackers and preventing an attack on the
U.S. Capitol or the White House.</LD>
<TE>   During the struggle, the plane crashed, killing all aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema said last month that she probably would reject the
government's plan to play the recordings unless prosecutors could
show that they represented essential evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The government has not asked that the trial be closed to the
public while any tapes are played, but it noted that federal law
would prevent releasing the recordings outside the court.</TE>
<TE>   Any public release "would be contrary to the statutory protections
... instituted at ALPA's behest--protections that were instituted to
protect legitimate and sensitive privacy interests of pilots and the
victims of aviation disasters and their families," the union's
written request said.</TE>
<TE>   The recorder from Flight 93 was the only one recovered from the
Sept. 11 attacks. The government has allowed relatives of the 40
passengers and crew who died to listen to the tapes in private
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, tapes from the cockpit voice recorder, which runs
continuously in 30-minute increments and therefore records the period
leading up to a crash, are not played in public. Transcripts usually
are made public by the National Transportation Safety Board as part
of crash investigations.</TE>

<HD>Experts Are at a Loss on Profile of Sniper</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Another shooting at a gas station may be
seventh fatality in the seemingly random attacks, but police say that
it's too soon to tell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE and JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Is he a hunter gone mad? A schizophrenic with delusions of a direct
line to God? A military marksman waging urban warfare on his
countrymen? A terrorist? And whoever he is, is he working alone?</LD>
<LD>   The science of U.S. law enforcement has had ample experience with
murder, but the sniper who has terrorized the greater Washington area
for a week, killing six and wounding two with single-shot precision,
is confounding at least 195 of the nation's finest.</LD>
<LD>   And Wednesday night, investigators were seeking to determine if
the sniper had struck again.</LD>
<TE>   Police reported a man was shot to death at 8:18 p.m. at a service
station north of Manassas, Va., 30 miles southwest of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an adult male who was pumping gas who is deceased,"
Prince William County Police spokesman Dennis Mangan said. "And that,
at least on its surface, fits the pattern we've been seeing."</TE>
<TE>   But Mangan cautioned against making a firm link to the other
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still in the earliest stages of investigation," he said. "We
don't know exactly what we have yet."</TE>
<TE>   The victim, whose identity was not released Wednesday night, was
standing beside the gas pump when he was hit, Mangan said. If a link
is established to the other killings, it would be the third shooting
to occur at a gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia State Police said two men were seen driving away in a
white vehicle after the attack. A Maryland witness told police last
week he saw two men in a white truck or van leaving the scene of a
shooting outside a post office.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of police officers descended on the area, checking nearby
motels and blocking traffic around the shooting scene. They were
joined by investigators from the sniper task force who were
dispatched from their Montgomery County, Md., headquarters, as were
agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Cpl. Rob Moroney of the Montgomery County Police Department, which
is coordinating the investigation, said it was "too early to
speculate" about whether this shooting is linked to the others.</TE>
<TE>   There have been frustratingly few clues in the attacks. The latest
is a Tarot card inscribed, "Dear policeman, I am God," found near a
shell casing 150 yards from the Maryland middle school where a
13-year-old boy was critically wounded Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Voicing the challenge faced by investigators struggling to solve
the series of crimes, Clint Van Zandt, a retired FBI official and an
expert on criminal psychology, said: "I am a profiler, not a
soothsayer. He is motivated, he is focused, he is reasonably
intelligent for a predator. He is psychopathic and has no
appreciation for the pain and consternation he is causing."</TE>
<TE>   A sniper as serial killer is not unprecedented, but cases that
leave so little evidence and follow no pattern tend to stump even the
best detectives, who now are turning to everything from psychological
work-ups to combing blades of grass on their hands and knees.</TE>
<TE>   With 1,600 "credible" leads and precious little hard evidence to
go on, experts are attempting to build a profile of a killer who has
managed to strike and vanish eight times in Maryland, the District of
Columbia and Virginia--areas already under an unprecedented level of
security since last year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Most serial killers prey on a particular type of victim--women,
gay men, prostitutes--at a particular kind of site--lovers' lanes,
freeways, bars. But this one seems to have made a pattern out of
randomness. His victims--black, white, Latino and Indian--have ranged
in age from 13 to 72. He has no apparent personal contact with his
prey, shooting people he likely has never met from distances that
prohibit so much as a look into their eyes. His only consistent
calling card is his weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a nighttime slaying of an elderly man on a Washington
street corner and, if it is linked, this latest shooting, the killer
has kept banker's hours--a shooting spree in the mornings and
afternoons late last week, off for the weekend, then back at 8:09
Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Every tidbit of information has been seized upon by experts and
lay people alike as a possible window into the mind of a maniac.
Still, no single portrait emerges.</TE>
<TE>   The chilling efficiency of the shootings and swift escapes has
raised questions about whether the killer has had military or police
training. His weapon of choice--linked in six of the eight
shootings--is not the run-of-the-mill rifle Boy Scouts use to shoot
tin cans, nor the .30-caliber model popular among hunters, but a
.223-caliber known for high velocity and pinpoint accuracy at 500
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "The weapon itself is indicative of a person on a power trip,"
said Robert Ressler, a criminologist and former FBI profiler. "It's a
macho, civilian version of the military M-16. It appeals to the gun
nuts and the paramilitary types, a favored symbolic expression of the
authority and power these people are trying to obtain."</TE>
<TE>   Many serial killers kidnap, rape or otherwise interact with their
victims. David Berkowitz--the "Son of Sam" killer who terrorized New
York City in 1976 and 1977--focused on young women parked in lovers'
lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Berkowitz would come right up close and shoot," recalled Fred
Schwartz, who investigated the case for the Queens County, N.Y.,
district attorney's office and is now a lawyer in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Washington-area shooter approaches his grisly
task more like sport.</TE>
<TE>   "This is hunting behavior," said Reid Meloy, a San Diego forensic
psychologist who profiled Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh for
prosecutors. "That's why it's so frightening. The success of hunting
is built on the premise of not alerting your target before you make
the kill. This is planned, purposeful, and the act of killing is done
with little emotion."</TE>
<TE>   The shootings seem to involve great calculation; matted grass
found in the woods near the middle school indicates that the killer
lay in wait. But the ability to vanish without being spotted even in
populous suburbs suggests to some the work of a team, perhaps a
mastermind with a partner at the ready for a quick getaway.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just stick a rifle like this out of a window; it takes
manipulation," Ressler said. "He's not pulling up and speeding off.
The vehicle would almost have to be stopped to get that ...
accuracy."</TE>
<TE>   But the skill of blending into an urban setting is also
characteristic of military training, leading some investigators to
wonder if this is an elite soldier gone off the rails. "Whoever it
is, they've spent a lot of time looking down the sights of a rifle,"
Van Zandt said.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts lean toward the notion of a frustrated civilian
enamored of the military and perhaps influenced by a "sniper culture"
of books and videos that has emerged in recent years under the slogan
"one shot, one kill," said Tom Diaz, senior analyst at the Violence
Policy Center in Washington, a gun-control advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   A point of agreement is that this killer is mentally ill. The
Tarot card--sent to FBI forensics analysts for study--was seen as
evidence of a damaged mind, perhaps weak and impotent in daily life.</TE>
<TE>   "In the act of killing--particularly in a case where the person
appears to have developed a taste for it--there is a sense that he
does become godlike, because he does have the power of life and
death," Meloy said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the urge to communicate with police grows, a move that
can prove to be a killer's undoing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Achilles' heel of an individual like this is typically his
sense of impunity.... That's what eventually brings him down," Meloy
said, citing the case of Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski, whose
explosives sent through the mail killed three and injured 29 between
1978 and 1995. If Kaczynski had "kept bombing and didn't send
manifestos out to the newspapers, he might still be out there."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the shooter has yet to do is claim responsibility for
the killings, leading some to discount the notion of foreign
terrorists who seek to advance a broad agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "This is small change for a terrorist," criminologist Ressler
said. "They look to disrupt the economy and commerce. There's not
enough bang for the buck here."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Tarot card discovery prompted police to return to
the earlier crime scenes, raking the areas for clues. Investigators
were deluged with tips and chased some leads that went nowhere. At
noon Wednesday, a heavily armed SWAT team fanned out into a wooded
area near a Maryland elementary school after a neighbor reported
seeing a man vanish into the forest carrying a long black bag. A
search yielded nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one reason serial killers are so frustrating to law
enforcement is they tend to operate outside of the world where police
have their greatest resources: informants and eyewitnesses.</TE>
<TE>   So police are continuing to turn to the public, urging residents
to call in any noticeable change in behavior in those around them.</TE>
<TE>   "It is information from another person that may close this
investigation," Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose
said.</TE>
<TE>   If past killers have imparted any lesson, it's that they can elude
police for years. Ted Bundy confessed to killing 30 women and girls
in seven states from 1973 to 1978 before he was caught and executed.</TE>
<TE>   "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez was convicted of 13
torture-murders in the L.A. area in 1984 and 1985; he remains on
death row.</TE>

<HD>Atlantis Docks at the Space Station</HD>
<DH>Shuttle: Crew brings a truss segment for the expanding
complex and fresh food for the hosts.</DH>

<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The space shuttle Atlantis approached gracefully and docked
flawlessly with the International Space Station on Wednesday, gliding
out of the inky darkness of space on the whisper of its smallest
jets.</LD>
<LD>   That allowed for a boisterous meeting between the shuttle's
six-member crew and the three current residents of the space station,
who began their mission 126 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   The two spacecraft, each weighing more than 100 tons, hurtled
above the Earth at five miles a second, but the final miles of an
orbital rendezvous are so carefully choreographed that only the
rapidly spinning Earth beneath the shuttle, as seen from video
cameras aboard the station, hinted at the speed and force involved in
their flights.</LD>
<TE>   The shuttle and its crew launched from Florida on Tuesday. Their
11-day mission is carrying a $390-million, 45-foot truss segment for
the growing space station.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle commander Jeffrey Ashby, a U.S. Navy captain, fired the
shuttle's rockets to slow its progress throughout the morning, then
used maneuvering jets to fine-tune his approach until Atlantis inched
up to the station and grabbed hold of a docking port at 11:17 a.m.
EDT, slightly ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle and station crews chatted amiably as Atlantis moved
within radio range.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Piers, how are you doing? How do you like being in space?"
called out Peggy Whitson, the American science officer on the
station. She and her two Russian crewmates were spending their 126th
day in orbit.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good. It's great," said Piers Sellers, a British-born
NASA astronaut making his first flight.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sellers is to make his first spacewalk with American David
Wolf. The pair will secure the truss segment to the station and
prepare many of its systems for activation.</TE>
<TE>   The long, narrow, girder-like assembly in the shuttle's cargo bay
is the second truss segment to arrive at the station. It will become
part of an eventual 350-foot structure, the longest built in space.
The structure will support the massive arrays of solar panels that
will power the life support and science activity on the station
throughout its life.</TE>
<TE>   After seals and air pressure were checked on the newly joined
complex, hatches separating the two spacecraft flew open and the six
Atlantis astronauts crowded into the U.S. laboratory module, Destiny,
giving their hosts bearhugs and boisterous greetings.</TE>
<TE>   These were the first visitors for the station crew of commander
Valery Korzun, flight engineer Sergei Treschev and Whitson since the
shuttle crew that delivered them left 17 weeks ago. They will wrap up
their long-duration expedition in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantis crew members brought with them fresh fruit, hot sauce
and a pecan pie. Living off a diet made up largely of reconstituted
food, space station crews most often request items that they can
smell and taste, such as oranges.</TE>

<HD>W.Va. Coal Plant Reopens After Spill Into Streams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOGAN, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>LOGAN, W. Va.--A coal treatment plant reopened Wednesday, a day after
a ruptured pipe spilled 100,000 gallons of coal slurry into two
nearby streams, killing fish and raising concerns about the safety of
the water supply.</LD>
<LD>   State environmental inspectors said Bandmill Coal Co., a
subsidiary of Massey Energy Co., could open as long as workers
continued cleanup efforts.</LD>
<LD>   By Wednesday afternoon, the spill had discolored the Guyandotte
River. The slurry--concentrated and grayish-black on Tuesday--had
broken up considerably, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The cleanup is proceeding very well, and the operations of the
plant itself were not going to impair the work," state inspection
supervisor Joe Hager said.</TE>
<TE>   Massey said its investigators have determined that human error
caused the spill of slurry--a mixture of water, fine coal particles
and other waste from washing coal to prepare it for market.</TE>
<TE>   A mistakenly opened valve allowed slurry to enter a smaller water
line. That raised pressure inside the pipe, causing it to rupture.</TE>
<TE>   Bandmill faces as much as $15,000 in daily fines related to the
spill and has been ordered to restore the smaller of the two creeks
to its pre-spill condition. The slurry had mostly diluted by the time
it reached the larger creek.</TE>

<HD>Head of Islamic Charity Is Indicted</HD>
<DH>Terror: Director is accused of fraudulently raising
millions of dollars for Al Qaeda and of being a close associate of
Osama Bin Laden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The head of an Illinois-based Islamic charity was indicted Wednesday
on charges of fraudulently raising potentially millions of dollars
for the Al Qaeda terrorist network, and he was accused by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft of being a close associate of Osama bin Laden who
bought large quantities of weapons for jihad warriors.</LD>
<LD>   Enaam Arnaout, 40, executive director of the Benevolence
International Foundation, was charged with conspiracy to engage in a
racketeering enterprise, providing material support to Al Qaeda and
other terrorists, money laundering mail fraud and wire fraud. He
faces a maximum of 90 years in prison without parole if convicted on
all counts.</LD>
<LD>   A grand jury in Chicago accused Arnaout of defrauding contributors
to the high-profile international charity by falsely claiming that it
used donations solely for humanitarian relief, including helping
children in war-torn Islamic countries. An undisclosed--but
significant--amount of money actually was sent to Al Qaeda and "other
groups engaged in armed violence overseas" over a period of more than
10 years, it said.</LD>
<TE>   In one case in November 2001, the seven-count indictment alleges,
Arnaout told a Benevolence employee in Bosnia-Herzegovina to
camouflage donations that went to injured jihad fighters by creating
"a new list of orphans as a means of justifying the expenditures."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no moral distinction between those who carry out
terrorist attacks and those who knowingly finance terrorist attacks,"
Ashcroft said at a news conference in Chicago. "We ... will find the
sources of terrorist blood money, we will shut down these sources,
and we will ensure that both terrorists and their financiers meet the
same swift, certain justice of the United States of America."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft accused Arnaout of preying on the goodwill of Muslims in
the United States, who he said are obliged by the principles of their
religion to donate to legitimate charities. Some donors knew the
money was going to Al Qaeda, Ashcroft said, but most did not.</TE>
<TE>   Benevolence International is one of the largest and most prominent
Muslim charities in the United States, with offices in Bosnia,
Pakistan, Tajikistan, Yemen, Turkey, Georgia and China. It frequently
raises more than $1 million a year in charitable donations.</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout, a Syrian-born naturalized U.S. citizen, has been in
custody since April and could not be reached for comment. But a
lawyer for the Palos Hills, Ill.-based group said the charges against
Arnaout were unfair and based on "guilt by association" stemming from
his support of Afghan fighters opposing the Soviet occupation of
their country in the 1980s. The government alleges that Arnaout and
Bin Laden met during that time and continued their relationship for
more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It is no secret that almost everybody in the Arab and Muslim
world was supportive of the efforts to resist the Soviet occupation
of Afghanistan, as was our own government," lawyer Matthew Piers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout, a married father of four, was arrested April 30 on
charges of lying under oath in documents his group had filed in
federal court in an effort to have its funds released by the U.S.
government. Those funds were frozen last year because of Benevolence
International's alleged ties to Al Qaeda. In those documents, Arnaout
insisted that he had no connection to terrorist activity and that he
had never met Bin Laden or other top Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday's indictment alleged a wealth of connections between
Arnaout, Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda officials, as well as other
alleged terrorists, including Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan warlord
who has targeted U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   It also disclosed that when authorities raided a Benevolence
International office in Bosnia in March, they found a treasure trove
of incriminating Al Qaeda documents, including details of how the
group officially was formed on Sept. 10, 1988; top Saudi Arabian
financiers of the terror network; the text of the original oath of
allegiance pledged by Al Qaeda members; and personnel files of
individual moujahedeen, or Islamic warriors, trained in Afghanistan
under Bin Laden's direction.</TE>
<TE>   "The documents ... show the American people and the world for the
first time tangible proof of the founding of the world's most
dangerous terrorist network and the oath of allegiance its members
pledge," Ashcroft said. "It is chilling that the origins of Al Qaeda
were discovered in a charity claiming to do good."</TE>
<TE>   The seized documents also showed that in the mid- to late 1980s,
Arnaout served as the director of communications at a moujahedeen
camp in Afghanistan under the direction of Bin Laden. While there,
the indictment alleged, Arnaout was involved in acquiring and
distributing hundreds of rockets, mortars and bombs on behalf of
jihad causes.</TE>
<TE>   Piers said the documents provided to Arnaout's defense team don't
indicate any kind of liaison between him and the charity and
terrorists, including Bin Laden. "They are interesting historical
documents, if true, but they are not indicative of any wrongdoing by
Mr. Arnaout," Piers said. He added that Arnaout never told the
Bosnian employee to lie about the destination of donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Enaam is not surprised" by the indictment, Piers added. "But he
is saddened by the prospect that with the government putting all of
this effort and focus on him, that he may be spending the rest of his
life in jail. He has no illusions about the difficulty in getting a
fair trial, especially with the attorney general traveling here
personally to inflame the press and the public."</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout, he said, "feels betrayed by a country for which he
believes he has been a patriotic and productive citizen."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, U.S. authorities have alleged that Arnaout has
been a personal friend of Bin Laden for more than a dozen years, and
that Al Qaeda has long used Benevolence International for logistical
support and financing. One Chicago-based FBI agent said in an
affidavit that terrorists who have tried to obtain chemical and
nuclear weapons on behalf of Al Qaeda have had contacts with
Benevolence International offices and personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The group also has made efforts to provide Chechen rebels and a
related military group with money, an X-ray machine and anti-mine
boots, the FBI agent said.</TE>

<HD>War's Unknown Financial Costs</HD>
<DH>Budget: Estimates are as high as $200 billion. But while
some lawmakers ask about the monetary impact, the questions go mainly
unanswered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As Congress steams toward authorizing a possible war against Iraq,
it's blank check time for U.S. taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   No one knows exactly how much money it would cost to wage war
against Iraq because President Bush has not said what kind of
military attack he envisions, should he decide one is necessary.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's top economic advisor has said it could cost as much as
$200 billion, a significant drain on a federal budget already
swimming in red ink.</LD>
<TE>   The Congressional Budget Office, while declining to predict an
overall figure, estimates that combat could cost as much as $9
billion a month--a figure that dwarfs current fiscal concerns. The
entire U.S. budget for the 2003 fiscal year is stalled in Congress
over a $9-billion difference between Bush and congressional
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers generally view the decision to go to war as a moral and
strategic choice, not one that hinges on economic or budget policy.
But they are still asking questions about what financial impact to
expect--and those questions have been left largely unanswered during
the congressional debate on Bush's push to confront Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Estimating the cost of a still-undefined and undeclared war with
Iraq is a difficult undertaking, to say the least," Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) said recently. "But let's be
clear. This debate should not be driven by how much it will cost U.S.
taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.) said Wednesday it was appropriate
that fiscal concerns were "conspicuously absent" from House debate.
But he also urged lawmakers to recognize the pressures a war would
put on a federal budget that is already projected to run $452 billion
in deficits over the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost, whatever the cost is, is not beyond our means in a
$10-trillion economy. But it is beyond our budget," Spratt said.</TE>
<TE>   One factor could ensure that the price tag for attacking Iraq
would be greater for the United States than in the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   That conflict cost about $61 billion, but other countries in the
international coalition put together by the United States contributed
$48 billion.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain that in a new fight with Iraq, Bush would be able
to assemble such a broad coalition of allies and potential partners
in sharing the cost of combat and postwar reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The forces to carry out this mission and to pay for this mission
will come from the United States," said Senate Appropriations
Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), a leading critic of Bush's Iraq
policy. "There can be little question of that. If the rest of the
world doesn't want to come with us at the outset, it seems highly
unlikely that they would line up for the follow-through."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats are concerned that the cost of waging war and of
coping with its aftermath would make it harder to find room in the
U.S. budget for such priorities as education aid and prescription
drug coverage for Medicare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   "Schoolkids will pay" for a war with Iraq, said Rep. Pete Stark
(D-Hayward). "There'll be no money to keep them from being left
behind--way behind.... And there won't be any money for a drug
benefit because Bush will spend it all on a war."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, war spending could simply add to the deficit,
if Congress refuses to choose between guns and butter and instead
finances both. That could rile fiscal conservatives like Mitchell E.
Daniels Jr., Bush's budget director, who said Wednesday an armed
conflict with Iraq "should not leave a residue of bigger government
and higher taxes, as many wars have."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels estimated that the cost of responding to last year's Sept.
11 terrorist attacks added $80 billion in federal spending.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had no idea what a possible war with Iraq would add to
government spending.</TE>
<TE>   That is in part because Bush says he has not yet decided whether
to launch a military strike. And if he does, the cost will be
affected by whether it is predominantly a land or air attack, whether
it is a quick or protracted conflict and by the role the United
States plays in Iraq in the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic advisor, estimated in a
recent interview with the Wall Street Journal that a war with Iraq
would cost from 1% to 2% of the gross domestic product--which amounts
to from $100 billion to $200 billion. Lindsey did not detail how he
arrived at those figures.</TE>
<TE>   If it cost that much, it would amount to nearly four times the
amount the president requested for the Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   The most detailed effort to estimate war costs has come from the
CBO, which projected $6 billion to $9 billion a month in combat
expenses, depending on the nature of the warfare. In addition, the
CBO estimated it would cost:</TE>
<TE>   * Up to $13 billion to deploy U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf
region.</TE>
<TE>   * Up to $7 billion to return U.S. troops to their home bases after
the war.</TE>
<TE>   * Up to $4 billion a month for occupation of postwar Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The estimate did not include potential costs of humanitarian
assistance and postwar rebuilding of Iraq, which could be
considerable.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO also did not try to calculate potential casualties or the
cost of responding if Iraq uses chemical or biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Unknown factors abound in considering how a conflict with Iraq
would actually unfold," the CBO report says.</TE>

<HD>Florida Executes Female Serial Killer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STARKE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Aileen Wuornos, a hitchhiking prostitute who killed six men along
Florida's highways more than a decade ago, was executed by injection
Wednesday after dropping her appeals and firing her lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   Wuornos, 46, became the 10th woman executed in the United States
since capital punishment resumed in 1977. Oklahoma has put three
women to death; Florida and Texas have executed two each.</LD>
<LD>   In her final statement, Wuornos referred to Jesus and a
blockbuster movie.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd just like to say I'm sailing with the Rock and I'll be back
like 'Independence Day' with Jesus, June 6, like the movie, big
mother ship and all. I'll be back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The execution had been delayed while experts evaluated her mental
health. Gov. Jeb Bush lifted his stay last week after three
psychiatrists concluded that Wuornos was competent to choose
execution.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos shot to death at least six middle-aged men along Florida
highways in 1989 and 1990. Her story has been portrayed in two
movies, three books and an opera.</TE>
<TE>   She initially said the killings were in self-defense after she was
assaulted by customers who picked her up. But she later said that the
claim was a lie and that she intended to rob and kill the men.</TE>
<TE>   At a July hearing, Wuornos told a judge that she was "sick of
hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I'm competent, sane and I'm telling
the truth." She also told the state Supreme Court that she would kill
again.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos' death warrant was for her first victim, Richard Mallory,
an electronics shop owner. She later pleaded no contest to five other
murders.</TE>
<TE>   She spent Tuesday night visiting with a childhood friend, Dawn
Botkins, who said Wuornos was in a good mood, laughing a lot and
never crying.</TE>
<TE>   "She was looking forward to being home with God and getting off
this Earth," Botkins said. "She prayed that the [souls of the] guys
she killed are saved and that by her dying they will be saved."</TE>
<TE>   Terri Griffith, whose father was killed by Wuornos, said: "I'm
glad it's over. It was an easy death. It was a little bit too easy. I
think she should have suffered a little bit more. She was off her
rocker."</TE>

<HD>Wary Congress Moves Toward a Vote on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Debate: House, Senate may reach a decision today.
Developments at Capitol show growing momentum behind Bush's
resolution.</DH>

<AU>NICK ANDERSON and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Grim talk of war and peace filled the Capitol on Wednesday as
Congress moved closer to granting President Bush broad authority to
launch--if diplomacy fails--the second U.S.-led war against Iraq in a
dozen years.</LD>
<LD>   The House debate is expected to end today with a final vote on the
resolution, which would have far-reaching consequences for American
foreign policy. The Senate also may take its final vote today.</LD>
<LD>   Hawks, who have held the upper hand from the start, argued that
Congress must give Bush the strongest possible show of support to
help the administration confront the threat posed by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and his suspected weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Doves, outnumbered but speaking out in force, complained that the
resolution Bush wants would give him unchecked power to initiate
preemptive war--one that they warned would lack international
support, violate American tradition and cost unknown numbers of
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers in between wrestled with a vote they called one of
the most important of their careers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a terrible, terrible time," said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy
(D-N.Y.), who intends to support the president's resolution but
prefers an alternative that would link the use of military force to
action by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "In the morning you wake up and say, 'Where am I going today? How
am I going to vote?' And midafternoon, you're somewhere else. This is
probably going to be the hardest vote that any of us will ever make."</TE>
<TE>   The televised debates, observed firsthand by some tourists in the
galleries and a smattering of lawmakers seated in the House and
Senate chambers, yielded some dramatic moments amid the long hours of
scripted speeches.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday afternoon, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, prowled the Senate
floor, beseeching his colleagues to be wary of endorsing a new
doctrine on the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress chooses to authorize military action, Biden said,
"please do not rest it on this cockamamie notion of preemption. You
will rue the day if that is a precedent we establish."</TE>
<TE>   Biden, who has raised questions about the administration's
approach, did not indicate how he would vote. However, he is
considered likely to back the White House resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, developments on both sides of the Capitol showed
unstoppable, growing momentum behind the resolution Bush proposed
last week with bipartisan congressional support.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would authorize the president to use U.S. military
force against Iraq if he concludes that diplomatic efforts to disarm
Hussein have failed. It would urge cooperation with the United
Nations and require subsequent reports to Congress but would
nonetheless give the president wide latitude to act.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans forming a solid wall behind the president, key
Democrats continued to fall in line, including Harry Reid of Nevada,
the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate; Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, his
party's ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee; and
Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a potential 2004 presidential
contender.</TE>
<TE>   "By standing with the president, Congress will demonstrate that
our nation is united in its determination to take away Saddam
Hussein's deadly arsenal, by peaceful means if we can, by force if we
must," Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles Hagel of Nebraska, until now a leading Republican
skeptic of the drive toward military confrontation, also embraced the
Bush resolution.</TE>
<TE>   So did Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the only current Senate
Republican who opposed the measure authorizing the Persian Gulf War
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The White House kept up pressure in an effort to win the largest
possible majorities for its resolution. Administration officials have
stressed that it would help their effort in building an international
coalition to confront Hussein and force Iraq's disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations in New York, diplomats continued their
search for agreement on wording for a new Security Council resolution
on Iraq. The United States and Britain were moving toward accepting a
single compromise measure that would call for "consequences" if
Baghdad defies weapons inspections, but it would not directly
authorize the use of military force, according to U.S. officials and
U.N. diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   However, differences remained, with France and Russia focused
mainly on getting inspectors back into Iraq, while the United States
and Britain pressed for stringent conditions to ensure compliance by
Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke by telephone with French President Jacques Chirac on
Wednesday. British Prime Minister Tony Blair is scheduled to fly to
Russia to meet today with President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, addressing a U.S.
intelligence report that surfaced Tuesday and raised questions about
whether Hussein would launch a catastrophic first strike against the
United States, said the information indicates that the Iraqi arsenal
should be cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam Hussein holds a gun to your head even while he denies
that he actually owns a gun, how safe should you feel?" Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, the major question remains how many Democrats will back
him. In January 1991, most congressional Democrats opposed the
resolution that his father's administration sought to authorize the
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   But the current debate has revealed that last year's terrorist
attacks changed the world view for many Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who opposed the
1991 war, supports authorizing military action against Hussein's
regime because, he says, the United States cannot risk the
possibility that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would flow
from Iraq to suicidal terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Half or more of the Democrats in Congress are expected to agree
with him in the final votes. These Democrats, spanning the party's
ideological spectrum, have echoed concerns raised in Congress
immediately after last year's attacks. Like Bush, they have tied
action on Iraq to the continuing threat of terrorism and the
overarching priority of securing the American homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many Democrats are preparing to vote against the
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the most senior member of the
House and a supporter of the 1991 war, said approval of the measure
would be "an act of great folly."</TE>
<TE>   In a stinging speech on the House floor, Dingell contrasted the
administration's policy with the reluctance of President Kennedy to
launch a war during the Cuban missile crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Moving against Iraq without the backing of a global coalition,
Dingell said, "poses enormous risks to the troops that we would be
sending, and it poses enormous risks to this country and its foreign
policy. Not only is it novel and dangerous to talk about preemptive
strikes, but it is something which need not be done."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats, anguishing over the debate, seemed likely to
follow a two-pronged strategy.</TE>
<TE>   First, they planned to vote for an alternative proposed by Rep.
John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.) that would authorize the use of force
against Iraq only in concert with the U.N. Then, with the expected
defeat of Spratt's proposal, they would vote with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   That was the path chosen by senior Democrats such as Skelton and
Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles. Waxman said most of his
constituent phone calls and mail have been running against the
president's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "People would prefer what I want, which is a proposal that would
work through the U.N., and only if that doesn't succeed would we come
back and delegate further authority to the president," Waxman said in
an interview. "But at the end of the day, what I want isn't going to
prevail. And I think it's important to have the strongest bipartisan
signal of unity to get the U.N. to act."</TE>
<TE>   Most Republicans showed few qualms about their votes.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ron Lewis (R-Ky.) noted that allied warplanes patrolling Iraq
are still dodging antiaircraft fire, years after the 1991 cease-fire.
"Iraq is still fighting, and we need to respond," Lewis said. "The
Persian Gulf War is ongoing."</TE>
<TE>   Another Bush supporter, Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.), declared:
"Saddam Hussein is uniquely evil--the only ruler in power today and
the first one since Hitler to commit chemical genocide."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, which has been debating the Iraq issue for a week,
rejected, 88 to 10, an amendment by Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.)
concerning the use of force against terrorist groups. The amendment
was opposed by the White House as a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Senate is expected to vote to shut down debate and move
toward passage of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Final action could come as early as tonight, though Sen. Robert C.
Byrd (D-W.Va.) and other opponents might try to stall the vote</TE>
<TE>   The decisions by Hagel and Kerry, both Vietnam War veterans, to
support the resolution helps the White House toward its goal of
passage by a lopsided margin.</TE>
<TE>   But Hagel raised many questions, even as he endorsed the
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "In authorizing the use of force against Iraq, we are at the
beginning of a road that has no clear end," he said. Kerry too had
pointed words, warning the administration that it must build an
international coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go it alone without reason, we risk inflaming an entire
region and breeding a new generation of terrorists, a new cadre of
anti-American zealots," Kerry said.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where the Resolutions Stand</TE>
<TE>   Several resolutions on Iraq are pending before the United Nations
and Congress:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Congress</TE>
<TE>   House version: One, backed by President Bush, authorizes the
president to use armed forces to `defend the national security of the
United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq' and
strictly enforce U.N. resolutions. Another authorizes military force
only in conjunction with passage of a new U.N. Security Council
resolution. A third would urge the U.S. to work for Iraqi disarmament
through peaceful means using U.N. diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Status: The full House is expected to pass the Bush-backed measure
today.</TE>
<TE>   Senate version: One is the Bush-backed resolution also being
consider by the House. The other authorizes force only in conjunction
with the U.N., similar to another House version.</TE>
<TE>   Status: The Senate may vote today as well. The Bush-backed
resolution is expected to pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. proposal: The United States has drafted a tough resolution
that demands that Iraq allow inspectors anywhere on its territory and
authorizes military force if Iraq refuses. The draft is backed by
Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Status: The U.S. may agree to return to the Security Council for
authorization of military force if Iraq  blocks inspectors. But it
may reserve the right for a coalition to go ahead and strike if the
approval process bogs down or fails at the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   France's alternative: France wants two resolutions, one laying out
new instructions for the inspections and a second, if needed, dealing
with consequences of any Iraqi noncompliance. Russia will back the
French approach if the initial resolution clearly lists the criteria
Iraq must fulfill to have sanctions against it suspended.</TE>

<HD>3 Win Nobels in Chemistry for Molecular Studies</HD>
<DH>Award: Breakthroughs by a Swiss scientist, an American and
a Japanese have led to quicker cancer detection and drug development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Swiss chemist who works part time in La Jolla, a Japanese and an
American will share the 2002 Nobel Prize in chemistry for
"revolutionary breakthroughs" that are helping scientists determine
the complex structures of proteins and other large molecules that
play key roles in living organisms.</LD>
<LD>   The techniques they pioneered have led to quicker detection of
cancers, development of drugs for a variety of diseases and new ways
to monitor contamination of foods.</LD>
<LD>   "They are enablers, toolmakers who gave chemists better ways to
answer amazing questions about biological molecules," said chemist
Catherine C. Fenselau of the University of Maryland.</LD>
<TE>   John B. Fenn, 85, of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond,
and Koichi Tanaka, 43, of Shimadzu Corp. in Kyoto, Japan, will share
half of the estimated $1-million prize for developing techniques to
study large molecules by mass spectrometry.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Wuthrich, 64, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
Zurich and the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, will get the
other half for applying the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging to macromolecules.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka, an engineer, is one of the very few science winners in the
modern era who does not have a doctorate. He is the second Japanese
winner this year; Masatoshi Koshiba of the University of Tokyo
received the Nobel for physics Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Tokyo, Tanaka said he received a phone
call telling him to stand by for an important call, then a second
call with "someone talking to me in English. I thought I heard a
word, 'Nobel,' and 'Congratulations,' but I still had no idea what
they were talking about."</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't believe even now that I would win this kind of
prize," he said. "If I had known, I would have ... dressed in a suit
and tie, so I apologize for my attire."</TE>
<TE>   Fenn said that he was "sort of overwhelmed" by the prize. "It was
a bolt out of the blue. You can never expect these things, so I am
still in a state of shock."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Fenn said, "There's an awful lot of luck in
this. In fact, there's a lot of luck in science. To succeed as a
theorist, you have to be good. To succeed as an experimentalist, you
only have to be lucky. As an experimentalist, you go through life
kicking over a lot of stones and, if you're lucky, you'll find
something."</TE>
<TE>   In Zurich, Wuthrich said he was "delighted and surprised" with the
award.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad that such a prize is coming to Switzerland. At a time
when so much seems to be going wrong, this shows that certain things
also have gone right."</TE>
<TE>   Wuthrich works part of the year at Scripps and said he will use
some of the prize money to move his entire laboratory to La Jolla. He
will become a full-time faculty member there in 2004, when he will
face mandatory retirement in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year in a row that a Scripps researcher has
received the chemistry prize. Last year, K. Barry Sharpless was
awarded the chemistry Nobel for the development of new ways to
synthesize asymmetric molecules.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying biological molecules and determining their structures
long have been a major focus of biology. Identifying which proteins
and other large molecules are present in a cell gives powerful clues
to how the cell works, and determining the precise structure of such
macromolecules is necessary to determine how they carry out their
functions.</TE>
<TE>   The first useful method for determining protein structure was
X-ray crystallography, and several Nobels have been awarded for its
development and use. But crystallography is a laborious process, and
it doesn't necessarily reveal anything about a molecule's shape when
it is dissolved in a liquid--its natural habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging are
alternative ways to approach the problem. In mass spectrometry, a
molecule is vaporized and ionized in a magnetic field. The time the
ion takes to reach a detector reveals its mass, and the sizes of
fragments that also reach the detector reveal much data about the
original molecule's structure.</TE>
<TE>   Mass spectrometry long has been used for relatively small
molecules. In the mid-1980s, Fenn and Tanaka found ways to apply it
to much larger molecules. "We made elephants fly," Fenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Fenn dissolved the molecules in water, applied an electric current
and sprayed the solution into the mass spectrometer. As the water
evaporated, it left behind intact airborne proteins that were
suitably ionized. Tanaka achieved the same feat by shining a laser
beam on a small particle of the molecule to be studied.</TE>
<TE>   Mass spectrometry shows the size and chemical composition of the
molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance provides three-dimensional
structure. Like mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance was
routinely used for studying small molecules in solutions. Wuthrich
found a complex mathematical technique that allowed it to be applied
to large molecules as well. His approach was similar to that used for
magnetic resonance imaging in medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthroughs have proved extremely valuable for studying, for
example, how enzymes carry out chemical reactions. The shape of an
enzyme changes as it interacts with the chemicals it targets, and
nuclear magnetic resonance has made it possible for the first time to
determine both the before and after shapes.</TE>

<HD>The Twins' Most Valuable Bench Player</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Judge who ruled the game must go on in Minnesota
is hailed as team's savior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Judge Harry Seymour Crump, 64, avid snowboarder, member of a local
ski patrol, a man trained first as a pharmacist before becoming a
lawyer and then a judge, takes no credit for saving the Minnesota
Twins.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that's a bit of a stretch," he said Wednesday. "All I did
was get assigned a case and make a ruling I thought was the right way
to interpret the law."</LD>
<LD>   But on the streets of his city, where small children imitate Torii
Hunter's swing and old men gather to talk about Doug Mientkiewicz
being a throwback to a time when guys played more for fun than money,
Crump is known as every bit a hero.</LD>
<TE>   Without this soft-spoken great-grandfather, their beloved Twins
might be out of existence.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, baseball owners, in a move they said was made to
lessen the revenue drag that deadbeat franchises were having on the
rest of the league, voted to eliminate two teams. The Twins and
Montreal Expos were expected to be the ones on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Crump, a district court judge, who issued an injunction
forcing the Twins to honor their lease on the Hubert H. Humphrey
Metrodome, effectively thwarting baseball's plans.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Crump was poetic. He likened baseball to "turkey
and apple pie" and wrote of fathers taking sons to games, and of how
"the Twins brought the community together with Homer Hankies and
bobblehead dolls," referring to the white towels fans wave and the
popular player statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that local streets and avenues had been named after
Tony Oliva, Kirby Puckett, Harmon Killebrew, former Twins stars, and
that baseball is "a tradition that passes from generation to
generation, crosses social barriers and is a national pastime."</TE>
<TE>   And now, less than a year later, the once-sad-sack Twins are the
happy story of sports, a collection of young, unjaded, lesser-paid,
eager beavers who say they are just happy to be here--and mean it.</TE>
<TE>   Having been one step from obliteration, they are now just a short
hop from the World Series. They defeated the Anaheim Angels Tuesday
in Game 1 of the best-of-seven-games American League championship
series. The Angels won Wednesday's game, 9-6, and the series moves to
Anaheim for games Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   This metropolitan area, this state, this whole upper Midwest, has
become convinced the Twins are somehow fated to keep winning playoff
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from Rapid City, S.D.," Arnie Ribeault said. "And I'm
looking for tickets. I want to support this team now."</TE>
<TE>   "What was almost done to this team and their fans was just wrong,
and I'm happy Bud Selig has to show up here and eat some crow," he
said of baseball's commissioner. "I believe that God sends messages.
I think the Twins are a message."</TE>
<TE>   Such mystical talk doesn't impress everyone.</TE>
<TE>   A major league baseball attorney--he didn't want to be
identified--called Crump's ruling the conclusion of "the most
political case I've ever seen," and Roger Magnuson, an attorney who
represented the Twins and baseball in Crump's courtroom, called the
ruling "Homer Hanky jurisprudence."</TE>
<TE>   "The judge," Magnuson said, "is clearly a sports fan, a baseball
fan and a Twins fan, and maybe in inverse order."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, Crump says.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the game of baseball, but no more than some other sports,"
he said. "I am happy for the city that the Twins have done so well,
and I suppose I understand how some see this as fate or as deserved
after what happened. But none of that played any part in my ruling. I
ruled according to the law."</TE>
<TE>   Crump's ruling said the Twins had a valid lease that could not be
broken without causing irreparable harm to the lessor--the Metrodome.
His decision was upheld by the Minnesota Court of Appeals in January,
and in February, a day after the Minnesota Supreme Court refused to
hear baseball's case, the owners gave up on a plan to eliminate the
Twins and Expos in 2002. As part of baseball's August labor
agreement, no teams will be abandoned before 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," said an attorney who represented the Metropolitan
Sports Commission, which runs the Metrodome, "that Judge Crump's
ruling was the first tangible sign baseball owners got that the fans
and cities who have paid taxes and paid for stadiums for these teams
were not just going to roll over and be run over. I think baseball
was surprised at the ruling, and I think baseball was even more
surprised that the ruling was upheld."</TE>
<TE>   Crump, a licensed pilot and aerobatics performer, grew up in
Chicago and attended White Sox and Cubs games but never became an
avid supporter of either team.</TE>
<TE>   He has not attended a Twins game since his son Sean, 24, who had
helped Crump take underprivileged fathers and sons to Twins opening
games, was killed in a head-on car crash on Christmas Day 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I just haven't had it in me to go," Crump said. "But I do
understand about the deep feelings the game engenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking the other day about what I wrote in my opinion and
realized when I was speaking about children and parents that I had
forgotten another group. Do you know what the game means to senior
citizens? I see it all the time, in senior citizen homes, how the
Twins bring light into the day."</TE>
<TE>   Magnuson, the Twins' attorney, said there's a problem with the
judge's heartfelt emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't arguing for the Twins' demise," Magnuson said, "as much
as I was arguing for the Twins' legal right to take the money they
were being offered through contraction instead of continuing to lose
millions."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Shea, an attorney who represented the Metrodome, said that
Crump's ruling "was a key decision that legitimized the fight to keep
the team in Minneapolis."</TE>
<TE>   "When you go up against the power and strength of major league
baseball and the wealth and power of Twins ownership, you couldn't be
certain what would happen, what a judge would think," Shea said.
"Clearly, Judge Crump is a thoughtful man who understood both the law
and baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Crump studied engineering and physics at Wilson Junior College in
Illinois. He was urged by a professor to take a pharmacy course and
entered the pharmacy program at the University of Illinois Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   There, Crump took a course in pharmacy law and, after acing it,
decided law school was for him. In 1974, Crump graduated from DePaul
University School of Law, where he was on the dean's list.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Crump's ruling made him one of the most popular men
in Minneapolis, Kevin Kolosky, a 49-year-old Minneapolis attorney,
registered to challenge Crump for the judicial seat he has held for
18 years as a Hennepin County District court judge. The election is
scheduled for Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time," Kolosky said, "I evaluated who else there was to
challenge, and after deciding I had no chance of defeating the other
highly respected judges up for re-election and knowing I personally
disliked the ruling of Judge Crump, I chose to run against him."</TE>
<TE>   While Kolosky wouldn't say he would have ruled differently than
Crump, "I would have ruled strictly by the evidence, not by if I
wanted the Twins to be here or not," he said. "I have not seen where
the public good supersedes the law."</TE>
<TE>   But Kolosky also realizes, as he walks around downtown
Minneapolis; sees Homer Hankies in every window; sees posters and
T-shirts, hats and pennants: "There's no doubt in my mind I'll
probably lose this election because of the success of the Twins now
that they're in this postseason thing. A lot of people around here
are cognizant that the ruling stopped the Twins from going suddenly
downward toward a slippery slope."</TE>
<TE>   Kolosky has a good eye and a good ear.</TE>
<TE>   "I will always vote for Judge Crump from now on," said Harry
Alfredson, 58, a computer programmer. "For what Judge Crump did for
this community, everybody should vote for him to show their
appreciation.... I would like to hug Judge Crump and kick Bud Selig
in the rear end."</TE>
<TE>   Selig attended Game 1 of the AL championship series Tuesday night
and watched the Twins beat the Angels, 2-1. Selig stayed in the
background, never appearing where his face could be shown to the
fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything good or bad to say about Mr. Selig," Crump
said, "other than it was nice he could enjoy our city and our team.</TE>
<TE>   "And as for my decision, I made it the same way I make all my
decisions. I'm a religious person. Every morning I pray. I ask the
Lord for wisdom and courage to make the right thing happen. That's
what I did in this case. I thought about what was the right thing.
The state appellate court agreed with me.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told it was divine providence, the decision I made and
the Twins' success this year. About that, I don't know. I just know
the law."</TE>

<LD>The bulldozers are quiet once again along Culver Boulevard near the
Playa Vista project. Two state appellate judges ordered the developer
to halt road-widening to give the appeals court time to review a
lower court decision to let the work proceed.</LD>
<LD>   The action at least temporarily halted the work that had started
Monday after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to grant an
injunction to stop it. The injunction had been sought by a Sierra
Club wetlands task force in a suit against the California Coastal
Commission and Playa Vista.</LD>
<LD>   The bulldozers could remain out of action through the rainy
season. The appellate judges gave the two sides in the dispute until
Friday to explain their sides. Regardless of what the court decides,
the roadwork must cease Oct. 15, the state-designated start of the
rainy season.</LD>

<HD>D.A.'s Investigators Raid Office, Home in Probe of Film
Agency</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Officials seize records from EIDC's auditor and
the property manager for Cody Cluff's home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
raided two offices doing business with the embattled Entertainment
Industry Development Corp. and its president, Cody Cluff, Wednesday,
gathering more financial documents pertaining to the quasi-public
film permit agency, which has been under investigation by prosecutors
since last year.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities armed with search warrants seized home rental records
for Cluff's San Dimas residence from Traditional Realtors Property
Management in San Dimas and financial files from Sherman Oaks-based
Kellogg &amp; Andelson, which has performed annual EIDC audits for the
last four years.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Wall, vice president of Kellogg &amp; Andelson, said that "they
took all the records pertaining to the EIDC." Investigators left with
boxes of tax returns and other financial records from the offices
after appearing at 9 a.m. Wednesday, he said. Two hours earlier, Phil
Cimino, who operates Traditional Realtors out of his house, was
awakened by investigators pounding on his front door.</LD>
<TE>   "All of a sudden there were eight uniformed men and women running
into my house with their guns drawn," said Cimino, 64. " I'm not a
criminal and they treated me like I was. I could see it if I was a
drug dealer, but I'm just a property manager. I'm so shaken up."</TE>
<TE>   The searches were the second wave of raids conducted by the
district attorney's office in connection with its investigation of
the EIDC for alleged misuse of funds. On Sept. 5, investigators
searched the Hollywood offices of the EIDC, the San Dimas home of
Cluff and the Covina home of his estranged wife.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff receives an $1,800 monthly housing allowance as part of his
employment contract with the EIDC, which was formed in 1995 when city
and county officials decided to merge and privatize their film
permitting operations.</TE>
<TE>   Cimino said Cluff's rent in San Dimas is $1,800 a month. Officials
would not say why they were interested in the rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's lawyer, George Newhouse, said he had no idea why the
district attorney was interested in Cluff's rental papers.</TE>
<TE>   Cimino said the raid was intrusive. "They went into every cupboard
and every drawer. I asked them what they were there for and they just
waved a search warrant in front of my face," said Cimino. He said he
was interrogated for an hour before they showed him the second page
of the search warrant, which had Cluff's name on it.</TE>
<TE>   He then told investigators that Cluff's rental records were in a
second-floor office of his home. "I told them I'll get you the
documentation. They said no, we'll find it. I told them that I live
alone. They went upstairs with their guns drawn. I told them that I
have a dog with a heart condition and that the dog was up on the
bed."</TE>
<TE>   Cimino said that even after he gave investigators the Cluff file,
they continued their search. "They tore apart my office."</TE>
<TE>   David Guthman, director of the district attorney's bureau of fraud
and corruption prosecutions, acknowledged that guns were drawn in
accordance with office policy. He said that the home was not trashed
and that prosecutors have "before" and "after" photos to prove so. He
said records show that Cimino owns a firearm and that it is standard
procedure for investigators to take precautions.</TE>
<TE>   Cimino said, "I had to plead with them so I could take my
medication so I could settle down. I went to get it in the cabinet
and that's when they pulled my arm behind my back. They could have
just subpoenaed the files. They wanted to check everything ... and
for what? A lousy rental property."</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse called the search "an unacceptable abuse of law
enforcement power. You don't need to use a hand grenade when a fly
swatter will do."</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Seek to Sever Bombing Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense team says jurors will be prejudiced if two
JDL leaders are tried together for alleged plot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin said Wednesday
that jurors will be severely prejudiced if he is tried alongside his
longtime associate, Earl Krugel, on charges of conspiring to bomb a
mosque in Culver City and a congressman's field office in San Diego
County.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, Rubin's lawyers asked that
the defendants' Nov. 12 trial be severed.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin contends he had nothing to do with the alleged plot to bomb
the King Fahd mosque in Culver City and a field office of U.S. Rep.
Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), an Arab American, last year.</LD>
<TE>   Krugel's defense is that he was illegally entrapped by a former
league member turned government informer.</TE>
<TE>   To counter Krugel's entrapment claim, prosecutors are expected to
present evidence that he was involved in at least two previous
bombing plots.</TE>
<TE>   Any such evidence is likely to rub off on Rubin and prejudice him
in the eyes of a jury, defense attorneys Peter Morris and Bryan
Altman argued in their severance motion.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if this court gives the jury an instruction that the prior
bombing evidence is not to be considered against Rubin, the jury will
not be able to separate out the evidence," his lawyers asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's defense also contended that jurors will be prejudiced
during a joint trial because of the "many disgusting racial remarks"
that Krugel made during secretly recorded meetings with the
government informant, Danny Gillis.</TE>
<TE>   According to a partial transcript of one meeting, Krugel and
Gillis traded racist quips about Arabs and blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is especially unfair to Rubin, who did not make any racist
remarks in his conversations with Gillis," Rubin's attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Krugel's defense lawyer, Mark Werksman, asked U.S.
District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew to bar prosecutors from playing
offensive portions of the tapes because they could inflame the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Lew is scheduled to hear arguments on all pretrial motions Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Reached for comment Wednesday, defense attorney Morris denied that
the request to sever the case represents a falling out between the
two defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "This in no way represents a split between Irv Rubin and Earl
Krugel," Morris said. "The severance motion was made to protect Irv
Rubin's legal interests."</TE>
<TE>   Werksman said he believes a joint trial would be better for both
defendants "unless Irv Rubin is going to be unfairly disadvantaged
because of this evidence, which may come in against Earl but not
against Irv."</TE>
<TE>   He said the goal of both defense teams is to "prove that Earl
Krugel and Irv Rubin are innocent of these trumped-up, inflammatory
and overblown charges."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate motion Wednesday, Rubin's lawyers asked Lew to order
prosecutors to turn over records concerning FBI investigations into
the 1985 murder of Alex Odeh, director of the Arab American
Anti-Discrimination Committee's West Coast office in Santa Ana, and a
series of alleged death threats against Rubin in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin and other league members were subpoenaed to testify before a
federal grand jury investigating Odeh's slaying, which remains
unsolved. Rubin has publicly denied any involvement.</TE>
<TE>   His defense lawyers said they want the government's Odeh files to
show that the FBI was "out to get" Rubin because it could not
implicate him in the murder.</TE>
<TE>   They said they also intend to show that the government failed to
investigate credible and explicit death threats made against Rubin
over the telephone and through e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Records of both investigations are needed, they said, to prove the
government's "longtime bias" against Rubin. "This is one of the most,
if not the most, critical parts of Rubin's defense." they said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, 56, the Jewish Defense League's national director, and
Krugel, 59, the organization's West Coast coordinator, face sentences
of at least 40 years in prison if convicted. They have been held
without bail since their arrests last December.</TE>

<LD>   Hospital lawyers say that the decision would effectively take away
the hospital's ability to treat indigent psychiatric patients who are
covered by Medi-Cal.</LD>
<TE>   The county says that City of Angels discharged patients to an
unlicensed boardinghouse in the San Gabriel Valley. Five residents
there died earlier this year: Three suffered drug overdoses, and
drugs played a role in a fourth death, according to coroner's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   County mental health officials say that the hospital should have
known about the poor conditions at the unlicensed facility. The
hospital disputes that contention and maintains that patients have
the right to decide where to live when they are released.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected next week to consider the
proposed termination of City of Angels' contract.</TE>
<TE>   In August, in response to the same allegations, the Mental Health
Department stripped the hospital of its ability to detain and treat
mentally ill patients against their will.</TE>
<TE>   City of Angels has sued the county, but has so far been unable to
persuade a judge to overturn the sanction.</TE>
<TE>   The county's actions "are in total disregard for the needs of the
psychiatric patients and ignore the clear fact that these patients
will have no other immediate resource for treatment," hospital lawyer
Jill Curb said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   David Meyer, deputy director of the Mental Health Department,
said: "They can whine all they want, but that's not going to change
what they did and the danger it presents to people who can't care for
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the county has also sent a warning letter to Los
Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center because it also allegedly
discharged patients to the San Gabriel Valley home whose residents
died. The medical center was placed on probation for six months
related to its ability to keep mentally ill patients against their
will.</TE>
<TE>   The discipline meted out to Metropolitan was substantially lighter
than that imposed on City of Angels and Hollywood Community Hospital
of Van Nuys, which faced similar allegations. The Van Nuys facility
was also stripped of its ability to keep mentally ill patients
against their will, and it has also sued the county.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fighting the allegations, Los Angeles Metropolitan
agreed to change its practices. In August, the hospital agreed to the
county's demands and fired six employees who had done mental health
evaluations at the San Gabriel Valley boardinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   The firings reduced the staff of 12 clinicians by half, but the
medical center's chief executive, Marc Furstman, said they were
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that the conditions at these facilities were very,
very bad," he said. "If clinicians go out [to a facility] and notice
that conditions are not up to par, they are required to report that."</TE>
<TE>   Furstman said the hospital has a system in place in which
clinicians must fill out a form on every facility they visit to
determine if it's clean and safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you've got a situation where people are dying, it's a
very difficult situation for everybody," he said. "But ... we think
we've got a system in place now to try to keep this kind of thing
from happening in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Peck, one of the fired clinicians, said the terminations
amounted to scapegoating.</TE>
<TE>   "Our only crime is that at one time or another we happened to see
a patient at these facilities," Peck said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to do emergency psychiatric evaluations. We don't have
control over where we go; we don't discharge patients back into the
community," he said.</TE>

<HD>Musical Plumbing? Stereos Are Sure Getting Complicated
These Days ...</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aresident phoned police to accuse his neighbor of "piping music into
his plumbing," the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise said. Not sure I'd
mind that so much, as long as I received intermittent traffic reports
too.</LD>
<LD>   Related item? Oddly enough, I did just read an article about the
next generation of plumbing being developed in Japan: toilets that
will play music.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, I'm sure that the sign spotted by Bob Fenton of
Rancho Cucamonga at a restroom at the L.A. County Fair was
inadvertently placed there (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Not the shape of things to come: Time was when Southern California
boasted such sights as a flower shop in the shape of a flower pot, a
photo shop that resembled a camera, and an eatery in the shape of a
tamale.</TE>
<TE>   Imagination has given way to the almighty buck, though, and most
have disappeared in favor of boring-looking edifices. The latest
casualty is the nautically themed Shrimp House in Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant is for lease, reports columnist David Allen of the
Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, and it is uncertain whether a new
occupant would want to retain the motif, with its smokestack,
anchors, pilings, etc. (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of makes it hard to do a Chinese buffet," observed
leasing agent Carlos Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   But public-spirited Allen pointed out that it would be ideal for
another local business: Pizza Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand: Jerry Dixon of Torrance did come across an
executive suite that bore a remarkable resemblance to an SUV (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the traffic, it looked as though that employee stayed
late at the "ofice" that day.</TE>
<TE>   King for a night: Wayne Gretzky was saluted at a dinner the other
night, and the hockey Hall of Famer invited former Kings owner Bruce
McNall as his guest.</TE>
<TE>   McNall, who served almost four years in federal prison for
defrauding financial institutions of $236 million, came in for some
kidding from comedian Alan Thicke.</TE>
<TE>   Thicke told the Staples Center gathering that McNall was the "Lord
of Lompoc," adding, "What can you say about Bruce McNall that hasn't
already been said about Martha Stewart?"</TE>
<TE>   McNall, obviously relieved to be out of the federal penalty box,
thanked Gretzky for frequently visiting him in "in some pretty
terrible places."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like ... : I mentioned things that had been turned into
humans in classified ads: Chester Drawers, etc. Karla Butler of
Sherman Oaks saw a sign from someone wanting to adopt a cairn
terrier. But it was spelled "Karen Terrier."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: On the San Diego Freeway, I steered clear of a car
that no sane driver would tailgate. A sign in its rear window warned
"Caution--Raiders Fans Aboard."</TE>

<HD>Street Race Spectators Face Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cracking down on illegal street racing in the San Fernando Valley,
the Los Angeles City Council decided Wednesday to punish spectators
with harsh fines and possible jail time.</LD>
<LD>   The council also ordered a new law to be drafted that would allow
authorities to permanently confiscate any vehicle used in a street
race.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a long-standing problem. It has reached crisis
proportions," Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said after the 14-0 vote to
impose up to a $1,000 fine and up to six months in jail on any
spectator at an illegal speed contest.</LD>
<TE>   Council members believe if racers can't show off in front of their
friends, the sport's attraction will evaporate. "You're not going to
have the street racing if you don't have the spectators," Councilman
Dennis Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials report the sport has spawned a large
gambling operation in which spectators use the Internet to bet on
race outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said hundreds of races take place in her district every
week on Glenoaks Boulevard between Peoria and Sheldon streets in Sun
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Her motion to impose stiff penalties on spectators also directed
the city attorney to draft an ordinance allowing the confiscation and
forfeiture of any vehicle used in an illegal speed contest.</TE>
<TE>   Zine, a former Los Angeles police officer, said the drag-race
problem has plagued the Valley for years, popping up in new locales
when police raid illicit race strips.</TE>
<TE>   In August, dozens of law enforcement officers arrested more than
60 people, cited 98 spectators and impounded 92 vehicles in an
overnight sweep on Glenoaks Boulevard. The next day, all but three of
the autos were back on the street, Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a previous ordinance, watching an illegal race was an
infraction punishable by a $250 fine but no jail time. The new
ordinance raises the crime to a misdemeanor.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court commissioner refused to lower the $1-million bail
Wednesday for a former Roman Catholic priest accused of molesting
seven girls between 1947 and 1976.</LD>
<LD>   G. Neville Rucker, 82, appeared in a wheelchair in a downtown Los
Angeles courtroom to be arraigned on the charges, but the hearing was
postponed until Nov. 6. Commissioner Jeffrey M. Harkavy said he would
consider bail again next week once he had more information about the
former priest's finances.</LD>
<LD>   Rucker's attorney, Don Steier, said his client is not in good
health and is not a flight risk. "He's not fleeing too far, quite
frankly," he told the commissioner.</LD>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Suzanne Freeman said $1 million was an
appropriate bail "in light of the seriousness of the charges" and
that Rucker had enough money to take a 64-day cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker was arrested last month after his cruise ship was diverted
on the high seas to Alaska's Aleutian Islands. Prosecutors charged
Rucker with 23 counts of child molestation, alleging that he abused
seven girls while he worked at several churches in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   One of the alleged victims, Tammy Helm, said outside court that
she was thrilled bail was not reduced. "This man has been molesting
kids for over 40 years," she said, adding that now he is in jail,
"where he belongs."</TE>

<LD>El Capitan Ranch, one of the largest properties on the Gaviota coast,
is now a state park, according to the Trust for Public Lands.</LD>
<LD>   The 2,500-acre property, which rises from El Capitan State Beach
through oak woodlands and chaparral to the ridgelines of the Santa
Ynez Mountains, cost $9.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The state already owned about 3,000 acres at Gaviota State Park
and El Capitan and Refugio state beaches. The ranch is valued at
$12.5 million, but its former owners, Chuck Blitz of Santa Barbara
and Roger Himovitz of Montecito, agreed to make a contribution of
$2.5 million in land value. They will keep 650 acres.</LD>

<LD>The Tuolumne Band of Mewuk Indians plans to expand its rancheria in
the Sierra Nevada and build a new casino.</LD>
<LD>   In March, the tribe bought a 350-acre site formerly owned by the
West Side Lumber Co. The tribe plans a 121-lot residential
development with an 18-hole golf course, hotel and conference center
and other businesses for the parcel.</LD>
<LD>   An official said the development will allow Mewuks who are
eligible to live there, or those forced to leave as adults, to have a
home. The 300-acre rancheria north of Tuolumne City has 160 residents
living in about 45 homes.</LD>

<HD>Teach-In Tackles Threat of War</HD>
<DH>Education: Many of the 300 attending the Valley College
event oppose a U.S.-led attack against Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The message coming out of a Wednesday teach-in discussion at Valley
College on the possible use of U.S. military force against Iraq was
unmistakably clear: War is not the answer.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 students and faculty members gathered on the Valley Glen
campus for a wide-ranging discussion on the Bush administration's
effort to win foreign and domestic support for its plan to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and to force the removal of suspected
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Leon Marzillier, president of the college's faculty association,
convened the teach-in to give students and faculty members the
opportunity to discuss the prospect of another war in the Persian
Gulf and its potential impact on the nation and world. He was joined
on the panel by history teacher Farrell Broslowsky and Associated
Student Union President Samy Kbushyan.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the 90-minute session, however, it was clear that
all of the panelists as well as several audience members were
strongly opposed to a U.S.-led military strike.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, when we were worried about the prospects of war in
the Persian Gulf ... we were concerned about the fallout from that
war," Broslowsky said. "I think that is what we are facing right
now." Broslowsky challenged the audience to question elected
officials about the timing and reasons for an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the rationale for going to war now? What is the
underlying policy? What is the potential fallout from this war? Why
just before an election do we have to go to war?" Broslowsky asked.
"On no level do I see a convincing case that this country should go
to war now or in the foreseeable month ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Marzillier, who said he was speaking for himself and not for
faculty members, said the Bush administration was using a potential
war with Iraq to divert attention from such domestic issues as
corporate scandals, unemployment, health care, education and a
flagging economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's oil, it's personal and it's a shield to take our focus off
failed domestic policies," Marzillier said. "The pipedream that we
can get rid of Saddam and bring democracy to Iraq is just that--a
pipedream."</TE>
<TE>   Student Glen Burns, a supporter of Bush's plan, said military
intervention could prevent Hussein from building an arsenal of
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. "I don't like war," he
said, "but I believe we have to do something, and do it soon."</TE>
<TE>   Another student, Cecil Ingram, said he was concerned about
casualties. "Guess who's going to be on the front lines if we go to
war?" he asked. "It's not going to be the Bush family, the Cheney
family or the Condoleezza Rice family. It's going to be brown and
black and poor whites who will be fighting for something they don't
understand."</TE>
<TE>   Karapet Torossian, treasurer of the Associated Student Union,
tried to inject humor into the discussion by explaining why he didn't
want the draft to be reinstated. "I don't want to go to Canada,
because it's cold," he said.</TE>

<HD>'Deficiencies' Cited in L.A.'s Terrorism Fight</HD>
<DH>Safety: Councilman's report says city should boost its
preparedness with more personnel, training and equipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With so many potential targets and the nation's second-largest
population, the city of Los Angeles must quickly increase emergency
personnel, training and equipment to counter the threat of terrorism,
according to a detailed report to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-page report, prepared by Los Angeles Councilman Jack Weiss,
offers a variety of recommendations to address the "deficiencies" in
the city's anti-terrorism preparedness.</LD>
<LD>   Those deficiencies, the report states, range from inadequate
funding for counterterrorism experts to the Fire Department's use of
radiation detectors from Civil Defense kits dating from the 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess the central message is that while it is true we are more
prepared to fight terrorism than we were a year ago, serious
deficiencies remain," Weiss said Wednesday. "But these deficiencies
can be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, a member of the council's Public Safety Committee, said the
report was compiled by his staff and based on interviews with city
departments and outside experts to assess L.A.'s ability to prevent
or respond to a terrorist incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, ... officials
responsible for public safety in the Los Angeles area must address a
new threat environment, in which terrorists and criminals may strike
with the sole purpose of creating terror and attacking our way of
life," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the communications problems in New York City that arose
between police and fire officials responding to the attacks on the
World Trade Center, the report said Los Angeles must ensure that its
officers and firefighters have compatible radio equipment as well as
transmission towers for providing instant communications with
personnel from other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   With $120 million already approved by voters for a new Emergency
Operations Center, the report said, better communications are crucial
to the city's ability to respond to acts of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the report said, Los Angeles must significantly increase
staffing to provide a more efficient command structure as well as
emergency personnel versed in anti-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, it recommends nearly doubling the Los Angeles Police
Department's Anti-Terrorist Division by adding 30 officers dedicated
to full-time surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   The report also suggests following New York City's lead in
recruiting a national counterterrorism expert as well as hiring a new
city director of homeland security to oversee the local response to
anti-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Among its other recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Dramatically increase city spending to support the countywide
Terrorism Early Warning Group to analyze terrorist threats in the
region and coordinate plans for a response. Last year, the report
said, total funding for the early warning agency was $1.8 million,
while the cost to adequately staff, equip and train the personnel
would require about $12 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Expand the training of police and fire personnel who would be
the first to respond in the event of a terrorist attack involving
bombs or biological, chemical or radioactive weapons. While the Fire
Department has one new hazardous materials team and the LAPD bomb
squad has better equipment, the report said the city still needs to
upgrade its radiation-detection equipment with at least one new
detection system at each of the department's nearly 100 stations.</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the city's coordination with the private sector,
colleges and citizens' groups to take advantage of their expertise
and ability to respond to disasters. UCLA's team of 20
radiation-safety experts, for instance, could be given emergency
credentials that would permit the experts to enter LAPD crime scenes
in the event of a "dirty bomb" attack.</TE>
<TE>   The report does not offer a specific price tag for improving the
city's anti-terrorism efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said that was by design because the recommendations are a
starting point for discussions by city lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a road map for a collaborative process between elected
officials" and city departments, said Weiss, who will unveil the
report today with other city officials.</TE>

<HD>Local Dockworkers Return to Big Backlog</HD>
<DH>Port of Hueneme: Union says it was overwhelmed by the
number of orders it received. Shifts of longshoremen were expected to
work through the night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longshoremen returning to work Wednesday evening at the Port of
Hueneme faced piles of work orders, as cargo shippers began to
recover from the 10-day lockout that had stalled activity at ports
along the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Reactions to the reopening of the port and the ongoing labor
dispute between the longshoremen and their employers, Pacific
Maritime Assn., were mixed. Union members worried that an emergency
order forcing them back to work could weaken the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union's stance when bargaining resumes
Wednesday in San Francisco, while management and shippers expressed
relief that the order might ease the bottleneck at the Port of
Hueneme.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Carlton, president of Local 46, said the union was
overwhelmed with the number of work orders it received Wednesday
afternoon. A peak night shift could require 60 to 80 workers, but
Carlton said he had received work orders for more than twice that
many workers by the 3 p.m. deadline.</LD>
<TE>   "We only have a certain number of people," he said. "We'll try to
field as much as we can, but we won't be able to fill them all." He
expected to have shifts working throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Maritime Assn. locked out the longshoremen Sept. 29,
saying the union members were intentionally slowing the movement of
cargo. Union workers denied the accusations and said the delays were
the result of heavier workloads and increased efforts to adhere to
safety procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's court order specifies that ILWU members must resume work
at a "normal and reasonable rate of speed." Carlton said union
members have no intention of disrupting the work flow. "We'll work at
our normal pace," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the lockout did not affect the Port of Hueneme to the degree
it did ports in Long Beach and Los Angeles, economic analysts
estimated it had cost Ventura County business millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Sunkist, one of the Port of Hueneme's leading
exporters, estimated its growers were losing nearly $2 million each
week they were unable to export their citrus crops. That figure could
rise dramatically if growers are prevented from shipping during the
navel orange season, which begins next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're delighted that we're going to be able to start exporting
again soon," Sunkist spokeswoman Claire Smith said. "But we're still
concerned that [the contract] is not settled. We'd like to see this
thing over now and settled permanently."</TE>
<TE>   Others said they hoped an 80-day cooling-off period would give the
two sides time to reach a compromise, without continuing the lockout
and further damaging the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that it's important, number one, for people to get back
to work, and number two, for the economy to not be stalled," said Jim
Kilpatrick, vice president of marketing and development for Pacific
Vehicle Processors.</TE>
<TE>   The company was prevented from unloading a shipment of import cars
bound for a processing plant when the Port of Hueneme lockout began.
Kilpatrick said the move forced the company to temporarily lay off
some employees and divert a separate vehicle shipment to Tacoma,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been slowed down significantly," he said. "And the
dockworkers [here] have lost a lot of work because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone cheered the decision to reopen the port.</TE>
<TE>   Union supporters said they feared the court injunction would limit
the ILWU's bargaining power and give the Pacific Maritime Assn. an
edge in the labor dispute, which hinges on introduction of technology
that could eliminate some union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an anti-union situation, and it makes the playing
field uneven," said Barry Hammitt, president of Service Employees
International Union, Local 998, which represents wharf workers not
included in the longshoremen's union.</TE>

<HD>He Can Give 99 Reasons for Not Liking Gretzky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am sitting at a hockey game while the Angels are in Minnesota for a
huge baseball game because the sports editor says I cover hockey like
no one else.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have advanced in the playoffs for the first time in
their 42-year history, and I am sitting at a hockey game to honor
Wayne Gretzky, and I despise Wayne Gretzky.</LD>
<LD>   I have already paid $2 more for parking because Staples Center is
in the business of being greedy, which must really rankle Gretzky
because the guy who built Staples got rid of Gretzky for being too
greedy.</LD>
<TE>   I wouldn't be surprised if Staples officials charged Gretzky to
park on his own night at the arena, and I've got no problem with
that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW EVERYONE is pretty much in agreement the sport of hockey in
the U.S. expanded because Gretzky came to L.A., and they're honoring
him for that?</TE>
<TE>   We've got Wayne Gretzky to thank for giving us the Mighty Ducks?</TE>
<TE>   Do you think some day the members at Augusta National are going to
put Martha Burk's picture on the wall of the men's grill to thank her
for expanding their membership?</TE>
<TE>   I curse the day Gretzky cleared customs and came here to save
hockey. No one wants hockey here except for the people who believe
you need to wear a hideous sweater in L.A. Even the people who go to
the games aren't happy; they were booing the hockey commissioner when
he took the ice. Gary Bettman told the crowd that Gretzky proved a
nontraditional, warm-weather city such as L.A. could support hockey,
and I know that's why I was booing.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. never had a chance once Gretzky arrived. That's what makes
the skinny twig so infuriating. He not only takes one of our more
attractive actresses off the free market (and brainwashes her into
cheering for Canada to beat our guys in the Olympics), but because
he's so dominant in a sport that seems incapable of being dominated,
he's compelling to watch. (So is she, so cheering for Canada, I
guess, isn't that bad.)</TE>
<TE>   "When I came to L.A.," Gretzky said this week, "the team had
finished second to last in the NHL that year and was drawing 6,000
people a game."</TE>
<TE>   If Gretzky doesn't show up in L.A., hockey probably shrivels up
and disappears like the XFL. And I'm in Minnesota writing about
baseball, or better yet--in Denver covering a Galaxy playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M HAPPY, of course, they retired Gretzky's sweater, ruling out
his return. But I wonder about an organization that has retired four
jerseys while making it to the Stanley Cup finals once, while the
Lakers have nine trophies, and have retired the jerseys of only seven
players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE PHOENIX something-or-others played the Kings, and some guy was
singing "O Canada," and I think you've got to blame Gretzky for that
too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EACH PLAYER wore Gretzky's No. 99 sweater on the ice briefly,
added his own autograph to Gretzky's, and then the sweaters were
available for the hideous-sweater crowd in a silent auction. Each
sweater had a starting bid, so it was easy to tell who the Kings
really value with Felix Potvin, Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam
Deadmarsh going for at least $3,000 each. Bryan Smolinski has fallen
so far, though, he was going for $1,000 with Alexander Frolov, who
was playing his first game for the Kings, going for $1,250.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW HERE'S a shock. It was 0-0 after the first period of NHL
action this season in Staples Center. The Queen of England dropped a
ceremonial puck to start a game Sunday and left after the first
period. I can't imagine the queen doing anything improper, so I
followed her example.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DIDN'T receive an invitation, but I heard a tape recording of
Tim LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke speaking at a soccer media function
Wednesday at the Beverly Hilton, and in addition to distorting the
truth, the guy knows how to get a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, who works as billionaire Philip Anschutz's mouthpiece at
Staples, said for 23 years the media have been telling him soccer
will never make it in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to make it," he said. "The sportswriters and
columnists out there that refuse to acknowledge it are going to have
to wake up one day and learn it or they're not going to have anybody
read their column anymore."</TE>
<TE>   LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke then told the crowd that "my favorite
columnist [is] T.J. Simers," and witnesses said his nose grew. He
then told everyone that I would never accept the Anschutz empire's
ability to own an NFL team "until Phil could sit down and explain why
he invested in soccer."</TE>
<TE>   I never said any such thing, of course, because if I were given a
chance to sit down with Phil, I'd be interested in knowing only why
Qwest's stock has plummeted under his leadership. I already know why
he invested in soccer; he told me five or six years ago when we last
talked. He said his kids played soccer, and he saw a bright future
for the sport, and I should have known then what was in store for
Qwest.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's news for T.J.," Leiweke told the crowd. "In about 20
years, I predict that professional soccer will be the second most
popular professional sport in this country." Remember, whatever Phil
thinks, Leiweke</TE>
<TE>   says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RECEIVED e-mail from "N.G. of the Glendale YMCA Quarterback
Club," who wanted to know: "Are you sure George Costanza isn't from
UCLA? The photo that was above your column showed him practicing his
placekicking from a handicapped parking zone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ben:</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching at USC? Could Jason Alexander sink any lower?"</TE>
<TE>   Didn't see him at the Kings' game.</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   Darin Erstad's first-inning homer. It was important for the Angels
to get off to a fast start for two reasons: It quieted the Metrodome
crowd and it enabled high-strung Ramon Ortiz to relax a little on the
mound. Ortiz pitched well Wednesday, and giving him a quick lead was
a big reason why.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   The one drawback to the Angel victory was Tim Salmon's hamstring
injury. Salmon is a big part of the Angels' success this season, and
if he has to sit out a couple of games, it will throw the offense out
of sync. Even if he can play, a tight hamstring could make him
tentative at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN THE BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   When Troy Glaus led off the second inning with a single, it marked
the first time in this series that an Angel had reached base to lead
off an inning. It's no coincidence that they scored three runs in the
second, giving them a 4-0 lead and putting them in command of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey, already named to start Game 4, was warming up in the
Angel bullpen in the seventh inning. He simply might have been
throwing between starts, but the seventh inning is an unusual time to
do that. Is Mike Scioscia thinking of bringing Kevin Appier back to
start Game 4 on three days' rest?</TE>

<HD>Salmon Might Be Out for Game 3</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Angel outfielder Tim Salmon is unlikely to play Friday, when the
American League championship series resumes in Anaheim, after leaving
Wednesday's game because of tightness in his right hamstring.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, administered a
cortisone injection Wednesday night to combat inflammation in the
leg. The recovery period from such an injection is typically 48
hours, and Yocum said the chance was slim that Salmon could recover
in time for Friday's game.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon said he first felt a "grab" in the hamstring while chasing
down a fly ball hit by Minnesota's Jacque Jones in the first inning
and felt it again while running down a fly ball hit by Torii Hunter
in the second inning. Salmon said he told no one except center
fielder Darin Erstad, hoping the discomfort would go away.</LD>
<TE>   When Salmon ran gingerly down the first base line in the third
inning, as he flied out, Erstad told trainer Ned Bergert about the
injury. The Angels, with a 4-0 lead, promptly removed Salmon, wanting
to ensure he would not rupture the hamstring and miss the rest of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Said Erstad: "I couldn't care for anybody more than Tim. I want
him for the rest of the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Without that lead, Salmon said, "I probably would have argued
more, and it might have been the first time all year I won the
argument."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The kid in the wheelchair does not speak, but he does smile. Say
the name of his favorite player, the Angels' Dennis Cook, and watch
the kid's eyes light up. The kid holds out his left arm at an awkward
angle too, his way of sharing that his friend Dennis has an injury to
his left arm. Nate Halsa, 5, was born with cerebral palsy.</TE>
<TE>   In June, when the Angels played here, he and his father watched
two games from the disabled seating section near the visiting
bullpen. Cook chatted with Nate the first day, then brought him a cap
autographed by the Angels the next day. Nate's father asked if Cook
would stand next to the railing and take a picture with his son; Cook
invited Nate onto the field after the game and posed with him there.</TE>
<TE>   "It made his whole weekend," said Nate's father, Mike. "It's a
small thing for Dennis to do, but it's a big thing for Nate."</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota kid and the Angel pitcher have stayed in touch. Mike
Halsa sent Cook a copy of the picture, which the pitcher still keeps.
Before Tuesday's first game of the championship series between the
Angels and the Twins, the kid and the pitcher caught up, friends
sharing a few moments near the visiting dugout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uh-oh: Angel coaches Mickey Hatcher and Joe Maddon were sitting on
the bench before Wednesday's game, discussing the four-hitter thrown
Tuesday by Minnesota pitcher Joe Mays.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time a pitcher goes out there and throws a lot of off-speed
pitches for strikes, especially a changeup, we have a tough time,"
said Hatcher, the Angel batting coach.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Mays, the coaches were asked, which American League
pitcher has a good changeup? The answer: Brad Radke.</TE>
<TE>   Radke, scheduled to start Game 4 Saturday for the Twins, is 11-4
with a 1.72 earned-run average overall against the Angels. Mays is
scheduled to start Game 5 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry, who sold the Angels to Disney in 1996, said she is
not interested in buying the team back, either by herself or as a
minority investor in a partnership. She said she has rebuffed
"several people" who invited her to join in a potential ownership
group and said she is not willing to invest money in the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   She said the baseball business is a bad one and that she had
recently talked someone out of investing in a major league franchise.
Disney has hired an investment bank to find a buyer for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said he had not ruled out bringing back ace
Jarrod Washburn on three days' rest to start a possible Game 6.</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 0--David Eckstein grounded to the pitcher.
Darin Erstad homered to right. That quieted the Metrodome crowd. Too
bad it didn't quiet Steve Lyons. Tim Salmon flied to center. Garret
Anderson grounded to second. Anderson jogged to first base. Didn't he
learn his lesson in the Yankee series? One run, one hit, none left.</LD>
<LD>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 0--Tim Salmon made a nice running catch on
Jacque Jones' fly ball to right. Cristian Guzman grounded to first.
Corey Koskie walked. David Ortiz, professional hitter, grounded to
second. No runs, no hits, one left.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Troy Glaus singled to right. Brad
Fullmer doubled to right-center, Glaus to third. Scott Spiezio hit a
high pop down the right-field line for a double that landed fair just
in front of Michael Cuddyer and bounced over his head. How about that
Metrodome turf? Glaus scored, Fullmer stopped at third. Bengie Molina
flied to shallow right, the runners holding. Adam Kennedy grounded to
the pitcher, Fullmer was tagged out in a rundown between third and
home. Spiezio took third. Kennedy was picked off first and caught in
a rundown, but first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz threw home to try to
get Spiezio, who was safe, his knee knocking the ball out of the
catcher's glove. Kennedy took third on the play. Eckstein singled to
right, Kennedy scoring. Erstad flied to center. Three runs, four
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Salmon made another nice running catch
on Torii Hunter's fly to right. Mientkiewicz grounded to first.
Cuddyer hit a grounder to the hole between short and third. Eckstein
almost dislocated his shoulder trying to throw him out, but Cuddyer
was safe at first. A.J. Pierzynski struck out swinging. No runs, one
hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Salmon flied to right, but he pulled a
hamstring running it out and would leave the game. Anderson flied to
center. Glaus grounded to short. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Orlando Palmeiro in right field. Luis
Rivas singled up the middle. Rivas was picked off first. Swiper no
swiping! Swiper no swiping! Jones struck out swinging. Guzman hit a
slow bleeder to third that Glaus was unable to come up with. Koskie
hit a shot to first, but Spiezio made a nice diving grab and ran to
first for the out. No runs, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Fullmer grounded to first. Spiezio
lined a single to center. With Spiezio going on the pitch, Molina
grounded to short, Spiezio to second. Kennedy flied to right. No
runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Ortiz singled to right. Hunter grounded
into a 6-4-3 double play. Mientkiewicz (Vanna White's favorite
player) singled to center. Cuddyer flied to center. No runs, two
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Twins 0--It all makes sense now. "24" is not
only the name of the show starring Kiefer Sutherland, it's also the
number of times per inning that Fox shows commercials for it.
Eckstein flied to right. Erstad flied to center. Palmeiro flied to
left. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 4, Twins 0--Pierzynski singled to center. Rivas
grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Jones grounded to first. No runs,
no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 6, Twins 0--Anderson grounded to second, Rivas
making a nice jump and throw to beat Anderson by a step. Anderson was
running hard on this play. Judging by the Fox "Sounds of the Game,"
Angel pitching coach Bud Black doesn't know the name of his own
pitchers. He refers to everyone as "Hey!" Glaus tripled to right.
Right fielder Cuddyer makes Billy Ashley look graceful. Fullmer
homered to right-center. Metrodome fans are booing. They should be
happy they have a team. Johan Santana pitching. Spiezio flied to
right. Molina struck out swinging but reached first when the ball got

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels won beneath the big top.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the Metrodome, where the grass is fake and the noise level
exceeds inhuman, the Minnesota Twins are an extraordinary team.
Outside, the Twins are by definition an ordinary team.</LD>
<LD>   So the Angels took a huge step toward the World Series on
Wednesday, neutralizing the Twins' dome-field advantage with a 6-3
victory in the second game of the American League championship
series.</LD>
<TE>   With home runs from Darin Erstad and Brad Fullmer and some
high-octane relief pitching, the Angels flew home happy, with a split
in the first two games of the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really buy into home-field advantage," said Angel pitcher
Jarrod Washburn, who will start Game 3 Friday. "But if there is a
home-field advantage, these guys have it. They're used to playing on
this joke of a field and dealing with the roof and turf and all those
things.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big to come out of here with one."</TE>
<TE>   It's a best-of-five series now, with the next three games in
Anaheim. Sweep at home, and the Angels are done with the dome. The
home-field advantage belongs to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be taken right back," Erstad said. "We'll probably have to
win another one here. But this was definitely a very important game."</TE>
<TE>   And a weird one. Gov. Jesse Ventura sang "Take Me Out to the
Ballgame," dedicating it to Bud Selig. The video board displayed a
picture of former Angel and Twin pitcher Bert Blyleven next to a
picture of Bert from "Sesame Street."</TE>
<TE>   A record crowd of 55,990 stood, and hollered themselves hoarse,
and waved their "Homer Hankies" to no end.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wobbled, but they did not fall. They took a 6-0 lead in
the top of the sixth inning; they were biting their nails in the
bottom of the inning. Ramon Ortiz carried that shutout into the
bottom of the inning. He got one more out, but the Twins got three
runs, and the bullpen preserved his victory from there.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly got two outs, one by strikeout. Francisco
Rodriguez got five outs, three by strikeout. Closer Troy Percival got
four outs--three by strikeout--and the save. He retired the side in
order in the ninth inning, no surprise against the Twins. In 34
career appearances against Minnesota, he never has given up an earned
run.</TE>
<TE>   Although the save was recorded in the ninth inning, it was earned
in the eighth. With two on and two out and the tying run at the
plate, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia summoned Percival to replace
Rodriguez, veteran heat replacing rookie heat. Percival won, without
heat.</TE>
<TE>   The batter was a pinch-hitter, Bobby Kielty, an old friend from
Riverside. Kielty's father was one of Percival's teachers at Moreno
Valley High. Kielty took a 97-mph fastball and a 98-mph fastball,
fouled off a 97-mph fastball and a 98-mph fastball. Percival then
caught him looking at a changeup, clocked at 86 mph, for strike
three.</TE>
<TE>   Percival throws a changeup about as often as the fans here shut
up.</TE>
<TE>   "Changeup, split, forkball, whatever you want to call it,"
Percival said. "Depends on my grip. I make it up every time."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got four hits in nine innings Tuesday. They got five in
the first two innings Wednesday. Erstad homered in the first inning.
The Angels scored three runs in the second, and Fullmer added a
two-run homer in the sixth. Amid all the weirdness off the field, a
weird play on the field suggested this would be the Angels' night.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels up 1-0, Troy Glaus singled to start the second
inning, and Fullmer doubled him to third. Scott Spiezio dropped a
double inches inside the right-field line, so close to being caught
that Fullmer had to stay close to second base and could only reach
third on the double. Bengie Molina flied out, too shallow for Fullmer
to tag and score. Adam Kennedy grounded out, but Fullmer was running
on contact and thrown out at home.</TE>
<TE>   With Spiezio at third and Kennedy at first, Minnesota pitcher Rick
Reed tried the old fake-to-third, throw-to-first play. You know, the
one that never works. It worked. Kennedy had broken for second base
on a steal attempt, so the Twins had him in a rundown. Spiezio broke
for home, and so the Twins threw home. Spiezio, who appeared to be
dead at home plate, did not bother sliding. But Spiezio knocked the
ball away from catcher A.J. Pierzynski and he was safe.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had botched the play, and they still had scored. They
would score again too, on a single by David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel good about that," said outfielder Tim Salmon, who left
in the third inning because of a tight hamstring. "You feel good
about the fact that you made a mistake and still have it turn out
good."</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the big top, weird things can happen. Even this: The other
Troy pumped his fist. Third baseman Troy Glaus, usually stoic on the
field, pumped his fist after an important strikeout in the sixth
inning. Percival, who usually pumps his fist after every save, did
not do so this time.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, the final score was satisfaction enough. The series
is tied, the Homer Hankies have been put away, and here come the
thunder sticks and the Rally Monkey.</TE>

<TE>   Triple Play</TE>
<TE>   The Angels return home for Games 3, 4 and 5 with a chance to win
the ALCS with a sweep. Since the league championship series expanded
to seven games in 1985, only four teams have swept Games 3, 4 and 5,
and two of those sweeps were by the visiting team. A look:</TE>

<HD>Change of Pace by Percival Leaves Twins Crossed Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Trevor Hoffman has the changeup that seems to come equipped with a
rip chord and parachute. Robb Nen has the nasty forkball that looks
like a thigh-high fastball before it nose-dives into the dirt.</LD>
<LD>   And Angel closer Troy Percival has ... hmm, just what exactly was
that off-speed pitch he used to strike out pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty
looking with runners on first and third to snuff out an eighth-inning
threat Wednesday night?</LD>
<LD>   "It was a changeup, a split-fingered fastball, a forkball,
whatever you want to call it," said Percival, who went on to retire
the side in order in the ninth to save the Angels' 6-3 victory over
the Minnesota Twins in Game 2 of the American League championship
series. "It was an invented pitch, I guess.... I make it up every
time."</LD>
<TE>   This has been an ongoing challenge for Percival since he broke
into the big leagues as a flame-throwing set-up man in 1995: What can
he use as a second and third pitch to go with his 98-mph fastball?</TE>
<TE>   One spring, he was determined to perfect a curveball. The next
spring, it was the slider. One spring he dabbled with a
split-fingered fastball. The changeup has been an ongoing project.</TE>
<TE>   But whenever Percival got into a tense game situation, which is
pretty much every time he pitches, he'd usually scrap all those
experimental pitches and go with what he knows best: the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day last spring, Percival was toying around with a new
pitch in the bullpen. Pitching Coach Bud Black showed him a new grip
for an off-speed delivery, and Percival seemed to get more movement
on it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a fluke, really," Percival said. "I kept throwing
it until it felt comfortable. I'd try to mix it in when we had a big
enough lead to work with, and there weren't many opportunities, but I
feel comfortable with it now."</TE>
<TE>   Percival couldn't have picked a better spot to throw one of his
better off-speed pitches of the season. Set-up man Francisco
Rodriguez made a little mess of the eighth inning, walking Torii
Hunter with two out and giving up a single to Doug Mientkiewicz,
which moved Hunter to third.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia took a leisurely walk to the mound,
giving Percival time for a few extra warm-up pitches, and was faced
with almost the exact same decision that led him to be second-guessed
from coast to coast in Game 1 of the division series against the New
York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   With two on and two out in the eighth inning and the Angels
clinging to a 5-4 lead that night in Yankee Stadium, Scioscia
declined to use Percival in the eighth. Scott Schoeneweis gave up a
game-tying single to Jason Giambi and Brendan Donnelly gave up a
game-winning three-run homer to Bernie Williams.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Scioscia summoned his closer, the sixth time this
season he has gone to Percival in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was match-ups," Scioscia said. "Our preference is to keep
Percy for the ninth, but Rodriguez was approaching 30 pitches, and
Donnelly was out of the game. I thought the best match-up with Kielty
was Percival."</TE>
<TE>   Kielty fouled off several 96-mph fastballs before Percival caught
him looking with an 86-mph pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was gearing up for a fastball, and it looked like a straight
changeup," Kielty said. "It was inside. If it was a strike, I would
have swung at it, but [umpire Mike Everitt] was calling that pitch
the whole night, so there was nothing I could do."</TE>
<TE>   Percival retired A.J. Pierzynski on a grounder to short and struck
out Dustan Mohr and Jacque Jones in the ninth. The right-hander has
pitched 36 1/3 innings in his career without allowing an earned run
to the Twins, limiting them to three singles in 34 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love throwing in this dome," Percival said. "They have one
of the better mounds in the league--it really holds together well. A
lot of outdoor mounds break up by the ninth inning, but this one,
it's like you're pitching in the first inning when you get out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Though shoulder and elbow problems periodically sapped him of arm
strength over the years, Percival, 33, still has one of baseball's
best fastballs. It has always been his best pitch, and if he's going
to get beat, he wants it to be with his best pitch.</TE>

<HD>Trammell Is Hired to Manage Tigers</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Tigers hired former star shortstop Alan Trammell as
manager Wednesday, hoping he can turn around a franchise that has
endured nine consecutive losing seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit was 55-106 last season--tying Tampa Bay for the worst
record in the majors--and hasn't had a winning record since 1993,
during the latter part of Trammell's stellar career as a shortstop in
Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a day that I'm very proud of," Trammell said. "There's
certain areas that I know we can be better on quickly, that's my
goal, that's my job."</LD>
<TE>   Trammell, 44, replaces Luis Pujols, who was fired Sept. 30. Pujols
lost 100 games after replacing Phil Garner, who was fired in April
after an 0-6 start.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell, Detroit's fifth manager since Sparky Anderson's
17-season tenure ended in 1995, was San Diego's first base coach the
last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell batted .285 with 185 homers and 1,003 runs batted in as
Detroit's shortstop from 1977-96.</TE>
<TE>   The six-time All-Star won four gold gloves and was the World
Series most valuable player in 1984 when the Tigers won their fourth
and last championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Indian second baseman Ricky Gutierrez, 32, underwent
neck surgery that doctors hope will allow him to play again.</TE>
<TE>   Despite suffering what was later diagnosed as a career-threatening
injury in the first week of the season while diving for a grounder,
Gutierrez didn't tell the Indians he was hurt until August. He spent
the final 1 1/2 months on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians said Gutierrez had the surgery Monday at Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pat Gillick, 65, said he will return next season as Seattle's
executive vice president and general manager, ending speculation that
he planned to retire or move to another team.</TE>

non-throwing shoulder in last week's 41-38 six-overtime victory over
Arkansas.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Fulmer nor team officials have described Clausen's injury,
only saying he was probable for Saturday when No. 10 Tennessee
travels to No. 6 Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   When asked if Clausen's shoulder was broken, sprained or bruised,
Fulmer said, "He's got a sore shoulder," and wouldn't elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The Knoxville News-Sentinel and The Tennessean in Nashville
reported that sources said Clausen has a hairline fracture in his
clavicle, or collarbone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Motor Speedway General Manager Eddie Gossage said he would
like to talk to Texas and Oklahoma officials about the possibility of
moving the annual Big 12 Conference grudge match to the racing
facility in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Gossage believes the front stretch of the 1 1/2-mile track could
be configured to comfortably seat 125,000-150,000 spectators with the
playing field set up on the track's grass infield.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Athletic Director Joe Castiglione and Texas counterpart
DeLoss Dodds told the Dallas Morning News they would be willing to
consider a proposal from TMS.</TE>
<TE>   The contract the schools have to play their game at the Cotton
Bowl during the State Fair of Texas runs through next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback D. Bryant, who was declared academically ineligible at
Duke, has been declared ineligible by the National Assn. of
Intercollegiate Athletics and won't be able to resume his career at
Iowa Wesleyan.... New Mexico starting quarterback Kole McKamey was
suspended for one game after police cited the freshman for underage
drinking.</TE>

<HD>Hokies' Title Hopes Are on Schedule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Tech is back in the national title race, but there's nothing
Hokie about this story.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with Virginia Tech's 1999 march to the Sugar Bowl was
no one knew how good the Hokies were until they lined up against
Florida State.</LD>
<LD>   It was like getting one of the national title-game participants by
mail order.</LD>
<TE>   Virginia Tech played a nonconference schedule that included James
Madison and Alabama Birmingham and then sauntered through a
then-mediocre Big East schedule, essentially securing a title berth
by defeating a Miami program on the rebound from NCAA sanctions (the
Hurricanes finished 9-4 in 1999).</TE>
<TE>   The bowl championship series rankings were in their second year,
and Virginia Tech took advantage of a system that had more kinks in
it than the British rock band, piling up BCS points by scoring
lopsided victories against inferior competition.</TE>
<TE>   In a subjective sport where the champions are computer generated,
doesn't credibility have to be an issue?</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kansas State tried to back-door its way into the national
title game and nearly pulled it off--only an overtime defeat against
Texas A&amp;M kept Bill Snyder's Wildcats from a Fiesta Bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   So, look at the Hokies now.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech is not only 5-0 and ranked No. 4 entering tonight's
game at Boston College, the Hokies have returned with impeccable
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   In nonconference play, the Hokies have defeated Louisiana State,
Marshall and Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some teams that have risen in the polls playing suspect
competition (6-0 North Carolina State), Virginia Tech has come to its
ranking honestly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the toughest schedule we've ever played," Virginia Tech
Coach Frank Beamer said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech could have continued to schedule soft in hopes of
outsmarting the BCS computer, but head Hokies made a conscious
decision to upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a plan in scheduling and we wanted to toughen it up a
little bit," Beamer said. "We thought it was time, we thought the
program had taken enough steps to add some quality opponents and
opponents where you'd have a chance to go on national television."</TE>
<TE>   Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   My rule of thumb on scheduling has always been if you play in an
upper-tier conference--Big Ten, Pacific 10, Big 12, Southeastern--you
need to play one quality nonconference opponent.</TE>
<TE>   This year, for example, Washington played Michigan and then San
Jose State, Wyoming and Idaho, while USC ridiculously overloaded with
Auburn, Colorado, Kansas State and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   The point: The competition in these leagues is usually tough
enough to gauge a team's worthiness.</TE>
<TE>   If you play in the less regarded Big East or Atlantic Coast, you
need to play two quality nonconference opponents.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Florida State made up for mopping up in the ACC by
playing Florida and Miami every year and sometimes added a Penn State
or a USC to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   And this year, no one can beef about Miami rolling through the Big
East because the Hurricanes' nonconference schedule is tough as
bricks: Florida, Florida State, Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 Virginia Tech squad featured the fabulous quarterback
Michael Vick, yet the 2002 squad is more impressive to date because
it is making its case on the field, not in some computer nerd's
margin-of-victory component.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the first month of play, you can look toward Blacksburg
and legitimately marvel.</TE>
<TE>   If the Hokies can get past Boston College tonight--no guarantee,
for sure--they could easily be undefeated headed to Miami on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Because these Hokies have agreed to be sized up and measured, you
can argue Lee Suggs and Kevin Jones may be the best one-two tailback
punch in the nation and that Beamer, in his 16th season, may be the
best coach in college football.</TE>
<TE>   For as long as college football insists on using a subjective
system to pick its championship game participants, we're going to
insist on schedule accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Some coaches have been dragged to this concept--we're thinking
specifically of a Mr. Snyder at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Even Snyder, though, during what he acknowledged was a weak
moment, agreed to play USC this year and last, and won both games.</TE>
<TE>   In my book, those two victories earned Snyder more respect than
any 10 wipeout wins against schools with hyphens.</TE>
<TE>   This sport ought to be about leveling the playing field, not
Louisiana-Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Bumps and Bruises</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA's decision in the Colorado probation case was correct and
cautionary. The infractions committee meted reasonable, but not
harsh, sanctions against Colorado, but sent a strong message to
coaches who think they can beat an NCAA rap just by taking a job at
another school.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Colorado's 53 minor violations occurred under the
watch of Rick Neuheisel, now the Washington coach.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Coach Gary Barnett called the sanctions to his program
"very minimal," but we'll have to wait for the ripple effect on Puget
Sound.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA did not punish Washington, yet barred Neuheisel from
off-campus recruiting until May 31.</TE>
<TE>   This means Neuheisel cannot be on the road for the critical
recruiting stretch from December through February. Given Neuheisel
makes 20 to 40 home visits to recruits a year, this is almost like
grounding a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel can still contact players by phone, but it has been his
hands-on approach that has made him a talented recruiter and the
subject of NCAA inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is a relatively young team, so the ban probably won't
likely have an immediate impact. If the Huskies go 7-5 in 2005,
however, this decision could be responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel thinks the NCAA is making him the test case for his
innovative and, it turns out, inappropriate tactics to contact with
players, so-called "inadvertent bumps" while making authorized visits
to high school coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee's obvious message is that these bumps should no
longer be a part of the college football culture," Neuheisel said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   For Neuheisel, you might call it culture shock.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch Me Please</TE>
<TE>   No one is more amazed to be coaching the Miami Hurricanes than
54-year-old Larry Coker, who takes a 17-0 record into Saturday's game
against Florida State in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after Miami handed Florida State its first home defeat
in 10 years, Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden asked Coker how it felt to
be undefeated.</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, before Saturday's game, a year later, Bowden can
ask Coker the same question.</TE>
<TE>   Coker, a 31-year career assistant before being named Miami's 19th
head coach, has been on a nonstop joyride since being bumped up to
replace Butch Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The great thing is Coker doesn't act as if he invented the game
and appreciates the company he keeps.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really in awe of Joe Paterno and Bobby Bowden," Coker said.
"For me to be out at midfield talking to those people, I'm almost
speechless."</TE>
<TE>   Coker, formerly Miami's offensive coordinator, was not the likely
successor to Davis, but he caught a big break when Greg Schiano,
another Miami assistant, got antsy in 2000 and jumped at the chance
to become head coach at, uh-hum, Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   Had he stayed at Miami, Schiano likely would have taken over for
Davis after he left to coach the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the unknown Coker got his chance and led Miami to a 12-0
record and the national title, and is off to a 5-0 start this season.
Miami has been ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll for 18
consecutive weeks, sharing the all-time record with the USC Trojans
of 1972-73.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Our weekly check on those goofy BCS computer rankings: Jeff
Sagarin has North Carolina State at No. 3 and Air Force at No. 4,
both ranked ahead of Miami, at No. 9. Anderson-Hester still has Notre
Dame at No. 1 and lists Air Force at No. 5, ahead of Miami (6),
Oklahoma (7) and Texas (10). The New York Times computer rankings
have California at No. 12. And, fret not, USC fans. Despite two
losses, the Trojans remain No. 10 in this week's Massey Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden on Miami: "I see what they're doing, and I see a different
level. I think at one time we might have had that, and we're striving
to get that back, but we're not there yet, very obviously." And if
Florida State was to pull off the upset?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that would put you in the thick of things," Bowden said.
"You're only playing the king. If you whup the king, you're packing
something."</TE>
<TE>   USC found out against Washington State the importance of special
teams, and no school has dominated on special teams like Virginia
Tech. The Hokies have blocked 94 kicks in their last 179 games and
have scored 27 touchdowns on special teams in Beamer's 15-plus
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   There are 11 undefeated teams left in Division I, but only nine
with a shot to win the national title. Interestingly, the two non-BCS
schools on the outside are nicknamed the Falcons--Air Force (Mountain
West) and Bowling Green (Mid-American).</TE>
<TE>   Air Force's 5-0 start has earned it only a No. 21 ranking in this
week's AP poll. Bowling Green is 4-0 and unranked. Because neither
school is a member of a BCS-affiliated conference, the chances of
making a BCS bowl game are almost nil.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for what it's worth, Air Force has defeated two BCS teams
(Northwestern and California) while Bowling Green has won five in a
row against BCS competition, including victories against Missouri and
Kansas this season.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State is 5-1, ranked No. 11, and boasts a legitimate Heisman
Trophy candidate quarterback in Seneca Wallace. So why do we think
this feel-good story is going to end soon? The Cyclones play at
Oklahoma and at Texas later this month and, in November, play at
Kansas State and at Colorado in consecutive weeks.</TE>

2     TEXAS  (5-0)          Austin taxpayer Willie Nelson says it's
                            "crazy" to think Texas will lose again to
                            Oklahoma
3     OKLAHOMA (5-0)        Rankman recalls time when the Sooners

4     VIRGINIA TECH  (5-0)  Beamer falls to sleep by counting all the
                            blocked kicks his program has produced
5     GEORGIA  (5-0)        How's this: Rankman doesn't think Georgia
                            is "man enough" to beat Tennessee
6     OREGON (5-0)          Jealousy over team's success described in
                            literature as "Eugene Envy."
7     OHIO STATE (6-0)      Tailback Clarett so afraid to fly he says
                            he'll start hitching rides with John
                            Madden
8     NOTRE DAME  (5-0)     Only concern with school's "Sea of Green"
                            campaign is an outbreak of algae

                            coach only 10 more years
10    TENNESSEE  (4-1)      Fulmer cleans up financially after

                            Arkansas
11    WASH. STATE  (5-1)    Close to reopening Gesser-for-Heisman
                            campaign headquarters and feed store
12    MICHIGAN  (4-1)       Word is Lloyd Carr spent bye week seeing
                            if could crack a smile in front of the
                            mirror
13    IOWA STATE (5-1)      Why do we get the feeling this is a
                            hot-air balloon ready to run out of
                            helium?
14    FLORIDA  (4-2)        Probably a bad time for Zook to mention
                            that Steve Spurrier also has two losses
15    NC STATE (6-0)        Rankman suggests nickname change from
                            Wolfpack to the "Paper Tigers."
16    AIR FORCE  (5-0)      School assures Notre Dame there is plenty
                            of "hanger space" for Oct. 19 visit
17    IOWA  (5-1)           Yep, this appears to be the right year to
                            miss Ohio State on the schedule
18    WASHINGTON (3-2 )     Rankman tells NCAA committee the school's
                            poll drop was "an inadvertent bump."
19    KANSAS STATE (4-1)    School heads back to the Plains State
                            after Colorado loss looking rather plain
20    LOUISIANA ST.  (4-1)  Unlike Kentucky, coaches hope to get out
                            of Gainesville with a victory and their
                            wallets
21    PENN STATE (4-1)      After Wisconsin win, Paterno says
                            "Cheese" as photographer snaps postgame
                            photo
22    USC  (3-2)            Carroll has brought enthusiasm, energy,
                            hope and 9-8 record to program since
                            hired
23    UCLA  (4-1)           Toledo wonders why his 11-5 mark over
                            same period has his head on chopping
                            block
24    MISSISSIPPI (4-1)     Eli calls Peyton and asks what the big
                            deal is about beating Florida

<DH>Ducks have new personnel in place to change last season's
miserable man advantage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were some unflattering ways to describe the Mighty Ducks with
the man advantage last season.</LD>
<LD>   Penalty play. Power kill. Enron.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Bryan Murray, then the team's coach, caught the
live show nightly, as the NHL's worst power play was on an extended
run. Nothing was lost in the translation for the film version.
First-year coach Mike Babcock gave it two thumbs down.</LD>
<TE>   "You can tell by watching the films, they'd get the power play and
the whole bench would say, 'Oh, God, no, here it comes,' " Babcock
said. "You want that to go the opposite way, you want the power play
to build momentum for you."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were going nowhere without improving that one area. Of
the teams with the league's top 14 power plays, 13 of them made the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Magi, bearing offensive gifts from the East.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Oates, whose skills on the half board and his light passing
touch are among the best ever. Fredrik Olausson, a defenseman with
blue-line savvy. Petr Sykora, the best shooter from New Jersey who is
not in the Soprano clan.</TE>
<TE>   Problem solved, or it better be. The Ducks' season, which begins
tonight in St. Louis, could hinge on their power play.</TE>
<TE>   "Two for 10 in the NHL [on the power play] is a pretty good rate,
but that means you fail eight out of 10 times," Babcock said. "So if
you get frustrated and start pressing, then you start failing nine
out of 10 times. We have some more veteran players who understand
that it doesn't go the way you want every single time."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks allowed the eighth-fewest goals in the NHL last season.
Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere ranked fifth in goals-against average
and tied for fifth in save percentage. The team's penalty killing
units ranked seventh. A rosy picture.</TE>
<TE>   The power play, though, negated all that. Only two teams had more
power-play chances than the Ducks. Yet since they converted only
11.5% of the time, the power play was usually a two-minute breather
for opposing teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks lost 21 one-goal games and failed to score a power-play
goal in 14 of those losses. They finished 25 points out of a playoff
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Heads had to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Oleg Tverdovsky, a defenseman with offensive skills to envy but
only two power-play goals last season, fell out of favor, as did
fleet forward Jeff Friesen, who scored only one.</TE>
<TE>   Both were traded to New Jersey in a six-player deal that brought
Sykora to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Murray signed Oates, who ranks eighth all-time in assists. He then
brought in Olausson, who helped the Ducks to the NHL's best power
play in 1997-98, the last time he was with the team. That was also
the last time the Ducks made the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus is the return of Steve Rucchin, a bang-and-score
center.</TE>
<TE>   Said team captain Paul Kariya: "I think the important thing is
having talented players. The power play works best when guys are
interchangeable. They know instinctively where each other is, that
way you're one step ahead of the penalty killers."</TE>
<TE>   There are risks in the off-season ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Oates, who played for Washington and Philadelphia last season,
turned 40 in August. That stirred memories of Jari Kurri, a hall of
famer past his prime who signed with the Ducks before the 1995-96
season.</TE>
<TE>   But Oates led the NHL in assists for a second consecutive season
and seems to have arrived with his skills intact.</TE>
<TE>   "You better be paying attention out there, because Adam is going
to put the puck right on your stick," said Rucchin, who missed 138 of
164 games the last two seasons because of injuries. "It's amazing how
he can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Olausson, who turned 37 on Saturday, played in only 47
regular-season games with Detroit in 2001-02 and hasn't put in a full
NHL season since leaving the Ducks after 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Olausson was a key component in the Red Wings' run to the
Stanley Cup championship. He had two goals and three points against
Colorado in the Western Conference finals, including the Game 3
winner in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Sykora, bothered by injuries last season, scored only 21 goals,
his lowest total in four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendously talented group, as skilled as I have ever
played with," Olausson said. "If we get the job done, we can pick up
a few more points in the standings."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at St. Louis, 5 PDT, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--Savvis Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KPLS (830).</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Blues (2001-02)--1-3.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Ducks are aware that they desperately need a good
start to build confidence and convince fans that they are a different
team. "As much as we want to look at the big picture, the little
picture is so important," Coach Mike Babcock said. "We have to be in
the hunt after 20 games." The schedule doesn't help. The first 12
teams they play all finished above .500 last season.... Blues'
defenseman Chris Pronger, who is out with an injured left wrist, was
expected to be back in January but may now be sidelined until March.</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Heads Galaxy Attack</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Striker's goal gives L.A. a 1-0 victory over
Colorado and a berth in MLS Cup match for the third time in the last
four years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Back again.</LD>
<LD>   For the third time in the last four years and the fourth time in
the seven-year history of Major League Soccer, the Galaxy will play
in the MLS Cup match.</LD>
<LD>   Its 1-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids in Game 2 of the
semifinals at Invesco Field on Wednesday night solidified the
Galaxy's spot in the final, which will be held Oct. 20 at Gillette
Stadium at Foxboro, Mass., against the New England Revolution or the
Columbus Crew.</LD>
<TE>   In completing the two-game sweep of Colorado in front of 12,367,
the Galaxy did it with its staples--defense, Cobi Jones and Carlos
Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   The defense pulled off its second consecutive shutout of the
Rapids without sweeper and spiritual leader Alexi Lalas, who sat out
the match because he feared picking up a third yellow card in as many
games, which would have forced Lalas to sit out the next game.</TE>
<TE>   The Cobi and Carlos Show, meanwhile, played to rave reviews, as
the top two playoff scorers in the league combined for the
game-winner in the 64th minute.</TE>
<TE>   On a play that started on a ball from Peter Vagenas, who had
entered one minute earlier, Jones launched a cross pass from the top
left corner of the box into the middle of the box toward a drifting
Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   The Guatemalan striker outjumped Mark Chung, a 5-foot-7 midfielder
who somehow got caught in the back marking Ruiz, and Ruiz put just
enough head on the ball to redirect it into the left corner of the
net, past a prone David Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's seventh goal of the playoffs, which gave him 16 points,
established MLS records for goals and points in a postseason. Jones
has 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that Cobi's a good passer into the box," Ruiz said. "So
once I saw him get the ball, I just made my move. It was a good ball
by Cobi.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not over. We all want to be No. 1 when it's all said and
done. We're not satisfied until we win the championship."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he spied Ruiz from the get-go.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a matter of me getting the ball to him and him
jumping over the man who was marking him," said Jones, who began the
playoffs with 13 points in six previous postseasons. "I knew he'd be
dangerous with the ball in the air."</TE>
<TE>   After employing four defenders with a 4-4-2 lineup in Game 1, the
Rapids switched to more of a man-marking 3-5-2 alignment with three
defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it made no difference.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sigi Schmid moved Tyrone Marshall into Lalas' sweeper role
and started Craig Waibel at defender.</TE>
<TE>   The Rapids were breaking down the Galaxy defense early and getting
good looks at the goal. They just couldn't finish.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado nearly scored in the 41st minute, but Chris Henderson's
shot from 20 yards hit the right post and Mark Chung's left-footed
follow off the carom from five yards was wide left, though he had a
practically empty net.</TE>
<TE>   The Rapids outshot the Galaxy, 14-11, but only had one shot on
goal, compared to the five shots on goal taken by the Galaxy, which
has outscored the Rapids, 10-0, in four playoff matches and 12-1 in
the last four meetings between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most striking was how subdued the Galaxy's postgame
celebration was. Absent was the unbridled joy the team exhibited
after beating San Jose in the regular-season finale to win the
Western Conference title and the top seeding. Missing was the sheer
relief the Galaxy displayed in beating Kansas City in the first round
after being extended to three games.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very focused," Schmid said. "That's why they're not
celebrating, not jumping up and down. We've been there before."</TE>

<HD>USGA Keeps Things Public With Open Venues</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime today, the U.S. Golf Assn. will name Bethpage Black in
Farmingdale, N.Y., as the site of the 2009 U.S. Open. What does that
mean for Riviera Country Club?</LD>
<LD>   "We hope they consider inviting us another year," USGA President
David Fay said.</LD>
<LD>   A lot can happen, presumably, between now and 2009, with the
exception of Riviera Country Club hosting the U.S. Open.</LD>
<TE>   When the USGA awarded the 2008 Open to Torrey Pines at La
Jolla--and a Southern California rival--and then says today it's
going back to Bethpage Black in 2009, it all but ended Riviera's
chances for an Open, perhaps for a very long time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you where we're at," said Michael Yamaki, chief
corporate officer at Riviera. "We're at a standstill, honestly. As
far as I'm concerned, we're just pushing ahead, making the course the
best it can be. If it happens, it happens, [but] I can't say it's not
a disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   The South Course at Torrey Pines, which was renovated by Rees
Jones in time for this year's Buick Invitational, is a public course,
a style that seems to be in vogue at the present time, under the
watch of Fay.</TE>
<TE>   It was Fay who embraced Bethpage Black, another public course, and
the site of this year's Open. Yamaki believes Fay wants his legacy to
be highlighted by bringing the Open to public venues, such as Torrey
Pines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's David's thing, the public course thing, it's his direction,
the way they want to go," Yamaki said. "Whatever the politics are
there, that's all. This wave of David, wanting to go to public
courses, I can't fight that."</TE>
<TE>   Fay said choosing Torrey Pines over Riviera was a tough decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly understand that Riviera would feel badly about it,"
Fay said. "We're not turning our back on holding the U.S. Open at
private clubs. That's not our mission. But on the heels of a very
successful Open at Bethpage, it was an attractive opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Yamaki says he has been told informally that one of the drawbacks
to Riviera is that Los Angeles has an image problem.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a thing with L.A., that L.A. is too laid back, that we
couldn't go nuts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until local golf fans shed their laid-back image or 2010,
whichever comes first, Yamaki must wait.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be there, just in case something happens, if someone falls
out."</TE>
<TE>   It could happen, it just never has.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods confirmed he had a fever of 102 degrees on Sunday at
the Ryder Cup and said he found it funny that people questioned his
passion for the event simply because he wore a different shirt than
the other U.S. players.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a kick out of people saying that I wasn't patriotic ...
because I didn't wear the team uniform," Woods said in a conference
call with writers for his Target World Challenge in December. "The
turtleneck was part of the team uniform, but I wore it because I was
sick all week. I started to feel sick on Friday, Saturday I wasn't
feeling too good and Sunday I definitely wasn't feeling good. I did
it to stay warm. A bunch of [players] were out there in short sleeves
and I was out there in a turtleneck. I thought that was comical."</TE>
<TE>   Woods also reiterated his stance on women becoming members at
Augusta National Golf Club. He says he doesn't always agree with the
position of the club members, who host the Masters, but that the
issue is out of his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Augusta National has always been slow to change and they have
done things at their own pace, they are a private club, and they have
that right. I don't always agree with their policies, I have to say
that for sure, but there is not a whole lot that I can do about it.
They have their own membership, they have their own policies and they
make their own rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, Hootie [Johnson] runs the show there, it's his
tournament and he does whatever he wants to do."</TE>
<TE>   It's Tiger Time</TE>
<TE>   For $6 million over the next three years, Woods is getting paid to
know what time it is. He signed an endorsement deal with TAG Heuer,
the luxury Swiss watchmaker that churns out timepieces that run as
high as $5,550, thus proving that time is indeed money.</TE>
<TE>   It's Tiger Money</TE>
<TE>   According to Burns Sports &amp; Celebrities, which puts together
athletes and advertisers, Woods will make $62 million in 2002 because
of endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Business News</TE>
<TE>   It was a very good weekend for Callaway Golf because of victories
by Annika Sorenstam and Charles Howell III, who used the new Great
Big Bertha II driver. And Callaway had good golf ball news too.
Sorenstam and Howell used the HX Red ball and Dunhill Links winner
Padraig Harrington used the CTU 30 in his European Tour victory at
Carnoustie.</TE>
<TE>   Some statistics on Sorenstam: At the Samsung World Championships
in Vallejo, Calif., she exceeded her year-to-date driving average by
more than 20 yards (284.5 yards to 264.4 yards). She is 141 under par
in her nine tournament victories this year. She also won the ANZ
Australian Masters in February and the Compaq Open in Sweden in
August, two victories the LPGA doesn't recognize.</TE>
<TE>   But if you do count them, Sorenstam has won 11 of the 20
tournaments she has entered in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   More Business News</TE>
<TE>   It was also a breakthrough week for TaylorMade-Adidas Golf, which
lured Sergio Garcia from Titleist and signed him to an exclusive
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Garcia dropping Titleist's ball for the
TaylorMade-Adidas Maxfli brand, he's going to continue with Adidas
footwear and apparel, use a TaylorMade logo bag and play a complete
line of TaylorMade equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Jacket for Sale</TE>
<TE>   Gary Player is using Christie's auction house to sell his golf
memorabilia, including his Masters jacket, which he mistakenly took
from the course in 1961 and has had ever since. The collection,
appraised at $5 million, must be kept together as a condition of the
sale. Most of the proceeds are expected to go to Player's charitable
interests and for his children.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth Jim Murray Memorial tournament will be played Monday at
Lakeside Golf Club in Toluca Lake. The event benefits the Murray
Foundation, which awards scholarships to journalism students.
Details: (310) 476-8948.</TE>
<TE>   Prize money for the 2003 Kraft Nabisco Championship is being
increased $100,000 to $1.6 million. The tournament is scheduled for
March 27-30 at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage. Two other
of the LPGA's majors, the McDonald's LPGA Championship and the
Weetabix Women's British Open, also raised their purses $100,000 to
$1.6 million.</TE>

<LD>A preview of what could be the Southern Section Division III
championship match will be played today when North Hollywood Campbell
Hall and Brentwood highs meet in an Olympic League girls' tennis
match at 3:45 p.m. at Brentwood.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell Hall (5-2, 1-0) is ranked No. 1 in the Division III
coaches' poll, with Brentwood (6-1, 3-0) at No. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell Hall's losses are to Beverly Hills and Calabasas, ranked
Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, in Division I.</LD>
<TE>   Campbell Hall features Alli Krasnopolsky, a sophomore who was the
U.S. Tennis Assn.'s Southern California sectional runner-up in the
girls' 16s division in June. Krasnopolsky and junior teammates Daron
Moore and Cheyenne Reveche are ranked No. 16, No. 32 and No. 46,
respectively, in the Southern California Tennis Assn. girls' 16
division. They helped the Vikings advance to the Division V
semifinals last year.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood (6-1, 3-0), which lost in the Division V quarterfinals
last season, features freshman Austin Hansen, ranked No. 14 in
Southern California in girls' 16s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Calabasas High girls' tennis team has used a group effort to
post a 9-1 record this season, relying primarily on singles play and
doubles teams that include Cory Ceizler.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Erin Everly (17-1), junior Celia Durkin (18-3), sophomore
Amanda Fink (23-1) and freshman Kristen McVitty (17-1) have a
combined record of 75-6 in singles sets.</TE>
<TE>   The foursome shares the No. 1 spot in the lineup, with one of the
group usually rotated into the doubles lineup to team with Ceizler, a
junior.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riza Zalameda, the No. 1 player for Beverly Hills, lost both of
her matches while playing for a five-member United States team of top
19-and-under players, but the U.S. defeated Britain, 7-4, in the 29th
Maureen Connolly Challenge Trophy competition last week in
Bournemouth, England.</TE>
<TE>   Zalameda, a junior, fell to Melanie South, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, in
singles. Zalameda teamed with Shenay Perry of Coral Springs, Fla., in
doubles, but the pair lost, 6-4, 6-2, to Jane O'Donoghue and Anna
Hawkins.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Montclair Prep's football game Friday against Calexico
Vincent Memorial has been canceled. Vincent Memorial has 14 players

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Foothill (4-0) at San Clemente (3-1), 7:30 p.m., Friday</LD>
<LD>   Foothill received a serious confidence boost last week by
overcoming a 21-point deficit to defeat Orange El Modena, 28-24. Don
Poole has thrown for nine touchdowns and is averaging 19 yards per
completion for the Knights, who are No. 22 in The Times' rankings.
Last week Poole threw touchdown passes of 48, 49 and 42 yards in the
fourth quarter. No. 17 San Clemente is without quarterback Beau
Budde, who threw for seven touchdowns and 615 yards in three games
before breaking his foot during last week's 26-12 loss to Corona
Centennial. That not only puts pressure on junior Cole Berquist, but
also on running back Cheyne Verhagen and the offensive line.</LD>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley (4-0) vs. Canyon Springs (4-0) at Moreno Valley
High, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Murrieta Valley had 78 seniors and juniors and 68
sophomores show up for the first day of practice. Eleven years ago,
in Wally Clark's first season as coach, he had only 33 players. The
Nighthawks will count on Adrian Allen and Paul Como to keep the ball
moving against No. 23 Canyon Springs. Allen has rushed for 235 yards
and four touchdowns, and Como has rushed for 194 yards and has been a
force at outside linebacker. Canyon Springs relies on running back
Ryan Beard, who has totaled 288 yards and seven touchdowns, and
quarterback Josh Gibson, who has passed for 407 yards and four
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Diamond Bar (4-0) at Covina Charter Oak (3-1), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   A victory by Diamond Bar would go a long way toward earning some
respect for a team that won the Division II title in 1999 but is
unranked in Division II. The Brahma defense has allowed only 13
points a game while the offense, led by quarterback Tony Demonac and
running back Chris Carrillo, is scoring 35. No. 24 Charter Oak,
ranked No. 4 in Division VI after winning the Division VII title last
year, has outscored opponents, 83-17, since fumbling four times in an
opening-week loss to Alta Loma.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo (4-0) vs. Inglewood (3-1) at Inglewood Coleman Stadium.
7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Matt Engle of El Segundo is the top-ranked quarterback in Southern
California. Defensive end Lawrence Jackson of Inglewood has eight
sacks this season, 60 in his career, and is the most feared pass
rusher in the Southern Section. How well El Segundo is able to block
Jackson could decide this nonleague game.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   INTERSECTIONAL</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (3-0-1) at Carson (3-1), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The No. 5 Griffins got a scare from La Habra last week, needing a
fourth-quarter touchdown to escape with a 24-20 victory. They may get
another against No. 20 Carson as the Colts have rebounded nicely from
a second-week shellacking by Woodland Hills Taft. Jeff Kline and
Justin Elway alternate at quarterback for Los Alamitos and Jeremy
Childs (26 catches, 445 yards) and Brandon Tripp (24 catches, 243
yards) are the main targets. Carson junior Beau Davis (622 yards, six
touchdown passes) is beginning to settle in at quarterback and Greg
Chatman (18 catches, 20.1 average) is emerging as one of the City
Section's top receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly (4-0) vs. Concord De La Salle (4-0) at
California's Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, 2 p.m., Saturday</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive season, The Times' top-ranked team gets
a shot at ending De La Salle's national-record winning streak, which
is at 129 games, in a battle between two of the top teams in the
country. The Spartans toppled the Jackrabbits, 29-15, last year in
Long Beach. This year's game, which will be televised on tape delay
at 7 p.m. on Fox Sports Net 2, is being played at Cal because De La
Salle's preferred site for big home games, University of the Pacific,
was reserved for a Promise Keepers' conference. A crowd of
15,000-20,000 is expected, according to De La Salle Athletic Director
Terry Eidson. This will mark the final game in the series between the
juggernauts.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School: Pasadena La Salle</LD>
<LD>   Ht: 6-3 * Wt: 240 * Year: Senior</LD>
<LD>   John Caulfield assessed the risk factor and it was a no-brainer.
As the top returning shotputter in the state, he briefly weighed the
decision to play football at Pasadena La Salle this fall or skip the
season to protect his future in track and field, boosted by a
commitment to UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   Then he looked at the team's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between Division I and Division XI [high
schools]," Caulfield said. "If I went to a Division I school, I
probably would have had second thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers were happy they fit into Caulfield's plans this fall.</TE>
<TE>   They are off to an 0-3-1 start, but it hasn't been Caulfield's
fault. He is a vital two-way starter for La Salle, alternating
between fullback and tight end and anchoring the defense at
linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sab Manente understands some of the pressure Caulfield might
have been feeling to skip his senior season and concentrate on the
shotput, where he finished sixth in state last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been easy for him to not play," Manente said. "But
he made the decision on his own. He showed a lot of character and is
an integral part of this team."</TE>
<TE>   Noah Bryant didn't play football his senior year at Carpinteria
High, then won the state title in the shotput in June. Unlike
Caulfield, he had not made a college choice before his senior year,
committing to USC three weeks after the state finals.</TE>
<TE>   Caulfied said there's a big difference between his and Bryant's
out-of-the-ring interests.</TE>
<TE>   "For Noah, his whole family is also big into [power] lifting,"
Caulfield said. "I just like to be able to do it all. Playing
football is a big part of my life."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a little too early for USC football Coach Pete Carroll to start
celebrating, but the chances look good that two-time All-City
receiver Steve Smith of Woodland Hills Taft will become a Trojan.</LD>
<LD>   "I really like SC," Smith said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Smith lists the Trojans as No. 1 among his college choices,
followed by Texas and Tennessee. He's also considering Oregon and
Notre Dame, but UCLA is out.</LD>
<TE>   Smith's teammate, receiver Noah Smith, plans to attend the
California-Stanford game and also likes Washington, USC, Tennessee
and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Taft linebacker Lance Broadus has a visit scheduled for Arizona.
Taft defensive back Paul Pratt is attracting attention from Nevada,
Fresno State, Washington State and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Dunphy, a setter at North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake and the
daughter of Pepperdine volleyball Coach Marv Dunphy, committed to USC
earlier this year. Marv said he had no influence on her decision.</TE>
<TE>   Alex met USC Coach Mick Haley three years ago when he was coaching
the U.S. Olympic team. "I didn't do anything," Marv said. "She said,
'Hey, Dad, I want to play for Mick Haley.' "</TE>
<TE>   Billie Joe Grant of Arroyo Grande, the defending state champion in
the girls' discus, has taken trips to Arizona and North Carolina. In
addition, she has trips scheduled to Wisconsin and Arizona State
later this month.</TE>
<TE>   John Parfitt, a 6-foot-7 volleyball player at Anaheim Canyon who
had 74 kills in a match against Santa Margarita last season, has
committed to Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola receiver Quintin Daniels remains wide open in his college
options. He's being recruited by Oregon, UCLA, USC, Stanford,
California and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Chris Valaika of Newhall Hart will visit Nebraska this
weekend. He also plans to visit Fresno State and UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Ashlee Freeman of Westlake Village Oaks Christian has
committed to Boston University. Guard Larry Cunningham of Downey has
committed to UC Riverside.</TE>

<HD>La Habra Has Big-Time Look</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can't be rented at the local video store, but the hottest tape
around is the game film of La Habra's 24-20 loss to perennial power
Los Alamitos last Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Future Griffin opponents would like to see how La Habra, a
Division IX program, racked up 405 yards of offense against The
Times' fifth-ranked team.</LD>
<LD>   "We moved the ball all over the field," La Habra Coach Frank
Mazzotta said.</LD>
<TE>   La Habra held a 20-14 lead in the third quarter and had the ball
at midfield when a receiver was called for an illegal block
downfield. The Highlanders had to punt and never regained good field
position.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't figure out why we were penalized," Mazzotta said.
"Our receiver was just running a pass pattern."</TE>
<TE>   Mazzotta was surprised in the off-season when he requested and
secured a two-game series with the high-profile Griffins.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so far out on the edge of Orange County," he said, "people
don't realize we're here."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Highlanders won 12 consecutive games and reached the
Division IX final for their first championship-game appearance in 17
years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Torrance running back Chauncey Washington is expected to
miss the next two games because of a knee injury, Coach Don Gereau
said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, who has committed to USC, hurt his knee against North
Torrance in Week 2. He was coming off a 272-yard, six-touchdown
performance against West Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, Washington rushed for 1,548 yards. Last season, he
had 1,872 yards and 24 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "He's sorely missed," said Gereau, in his first season after
taking over for Brett Peabody, now an assistant at Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, backup running back Tyler Flack bruised his
thigh last week against San Pedro and is expected to miss Friday's
game against Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prepare to make room for Mike Wunderley on the short list of
Southland high school football coaches with at least 200 career
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Wunderley, who has been at Cerritos Valley Christian since 1979,
can reach the milestone Friday when the Crusaders (4-0) play host to
Playa del Rey St. Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   Once he does, however, don't expect a speech.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot more people paying attention to that than I am,"
Wunderley said. "The thing I'm most concerned with is getting this
team to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Wunderley has led the Crusaders to the playoffs every season,
winning Southern Section titles in 1986 and '95.</TE>
<TE>   Among active coaches with at least 200 career victories are John
Barnes of Los Alamitos, Dick Bruich of Fontana Kaiser, Steve Grady of
L.A. Loyola, Gary Campbell of Norco, Marijon Ancich of Santa Fe
Springs St. Paul and George Giannini of Van Nuys Montclair Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there aren't that many guys with 200 wins," Wunderley
said, "so it's nice to be in that company."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly Coach Raul Lara has worn out the year-old tape of
the Jackrabbits' loss to Concord De La Salle, looking for any tidbit
that might provide an edge heading into the rematch at 2 p.m.
Saturday in Berkeley at California's Memorial Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   So far the only weaknesses he has found are the ones on his team.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play our best game that night," Lara said of De La
Salle's 29-15 victory at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. "Our game
plan was very good but we didn't tackle or execute."</TE>
<TE>   Poly players have vowed to correct the deficiencies that
contributed to that defeat, specifically, the failure to catch
passes, make key blocks or bring down Maurice Drew, the Spartan
running back who blistered the defense for four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Our saying this year is, 'Play hard, play smart, execute and
score,' " Poly quarterback Leon Jackson said. "Each one of those
things leads up to the next thing. If you play hard, you'll play
smart. If you play smart, you'll execute, and if you execute all the
way down the field, you'll score."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops can't like the dispatches he has been
receiving from Huntington Beach, where soon-to-be-Sooner quarterback
Tommy Grady  has been sacked 15 times in Edison's last three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers' offensive line is so thin that guard Jon Simpson,
its lone returning starter, has been forced to switch to tackle.
Guards Tuo Fuga and Robert Barna have been sidelined by injuries.
Barna dislocated his kneecap and is expected to return in two weeks,
while Fuga will miss the rest of the season because of a torn
anterior cruciate ligament.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing with guys who have no experience," Coach Dave White
said. "They're doing the best they can."</TE>
<TE>   Grady has still managed to complete 51.5% of his passes for 1,148
yards and five touchdowns with only two interceptions. But Edison,
No. 5 in The Times' preseason rankings, is 1-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Mullaly will be Westlake Village Westlake's starting
tailback in Friday's Marmonte League game at Calabasas after coming
off the bench to rush for 116 yards and two touchdowns in a 28-23
victory at Agoura last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mullaly, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior, replaces Kenneth Mackins,
who will continue to start at defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   Mackins, an All-Ventura County defensive back last season, was
expected to play a big part in Westlake's offense this season. But he
was hampered by injuries during the first three games of the season
and had a fumble in the first quarter against Agoura.</TE>

<HD>Injuries Become a Federal Case</HD>
<DH>NCAA: Legislation to protect employees' privacy may keep
schools from reporting athletes' conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL McLEOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Troy Polamalu of USC hobbled off the football field late in the
first half of last week's loss at Washington State, Trojan officials
were quick to dispel speculation that their standout strong safety
had suffered a season-ending injury. It's a sprained right ankle,
they quickly reported.</LD>
<LD>   But under a federal law set to take effect in April, it might
become illegal for USC officials to say anything.</LD>
<LD>   The Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, designed
to protect the privacy of employee medical records, also includes
language that could punish institutions for releasing information
about an athlete's medical records.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, schools will be backed into a corner when faced with
situations such as Polamalu's injury, which took place in a packed
stadium and before a regional television audience. Will they be able
to keep information private with hundreds of thousands of fans
wondering about the condition of a player who is carted off the
field?</TE>
<TE>   The measure also has heightened concern about gambling on college
events because bookmakers rely on injury reports before posting odds
on a game.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Polamalu's status--he might not be able to play
Saturday against Cal--is a consideration for experts charged with
setting a betting line on the game.</TE>
<TE>   From the press box high above the field, there was early
speculation that Polamalu's injury was serious--torn ankle ligaments
or even a broken leg. A radio station reported that it was a knee
injury.</TE>
<TE>   "In that situation, we needed to be able to control that
information," said Tim Tessalone, USC's sports information director.
After getting correct information from the Trojan medical staff,
Tessalone told reporters about the sprain.</TE>
<TE>   Hal Hunter, head of the Health Care Administration Program at Long
Beach State and an expert on medical issues, said banning the release
of injury reports would be an unfortunate and "unintended
consequence" of strict interpretation of the law's language.</TE>
<TE>   In a key section of the original 16-page document, the words
"school or university" are lumped in with those of health-care
providers, employers and "any other person furnishing health care
services or supplies."</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Bush administration issued a 443-page summary of
how the law is to be interpreted, relaxing parts that would have
prohibited health-care providers from sharing important medical
information with each other. But its effect on athletic teams remains
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't intended for sports," Hunter said. "People would be
denied health insurance if they had preexisting conditions, so they
couldn't try to go to another job somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "The general thinking is that it should apply more to student
health-services records, rather than injuries. It was originally
designed to prevent people from getting locked into their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at USC and UCLA recently formed task forces to discuss
how to implement the law, which for violators carries fines up to
$250,000 and 10 years in prison. Information specialists at a few
other local colleges said they knew little or nothing about the
mandated change.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just in the beginning stages of discussing the impact that
this bill would have on the different areas at UCLA," Associate
Athletic Director Betsy Stephenson said.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL, which requires teams to release weekly injury reports,
"continues to analyze the potential impact and is weighing our
options," league spokesman Greg Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   The league is prepared to ask for an exemption from the law if
federal regulators don't clarify how sports teams should apply the
new rules, he said. Other professional sports groups are sure to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not that simple at the college level, where the quantity
and quality of injury reports vary from school to school.</TE>
<TE>   Several times this season school officials have left audiences
hanging by refusing to divulge conditions of players injured during
games broadcast on national television.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, college coaches, wary of giving opponents a break,
can use the new law as a shield.</TE>
<TE>   Injury reports are routinely published in newspapers throughout
the nation, but the manner in which injuries come to light vary.</TE>
<TE>   Some colleges, such as Kansas State, refuse to report them
altogether. Others, such as Arizona, follow the NFL approach and make
them available on a regular basis. Still others leave it up to
reporters who discover injuries by watching practices or talking to
players.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he would like to see a uniform process
for reporting injuries.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Stephenson believes that withholding injury reports might
curb wagering on college events because it would restrict the
quantity of information available to gamblers.</TE>
<TE>   John Mackovic, Arizona's football coach, said he is afraid the
opposite might be true. "Whenever you try to hide that information,
someone is going to get it or try to get it and that opens up a whole
new set of problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a great deal of illegal gambling going on in the country
and if you screen information that is meant to be public the people
who will get that information one way or another become the illegal
gamblers. They're the ones who will go to great lengths to get that
information because it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
probably billions of dollars now in college football."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe injury information will get out even if colleges
attempt to withhold it.</TE>
<TE>   An injury sustained by UCLA lineman Mike Saffer before UCLA's 43-7
victory over San Diego State on Sept. 28 provides a case in point.</TE>
<TE>   Saffer broke a rib when he sneezed while taking notes during
class. The game was barely 24 hours away, so UCLA officials chose not
to say anything about it, a school spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out about Mike having broken the rib at about 10:30
Friday morning, and within half an hour it hit the Internet," UCLA
Coach Bob Toledo said. "Talk about leaks. We can keep it a secret,
but I don't know if anybody else can."</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA doesn't have a policy, preferring to let schools make
their own decisions, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Tessalone of USC said colleges may be able to skirt the letter of
the new law by having athletes sign a waiver that gives permission
for school officials to release injury information.</TE>
<TE>   But even that would need to be clarified, because there are those
who believe a blanket-clearance waiver would violate the spirit of
the new law. Instead, they say, an athlete would need to sign off on
each incident or injury report before it could be made public. That
would not only be awkward, but it would generate a time-consuming
amount of paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know what lawmakers were thinking when they
included us in this," said Cal State Fullerton trainer Julie Max, who
is president of the National Athletic Trainers' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential for a great nightmare exists."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Left Bank, whose final start was his best, died this week of
complications after having a third surgery for colic.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Michael Tabor and trained by Todd Pletcher, the
5-year-old French Deputy horse first had surgery in August, seven
days after winning the Whitney Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Left Bank, who was pointed toward the Breeders' Cup Classic, had
14 victories in 24 starts and earnings of just over $1.4 million.</LD>
<TE>   Pletcher has entrants in four of the nine races at Belmont today.
In the first, a 2-year-old maiden race for New York-breds at one mile
on the grass, Pletcher will be represented by Dazzling Spirit, who is
adding blinkers, then he has Distant Fantasy in the fourth, the entry
of Defiant Beauty and Comeback To Me in the sixth and Whitewashed in
the seventh. A 3-year-old Broad Brush filly, Whitewashed probably is
Pletcher's best chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A field of 10 will get together in Oak Tree's
seventh, a contentious turf affair and the penultimate leg of a pick
six with a carryover of $82,254.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Gary Stevens. The jockey got off to a five-for-23 start
at Oak Tree and picked up two more wins Wednesday with favored
Tizalovelylady in the second and 6-1 shot Giovannetti in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Tyler Baze. Near the top of the standings at Fairplex
Park, Baze lost with his first 20 mounts at Oak Tree before winning
with 5-1 shot Fleetstreet Dancer on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the sixth keying Corona Classic
in the sixth on top with Reluctant Hero, Ima Mile High Guy and Mr
Motion in the two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/15. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8.40/$65.40. Total money bet: $104.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Contract Work Left for Taylor to Sew Up</HD>

<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After signing captain Mattias Norstrom to a four-year, $14.5-million
contract last month, King General Manager Dave Taylor said it was
probable that before the end of training camp the club would lock up
one or two more players eligible to become unrestricted free agents
next summer.</LD>
<LD>   But when the season opened Wednesday night, the Kings had yet to
extend contract offers to goaltender Felix Potvin, defenseman Aaron
Miller or forwards Bryan Smolinski and Craig Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   "Not yet," Taylor said. "In the next little while we'd like to get
going on that. We've just been preoccupied with the camp and our
evaluations and getting ready for the season."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze, demoted Monday to the minors and told that he was
free to pursue a trade, has not drawn interest from any other teams,
Taylor said. The veteran winger left Wednesday to join the Kings'
American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H., and is expected to
open the season in the AHL on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In pregame warm-ups, each of the Kings wore Wayne Gretzky No. 99
jerseys, which then were autographed by the players and Gretzky
before being put up for auction.</TE>

<KH>NHL OPENING NIGHT</KH>
<HD>Kings Finally Have Coyotes' Number</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. honors Gretzky, then ends six-game winless
streak against Phoenix with 4-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings opened their 36th NHL season Wednesday night both by paying
homage to Wayne Gretzky and disappointing their former captain.</LD>
<LD>   After a pregame ceremony in which The Great One's No. 99 jersey
was retired to a place of honor on the arena's south wall, the Kings
dominated Gretzky's Phoenix Coyotes, 4-1, in front of a sellout crowd
of 18,260 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Ziggy Palffy and defenseman Mathieu Schneider scored on the power
play and Eric Belanger and Ian Laperriere scored even-strength goals
for the Kings, who ended a six-game winless streak against the
Coyotes.</LD>
<TE>   And did they feel any guilt about spoiling Gretzky's big night?</TE>
<TE>   "Not the tiniest bit," King Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who haven't lost an opener since 1993, had little
success against the Coyotes last season, losing twice and tying three
times, and had not outscored them since March 19, 2001, when they
were 6-2 winners at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the teams were so evenly matched that each finished with 95
points last season, tied for sixth place in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are a lot of similarities in the two teams," Murray
said before the game. "That's why we had the battles and the number
of overtime games [four] we had with them last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we play similar styles. We're both very workmanlike in
the way we approach it. We both are physical. They've got good team
speed, as we do."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams, of course, also are linked to Gretzky, who played for
the Kings for eight seasons before he was traded in 1996 and last
year became a 20% owner and managing partner of the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   The pregame festivities, including the unveiling of a bronze
statue of Gretzky that will stand outside the arena, delayed the
opening faceoff by about 30 minutes, but Murray and his players were
only too happy to oblige.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything up to that point is for Gretzky," the coach said,
anticipating the late start, "and everything after that is for the
Kings."</TE>
<TE>   He was right.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big night with a lot of distractions," said goaltender
Felix Potvin, who stopped 25 shots, "but we seemed to get out of the
gate fast."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing Gretzky-era white home uniforms with silver and black
trim, the Kings came out aggressively, nearly taking the lead on a
shot by Brad Chartrand that caromed off the crossbar about 75 seconds
into the game.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the period ended, Coyote goaltender Sean Burke had
turned aside 14 shots, Potvin nine and neither team had scored.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger, whose promising 2001-02 season was marred by a midseason
wrist injury, broke the 0-0 tie at 6:32 of the second period.
Pouncing on the rebound of a shot from the point by Schneider, the
Kings' new second-line center shifted the puck to his backhand side
and flipped a pretty shot over the sprawling Burke for his first goal
since Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, whose 72 power-play goals last season tied for the NHL
lead, took advantage of a five-on-three situation at 12:06 of the
period, Palffy scoring off a pass through the crease by Jason
Allison.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Markov netted the Coyotes' only goal, making the score 2-1
on a shot from the left faceoff circle with 1:50 to play in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the third period, however, the Kings scored two
goals in 32 seconds. After the Coyotes were penalized for having too
many players on the ice, Schneider scored off a pass from Allison at
9:32. Laperriere, who sat out the exhibition season after off-season
abdominal surgery, slapped a shot past Burke at 10:04.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great to be out there with my teammates," Laperriere
said.</TE>

<LD>Brisco Lamb's maiden victory in Friday's second race was significant
for Patricia Visscher.</LD>
<LD>   Visscher earned her first victory as a trainer when Brisco Lamb,
who had been second in four of her first seven starts, finally got
the job done.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Visscher, her husband, died in March.</LD>
<TE>   "We were married for 25 years and we worked together with the
horses for a long time," she said. "Life without him has been
difficult and the adjustments have been hard.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband taught me a lot of things about working with horses
and I'm using that to help me now that I'm training. It's great to
win. It's a very emotional feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Visscher also credits trainer Chris O'Dell and owner Mimi Wells
with helping her transition.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Hubris. 2. Tenacious Storm. 3. Cash No Check. 4.
Synner Or Saint. 5. The Triple Crown. 6. Buzzin On By. 7. Lock To
Load. 8. Finest Ryon.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Hubris and Alpine Socialite in the first, single
Tenacious Storm in the second, Cash No Check, Mornings Snow and
Ilegal Babe in the third and Brite Future, Fleet Year, Eldorado Glow
and Synner Or Saint in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: New Alliance drops to the level of his last win
in the fifth. Adans Baby Victory debuts in a soft spot in the sixth
for trainer Blane Schvaneveldt.</TE>

<LD>Woody Paige of the Denver Post ripped former Colorado Coach Rick
Neuheisel, now coaching at Washington, for recruiting violations that
resulted in NCAA penalties against Colorado, referring to him as
"Neuweasel."</LD>
<LD>   "He is a creative cheater and a coaching charlatan," Paige said of
Neuheisel, the former UCLA quarterback. "Neuweasel is a disgrace to
the university that took a chance and gave a 33-year-old assistant
with no college head coaching experience a magnificent opportunity to
lead a successful program and ultimately made him a rich and famous
man."</LD>
<LD>   Neuheisel has been barred from off-campus recruiting for the
Huskies until May 31, 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the PGA Tour record for the longest
sudden-death playoff?</TE>
<TE>   Upsetting: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Says Jeff
Kent's agent, Jeff Klein: 'Jeff Kent is going to explore the
[free-agent] market and would be flattered to be considered by the
Dodgers.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to explore the Safeway market to find a new paper bag
to barf in."</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "The Mets need a break from the Bobby Valentine high
intensity-type manager. My pick would be Willie Nelson."</TE>
<TE>   Says it all: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "Maybe
no other sport has quite the variety and bluntness as ice hockey, my
favorite T-shirt summary of the sport being, 'If You Die, We Split
Your Gear,' although my preferred bumper sticker is 'My Son
Cross-Checked Your Honors Student.' "</TE>
<TE>   The real reason: Jay Leno, explaining why President Bush gave
Monday's speech in Cincinnati: "He was in Cincinnati to declare the
Bengals' stadium a disaster area."</TE>
<TE>   Golfer's best friend: Retired L.A. Times columnist Chuck Hillinger
has this golf story: "A friend, Jim Killough of San Pedro, always
brings along nuts to feed the squirrels at Harbor Golf Course--a city
course.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently while playing in his every-Friday five-some Killough
made a long putt on the par-three eighth hole. As the ball neared the
hole and was about to stop an inch or two from going in, a squirrel
ran up and pushed the ball into the hole. We were amazed."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Eleven holes in the 1949 Motor City Open. Cary
Middlecoff and Lloyd Mangrum were declared co-winners by mutual
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Mike Scioscia
as manager of the White Sox? It could have happened, former Dodger
general manager Fred Claire says. In the mid '90s, Sox General
Manager Ron Schueler called to ask permission to talk to Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fine with Claire, but Scioscia declined because he felt he
needed more seasoning as an instructor and minor-league manager.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It was typical of Mike to have a plan to get the experience he
felt he needed before taking a job, even though his goal was to
manage at the major league level,' Claire said. 'I felt he would and
should be manager of the Dodgers one day.'</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that after managing in the Dodgers' minor-league
organization, Scioscia was let go and now finds himself managing the
Angels in the American League championship series. Everybody knows
where we can find the White Sox, of course."</TE>

<HD>Camp Turns Gimpy for the Older Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal sat on a folding chair, rolling metal balls in his
hand, and Rick Fox teetered nearby, his achy lower back not quite
ready to support him while standing upright.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Horry had a pad on his right knee and a scowl on his face,
Tracy Murray didn't practice at all because of pain in his right hip,
still mending from surgery six months ago, and Samaki Walker left the
practice floor with trainer Gary Vitti and a slight limp.</LD>
<LD>   Spirited only a few days ago, Laker practice in El Segundo was a
little glum on Wednesday, still nearly three weeks from opening
night.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a hard time for the older players," Coach Phil Jackson said.
"It's tough physically to get their game legs and to see the
importance for enthusiasm for basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's time for young players with live legs and
ambitions."</TE>
<TE>   Not that that necessarily would get them jobs. The Lakers have 12
players under guaranteed contracts, and while Jackson spoke well of
guard Jannero Pargo and forward Guy Rucker, in particular, it would
take something dramatic to have the organization carry a 13th player
and push it further into the luxury-tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal continues on his regimen of cardiovascular fitness, clearly
pleased with his recovery and what it promises for his game.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like he has all the motivation in the world to come back
and destroy these cats," Kobe Bryant said. "It ought to be a fun
year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers travel after practice today to Little Rock, Ark., where
they'll play the Memphis Grizzlies, run now by Jerry West, in an
exhibition game on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, they'll fly to Oklahoma City to play the Denver
Nuggets on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The team is not scheduled to practice Sunday, starting a week that
will have  exhibition games Thursday at the Arrowhead Pond against
the Golden State Warriors and Saturday in Las Vegas against the
Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers waived Nick Sheppard, the forward from Pepperdine.
Their roster is at 17.... Jackson said Murray's sore hip is not
considered serious and was not  unexpected. Though not yet
comfortable, Fox practiced and then stayed late, shooting jumpers....
The Lakers did about six sprints after practice. Bryant led them all.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller bounced one pass through a tangle of legs and arms,
into the waiting hands of Corey Maggette, who dropped the basketball
into the basket during the Clippers' 101-99 exhibition victory
Tuesday over the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller airmailed another to Maggette, who leaped to gather the
ball in his hands before slamming it through the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper bench, and a predominantly pro-Laker sellout crowd of
10,097 at Bakersfield, gasped and cheered after two of Miller's more
remarkable assists.</TE>
<TE>   After only one exhibition game, it's clear the Clippers are richer
at the point guard position than perhaps at any time in their
woebegone history.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Marko Jaric, who did not play Tuesday because of a
groin strain, have moved the ball at a remarkable pace during
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are going to love playing with them," Coach Alvin Gentry
said recently. "They tend to pass the ball as soon as they get it,
which is a novel approach."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking help at the point, the Clippers acquired Miller in a trade
with the Cleveland Cavaliers and signed Jaric, a second-round draft
pick in 2000, and said farewell to Jeff McInnis, who signed with the
Portland Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said he is considering playing Miller and Jaric together at
times during the Clippers' exhibition schedule, which continues
tonight at Portland.</TE>
<TE>   If that goes well, you can count on seeing them together when the
regular season begins Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We played well," Miller said after finishing with 17 points, six
assists and three rebounds in 29 minutes against the Lakers. "We
played together. Everybody was involved. Everybody made plays. We're
athletic. We have a lot of depth. We have guys who can step in and
make plays."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Wang Zhizhi has been kicked off China's national team for
choosing to play with the Clippers instead of at the Asian Games,
state media reported in Beijing. Wang signed an offer sheet last week
with the Clippers that the Dallas Mavericks have until next week to
match.... Minnesota Timberwolves' guard Wally Szczerbiak is expected
to be sidelined for up to two weeks after dislocating his little left
toe in Tuesday's exhibition opener.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chinese center Yao Ming, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, agreed
to a four-year, $17.8-million contract with the Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, competing in the Asian Games, is expected to join the Rockets
by Oct. 20.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Ortiz Has His Father on His Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>   Look, just because new documentation advanced his age from 26 to
29 last winter didn't mean Ramon Ortiz had suddenly become three
years more fluent in his second language.</LD>
<LD>   The Dominican Republic right-hander is working at it, however. He
is trying to express his thoughts and emotions in English rather than
leaning on coaches Bobby Ramos and Alfredo Griffin for Spanish
translation, and Wednesday night he found a way to answer some very
tough questions in a style everyone understood.</LD>
<TE>   Could he help get the Angels back to Anaheim with a split of the
first two games in the best-of-seven American League championship
series?</TE>
<TE>   Could he do a better job of controlling his emotions, regain his
September form (4-0, 2.73 earned-run average) in a 15-9 breakout
season and put the memory of his abbreviated start against the New
York Yankees in Game 3 of the division series behind him?</TE>
<TE>   Could he continue to overcome the ache of his father's fight with
a life-sapping lung and breathing condition, wishing he could be with
him in the Dominican?</TE>
<TE>   As Ortiz left the team's Minneapolis hotel Wednesday afternoon, he
tapped his heart and said:</TE>
<TE>   "When I take the mound tonight my father is right here."</TE>
<TE>   When Ortiz took the mound, he would call on that heart while
displaying more tenacity than artistry, more grit than gloss.</TE>
<TE>   He would provide the foundation for a 6-3 victory over the
Minnesota Twins and immediately think of his ailing father.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy for the opportunity to pitch in the playoffs and I
want to go to the World Series, but I also want to be with my
father," Ortiz said. "He is not doing well, and I can only hope he
was able to watch me tonight. I know he would be happy."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels definitely were.</TE>
<TE>   Another meltdown--Ortiz worked only 2 2/3 innings against the
Yankees and left losing, 6-1, before the Angels rallied for a 9-6
victory--and his team might have flown home 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   "All players have pride," pitching coach Bud Black said, "and
Ramon wanted this. He wanted redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first inning or so you could see it on his face, see it
in his eyes. He was determined."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz pitched five shutout innings, allowing the Angels to build a
6-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   As for the emotion rattling noise of a crowd of 55,990 in the
Metrodome?</TE>
<TE>   "I've pitched in the playoffs in the Dominican, and there are a
lot of crazy people there, too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Homer Dome itself, the pitcher who led the American
League in home runs allowed avoided giving up any.</TE>
<TE>   He picked Luis Rivas off first after his leadoff single in the
third, got double-play grounders after leadoff singles in the fourth
and fifth, walked only one after walking four in that brief start
against the Yankees and ultimately left during a three-run sixth when
his adrenaline finally evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with 10 hits, but there is a 'W' by his name in the
box score, and his team is even, with the next three games in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "This was big for the team and big for Ramon," said Black. "We
obviously needed him to pitch well early. So much of what Ramon is
about is confidence, getting on a roll. In the three years we've been
here as a staff, we've seen him take gradual steps along the way, and
it's still happening in every facet of his game. The big thing is
that he's thinking more, not just throwing."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was registering in the mid-90s at times on the Metrodome
speed gun, his breaking stuff in the low 80s. In analyzing what went
wrong in the Yankee start after his big September, Manager Mike
Scioscia said he felt Ortiz "was overthrowing, trying to do too
much." He had gone eight days between starts, Scioscia said, "and
we've seen that happen with him before when he's had that much rest."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Ortiz was working on his normal fifth day, and he said,
"I had a good slider, good fastball, good location and good focus. I
made too many mistakes against the Yankees and I didn't have good
location. I needed to do this tonight. It was very important for me
and the team."</TE>
<TE>   In the nine innings of two previous starts at the Metrodome, Ortiz
had allowed nine runs, but he erased those demons as well before
turning it over to a bullpen that gave up only a single in the final
3 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Francisco Rodriguez worked another 1 2/3 shutout innings,
striking out three of the seven batters he faced, and Ortiz smiled
and said, "This guy can pitch. Great fastball, great slider. Ninety
four, ninety five (mph). He's nasty. Nobody can touch this guy now."</TE>
<TE>   So, the Angels went home happy, and now Jarrod Washburn will pitch
Game 3 and John Lackey Game 4. Kevin Appier will come back in Game 5,
and then the Angels will decide, if the series isn't over, whether to
bring Washburn back on three days' rest in Game 6 or save him for
Game 7, if there is a Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Should Washburn go in Game 6, Ortiz would have to pitch Game 7, if
it's needed, the biggest test yet for his emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," said Black, "the guy won 15 games, led our staff in
innings and was in the top 10 [in the league] in strikeouts and
opponents' batting average (.230). Nothing is official yet, but we're
not hesitant to give him the ball in any situation."</TE>
<TE>   A Game 7 would be the ultimate situation, of course, but hasn't
Ortiz pitched in those zany Dominican playoffs, didn't he hold it
together in the madcap Metrodome, and what heavy hitting lineup
compares to coping with a heavy heart?</TE>
<TE>   "I love my family," Ortiz said, packing for Anaheim with his mind
on the Dominican. "My dad taught me the game when I was young. I am
thinking of him at all times."</TE>

<LD>Lee Janzen and Steve Jones won U.S. Opens by grinding their way
through the toughest of conditions. Both showed Wednesday they can
play a bit on easy courses, too.</LD>
<LD>   Janzen, trying to win for the first time since the 1998 U.S. Open,
made 10 birdies on his way to a nine-under-par 63 in the first round
of the Invensys Classic at Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Jones had a 62, but his came at the par-71 TPC Canyons course,
while Janzen played the par-72 TPC Summerlin course. Both have some
hope that their droughts may be over.</LD>
<TE>   "In 1995 if someone had said you're going to win only once more
over the next seven years I wouldn't have believed it," Janzen said.</TE>

<HD>Falcons' Vick Is Still Doubtful</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>

<LD>Atlanta Falcon quarterback Michael Vick skipped practice Wednesday
and remained doubtful for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Vick sprained his right, nonthrowing shoulder in Atlanta's 20-6
loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Johnson will make his first start this season if Vick is
unable to play.</LD>
<TE>   "We won't rule him out," Coach Dan Reeves said of Vick. "It's just
what the comfort level is as far as the pain is concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Vick was injured early in the third quarter against the
Buccaneers. He was flushed out of the pocket by Warren Sapp and
sacked by Simeon Rice, landing hard on his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still sore but it's getting better," Vick said. "I am
getting as much treatment as I can--three times a day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Brown linebacker Darren Hambrick practiced and is
expected to play Sunday at Tampa Bay despite being charged with
stealing a check for about $5,700 from the Carolina Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   Hambrick is accused of stealing the money three weeks after
joining the Panthers in October 2001 according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   He flew to Florida on Monday and surrendered to authorities, who
had issued an arrest warrant for the fifth-year linebacker in August,
just days before he signed with the Browns. He was released on
$10,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Hambrick, 27, was issued a payroll check from the Panthers on Nov.
11, but then asked the team to stop payment because he never received
it, records said.</TE>
<TE>   Another check for the same amount was sent to Hambrick, and on
Jan. 29 a man who identified himself as Hambrick cashed both checks
at a Bank of America branch in Dade City, Fla., according to the
records.</TE>
<TE>   A bank representative told a detective she contacted Hambrick and
asked him to return the $5,682.51, but he refused, the records said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Raven middle linebacker Ray Lewis sat out practice
because of a sore shoulder and was listed as doubtful for Sunday's
game against Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis partially dislocated his left shoulder Sunday night against
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan end Carlos Hall sat out practice and Coach Jeff
Fisher said the rookie might need surgery on his right knee as soon
as today.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans had hoped Hall could practice and play through torn
cartilage in the knee, at least until end Jevon Kearse returns from a
broken foot. But Hall, who has four sacks as Kearse's replacement,
hurt too much to practice.</TE>
<TE>   Kearse might not return until Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Mike Jones was re-signed by the Oakland Raiders, who
cut him last month.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who made the game-saving tackle in St. Louis' Super Bowl
victory over Tennessee in January 2000 will play Sunday against St.
Louis if rookie Napoleon Harris is unable to play because of a
shoulder injury.</TE>

<HD>Messier Still Has Scoring Touch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Ranger fans calling for Mark Messier to retire better think
again.</LD>
<LD>   The 41-year-old Messier scored twice in a three-minute span and
goaltender Mike Richter moved within three wins of 300, giving Bryan
Trottier a victory in his first game as Ranger coach as New York beat
the Carolina Hurricanes, 4-1, Wednesday night at Raleigh, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The captain of the Rangers missed 41 games last season because of
shoulder problems, scoring only seven goals. But Messier was strong
at the start of his 24th NHL season, moving past Detroit's Steve
Yzerman and into seventh place on the all-time goals list.</LD>
<TE>   Messier scored his 659th goal nine seconds after Carolina failed
to score on one of its nine unsuccessful power plays. He added goal
No. 660 three minutes later from the side of the net as the Rangers
cashed in with the man advantage to go up, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a chance this year to control our own destiny," Messier
said. "So, through training camp we worked hard on detail.... For the
first game of the year that was an unbelievable pace."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 36-year-old Richter won No. 297 against the
defending Eastern Conference champions, losing his shutout bid when
Rod Brind'Amour scored with 3:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 1, Colorado 1--Colorado's Radim Vrbata scored the tying
goal in the third period, and the Avalanche tied the Stars at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Niko Kapanen scored at 4:20 of the first period--the first
goal of the NHL season and the first of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas goaltender Marty Turco had 40 saves, and Colorado's Patrick
Roy had 24.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas center Jason Arnott had to be helped from the ice after
injuring his right leg when he was dragged down by Vaclav Nedorost
near the goal in the first period. He did not return and was to be
reevaluated today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Kovalev, one of the NHL's top scorers the last two seasons,
and Pittsburgh broke off contract extension talks until after the
season.... Forward Chris Gratton missed a second day of practice
because of a broken left foot and is listed as questionable for
Buffalo's season opener tonight. Gratton was injured in a game
against Toronto on Sept. 27, but continued to skate before sitting
out Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>It's the Bronze Age in L.A. as Gretzky Is Immortalized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone finally caught Wayne Gretzky.</LD>
<LD>   Not until he had been retired for three years, of course, and
after he had passed his 41st birthday.</LD>
<LD>   And it was no ordinary defenseman or checking forward who snared
him. It took Eric Blome, an artist of supreme talent, to capture
him--or at least his essence--in lovingly sculpted bronze with a
granite base, creating a commanding, 1,300-pound statue that was
unveiled Wednesday in the Star Plaza in front of Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   To the man who has everything and has given hockey so much, the
Kings gave the ultimate gift on the night they also retired his
jersey: a little slice of immortality.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on a slab of steel, motionless as he never was on the
ice, the inanimate Gretzky is larger than life--125% of his actual
6-foot frame, in fact. He's tousle-haired, wearing a King jersey and
raising his right arm to acknowledge an ovation from the crowd. His
left hand is lowered and gripping his stick; his right glove is
tucked under his left arm, a pose based on a photo taken after he
scored his 802nd goal</TE>
<TE>   It was a familiar stance, one he assumed after so many of the
ovations he received for his hundreds of remarkable feats. Gretzky
was involved in so many memories, so many records, that the highlight
film shown on the scoreboard before the Kings' 4-1 victory over the
Phoenix Coyotes Wednesday could touch on a scant few.</TE>
<TE>   There was his 100th playoff goal. His 801st goal. His 1,851st
point, which broke Gordie Howe's seemingly unbreakable career scoring
record. Snippets of a brilliant career, one unlike any before or
since or maybe ever again.</TE>
<TE>   "On behalf of your league and your fans," NHL Commissioner Gary
Bettman said, "Wayne, we thank you for being the greatest."</TE>
<TE>   Watching his hockey life unfold on the scoreboard, serenaded with
rhythmic chants of "Gretz-ky!" in a cavernous arena built by
billionaires and priced for millionaires, Gretzky wiped away a tear.</TE>
<TE>   He was surrounded by his parents, Walter and Phyllis, his wife,
Janet, and their children, Paulina, Ty, Trevor and 2-year-old
Tristan, saucer-eyed in his father's arms.</TE>
<TE>   He was surrounded by a veritable Kings Hall of Fame: former coach
Barry Melrose, former teammates Jari Kurri, Kelly Hrudey, Paul
Coffey, Pat Conacher and Dave Taylor, former General Manager Rogie
Vachon. Former teammate Luc Robitaille, given permission to attend on
the eve of the Detroit Red Wings' opener at San Jose. Former owner
Bruce McNall, whose financial follies nearly brought the Kings to
ruin and cost Gretzky more than $1 million--but not at the cost of
Gretzky's friendship.</TE>
<TE>   And he was surrounded by the love of a family of fans who made him
feel at home though he stood at center ice in a place he had never
truly lived in.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky's King days were spent at the Forum, which in its later
years was far less than fabulous. By the time Staples Center opened
its doors, he had hung up his skates and left his name in the NHL
record books more than 60 times.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he can claim ownership of Staples, too, because if not for
him and the glamour he brought to the game, hockey might not be as
strongly entrenched as it is and Staples Center might not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, isn't home where you hang your jersey?</TE>
<TE>   His hangs in the rafters, near the "people up top" he was careful
to thank in his brief but beautifully articulated speech. As during
his career, his verbal aim was true.</TE>
<TE>   To Bettman, who had been booed when he walked onto the ice,
Gretzky said, "This is the greatest game in the world. I thank you
for letting me play it."</TE>
<TE>   To the assembled Kings, torn between paying him the proper tribute
and eagerness to begin their season, and their coach, Andy Murray, he
wished luck. And probably meant it, too. After all, even though he
owns 20% of the Coyotes, he still lives in Southern California and
has a suite at Staples, and he can appreciate good hockey.</TE>
<TE>   To the sellout crowd of 18,260 he gave a heartfelt thanks. "When I
came here in 1988, I never thought we'd have a day like this, believe
me," he said. "I want to say to all of the fans who treated me and my
family so nicely, I want to thank them all."</TE>
<TE>   More than a few, no doubt, saw their first game while Gretzky
played here, and came back after he left.</TE>
<TE>   "Hockey wasn't expected to survive here," he said during a pregame
news conference. "The fans deserve a lot of credit for their support.
They showed Los Angeles is not only a good sports city, it's a good
hockey city."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, like on so many nights between 1988 and 1996, it was
the Great One's city.</TE>

<HD>Riled-Up Giants Defeat Cardinals</HD>
<DH>Baseball: San Francisco wins Game 1 of championship series,
9-6, after tempers flare and a near brawl erupts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>With 15 runs and 22 hits Wednesday night in the opener of the
National League championship series, the sound of ball hitting wood
was repeated over and over.</LD>
<LD>   But the loudest noise of the night came from a pitch that hit
nothing but St. Louis Cardinal catcher Mike Matheny's glove.</LD>
<LD>   It ignited a near brawl, established an angry mood for this
best-of-seven series, fired up the St. Louis Cardinals, infuriated
the San Francisco Giants and left Tony La Russa and Dusty Baker, the
respective managers and close friends, yelling in each other's faces
until they were separated.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately, the uproar didn't change the outcome. The Giants,
leading 7-1 when St. Louis right-hander Mike Crudale's inside pitch
on Giant outfielder Kenny Lofton started the incident, went on to
win, 9-6, in front of a Busch Stadium crowd of 52,175.</TE>
<TE>   Will there be ramifications tonight when the teams play Game 2?
Was Baker drawing a line in the sand to establish his turf in this
series?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't draw lines," he said. "I don't knock chips off anybody's
shoulder. We just play. We don't start nothing, but we don't take
nothing, either."</TE>
<TE>   Each side hit three home runs, Lofton, David Bell and Benito
Santiago connecting for the Giants, and Albert Pujols, Miguel Cairo
and J.D. Drew for the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton's homer came with the bases empty in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton appeared to relish the moment, which may have incensed the
Cardinals, but he wasn't about to apologize when the game was over.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the playoffs," Lofton said. "You have fun and enjoy it.
No, I don't think I did anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "When [St. Louis'] Jim Edmonds hit a home run against [Arizona's]
Randy Johnson, he started pointing in the dugout. I didn't do none of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal starter and loser Matt Morris gave up the Lofton homer.
But when the Giant center fielder came up in the fifth, Crudale was
on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   When the pitch came inside, eye level but not close to Lofton's
head, he started yelling at Crudale. Matheny responded and Lofton
turned his venom on the St. Louis catcher. Both benches emptied and
soon Barry Bonds, spewing some well-chosen words of his own, had to
be shoved away from the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "That was very unnecessary," said La Russa of Lofton's outburst.
"It's a trick I've seen him pull before, causing a lot of stirring
and people saying nasty things to each other. You throw the ball
inside and he's always reacting like you're trying to hit him."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, of course, didn't agree.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he overreacted," Baker said. "What are you going
to do when a guy throws the ball up around your head?"</TE>
<TE>   La Russa told Baker it had started in the first inning when Giant
starter and winner Kirk Rueter hit St. Louis shortstop Edgar Renteria
in the leg with two on and two out.</TE>
<TE>   Baker denied that was deliberate and back and forth they went,
charges and counter-charges.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in all the heat were two other key factors in the game:</TE>
<TE>   * La Russa surprisingly stuck with Morris long after he looked
liked nothing more than a high-priced batting-practice pitcher,
allowing Morris to go 4 1/3 innings even though he gave up seven runs
and 10 hits, six hits in a row in the second inning when the Giants
scored four times.</TE>
<TE>   * With all the conjecture about whether the Cardinals would pitch
to Bonds in this series, Santiago drew a line of his own in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals pitched to Bonds twice and walked him three times.
The result: A two-run triple and a groundout for the game's most
dominating hitter.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cardinal strategy of pitching around Bonds will only work
if the hitter behind him, Santiago, doesn't make St. Louis pay for
it.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals paid dearly Wednesday. Santiago had three hits and
four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to see that guy go to first base," said Santiago of
Bonds, "because this is the best hitter we have. I would like to see
him swing the bat so we could put some more RBIs up there."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, Santiago emphasized that point by putting up some
RBIs of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton made his point as well.</TE>
<TE>   Lines have been drawn, challenges have been issued, angry words
have been exchanged, friendships have been put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   And this was only the opener.</TE>

<KH>GIANT-CARDINAL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Rolen Might Be Ready for Game 3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Tony La Russa should feel right at home on the gambling boats that
line the shores of the Mississippi River alongside this town.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis Cardinal manager spun his own wheel of chance
Wednesday when he put his injured third baseman, Scott Rolen, on the
active roster for the National League championship series.</LD>
<LD>   La Russa doesn't know when, or even if, Rolen, who has a sprained
left shoulder, will be ready to play. Rolen is definitely out until
at least Game 3 Saturday. And in the meantime, the Cardinals are
playing a man short, with only four reserves.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's a risk and a gamble," said La Russa's San Francisco
Giant counterpart, Dusty Baker. "I would not want to be in that
situation."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa said his optimism springs from the steady progress Rolen
has made since he was injured in Game 2 of the division series
against the Arizona Diamondbacks when pinch-runner Alex Cintron
collided with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was here Sunday when [Rolen] got treatment and he could not
raise his arm," La Russa said. "Monday, he could raise it to here
[indicating chest level]. [Tuesday] he got it up to here [above the
head]. I think we all would have had a bigger regret if, sometime
this weekend, Scott Rolen is ready to go and he's off the list. We
didn't think it would be worth the risk."</TE>
<TE>   Rolen stepped into the batting cage Wednesday, bat in hand, but
didn't take a swing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to see some pitches," he said, "standing in the
box."</TE>
<TE>   Obtained from the Philadelphia Phillies in a trade in late July,
Rolen batted .278 for the Cardinals in 55 games with 14 home runs and
44 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen insists he won't play until he's ready.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to hurry and get on the field is one thing," he said. "But
if you're going to bring the ballclub down, not help the team, I
don't think that's worth it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis right-hander Woody Williams, who sat out the division
series because of a pulled muscle on his side, was added to the
roster and will start tonight's game. To make room for Williams, the
Cardinals deactivated right-hander Luther Hackman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Giants made a one roster move, adding left-handed pitcher Chad
Zerbe in place of right-hander Manny Aybar.</TE>

<LD>A driver in the minor league ARCA series crashed into a wall
Wednesday and seconds later was broadsided by another car, killing
him and injuring the other driver.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Martin radioed his team, "I'm all right," after he spun and
rammed the wall backward coming out of the fourth turn in practice at
Lowe's Motor Speedway. But the other car, driven by Deborah Renshaw,
came around the turn going at least 160 mph and plowed into Martin's
car on the driver's side.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, 33, died instantly of massive internal injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Renshaw, 25, was taken to a Charlotte hospital, where she was in
fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   ARCA drivers are required to wear head and neck restraints.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was from Hixson, Tenn. He is survived by wife Tammy and two
children.</TE>
<TE>   His death is the 15th at Lowe's, the eighth involving a stock car
driver.</TE>

<LD>Angels Know All About</LD>
<LD>   Playing Second Fiddle</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago White Sox long have believed, often to the point of
distraction, that they're second citizens in the Second City.</LD>
<TE>   The Cubs cast a big shadow, it's true, but if the Sox would loosen
up a little bit, they would notice that the shadow looks something
like a large stuffed animal with motor-skills problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Sox instead might want to start paying attention to the
Anaheim Angels, who have managed to work their way out of the Los
Angeles Dodgers' shadow and into the light of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's anything tricky," said Angel General Manager
Bill Stoneman, who pitched for the Cubs in 1967 and 1968 before being
paroled to Montreal. "I don't spend my days thinking, 'We're second
to the Dodgers.' My job is to get the best players for [Manager] Mike
Scioscia and see how many games he can win with them."</TE>
<TE>   A lot, as it turns out, including Game 2 of the American League
championship series on Wednesday night, a 6-3 victory over the
Minnesota Twins. Some of the credit goes to Stoneman, a man working
with limited resources. At the start of the season, the Angels had a
payroll of $61.7 million, 15th out of 30 major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   Disney increased its payroll by $13 million for this season, even
though attendance had dropped in 2001. The Angels improved this year,
and so did attendance. Funny how that works.</TE>
<TE>   The moral of the Angels' story is that neither ownership nor money
is necessarily the most important element in winning. Decision-making
abilities are.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody takes shots at Disney because they're an easy target,"
Stoneman said. "They think the people upstairs are pulling my
strings. There couldn't be anything further from the truth. I wish
they weren't selling."</TE>
<TE>   None of that matters right now, not with the Angels in the heat of
the playoffs. Come to think of it, the Dodgers don't matter much
right now.</TE>

<TE>   That should have been the battle cry for the Twins as they headed
to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   There is this mystique surrounding the Twins' glories of 1987 and
1991 that it can be traced strictly to Metrodome magic.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a Twins follower who believes in that, then there's a
feeling of gloom this morning after the 6-3 loss to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   But the Twins were in exactly this same predicament when playing a
very strong Toronto team in the 1991 ALCS.</TE>
<TE>   Four years earlier, the Twins had gone 6-0 in the Metrodome while
winning the ALCS and the World Series. This led to the belief around
here that hard turf and ear-splitting noise would carry the Twins to
victory in any playoff showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in Game 2 of the '91 ALCS, Toronto right-hander Juan
Guzman--followed by the hard-throwing bullpen duo of Tom Henke and
Duane Ward--shut down the Twins for a 5-2 victory at the Dome.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins headed for Toronto with the series tied, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   The third game of the league championship series went into extra
innings. Pagliarulo hit a home run in the top of the 10th off Mike
Timlin. The Twins won 3-2, then won two more against the deflated
Blue Jays in the SkyDome and completed a five-game romp through the
ALCS.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>   Touched by an Angel.</LD>
<LD>   Of course that was it. What else could it be?</LD>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins turned up the rap music late Wednesday and
wandered through their clubhouse with an unfamiliar wince.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so ... unfortunate," said first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz. "Real unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   They had seen it happen seemingly everywhere else this fall, from
Seattle to New York, this certain relentless baseball magic that
leads to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   And now it had happened to them? The team that was supposed to be
the most magical of all?</TE>
<TE>   In a second inning that defined a season, the Twins were touched
by an Angel.</TE>
<TE>   Six of them, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of this American League championship series, neither
team may be the same.</TE>
<TE>   What should have been the Angels' most embarrassing postseason
inning became their most energized.</TE>
<TE>   What could have been a grand Twins' escape left them captives to
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of about 15 minutes, the Angels were fooled on the
basepaths not once, not twice, but three times.</TE>
<TE>   They survived to score not one, not two, but three runs.</TE>
<TE>   In that same span, the sure-handed Twins made not one, not two,
but three fielding mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   They survived not.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels win this series that is tied at one game apiece
after their 6-3 victory in Wednesday's Game 2, everyone will look
back at that second inning.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, they will say. It happened then.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you see some things and you just aren't sure ... " said
Angel third base coach Ron Roenicke, as exhausted as any of the
players.</TE>
<TE>   Not sure how. Not sure why.</TE>
<TE>   After the second inning, the Angels are going to stop asking.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to think, well, this is how it's been all year for
this team," said second baseman Adam Kennedy. "So this is how it has
to be."</TE>
<TE>   The victorious inning started with a concession speech.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus, behind 1-and-2 in the count, conceded to batting coach
Mickey Hatcher that there are times he should shorten his swing and
hit to right field.</TE>
<TE>   So he did, slapping a single off Rick Reed, his first hit of the
series.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking about this before the game, and I was telling
him, make them adjust to you, go with what they give you," Hatcher
said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   That tiny gold angel pin on Hatcher's red uniform jacket was just
a coincidence, right?</TE>
<TE>   The next batter, Brad Fullmer, hit a looping shot to right-center
field. Running to the ball was right fielder Michael Cuddyer.</TE>
<TE>   But the rookie must not know Fullmer or the Angels, because he
wasn't running hard enough, and Fullmer sneaked to second base while
moving Glaus to third.</TE>
<TE>   Next up, Scott Spiezio, who hit a ball right back at Cuddyer, this
time a blooper that was poorly played and bounced over the rookie's
head.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus scored, Fullmer took third, Spiezio took second, and the
Twins were growing angry.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a real chip on our shoulder about our defense," said
Mientkiewicz. "We take this stuff personally."</TE>
<TE>   But then most of 55,990 breathed a sigh of relief when, one out
later, on Kennedy's bouncer back to the pitcher, Fullmer was caught
running on contact and was thrown out at home without even drawing a
rundown long enough to allow Kennedy to reach second.</TE>
<TE>   That was the Angels' first mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Their second mistake occurred moments later when Kennedy was
fooled by that cliche look-toward- third-then-throw-to-first pitching
move.</TE>
<TE>   Reed threw to first, Kennedy's spikes dragged him to the turf,
three out, inning over, right?</TE>
<TE>   "But the thing about this team is, we never give up," said David
Eckstein, batting at the time.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of quickly ending his embarrassment by allowing himself
to be tagged, Kennedy hopped up and ran toward second base in hopes
of causing a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz, knowing this was Kennedy's ploy, faked the throw to
second base.</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough ...</TE>
<TE>   "I went for the fake and took off for home the minute his arm
pumped," said Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   The third mistake.</TE>
<TE>   But look what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz smartly threw the ball home. Spiezio, knowing he
would be out if he slid, decided to attempt to run over the catcher.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Pierzynski, seemingly stunned that Spiezio was not sliding,
applied a weak brush tag to his leg. The force of Spiezio's knee
knocked the ball loose, allowing that run to score.</TE>
<TE>   The best part of it was, did you see where Kennedy ended up? Yep,
he ran all the way to third base.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then did you see what Eckstein did?</TE>
<TE>   After hitting three foul balls before the pickoff play, Eckstein
fouled off another one after that, meaning he had fought off three
two-strike pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Then he singled to right, scoring Kennedy with the third run after
perhaps his best at-bat in a postseason full of them.</TE>
<TE>   "That was ugly, wasn't it?" Eckstein said, grinning. "But you can
always tell when I'm feeling good at the plate, because I'm fouling
off a lot of balls."</TE>
<TE>   After Erstad flied out to end the inning, the score was still only
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   But to a Twin team that rarely plays this poorly at home, it felt
like 40-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We did everything right," said Manager Ron Gardenhire on the
pickoff play, later adding, "We got everything right.... I don't know
what we could have done more."</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of wonder that seeps into teams and weakens their
will.</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of wonder that allowed the Angels to break the
Seattle Mariners and Boston Red Sox in the final month of the regular
season, and then finish the Yankees last week.</TE>
<TE>   After losing a postseason game at the Metrodome for only the third
time in 16 occasions Wednesday, the Twins probably flew toward
California with all kind of emotions. Wondering. Wishing. Touched.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES: ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>Rodriguez More Than Man in the Middle</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>It is a joy to watch Francisco Rodriguez pitch.</LD>
<LD>   His arm is live, his motion is flawless. His fastball jumps out of
his hand, a skittering, weaving object. His slider sweeps, makes a
giant arc so that it seems more of a curveball. His body, loose and
limber, is always in balance. His eyes focus ahead, on the job to do
and nothing else.</LD>
<LD>   Until the pitching is done and then Rodriguez smiles, laughs or
sometimes frowns.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday night at the pulsating Metrodome, where the 55,990 fans
were standing and hollering in anticipation of watching a 20-year-old
rookie who has been a big league pitcher less than a month fold and
collapse, Rodriguez was a star.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   We keep waiting for Angel Manager Mike Scioscia to bring in this
wide-eyed kid from Venezuela one time too often. We keep expecting
the Angels to discover that there is a situation too pressure-packed
for Rodriguez, who will show some fear or hesitancy that will make
him melt on the mound, force him to get wild with his fastball or
weak-kneed with his slider.</TE>
<TE>   But not yet. Not this time, not against the Minnesota Twins in
Game 2 of the American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, with the momentum of a 6-0 lead having
faded along with starter Ramon Ortiz's concentration, the Angels led,
6-3. Brendan Donnelly had relieved Ortiz and gotten out of a
sixth-inning mess.</TE>
<TE>   And now it was Rodriguez's turn. His job was to get the Angels far
enough along for closer Troy Percival to get a save.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Rodriguez was practicing for next year, auditioning
for the Angels by helping them close on their first playoff berth
since 1986. Now Rodriguez had appeared in three playoff games against
the New York Yankees. He had won two of them and had become the
answer to a trivia question: Who was the only player to get his first
two major league wins in the postseason?</TE>
<TE>   But in 20 days, Rodriguez has become another piece of this Angel
puzzle. He fits naturally between Donnelly and Percival. Donnelly is
31 and needed 10 years to get to this spot; Rodriguez took about 10
minutes. Then the Angels get to one of baseball's best closers.</TE>
<TE>   So in the seventh, Rodriguez struck out his first Twin, Luis
Rivas, on that slider, which swooped in at 84 mph and followed 94 mph
and 93 mph fastballs. Next, leadoff man Jacque Jones flied out to
left after getting behind in the count, 1-2. It was the slider again,
after three fastballs, that did the trick. Cristian Guzman, who had
two hits and scored a run, struck out looking helplessly at a 94 mph
fastball. Rodriguez pounded his glove and grinned as he walked off
the mound.</TE>
<TE>   And he got to start the eighth in style, striking out Corey Koskie
and getting designated hitter David Ortiz to line to first on an 0-1
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   But Torii Hunter walked and Doug Mientkiewicz followed with a
single, and as pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty came to bat, Scioscia called
for Percival. Rodriguez walked out of the game and he was talking to
himself, enthusiastically.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so mad," Rodriguez said, "because I gave up the single on
an 0-2 pitch, the slider, and I shouldn't have done that. I should
have got that out."</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel starter Kevin Appier: "That's what you like about the
kid. It's not how he handles himself when things are going easy. It's
how he handles himself when things aren't going so easy. He
understands."</TE>
<TE>   For 30 minutes after the game, Rodriguez hypnotized listeners with
a story of poverty, sacrifice, love, despair and joy.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has 13 brothers and sisters. When he was two months old,
his parents split.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me to my grandmother and my grandfather, Isabel and
Francisco Rodriguez," Rodriguez said, "and they took me and raised me
and made me happy. It was not easy. We were poor, yes. I would wear
the same shoes for two years or three. But we always had food and we
always had love."</TE>
<TE>   When he was 2 or 3, Rodriguez said, his grandfather, whom he calls
"Dad," started taking Rodriguez to watch his uncle play for a college
team in Caracas, where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved watching my uncle," Rodriguez said. "And I wanted to play
this game all the time."</TE>
<TE>   He speaks every day to Isabel, his mother in every way except
birth. He tells her how much fun he has. She tells him to eat and
sleep well and stay healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez says he feels no nerves when he walks onto the mound.
"What I know is that baseball is fun and this is fun and sometimes I
have to pinch myself to see if this is real. Am I really in the
playoffs? Am I really pitching almost every day? I pinch myself and
it hurts, so, yes, this is real."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire seemed to need to rub his eyes
after he watched Rodriguez. "First time we've seen the kid," he said.
"Wow, the ball was jumping out of his hand."</TE>
<TE>   It jumps, it hops, it roars, it soars in so many ways. It comes
from a talented and competitive kid who could hardly wait to shower
and call Isabel and say that, yes, he was eating and sleeping well
and staying healthy. And making hitters ill.</TE>

<KH>Soccer DAILY REPORT</KH>
<HD>MLS Adding Two Teams Within Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Soccer will expand from 10 teams to 12 within the next
year, Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, said
Wednesday at Futbol de Primera's fifth Honda Soccer Symposium in
Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "Within the next 365 days, the league will announce that it will
be adding two more teams," Leiweke said. "Then we will add two more
down the road."</LD>
<LD>   AEG controls six of the MLS teams, but Leiweke said the expansion
teams would not be run by AEG.</LD>
<TE>   "Our purpose is not to be the majority owner of MLS," he said.
"Someday we will have 20 teams with 20 different owners. We are
committed to MLS, but we don't want to dominate MLS."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson, Hermosillo</TE>
<TE>   Among those attending Wednesday's symposium was Steve Sampson, the
former U.S. national team coach who last week was named coach of
Costa Rica, and Carlos Hermosillo, the former Galaxy star and one of
the all-time leading goal scorers in Mexican soccer history.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud to be the first American coach to have the
opportunity to coach the national team of a different country," said
Sampson, who coached the U.S. to the 1998 World Cup in France after
earlier being an assistant under Bora Milutinovic on the 1994 U.S.
World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Hermosillo, who retired recently after a 17-year professional
career, revealed that he soon will travel to Spain to study sports
management and, while there, will join European champion Real Madrid
on a one-year executive internship.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an honor to have the opportunity of learning from the
best," Hermosillo said, "and I hope that afterward I will be able to
use this knowledge in order to help further develop soccer in
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Razov Suspended</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Fire and U.S. national team forward Ante Razov was fined
$2,750 and suspended for three games by the MLS disciplinary
committee for what the committee said was a "demonstrated disregard
for the safety of his opponent."</TE>
<TE>   The punishment, which was increased from the automatic $250 fine
and one-game suspension that accompanies all red cards, stemmed from
Razov's challenge on New England Revolution defender Jay Heaps during
the third game of the Revolution-Fire playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   Because Chicago was eliminated, the former UCLA striker will serve
the three-game suspension at the beginning of next season.</TE>
<TE>   Luciano Banned</TE>
<TE>   Luciano, the Brazilian winger who last month admitted that he had
faked his age and his name and, under the deception, had played
professionally for Palmeiras in Brazil and for Bologna and Chievo in
Italy, was banned from all soccer for six months and fined $145,000
by the disciplinary commission of UEFA, European soccer's governing
body.</TE>
<TE>   Gold for Turkey</TE>
<TE>   In appreciation of Turkey's unprecedented third-place finish at
the 2002 World Cup, the Turkish government doled out more than a
half-million dollars in gold coins to the coaches and players on the
national team. Coach Senol Gunes received 600 coins, worth roughly
$42,000, and the 23 players each received 300 coins.</TE>

<KH> AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES: ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA /
TWIN NOTES</KH>
<HD>A's Closer No Friend of Cocky Pierzynski</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna; Jason Reid; Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>When Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio kicked the ball out of
Minnesota catcher A.J. Pierzynski's glove while scoring in the second
inning of Wednesday night's game, Oakland closer Billy Koch probably
stood in front of his television and cheered.</LD>
<LD>   Pierzynski, it seems, left a lasting and not-so-favorable
impression on the A's reliever, who gave up three runs in the ninth
inning of the Twins' 5-4 division series-clinching victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a jackass," Koch told the San Francisco Chronicle while
cleaning out his locker in Network Associates Coliseum on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Koch said Pierzynski "popped off" throughout the division series,
and one play in particular, when Pierzynski stood on top of the plate
while Eric Chavez scored without a throw home in the first inning of
Game 1, irked the A's pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Pierzynski, who has a reputation for being cocky, said, "I don't
do anything personally to anyone, I just want to win. I don't realize
what I'm doing sometimes. Sometimes I'm in a different world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A simple question during Wednesday's pregame interview session
with Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire had reporters rolling with laughter.
What makes Angel reliever Ben Weber such a tough pitcher to bat
against?</TE>
<TE>   "His glasses," Gardenhire said of the goggles-wearing right-hander
with the herky-jerky motion. "Glasses are really tough. We won't talk
about that nasty sinker or slider, we'll talk about those glasses he
wears....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. He's nasty. I mean, he's not just tough on our
team, he's tough on everybody. That double hitch that he does out
there, I mean, I don't know if as a little kid you emulated players
growing up like Willie Mays or Mickey Mantle....</TE>
<TE>   "Our players do it right now. They love to go out there and
imitate his style. That's pretty special. Maybe they're watching that
instead of his pitches, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Denny Hocking, sidelined for the series because of a
finger injury, has been busy trying to accommodate a group of 36
relatives and friends seeking tickets for this weekend's games at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Hocking, born in Torrance and preparing to move to Orange, said
coordinating a cheering section isn't as easy as it seems.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I was from somewhere else," he said. "They'd make it easy
on me if they'd just all come to the games all three days, but some
can only come Friday and Saturday and I've got to find tickets for
those people on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from what the Angels have told Hocking about the
atmosphere at Edison Field these days, he believes his enthusiastic
bunch should fit in well.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched those games with the Yankees on TV, and it was a sea of
red out there," said Hocking, who has attended Angel games since
1986. "I'm sure it probably brought [Darin] Erstad back to his
Nebraska days.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember my buddy getting free tickets at the ballpark the
night Roger Clemens pitched, sitting one row behind the Boston Red
Sox dugout and putting my feet up. You probably wouldn't be able to
do that now."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The score of Game 1 may have been close, but in regard to TV
ratings, it was a wipeout.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis averaged a 41.4 Nielsen rating with a 56 share for the
Twins' 2-1 victory over the Angels on Tuesday night, while Los
Angeles had a 15.9/28.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the game televised by Fox averaged a 7.3/12. Last
year, Fox averaged a 7.1/12 for its first prime-time telecast of the
second round--Game 2 of the National League championship series
between Atlanta and Arizona.</TE>

<HD>It's Wrong Start at Wrong Time for Twins' Jones</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Leadoff man struggles with no hits in first nine
at-bats against Angels, including the final out in Game 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Jacque Jones is fighting himself as well as the Angels, and that's
one opponent too many in the American League championship series.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twin leadoff batter hasn't had much fun recently,
and things didn't get easier for Jones and his teammates Wednesday
night in a 6-3 loss in Game 2 before 55,990 at the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   The largest, and one of the loudest, crowds in franchise history
watched in disappointment as the Angels evened the best-of-seven
series, and another bad experience for Jones was good for the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   He was hitless in five at-bats, striking out twice, ending the
game swinging and missing against Angel closer Troy Percival. The
Twins outhit the Angels, 11-10, chased starter Ramon Ortiz in the
sixth and applied pressure until Manager Mike Scioscia summoned
Percival with two out and runners on the corners in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty struck out looking and Percival worked a
1-2-3 ninth, completing the victory against the Twins' suddenly
struggling sparkplug.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not hitting," said Jones, a former USC standout. "It's
just not happening."</TE>
<TE>   That's for sure.</TE>
<TE>   Jones failed to get a hit in nine at-bats during the first two
games at the Metrodome. Including the division series, he is hitless
in his last 15 at-bats, batting .172 overall in the postseason with a
.226 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with Jacque is some of their pitchers are really
throwing good right now," Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire said.
"We're having some guys struggle a little bit. Jacque is getting
after it. He's missing some pitches right now."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates have noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys talk to him; try to tell him to just calm down," Twin
center fielder Torii Hunter said. "But Jacque knows how to play. He
hit .300 during the season, so he's going to get out of it, and he's
still helping us."</TE>
<TE>   The left fielder has left his problems at the plate, continuing to
provide the Twins with solid defense. But the four-year veteran is
much more than a defensive specialist, having batted .300 with 27
home runs, 37 doubles, 85 runs batted in and 96 runs during the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, not the type to over-analyze things, said he doesn't feel
increased pressure to get the offense going in the AL championship
series. And he's not going to change his approach now.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is just go out and swing," the San Diego native
said. "I'm not going to stop swinging because I've been doing it all
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days it's going to happen, some days it's not. But I'm not
going to stop going out playing and swinging. Whatever happens,
happens."</TE>
<TE>   That's the attitude, the Twins said.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be fine," designated hitter David Ortiz said. "The same way
people might be looking at Jacque right now is the way they were
looking at me [in the division series against Oakland]. I had eight
at-bats and I didn't get any hits ... everybody was asking about me.
But you know Jacque can come out at any time and get two, three, four
hits.</TE>
<TE>   "And you've got to know that this is the playoffs and pitchers
don't make mistakes as much. People sometimes need to chill when they
watch [the] playoffs because [the] playoffs [are] not like the
season. The season ... it's a little bit different. Pitching is a
little bit different now.</TE>
<TE>   "Pitchers know Jacque can hit the ball out of the ballpark, so
they don't want to make mistakes against him. That's why Jacque just
has to keep playing. Jacque just keeps doing what he's doing and
he'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire says he's sticking with the left-handed batter against
Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn in Game 3 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't take him out against Washburn," Gardenhire said. "He's
our left fielder. He plays very well out there. He'll get some hits.</TE>
<TE>   "Jacque has been there all year for us. I don't think you give up
on our guys right now."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arithmetic according to Cory Paus: Thirteen is greater than 378.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Bruin quarterback was pleased with his career-high
passing yardage last week against Oregon State.</LD>
<LD>   But he was absolutely thrilled with rushing for 13 yards.</LD>
<TE>   It was only the second time in four years he has rushed for
positive yardage.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been saying I am a little faster this year and I feel like
it out there," he said. "And I could have run better. I could have
had a couple more first downs."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to taking off and gaining a few yards now and then,
Paus is sidestepping rushers and throwing passes instead of getting
sacked. He recalled advice from former San Francisco 49er Coach Bill
Walsh, who said that good quarterbacks are able to see receivers
downfield after eluding the rush.</TE>
<TE>   "When they blitz or there is a breakdown in protection and I make
somebody miss, that's the main thing I need to do," Paus said. "See
the field and complete a pass."</TE>

<TE>   Three UCLA players are not practicing because of injuries but are
expected to be ready by Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Free safety Ben Emanuel has a pinched nerve in his neck and will
be replaced by sophomore Jibril Raymo in the starting lineup. It will
be Raymo's first start. Reserve offensive tackle Ed Blanton has a
sprained foot and reserve tailback Wendell Mathis has a sore
shoulder.</TE>

<TE>   The roles of two true freshmen have changed because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Potasi, a tackle who had moved up to second string, will
redshirt because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu, a defensive tackle expected to redshirt, will play
because starting tackle Rodney Leisle will sit out at least five
games because of a foot injury. Besides Niusulu, only senior Sean
Phillips is available to back up starting tackles Steve Morgan and
Ryan Boschetti.</TE>

<HD>If Needed, Leach Is Ready to Start</HD>

<LD>Jason Leach hopes he doesn't have to make the first start of his USC
career Saturday against California.</LD>
<LD>   But if he is called on, Leach says he'll be prepared.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm ready to go," he said Wednesday after practice.</LD>
<TE>   The sophomore from La Puente Bishop Amat High might be needed to
fill the considerably large shoes of Troy Polamalu, the Trojans'
All-American strong safety. Polamalu suffered a high right ankle
sprain last week against Washington State and is questionable for
Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It would make me more happy if he came back," Leach said of
Polamalu. "That would be a big help for our defense."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, who had an MRI exam Wednesday, isn't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing awesome," Polamalu said of Leach. "There's no need for
me to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu was being gracious, but Coach Pete Carroll indicated
there isn't a dramatic drop-off in ability with Leach at strong
safety. Leach leads USC with two interceptions, including one in the
fourth quarter against Washington State that led to a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason has done really well for us," Carroll said. "The fact that
he has been playing in games all along and competing under pressure
really helps him feel comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, who sat out practice again Wednesday, said his ankle is
responding to rehabilitation. A decision on whether he can play
probably won't be made until game time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his first three seasons at USC, Kareem Kelly averaged 15.8
yards per catch. This season, he is averaging 9.8 yards in the
Trojans' short-passing scheme.</TE>
<TE>   "My role has changed," Kelly acknowledged. "I'm just playing
within the game plan, running a lot of slants and crossing routes."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who had eight catches for only 66 yards against Washington
State, said the Trojans are capable of completing deep passes with a
group of speedy receivers that includes himself, Keary Colbert and
Mike Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on what the defense gives us and tries to take
away," he said. "But there's no frustration. I'm having a good time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen will continue to handle all kicking duties, Carroll
said. David Davis, USC's other kicker, is recovering from an injury
to his left (kicking) leg.</TE>
