<LD>Inside the Butterfields auction house on Sunset Boulevard, bidding
was getting brisk. "I have $1,900, go $2,000, if you wish," the
auctioneer called out to about 150 people who had come for the
Playboy auction Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Bidders waved white cardboard paddles shaped like Playboy's rabbit
head logo to bid on the lot, which contained a mixed bag of kitsch
and valuables. On sale, alongside logo ceramics and sweaters, were
original Andy Warhol collages, Alberto Vargas pinups and LeRoy Neiman
paintings. ("He's the Norman Rockwell of Playboy," a dealer said.)</LD>
<LD>   The auctioneer called out to a man in the back.</LD>
<TE>   "You're done?" she asked. "Now? You're really done?"</TE>
<TE>   He was.</TE>
<TE>   Lot 9016, Haddon Hubbard Sundblom original artwork for the
December 1972 cover (a woman in a skimpy Santa outfit), sold for
$13,000.</TE>
<TE>   The auctioneer addressed another bidder, after a series of
confusing gestures. "Careful with the bunny. You might get something
you didn't want to buy."</TE>
<TE>   She presented the next item: a Playboy Club key, which went for
$300. A bunny tail, mounted like a trophy head, with the inscription
"Caught live at the Playboy Club," also sold for $300. Then came the
Neiman paintings. As the bidding took off, people strained their
necks to see who was bidding. Lot No. 9042, an enamel on Masonite
painting for the 1965 May cover, jumped from $4,000 to $9,000, with
the bids stopping at $19,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the viewing gallery next door, writer Glen Gold, 38, admired
the layout boards--especially the notations in the margins. Some were
directions for airbrushing. "Kill the mole, kill the stubble," he
read. "The imperfections ... there's something fascinating about
that." His eye wandered across the comics mounted on the wall.
"That's 'ghosted' by Frank Frazetta," he said, pointing to one panel.
"Although it's credited to a couple of other guys, you can tell he
had a hand in it."</TE>
<TE>   The bunny logo represented an age of innocence, said Gold. "There
are a lot of hateful images in mainstream erotica today," he said,
"although you could probably sit down with [feminist] Andrea Dworkin
... and [find] what's problematic with these images, too."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Silber, a 56-year-old probation officer in a black pajama
outfit with a red sparkly bunny motif, held up her purchase: a felt
pajama bag. "Ooo, it's so cute," she said, explaining she had bought
it to decorate her bed. A collector of Playboy pins, jewelry and
other artifacts, her interest was sparked when a friend began taking
her to the parties in the '60s. She looked around the room. "I don't
see anybody from the old days who used to party."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Ed Schumacher, a 37-year-old commercial filmmaker, looked
at original Betty Page photos. "It looks like the glossies you can
buy on Hollywood Boulevard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Having just bought a new house, Schumacher was looking for
something more than glossies to put on his walls, and had come with
his friend, Craig Tanimoto, 38, to bid on a group of Herb Ritts'
sepia-toned photos of Cindy Crawford in various stages of undress.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it holds up, some doesn't," Schumacher said of the
pictures and objects surrounding him. The logo ceramics and sweaters
looked "kind of cheesy" to him. But a rug piece, "Hooked Wall
Hanging," by Bill Hinz, that was mounted nearby appealed. "There's
something very retro cool about it."</TE>
<TE>   Walking around the room, he reminisced about reading the magazine
when he was growing up. The artworks, he said, reflected another era.</TE>
<TE>   Art dealers Franklin Bowles, Tony Pernicone and Carla Bonney were
motivated less by nostalgia than by competition.</TE>
<TE>   Bowles had outbid Bonney on a couple of Neimans. "Now, she's
pouting," he teased, as he was getting ready to bid on the Vargas
lot. "I hope they don't do very well," he joked. "I always
overspend."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the paintings went for slightly more than their estimated
price, about $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   But for those without deep pockets, there was the bunny bid
paddle.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Blackman was carting off his $2,400 wall rug outside the
auction house when he was approached by a Butterfields staff member:
What was the number on his paddle?</TE>
<TE>   "They're collectibles," she explained, over her shoulder as she
continued down the street in pursuit of the mysterious paddle
collector, "but if somebody walks off with someone else's paddle, the
wrong person gets billed."</TE>
<TE>   Airborne Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   The reason behind John Travolta's Monday morning appearance at the
Los Angeles International Airport was top secret. A news release
issued last week promised the announcement of "a unique global
initiative" by the famous Scientologist, leaving reporters to wonder:
Would Travolta testify before Congress on airline security? Would he
travel to war-torn countries to preach world peace? Not quite.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Monday, Travolta, a longtime aviation enthusiast, will
pilot his Boeing 707 (a retired Qantas jet) to 13 cities as an
employee of and "ambassador-at-large" for Qantas. "The past year has
been awful for our sense of security and goodwill and also for trust
and friendship between different cultures and countries," Travolta
said in a statement Monday. And his travels are a way "to reach out,
to cross borders, make contact, rekindle friendships and make new
friends."</TE>
<TE>   Not that his trip is likely to enhance fragile political
alliances. Skirting hotspots (but diving into Qantas' major overseas
markets), he plans to fly from Los Angeles to Auckland, New Zealand;
Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, Australia; Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo,
London, Rome, Paris, Frankfurt and New York.</TE>

<LD>WHEN EVE WAS NAKED</LD>
<LD>   Stories of a Life's Journey</LD>
<LD>   Josef Skvorecky</LD>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus and Giroux</TE>
<TE>   352 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   "I had lived through nearly all the types of society that had ever
existed--including modern forms of slavery and feudalism," writes
Josef Skvorecky, one of the finest, internationally celebrated
authors of his generation in the preface to "When Eve Was Naked:
Stories of a Life's Journey." The Czech native, who grew up during
Nazi rule and came of age as a writer under communist oppression, was
recently urged by friends to write his memoirs. "Thinking about my
oeuvre, I saw that there was very little worth telling that had not
already been told in my stories and novels." Instead of writing a
straight autobiography, the novelist has taken 24 of his short
stories that came most directly from his life and pieced them
together in chronological fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting work, as much history lesson as biographical sketch,
is a thoroughly rewarding read, masterfully written and
heartbreakingly real. Reminiscent of the works of Isaac Bashevis
Singer (though from a Catholic rather than Jewish perspective), these
stories give intelligent, unique insight into some of the most
eventful and traumatic happenings of Eastern Europe in the last
century. We visit prewar Prague, witness the terror of Nazi
occupation, are shocked by the destruction of World War II and later,
experience the artistic persecution by the communist regime.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tales are narrated by Skvorecky's fictionalized
self, a character named Danny Smiricky. The title story tells of
8-year-old Danny falling in love with 6-year-old Eve. The two meet
while on a bus tour of Prague for winners of a toothpaste-cap
collecting promotion. As we notice Eve's innocence though Danny's
eyes, we can't help but imagine an innocent Europe on the cusp of
horror, and watch--helplessly--as that naivete, both in Danny and in
Eve, is destroyed. The story's climax comes when Danny sees young Eve
stripped naked for an ocean swim. "She looked like a baby bird. Her
tiny body was white except for her legs, shoulders and arms, which
were the colour of light brown coffee." The sight triggers his first
experience with life's anguish. "I suddenly felt faint," Danny tells
us. "Then strange. Then incredibly sad, so sad that words can't
convey it." The narrator's innocence makes an incisive mark on all
the stories. Coupled with Skvorecky's desire for words to
convey what perhaps they are unable to convey, the innocence provides
an aching, artistic perspective on that tragic time and place. For
instance, we watch Danny worrying over his love life as Prague falls
to bits. Like the rest of us, Danny has no ability to see the
happenings from a historical standpoint; he can only witness them as
they affect his own comings and goings and throw difficulties, or in
some cases advantages, on his romantic pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the strongest stories, "Spectator on a February Night,"
the author recreates the Communist coup of 1948, which ushered in 40
years of totalitarianism in Czechoslovakia. The story is told from
the point of view of a young man who is exhilarated by the
excitement. "I could tell something was about to happen. I couldn't
wait. We were in the middle of it and it was great. I felt the mob
move .... I felt splendid. I felt alive, and alive when it felt good
to be alive." The need for commotion, after all that had happened in
Prague at that time, was great, even if the commotion was leading
somewhere awful. "Just think if it all hadn't happened. We'd just
rot. In all that peace. Good that things happen."</TE>
<TE>   As the narrator and his friends make plans to flee the country,
again, love concerns are paramount. The seating arrangements in the
getaway car may provide a chance to sit close to the mysterious Kitty
and be forced to touch legs with her.</TE>
<TE>   "The End of Bull Macha" tells of the governmental suppression of
jazz music and jitterbug dancing and the young jazz player Bull
Macha's fight against being "made over" by the new regime. When Macha
discovers a rollicking jazz joint, the "desperate rebellion that had
been building up inside him all afternoon ... gave way to a
victorious sensation of certainty that all this would last, that they
wouldn't manage to suffocate it after all, that it was the same jazz
it had always been ... that no one in the world could wipe out this
music, this world, the only one he had ever wanted to belong to." His
hopes, though, are in vain.</TE>
<TE>   By approaching these critical moments in history from such a
personalized perspective (such a self-centered and human point of
view) Skvorecky succeeds in giving us a genuine taste of them.
His is not the history of dates and textbooks, but of individuals
swept up in happenings they'd never requested nor, at the time, fully
understood.</TE>

<LD>An Ancient Hero</LD>
<LD>   Have you heard of Hercules? The people of ancient Greece believed
this mythical figure was courageous and powerful and called him
"Herakles." Many stories were told about the adventures of Herakles
including the story of his 12 labors.</LD>
<LD>   The 12 labors were challenges given to him by a king. One of the
challenges was for Herakles to kidnap a monster named Cerberus
without using force. The scene painted on this vase shows Herakles
(on the right) attempting to complete the challenge.</LD>
<TE>   About the Vase</TE>
<TE>   In ancient Greece, vases were used to store goods and were given
as gifts and prizes. This vase is called an "amphora" because it has
two handles on either side of the neck. Amphoras were used to store
oil and wine. What do people uses vases for today?</TE>
<TE>   Greek vases such as this one were made from red clay and then
painted with designs. When the vases were fired, or baked, to make
them hard, the paint mixture would turn black. Because of this, the
style is known as "black figure painting." Black figure painting was
a popular style of pottery in ancient Greece.</TE>
<TE>   Activity</TE>
<TE>   Do you have a modern-day hero? Is there someone you particularly
admire for his or her abilities, skills or accomplishments? Maybe you
know your hero, or maybe he or she is someone you have never met.</TE>
<TE>   Think of something your hero has done that you admire then try
drawing it with black marker in a style similar to this painting of
Herakles. Use reddish-orange pastels, crayons or chalk to color in
the background of your completed drawing.</TE>
<TE>   You can see ancient Greek vases and many other kinds of art at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.

<LD>* "Four eyes," "brace face," "tin grin." Have you ever been called a
name like that? Or maybe "geek" or "nerd"? Some people call this
bullying, others call it teasing. Whatever you call it, it's wrong.
Teasing can happen to anyone, but it usually happens to kids. In
school, people can talk about you or say mean things to you. Other
times, they might exclude you from a game. Most people don't like it.</LD>
<LD>   Once, at camp, I was really excited. It was my first time to go in
the mud. I touched the mud. It looked like chocolate, but I wasn't
sure if it actually was chocolate. I thought, "There's only one way
to find out." So I put my finger in my mouth. It tasted disgusting. I
was only 5 and I hoped nobody saw. I ran to the water fountain and
drank water. Then a girl started laughing. So did everyone else. I
asked them what was so funny and they said, "You!" I laughed along so
they couldn't tell I was hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Stopping teasing and bullying is important. One way to do this is
for one person to stand up for his or her friend, then everybody
will. Working together may do the trick. Just make sure nobody you
know is a bully or being bullied.</LD>

<TE>   * I have been teased many times. It's not fun. I get teased at
school, home and sometimes on the baseball field. When people tease
you, they call you names like "baby," "ugly," "jerk" and "small."
I've been called those before. But the one thing I've been called
most is "dumb." I try to ignore it and walk away.</TE>

<HD>A Loss for Words</HD>
<DH>Ann Landers' syndicated column will cease soon, but her
editors will carry on under a different title</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>And Mary Rourke TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before her death Saturday from cancer at the age of 83, Ann Landers
made it clear that there would be no future Ann Landers, a fictional
name she owned and for which she'd been offered huge sums of money.
But by Sunday, plans were already in the works for two of her
longtime editors to carry on. Their daily advice column, Annie's
Mailbox, will debut July 28. "We have received an incredible number
of e-mails saying, 'You must run the classic Ann Landers or you must
continue this column,' " Richard S. Newcombe, president of L.A.-based
Creators Syndicate, said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Esther Friedman Lederer had made it very clear, said her
daughter, Margo Howard, that the Ann Landers column per se would end
with her death. "She had invested so much of herself in the column
and she would have no control over it. It was a name she was so
strongly identified with," Howard said from her home in Cambridge,
Mass.</LD>
<LD>   At the urging of Newcombe, however, the decision was almost
immediately made to launch Annie's Mailbox in a similar format. He
said, "We agreed that upon her death [her] name would not be used and
we are honoring that request."</LD>
<TE>   Letters to "Dear Annie," who will have no last name, will be
answered by Kathy Mitchell and Marcy Sugar, both in their 50s.
Mitchell worked for Landers for 34 years and Sugar worked off and on
for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell and Sugar said they had not yet had time to think about
the voice of Annie's Mailbox although, Mitchell said, both were so
familiar with the style and format that "we could do it in our
sleep." Said Sugar, "She taught us everything we know. She was a
wonderful mentor."</TE>
<TE>   The last Ann Landers column, written before her death, will run
July 27. On Monday, some newspapers carried a tribute to Ann Landers,
written by her daughter, to "a gutsy, old-school newspaper dame who
believed there was no better job in all the world and who would, if
she could have, wished you a fond and grateful farewell herself. And
she wanted you to know that hers had been a 'simply wonderful ride.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The columnist's death has spurred a discussion about trends in
newspaper advice columns, preeminent among which were Ann Landers and
the rival Dear Abby, for years written by Lederer's twin sister,
Pauline Friedman Phillips--a.k.a. Abigail Van Buren. It is now
co-written with Phillips' daughter, Jeanne Phillips, from Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Howard said her mother had once asked if she wanted to continue
the column some day. "I said not me, honey. I don't really like to
work all that much. And I didn't have her sense of mission. She
really cared about these people and she cared about fixing the
world." Howard does write an advice column, Dear Prudence, a weekly
feature that runs in the online magazine Slate. Creators Syndicate
will offer the weekly column to newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Rosen, chairman of the department of journalism at New York
University, said Monday that while the advice column genre is not
usually considered journalism, Ann Landers "was a journalist of a
very unusual kind" who showed extraordinary discipline and "extreme
fidelity to fact" and, because of her high reader interaction, "had
to reach standards that meet or exceed the standards of a lot of
daily journalism in terms of accuracy."</TE>
<TE>   As for the future of such columns, Rosen observed, "She and her
sister began at a time when you could rely on much more social
consensus. A lot of the drama of the column had to do with the
breakdown of that social consensus and the thousands of problems that
resulted. The idea now of that kind of advice for 'the American
woman' or 'the American family' is hard to imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Some reading Lederer's obituaries wondered why her twin did not
issue a statement. Phillips, who has been in declining health, did
not return calls Monday. However, her daughter wrote a "Dear Aunt
Eppie" column released Monday by Universal Press Syndicate in which
she praised her aunt as "a woman of courage, integrity and loyalty, a
"role model." The twins had a famously strained and competitive
relationship. They were, said Howard, "rather distant." But, she
added, "They faxed some. They were both a little hard of hearing. But
I think they had fixed up the difficulties of the earlier years."</TE>
<TE>   Other advice columnists speculate that there will be fewer such
advice columns now that readers can get answers to their problems
fast on the Internet. And the columns that flourish may be more
specialized.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot more leeway writing an advice column for Slate than
I would for newspapers," said Howard. "I can be risque, I make
literary references. I don't want to say e-mail users are smarter,
but very accomplished people write to me." She doesn't know whether
Dear Prudence would work as a newspaper feature.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a distinct difference between the older and younger
generations of columnists? Yes, said Robert Epstein, editor of
Psychology Today. "The older generation--Ann Landers, Dear Abby,
Doctor Ruth--were sincere little Jewish ladies. Ann Landers had a
blend of common sense, genuine caring and professional advice. We
still need someone like that, but I don't see anyone to replace her.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "The public now wants to be titillated. They're used to
watching TV advice shows that are scary and getting scarier." Still,
he said, "Baby boomers make up a large part of the population and I
think they want wisdom and experience in an advice column. The world
may belong to the young, but we still realize that older people have
wisdom."</TE>
<TE>   One of the newer breed of advice columnists, 35-year-old Carolyn
Hax, writes Tell Me About It, a 5-year-old column syndicated by the
Washington Post. She says most of her correspondents are in their 20s
and 30s--and can reach her both by mail and by e-mail. "I get the
computer crowd. I can answer the Q and A mail within an hour" online.</TE>
<TE>   She adds, "It's not that hard for anyone to get expert advice now.
The need for a gatekeeper with access to experts is not as strong as
it was when Ann Landers was writing her column. You can get legal
advice in a minute on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Like Ann Landers, Hax shared news of her divorce with her readers,
wanting to be as forthcoming with them as they were with her. "It
would be lousy of me to go underground with the truth just because it
wasn't flattering," she reasoned.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer, who described herself as "the original square Jewish lady
from Sioux City," had many and diverse friends, among them Father
Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University of Notre
Dame. Howard said that he had promised to say a special Mass for her,
"asking the good Lord to deal with her gently."</TE>
<TE>   Another close friend was Ilana Diamond Rovner, a federal appellate
court judge in Chicago. She said, "Eppie had a sixth sense about
humanity, this innate, deep, unfailing ability to understand other
people, to understand their joys, their sadness, their problems,
their weaknesses, their foibles. She had this ability to connect with
anyone and everyone, from the best amongst us to the worst amongst
us. I learned so much about judging from her because she judged
without being judgmental."</TE>
<TE>   She recalled riding with Lederer in her car on a typical day when
2,000 letters to Ann Landers had arrived. "It used to look like Santa
Claus had come, those huge mailbags. The letters would be up to our
ankles. I was always afraid one of us was going to get a heel caught
inside an envelope and kill ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   David Grossvogel, professor emeritus of comparative literature at
Cornell University and author of a 1986 book that explored the social
impact of Ann Landers, said Monday, "Her advice changed as the
country changed. In the mid-50s her advice reflected a stable
society. But as fabric and mores changed, she evolved. She started
writing about marriage, divorce, the emerging role of women, sex,
drugs. She was among the first to tackle AIDS in her column."</TE>
<TE>   Grossvogel said his impression is that "younger people are
completely uninterested in getting advice. Ann's contemporaries were
interested in rules. The right answers seemed to be engraved
somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer was diagnosed in January with multiple myeloma and, Howard
said, chose not to have treatment. "She was a very straight, strong
girl. She said, 'Look, I'm 83. I've had a fabulous life.' She wasn't
going to go through all the carrying on. She was cared for at home,
under hospice, which was very important to her."</TE>
<TE>   There will be no formal services. Howard said, "She didn't want to
bother anybody, didn't want to put anybody out. She said there shall
be no memorial, no funeral. She's being cremated and will wind up in
her beloved Lake Michigan."</TE>

<HD>Down-to-Earth Spiritual Guru for the Masses</HD>
<DH>Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez's conservative message is wildly
popular, but Mexican intellectuals aren't buying what he's selling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He walks onto the Ontario Convention Center stage, clean-cut in a
navy suit, with little fanfare and hardly an introduction. The people
who have come to the Ontario Convention Center to listen to Carlos
Cuauhtemoc Sanchez, mostly Mexicans and Mexican Americans, rise in an
ovation for the man they've come to know intimately through his eight
novels and self-help tapes. For them, Sanchez is a cross between a
Spanish-speaking Tony Robbins and a beloved priest, a down-to-earth
spiritual guru who motivates them through the toughest moments in
their lives with his common-sense advice.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1992, Sanchez has sold an estimated 15 million copies of his
contemporary novels with messages of family unity, forgiveness, faith
and character, and has become a pop-cultural moral guide for millions
across Latin America who are so touched by his deeply conservative
message that they also pay $20 to $40 to flock to his lectures. Among
Latinos in Southern California he outsells such literary giants as
Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel Garcia Marquez; his books and tapes are
sold at stores, carwashes, even meat markets.</LD>
<LD>   On this Sunday afternoon, he begins by imploring his audience of
nearly 4,000 to focus on the voices of their own consciences while he
speaks, not just on his words. Then he tells a dirty joke about a
baby chick in a man's pants, and the crowd erupts in laughter.</LD>
<TE>   He goes on this way for a few minutes, reading off well-worn
sayings from his notes, dropping in an aphorism here and there: "The
thief who robs from a thief lives in Mexico City."</TE>
<TE>   Then the arena goes dark, and the spotlight is on Sanchez as he
begins his talk about the price of success. For the next 90 minutes,
he tells anecdotes, quotes the Bible and offers the kind of advice
you might hear from a friend. He discusses the differences between
material and spiritual wealth and the importance of placing God and
family above all else.</TE>
<TE>   "Success depends on the way you interpret your failures," he says.
"Maybe somebody rejected you, or betrayed you or manipulated you. Or
maybe you lost money or a competition. It happens to all of us! And
it happens frequently, and that's how you distinguish who is
triumphant!"</TE>
<TE>   A Roman Catholic who grew up in a middle-class suburb of Mexico
City, Sanchez studied industrial engineering before he became a high
school teacher and founded three vocational schools with his wife,
who is an English teacher. But Sanchez always wanted to follow his
grandfather, Claudio Gutierrez Marin, who was a writer and had a
doctorate in philosophy. Sanchez committed himself to his craft at a
young age, carrying a heavy typewriter to school every day. As a
child, instead of playing soccer, he locked himself in a classroom to
write.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, he developed an interest, and talent, for cycling
and won a spot on Mexico's Olympic team. He traveled abroad competing
in international bicycle races and winning prizes for his short
stories, essays and a novel. His first bestseller, "A Desperate Cry,"
published in 1992, evolved from the suicide of one of the students at
his school. The boy killed himself after running away from home and
returning to a harsh beating by his father. "Cry" urged fathers to
communicate better with their sons.</TE>
<TE>   'Sanchez Fever'</TE>
<TE>   When every publisher in Mexico turned down the manuscript, an
editor friend helped him print 1,000 copies. That caught the
attention of a textbook publishing house, Ediciones Diamante, which
has now published all of Sanchez's books and of which he is now a
part-owner. The book, and the two that followed, were immediate hits,
creating "Sanchez fever" among the Mexican populous.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico City, where Sanchez lives with his wife, Ivonne Herrera,
and three children, ages 7 to 13, he both is loved and
loathed--revered as a poetic philosopher in some circles, ridiculed
as a fraud and buffoon in others. The books resonate mostly with
young, working-class Latinos--not known for being avid readers. His
biggest followers are women.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Arias, a parent facilitator at El Sereno Middle School, is
so moved by Sanchez's message that she organized a bus trip for 70
parents for his Ontario event. "His books have a really strong
message about how to deal with our youth in these difficult times,"
she said. "He teaches that it's not money but your values and your
principles, routines and traditions that matter. You just grab the
concept and it stays with you." Adolfo Oseguera, who attended the
event with his wife, Norma, said he has found some answers for his
personal difficulties in Sanchez's books. Isabel Gomez-Bassols, a
Miami-based Spanish radio talk show host whose advice program is
broadcast on 1580 AM in Los Angeles, often recommends Sanchez's books
to her listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "He helps people to understand that there is a process you must go
through to understand yourself," she said. "He shares that dream of
helping other people that I have. He has a wonderful poetic way of
dealing with psychological issues. People don't read his books like a
manual but as a story that has a message to give. That's how they did
it in the old days. Even Jesus used parables."</TE>
<TE>   But to liken Sanchez to Jesus Christ or respected philosophers and
authors is an insult, say Mexican intellectuals who criticize him so
vehemently that he's been banned from Mexico's largest book festival.
Essayist Carlos Monsivais said he was stunned when he read three of
Sanchez's books and found no original insights or stylistic writing.
"It was like watching 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' with Shirley Temple
as the leading actor," he said. "These books are for people who are
seeking to find their spirituality without taking any risks. His work
does not qualify as literature or philosophy. It's marketing and
catechism for functional illiterates who want to have a spiritual
life. I cannot criticize his ideas because he has none."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez admits he reads one or two self-help books a week and
summarizes them for his own work. But he brushes off criticism citing
"envy" and says his critics insult his readers more than they offend
him.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are successful, a lot of people become envious," Sanchez
said in Spanish after his event on Sunday. "They are envious that
they have not had the same success. They say my readers are ignorant
people. But how can you say 15 million people are ignorant? Whether
they like it or not, my books are novels and they are literature.
Just because they contain self-help lessons does not mean they don't
qualify as literature."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Sanchez is so repudiated in Mexico's literary and
intellectual circles that he has become the brunt of a popular joke.
It is not uncommon for people to insult each other by saying, "The
only thing you've probably ever read is Cuauhtemoc Sanchez,"
according to popular Mexico City writer and sociologist Guadalupe
Loaeza.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody makes fun of him," she said. "We are aware that he
sells many books, but his books have no narrative quality or content.
They are self-help books read by people who do not read. But if I
were to see my daughter picking up one of those books, I would feel I
was a failure as a mother. I would rather see her smoking pot than
reading his books."</TE>
<TE>   Success in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Rueben Martinez, owner of Martinez Books and Art in Santa Ana,
says that although Sanchez's sales have dwindled in recent months, he
still restocks those titles two or three times a month. Sanchez says
each of his titles still sells 50,000 copies a year, a figure that
cannot be verified because the publishing house does not keep track
of book sales. Whatever the amount, Sanchez is doing well enough to
own a farm and a home in Mexico City and to employ a full-time
assistant who travels with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of the bestselling authors we have," Martinez said.
"What we appreciate in the bookstore is getting people who have never
read a book before to read his books. If anything, his books are word
of mouth. They have to do with the development of the family and his
topics are good."</TE>
<TE>   Practically unknown in the English-language world, Sanchez says he
is learning English because he would like to expand his lecture
circuit to a wider American audience. Three of his books, "A
Desperate Cry," "Youth in Sexual Ecstasy" and "The Last Opportunity,"
have been translated into English and are sold in the United States
by small distributors that cater to the Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   "The most receptive audiences I have are the Latino audiences in
the United States," Sanchez said. "These are people who are away from
their roots; they feel a profound nostalgia, and they are lonely. So
that makes them more sensitive, and the fact that they are moved is
more obvious. I would like to be able to speak to the English public
and see if they are as inclined to improve their lives spiritually."</TE>
<TE>   The speech on Sunday was sponsored by La Hora de los Triunfadores,
a Latino self-improvement organization founded in 1999 in North
Hollywood, which has held 50 such events throughout the United
States. Patricia Gamino, who says she never misses an opportunity to
listen to Sanchez, attended Sunday's event with her sister and
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "What moves me the most about his talks is that he focuses on the
spiritual," said Gamino, 38, of Santa Ana. "He helps us to understand
that material things are not important. First, we must focus on God,
and the rest will come on its own. He always talks about the same
types of topics: family issues, problems with raising kids, that sort
of thing. But he uses different examples and different advice."</TE>
<TE>   After a 15-minute break, Sanchez retakes the stage to give his
final thoughts on the afternoon's topic, "The Price of Success." He
tells the story of how his 10-year-old daughter, Ivy, almost died of
meningitis when she was 2. It was a life-altering moment for him, he
said. Some of the women in the audience are crying, even though it's
a story they already know. He ends by telling them to stay away from
premarital and extramarital sex, alcohol and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The advice is not original but his message certainly has impact.
When the lecture is over, people clamor for his autograph and hope
for a moment with the man they feel is lifting them into a higher
ground. Some hope for a chance to tell him their problems as he
allowed them to years ago before his connection to the people gave
way to the marketing and promotion machine.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez does not stop to listen. He leaves the conference hall and
heads upstairs for interviews. A prolific writer for the past 10
years, Sanchez says he is running out of ideas. He is working on his
ninth novel but is having trouble meeting his personal goal of
writing one book each year.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through a big personal crisis when I first got famous
because I wasn't prepared to deal with what that means," Sanchez
said. "I didn't sort it out until my daughter got sick. It does take
a toll. I used to be very giving to people in the audience and take
on their problems. But now, I just give my best to the lecture, and
that's all I can give."</TE>
<TE>   As he works to expand his reach, giving up that personal contact
with fans is the price he's willing to pay for success.</TE>

<LD>Nothing could have prepared Jeff Porter for his first year as a
teacher at Locke High in South-Central Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Not his upbringing in suburban Dallas, or the Teach for America
"boot camp" that gave him a crash course in instructional techniques.
Not the four years he spent in college science classes, or the
summers building homes for poor villagers in Mexico, or the days
accompanying his social worker mother on her rounds through
inner-city Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   And certainly not the interview with the principal (who has since
moved on) who hired Porter on the spot and assigned the novice
teacher five classes in three subjects--including Advanced Placement
chemistry. And then set him up in a portable trailer, with no lab
equipment, supplies or textbooks.</LD>
<TE>   "I was amazed that I got hired," he said. "And I was floored by
what I found." The materials had been locked away during a campus
renovation, "and no one knew where they were," he said. So his
students went three months without chemistry books or equipment,
working on assignments Porter photocopied from the college texts he'd
used as a nutritional biochemistry major.</TE>
<TE>   What's worse is it hardly seemed to matter. Few of his Advanced
Placement students had ever studied chemistry. Many of them read at
grade-school level, and couldn't do basic algebra. Some refused to
read outside of class and most of them balked at homework
assignments. And these were high-achieving students at the inner-city
school.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 55 minutes a day to teach 17 chapters of college science to
kids ... and I wound up giving reading lessons and math lessons. They
were good kids," he said. "I didn't have any discipline problems."
But--like their teacher--they had been thrust unprepared into a
demanding class where failure was acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Placement classes were originally designed to challenge
students who have already mastered standard high-school subjects.
After each AP course, students are given standardized tests; if they
do well, they can earn college credit in the subject. Because grades
in AP courses are weighted to count more than regular classes, they
boost GPAs, a key to college entrance.</TE>
<TE>   And now they are often regarded as a barometer of our commitment
to high expectations. Three years ago, the state of California was
sued for shortchanging minority students by not offering enough AP
classes at their schools. Since then, districts have rushed to add AP
classes, particularly in inner-city schools. But the practice makes
sense on paper only. Even the best schools have difficulty finding
teachers qualified to run the high-level classes. A school like
Locke, which turns over about one-sixth of its teaching staff every
year, is often forced to rely on newcomers like Porter.</TE>
<TE>   Even students notice that their classes have been dumbed-down to
accommodate academic deficiencies. In an AP English class at one
South Los Angeles high school, a student complained that they didn't
read a single book in an entire semester. The final assignment was to
write a "friendly letter."</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy between what the classes can and should accomplish
shows up on the tests AP students take each spring. Statewide, only
about one-third of black and Latino students who take AP tests score
high enough to earn college credit, while two-thirds of white and
Asian kids do.</TE>
<TE>   There is no shortage of AP courses at Locke, which is virtually
all black and Latino. "They have about a dozen," Porter says. That's
more than double the number at the suburban high school he attended
10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a difference in offering the classes and preparing
students to succeed in them. In the last three years, none of the
Advanced Placement chemistry students at Locke has scored above a 2
on the year-end test, which is graded on a scale of 1 to 5. A 3 is
the minimum score most colleges require to grant course credit.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not even expected to get the kids to pass this test,"
Porter says. "On paper we have all these classes, but we don't have
the faculty or the facility to push our students."</TE>
<TE>   Porter said his pace in class had to be slow, because homework was
so seldom done and they had to cover in class what should have been
studied at home. "I expected them to read at night, so we could
discuss in class. It never happened. I assigned them two chapters to
read over Christmas vacation. When they returned, only two [students]
had done the work."</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't only students who are to blame. "The kids are
adaptable and smart enough, but they had never been pushed hard
enough--not even in kindergarten," he said. Instead, they were
allowed to slide through school by uninvolved parents, frustrated
teachers, a lackadaisical administration and a culture that tells
them that education has little to do with success.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do they get Air Jordans every two months, but they can't buy
a calculator for my class?" Porter wondered. "They complain that they
can't spend money on poster board, yet they come to class in brand
new FUBU [clothing]."</TE>
<TE>   Porter's two-year stint at Locke ended last week, and he began
packing the day of graduation. Last weekend he headed up to San
Francisco, where he has a sales job waiting with a wine company. He
admits to "postpartum guilt" over his decision not to return to
teaching next fall. "I really enjoyed the kids, and the art of
teaching," he says. "But frustration took its toll."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he sees glimmers of hope at Locke. A new principal arrived
last fall, a Locke alumnus who has the respect of the community and
is working to convince teachers to stay and parents to get involved.
And district officials say they're pouring money--most from grants
with an alphabet soup of names--into the school's efforts to train
more teachers and provide help for students trying to make the grade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to turn around at Locke," Porter says. "But it's going
to take awhile."</TE>
<TE>   And "awhile" is just one more thing these kids don't have.</TE>

<HD>Here's Takeout Fare for Famished Fliers</HD>
<DH>A new venture offers food to go for those who get no lift
from an airline meal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old joke about airline food is that it's pretty bad--and there's
so little of it!</LD>
<LD>   Richard J. Katz and Alan M. Levin feel the hungry passenger's
pain. The former television executives are launching SkyMeals, a food
delivery service for travelers that could help eliminate on-board
hunger-induced frustration.</LD>
<LD>   The frequent flier who cringes every time a flight attendant asks,
"Chicken or pasta?" will be able to go to SkyMeals.com and peruse a
menu of breakfast items, generous sandwiches, buffet platters, salads
and desserts. Orders must be placed by phone 24 hours before takeoff.
A room-temperature meal is delivered to the customer's home or
office, packed in foil-lined containers inside a purple and gold
SkyMeals shopping bag. Katz and Levin hope to eventually serve
multiple cities, but initially, delivery will be available only on
L.A.'s Westside. Service is scheduled to begin Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The average price of a SkyMeal is $35 to $40. Levin says, "We're
looking to reach a demographic that is used to good food and good
restaurants. We don't expect this to only appeal to first-class
passengers. People who are content to pick up a Big Mac and fries at
the airport won't be our customers. We're looking for the traveler
who likes to eat well and can afford to."</TE>
<TE>   Who might that be? The business person whose company won't pay for
first- or business-class tickets anymore, but will approve a SkyMeal
charged to an expense account. Or someone in a commuter marriage, who
flies regularly and can't face another plastic tray filled with cold
rolls, limp lettuce, gummy salad dressing and other insults.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who like to leave nothing to chance, including
when their next meal will appear. SkyMeals is a control freak's
dream. "Each meal is made to order, prepared for you, to your
specifications," Katz says. "Having it with you gives you the option
of eating a little bit, whenever you're hungry--a little now, and a
little later. You don't have to eat when the airline decides to serve
you."</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers are already in the habit of bringing along their
own food--including gourmet takeout and homemade treats--on flights.
Levin sat near a woman in first class recently who had asked the
Peninsula Hotel to pack a meal to go (an indulgence she said cost her
$66). "I asked her why she brought her own food," Levin says, "and
she said she didn't like airline food, even in first class.''</TE>
<TE>   After its launch on the Westside, the first level of expansion
will be to the rest of the Los Angeles area. In nine months to a
year, Levin and Katz expect to add other cities. Since airport
security prevents passengers from carrying knives, the food is
pre-cut. Nothing needs to be heated, and the meals are designed with
an unrefrigerated shelf life of eight or nine hours.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Ungar, SkyMeals' full-time chef, works out of a kitchen on
Lincoln Boulevard in Venice. Since Lincoln is a popular route to the
airport from the Westside, the company is also offering curbside
pickup. Airlines typically spend $2 to $3 per passenger on food.
"We're using really fresh ingredients, and we aren't hiding the
flavor with lots of mayonnaise and salt," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The concept for SkyMeals was conceived in 1998. Levin and Katz
were flying home from a conference in France. Before going to the
airport, they hit their favorite Parisian charcuterie and
patisseries. Once on board, they unwrapped cheeses and pate, salami,
prosciutto, fresh baguettes and chocolate croissants. "Even though we
were flying in business class, we preferred fresh food to what the
airline was serving. Everyone around us was envious."</TE>
<TE>   If the cheese they bought was fragrant, envy might not have been
the only emotion their spread inspired. The SkyMeals founders aren't
worried that the smell of Caesar salad with blackened salmon might
attract attention. In fact, they hope it will.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, 62,000 people fly out of LAX," Levin says.</TE>
<TE>   "If every one of them wants a SkyMeal, we'd have a good problem.
For starters, we'll be happy selling 100 meals a day. I think we'll
far exceed that."</TE>
<TE>   Just how particular, and spoiled, travelers are remains to be
seen. For those who really like to be taken care of, SkyMeals will
make a $14.95 peanut butter and jelly sandwich for traveling
children.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are ordering for themselves, we want to give them the
option of having something for their children too," Levin says.</TE>

<LD>"Miss Graduate-To-Be, may I please have the bathroom now?" I shout to
Kate, pounding on the door.</LD>
<LD>   She has been in there for about an hour.</LD>
<LD>   "OK, OK," she shouts back and comes flouncing out, leaving behind
a very nice smell of Dior perfume. I see she's carrying the bottle so
there's no chance for me to sneak a spray. Kate always knows what I
have in mind. Sometimes I think she's unnecessarily selfish!</LD>
<TE>   "I think I'm entitled to hog the bathroom today," she announces,
and I say, "You definitely are." I figure this is the day to be nice
to Kate, and tomorrow I can go back to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Grandma and Grandpa arrive with the cake.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the frosting lopsided?" Grandma asks nervously. "My mind was
somewhere else when I was spreading it."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a masterpiece," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   We find room for it in our overstuffed refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "You look lovely, Mother," Dad says to Grandma.</TE>
<TE>   "You look lovely, too," I tell Grandpa, so he doesn't feel left
out.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that your new suit?" Mom asks him, smoothing the lapels. "What
a good-looking fellow you are. No wonder I married your son."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to look my best for this once-in-a-lifetime happening,"
Grandpa says.</TE>
<TE>   The aunts and cousins arrive in two cars because they live out of
town, and there's a lot of congratulating and kissing. Of course they
tell me how much I've grown, which I doubt, since they saw me a month
ago. I know for a fact that I'm not any taller. I like it when my
family is together like this.</TE>
<TE>   We're careful not to enjoy one another so much that we forget the
time. Our dining-room clock chimes noon, and Mom takes a deep breath
and says, "All right. Everybody ready?"</TE>
<TE>   There's a lot of talk about who'll drive with whom. When we get
settled we realize that our dog, Buster, is in the car, so we have to
hurry and take him out and tell him we'll be back.</TE>
<TE>   We have Grandma and Grandpa with us. I sit in the middle in back,
behind the bump. "What a happy, happy day," Grandma says.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa winks at me. "There's nothing this girl of mine likes more
than a party."</TE>
<TE>   But I know that, for all of us, today is more important than even
a party.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Is there something special about this graduation?</TE>
<TE>   Eve Bunting's favorite graduation day was when her granddaughter
graduated from preschool! This story will be on The Times' Web site
at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<KH>LOS ANGELES FILM FESTIVAL / First Person</KH>
<HD>Up to His Eyeballs in Cinematic Wonders</HD>
<DH>Total immersion is one way to take in all that a festival
has to offer. The result is seeing 11 movies in 12 hours, a feat no
buff would want to miss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN CRUST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Saturday I visited Hiroshima, Spain, Colorado, Mexico, Turkey,
Warsaw, Manhattan, San Francisco, Tanzania, Brazil, Las Vegas,
Wisconsin and Montreal, and I wasn't even tired. OK, I was a little
tired, but I managed to see all those places without venturing more
than a couple of hundred yards from the corner of Sunset and Crescent
Heights boulevards.</LD>
<LD>   The day was spent at the IFP/West--Los Angeles Film Festival, an
event in its eighth year that has received an infusion of life by
repositioning itself as a general-interest fest, including for the
first time an international showcase.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 150 films in 10 days, a festival like this can be
daunting for an audience facing a schedule full of unfamiliar titles.
One can either handpick films and try to see one or two per day or
take my approach: total immersion in a full day of screenings,
sampling something from each of the festival's programs.</LD>
<TE>   Through 12 hours of screenings, which included 11 films, I
witnessed houses that ranged from half-full to sold out. The
enthusiasm and response to both films and filmmakers was strong all
day; some of the smaller crowds, however, would indicate that the
audience may take a few years to build to fully support the
festival's lofty ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's first Saturday offered a full slate of films and
events and seemed to be a perfect way to experience a bit of
everything. Among the many joys of a film festival is variety that
one simply cannot find at even the best-programmed art house. The
eclectic nature of the festival can be quickly observed within the
context of a short-films program.</TE>
<TE>   My day began with the 10 a.m. screening of "The End," five
disparate shorts, including two animated films, two comedies and a
documentary, all of which in some way encompassed the theme of
existence.</TE>
<TE>   Though all five films were splendid, the highlight of the program,
and ultimately of the entire day, was Yasemin Kasim's "We Missed Our
God," a touching documentary capturing her elderly grandparent's
return to their native Turkey. Although the least technically
sophisticated of the shorts--UCLA student Kasim used a simple
hand-held approach--it expresses strong emotions and underscores the
powerful effects place and faith have on our sense of self.</TE>
<TE>   As were most of the screenings, "The End" was followed by a brief
audience question-answer session with three of the directors. The
presence of the filmmakers is one of the joys of seeing films at a
festival. There is something about hearing in person what inspired
them to make their films and what they had to go through to get them
made that enhances the experience of seeing the finished product.</TE>
<TE>   After a quick lunch, I ducked into the "Coffee Talk" on acting,
part of a series of discussions on the various crafts of filmmaking
featuring two or sometimes three filmmakers in a moderated chat about
their jobs. Actors Blair Underwood and Molly Parker, along with
moderator screenwriter Naomi Foner, herself the mother of two actors,
compared their experiences from very different careers and offered
advice to the audience, which, not surprisingly, appeared to be made
up primarily of aspiring actors.</TE>
<TE>   Intensity and Diversity</TE>
<TE>   The heaviest part of the film-viewing day was upon me. At 2:15
p.m., I saw an intense black-and-white Polish drama, "Hi Tereska,"
directed by Robert Glinski. Aleksandra Gietner stars as a sweet
Warsaw teenager whose gradual slide into delinquency explodes in an
ending that can only be called unremittingly grim.</TE>
<TE>   Next was a pairing of two diverse documentaries, each involving a
man of color seeking a missing part of his being. Sarah Kernochan's
Academy Award-winning short, "Thoth," tells the story of an eccentric
Central Park performer who has created a one-man opera as well as his
own mythology.</TE>
<TE>   In "That's My Face," Thomas Allen Harris, a filmmaker afflicted
with double vision, goes on a poetic quest in search of his roots
that leads backward to a similar journey his mother made in the 1970s
and forward to an area of Brazil known as "The Island of the Tides."
The quest was inspired by one dream and Harris was aided by another,
which led him to a treasure trove of home movies shot by his
grandfather; they are incorporated into the film.</TE>
<TE>   The definite crowd-pleaser of the day was Christian Taylor and
Lindy Heymann's faux documentary, "Showboy." Taylor, basically
playing himself, is a writer for TV's "Six Feet Under" when a BBC
documentary crew chooses him as the subject for a "successful young
Brit in Hollywood" piece. Although he is almost immediately fired by
producer and mentor Alan Ball, the crew still follows him as he goes
to Las Vegas; he is supposedly researching a screenplay, but it
gradually becomes obvious that he is actually pursuing his dream of
being a dancer.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Collins' short, "Pickup Polka," has a dry Great White North
sensibility and is similar in some ways to "Fargo." A team of nerdy
Czech immigrants accompanied by a polka-playing accordionist takes on
a team of ringers in a game of basketball in a Madison, Wis.,
gymnasium. The short aptly preceded "Looking for Leonard" by
Canadians Matt Bissonette and Steven Clark, an equally dry black
comedy about a comely femme fatale who reads Leonard Cohen novels and
has a deadly affair with yet another Czech emigre.</TE>
<TE>   At 11:30 p.m., following the "Looking for Leonard" question-answer
session, I called it a night even though there were midnight
screenings beckoning. My cinematic passport was full.</TE>

<HD>A Landmark Mexican Film Grips a Young Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I urgently need some tequila," says Mexican filmmaker Alfonso
Cuaron, aligning in front of him a shot glass filled to the brim and
a frosted bottle of Corona. But he forgets both drink and chaser as
soon as he begins to talk about "Canoa," one of three films the guest
curator recommended to the IFP/West--Los Angeles Film Festival
lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Cuaron and "Canoa" director Felipe Cazals are being feted by the
Mexican consul in an upscale West Hollywood restaurant just as a
screening of the seminal 1975 Mexican picture is in progress a few
blocks away at the Directors Guild of America. The film is a
historical and cinematic landmark of sorts, but Cuaron decided to
showcase it during the festival for personal reasons. When he was 14
and growing up in Mexico City, he saw "Canoa" and became unable to
shake its grip on his soul. He went back to watch it over and over
again. "I was so used to seeing a Mexican cinema that was poor in
terms of craft and not very interesting. But," Cuaron recalls, his
eyes glowing enthusiastically, "in this film I was confronted with
something powerful and felt touched by it in every regard."</LD>
<TE>   Eventually the movie bore an imprint on his own work, becoming a
source of inspiration for "Y Tu Mama Tambien," the road adventure
marking two boys' initiation into manhood which Cuaron co-wrote and
directed. The film shattered 2001 box-office records in his native
Mexico and is currently enjoying a prolonged run as one of the most
successful foreign-language films to have landed in U.S. theaters
this year.</TE>
<TE>   To American audiences ready to sink their teeth into more
south-of-the-border cinema, Cuaron suggests Cazals, a director who
came up with the new wave of Mexican cinema of the '60s and '70s. "He
just brings a natural narrative intelligence to a theme, which in his
best movies is based on a real event," says Cuaron. "Canoa," which
the "Y Tu Mama" director says popped in his head when festival
organizers asked him to pick three of his favorite pictures, "still
continues to have an impact in Mexico to this day."</TE>
<TE>   In an austere but vigorous visual style, "Canoa" embroiders on
actual events on Sept. 14, 1968, in the mountainous hamlet of San
Miguel de Canoa. Stirred into collective hysteria by a Machiavellian
priest, a mob of local residents lynched several workers from the
nearby Puebla University, whom they mistakenly thought part of the
radical student movement gathering momentum in Mexico City at the
time. The story unfolds as a would-be documentary, with dialogue
reconstructed from the testimonies of participants but punctuated by
the remarks of an omniscient, skeptical on-screen narrator. (It was
this idea of a narrator who periodically interrupts the flow of the
plot and opens the story to a wider context that Cuaron borrowed in
"Y Tu Mama.")</TE>
<TE>   A study in human group psychology and mass manipulation, the film
traces the chilling, step-by-step anatomy of a particular atrocity,
which it ultimately transcends to achieve broader relevance. "
'Canoa' is a metaphor for something bigger," says Cuaron, referring
to the parallel between the villagers' act of violence and what he
calls the biggest scar in his country's psyche, the Oct. 2, 1968,
massacre of student protesters by government troops in Mexico City.
To this day, the bloodbath remains cloaked in silence. No precise
number of victims has ever been released, but it is estimated there
were a couple of thousand. The fact that only seven years later
"Canoa" was able symbolically to drag the heavily censored event into
plain view on screen "is one of the many things I admire about this
movie," says Cuaron.</TE>
<TE>   From across the table, director Cazals explains in Spanish that
the production was able to skirt government censorship because it was
financed jointly with funds from a bank and a percentage from the
salaries of everybody who worked on it, from the director to the last
technician.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Canoa" is about mass psychology, "the film doesn't
disregard the human experience," says Cuaron. There are unforgettable
individual characters--like the manipulative priest Meza, played by
Enrique Lucero, remarkable for his signature dark shades and gift for
exalted rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   In long, static shots, the camera observes the throngs of
townsfolk inflamed by Father Meza's anti-communist sermons closing in
on the Puebla workers they mistake for leftist activists. At the
point of contact, unspeakable violence is shown unflinchingly, with
men and even women with babies in tow participating in the carnage.
At the edge of the human maelstrom, two villagers are seen calmly
engaged in a conversation about their animals' health.</TE>
<TE>   "In 'Canoa' the violence is brutal but honest," says Cuaron. He
explains that Cazals shows acts of cruelty that are meant to
embarrass, not titillate, the audience. "He is not trying to give an
ideological lesson, but simply capture a social moment: Those workers
represent the people of Mexico. Some are pro-students, some are
indifferent to them. But even though they believe that the student
rebellion is alien to them, the violence ends up affecting everybody
in the end," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the two directors climb into a white minivan that hurtles
along Sunset Boulevard toward the theater where the conclusion of
"Canoa" is being played out on screen.</TE>
<TE>   In a foreshadowing of reality, the film closes on a celebratory
note with villagers attending a local festival. Likewise, the 1968
Olympic Games that began in Mexico City shortly after the student
massacre seemed to all but erase the horror of the act from the
public consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   The film was honored with a Silver Bear at the 1976 Berlin Film
Festival but has been rarely seen outside Mexico, "for reasons we can
only blame on Mexican bureaucrats," says Cuaron. In the face of the
film's testimony, the inhabitants of the real village of Canoa have
remained in denial, director Cazals explains to the festival audience
through a translator at a question-and-answer session following the
screening. Last year on the day commemorating the killing, a banner
went up in the local church proclaiming, "What the movie says is not
true."</TE>
<TE>   "I think you just experienced an amazing film, and I'm proud of
that," Cuaron tells an audience that stands up and roars in response.</TE>
<TE>   And for those who wonder whether an American audience can forge an
emotional connection with an act of violence committed some 30-odd
years ago in a village deep in the rural heart of Mexico, Cuaron has
a simple answer: "An injustice in one part of the Earth affects the
whole mankind. A genocide does not affect only the victims, but
humanity itself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The other two features selected by Cuaron for the
festival--Jacques Rozier's "Adieu Philippine" and F.W. Murnau's
"Sunrise"--screen at the Directors Guild of America, 7920 Sunset
Blvd., on Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., respectively. (866)

<HD>New Hollywood Has Become a Stand-Up Quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Music Guild's spinoff series, Coffee, Cakes &amp; Chamber Music on a
Sunday Afternoon, drew a fairly substantial turnout at Brentwood's
University Synagogue over the weekend, perhaps lured by the marquee
value of the New Hollywood String Quartet.</LD>
<LD>   It's probable that many in the audience remember the original
Hollywood String Quartet, wondering how these guys stack up against
the legend.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out that the New Hollywood has become a formidable team
only about 1 1/2 years after its debut concert. These studio players
blend together as seamlessly and often as sumptuously as do more
seasoned quartets, with painstaking care in the shaping of virtually
every phrase.</LD>
<TE>   Also, as of two or three months ago, violinists Clayton Haslop and
Rafael Rishik and violist David Walther have started to play standing
up (with cellist Paul Cohen remaining seated), joining the Emerson
Quartet in a striking departure from business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   They look good doing so--especially Haslop, whose tall, lean frame
sways dramatically backward as he plays--and one wonders whether the
sound is affected, for the group had a remarkably even balance with
no one voice dominating.</TE>
<TE>   There is artistic growth too. The first movement of the Schubert
Quartet No. 13 ("Rosamunde") was a bit faster, more sharply
characterized, and it breathed more deeply than on a recording made
in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, they apply too much polish; the finale of the
Schubert could have used more of a rhythmic kick.</TE>
<TE>   The Beethoven Quartet No. 6 evolved from a tightly classical first
movement to absorbing dialogues in the finale, and spurts of drive
emerged through the refined textures in Dvorak's Quartet No. 14.</TE>
<TE>   While it doesn't try to sound like the original, the New Hollywood
is certainly up to the task of maintaining its predecessor's high
technical and musical standards.</TE>

<LD>John Woo almost single-handedly reinvented the modern-day action
movie with his bravura 1980s Hong Kong movies, but his introduction
to Hollywood filmmaking was a near fiasco. "In Hong Kong, everything
was very simple," the soft-spoken director recalled the other day,
sitting in his Santa Monica offices. "The filmmakers had full
control. We'd have one meeting with the studio, just to let them know
the idea for the movie, and then we'd be on our own." Woo's eyes
twinkled. "I think often I wrote and directed the film at the same
time."</LD>
<LD>   The director had a rude awakening on his first studio film, a 1993
Jean-Claude Van Damme action vehicle from Universal called "Hard
Target." Woo went weeks over schedule and had a disastrous test
screening where an American audience, unfamiliar at that point with
Woo's hyperkinetic style, tittered at his ballet-like action scenes
and heart-on-his-sleeve storytelling.</LD>
<LD>   "Things eventually turned out OK, but at the time it was something
of a catastrophe," recalls veteran producer Jim Jacks, a longtime Woo
fan who made the movie. "It was a real cultural education for all of
us. American audiences didn't understand the Chinese style of drama.
And John had to adjust to American actors. He was used to Chow
Yun-Fat, who was respectful and would always defer to his director.
But that wasn't the case at all with Jean-Claude."</LD>
<TE>   Since that rocky start, Woo has emerged as one of Hollywood's most
bankable action directors, making such hits as "Face/Off" and
"Mission: Impossible 2." His flamboyant style of directing has
influenced a wide spectrum of filmmakers, from Quentin Tarantino to
the Wachowski brothers. Woo is so well established that he'll survive
the drubbing he's taken on "Windtalkers," the $115-million film that
will be a huge money-loser for MGM.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even his biggest fans--count me as one of them--believe
that most of Woo's Hollywood movies pale in comparison to his work in
Hong Kong on such films as "A Better Tomorrow" and "Hard-Boiled." As
Dave Kehr wrote recently in the New York Times: "In much of his
American work, Woo has seemed more concerned with satisfying
expectations than he has with exploring new directions or trying to
grow as an artist." Woo is hardly alone. There are many emigre
directors, from Holland's Paul Verhoeven to Mexico's Luis Mandoki,
whose American films haven't matched the artistry of the films they
made in their native countries.</TE>
<TE>   All too many foreign directors have suffered severe culture shock.</TE>
<TE>   Alain Berliner, the Belgian director of "Ma Vie En Rose," had a
disastrous experience making "Passion of Mind" with Demi Moore, who
walked away from the movie. Chen Kaige, the Chinese director of
"Farewell My Concubine," made "Killing Me Softly," starring Heather
Graham and Joseph Fiennes, a movie that still sits on the shelf
unreleased. Talented directors like Alfonso Cuaron (Mexico),
Jean-Pierre Jeunet (France) and Mira Nair (India) returned to their
native countries to rejuvenate their careers after floundering in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Hollywood hires foreign filmmakers for their
artistic cachet, then often wastes their gifts on hackneyed material.
It's that classic combination of the American thirst for the exotic
and insistence on the familiar. I laughed out loud when I heard the
elegant French director Jean-Jacques Annaud referred to at his
American talent agency as "J.J."</TE>
<TE>   Successes and Struggles</TE>
<TE>   Foreign directors have a long, rich history in Hollywood, from
Josef von Sternberg and Billy Wilder to Fritz Lang and Fred
Zinnemann, and more recently directors like Czech-born Milos Forman
have flourished in America. But many have suffered, including
Ireland's Neil Jordan, who bombed trying to make broad comedies here,
and the late Louis Malle, who returned to France embittered by his
studio experience. Even directors like Wolfgang Petersen and Lasse
Hallstrom, who've enjoyed great success, struggled for years trying
to marry their European sensibility with American material.</TE>
<TE>   For foreign filmmakers, Hollywood can be a wilderness populated by
willful movie stars and meddling studio executives. "It's a very
insecure business," says Woo, who learned English by watching TV news
and became a U.S. citizen five years ago. "Everyone wants to get
involved and change things, which creates a lot of confusion. I can
never get used to all of the meetings and politics. You can spend
eight months just in meetings--it wastes so much time and energy."</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign directors have work habits that would be considered
outlandish by Hollywood standards. People who visit the sets of Tsui
Hark, the brilliant Hong Kong director of such films as "Peking Opera
Blues" and "Once Upon a Time in China," say he often goes without
sleep for days on end, sometimes working with an IV-fluid drip in his
arm to keep him going.</TE>
<TE>   When filming in Hong Kong, Woo and Hark thought nothing of
stopping a film for weeks at a time--and releasing their crew--while
they rewrote the script or dreamed up a better action sequence. In
Hollywood, where crews are unionized, such improvisation would be
unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big adjustment for filmmakers to come here and see a
street filled with big trailers for movie stars," says Theo van de
Sande, a Dutch-born cinematographer who has shot many Hollywood films
("Blade," "Volcano") since moving here in 1987. "In Europe, directors
are storytellers. Here you tell a story and then you have a test
screening to ask the audience if they liked it or not."</TE>
<TE>   A Loss of Control</TE>
<TE>   Much of the culture clash comes from issues of control. In
Hollywood, it's the $20-million movie star who wields the power. But
in Europe and Asia, it's the director who is king. "A lot of my
friends have rushed to America to make a Hollywood movie, only to
learn that if you are hired to make a movie developed by the studio,
the movie is not yours," says Annaud, director of "The Name of the
Rose" and "Seven Years in Tibet."</TE>
<TE>   The studios have often steered filmmakers into misguided
projects--"Amelie's" Jean-Pierre Jeunet was oh-so-wrong for "Alien:
Resurrection"--but directors are hardly unwilling participants.
Verhoeven seemed startled when I once asked him why he'd abandoned
the vividly personal movies he made in Holland. When he was young, he
said, "all I wanted to do was come to Hollywood and make war movies."</TE>
<TE>   Hark was so eager to work in America that he was willing to make
his debut making a film starring Van Damme, Mickey Rourke and Dennis
Rodman--you'd need a couple of IVs to survive that one.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, everyone wants to come here so you have to learn
to play by Hollywood's rules," says Ashok Amritraj, the Indian-born
producer of American films including "Bandits." "It can be
overwhelming. It took me 10 years to get to know the right players
and shake the right hands."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural connections don't come easy. Amritraj says he has shied
away from making American teenage movies, saying "it would be very
hard to do it well for someone who didn't grow up here." After "Hard
Target," Woo spent two years traveling in America, getting to know
the country before he made another movie. But it's also crucial to
learn the culture of Hollywood, where everyone, qualified or not,
gets to have an opinion about the finished product.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for filmmakers who've always listened to their own
voice to suddenly have to take in all these points of view and
discern what's valuable and what's not," says ICM's Robert Newman, an
agent who represents a host of A-list directors.</TE>
<TE>   Although directors like Woo have often been saddled with clunky
scripts here, their stylistic flourishes have begun to alter the
square-jawed look of Hollywood films. In Hong Kong movies, actors are
free with laughter and tears. So when Woo made "Face/Off," he
pestered Nicolas Cage to be more emotionally expressive. "American
actors think that the hero never cries," he explains. "Nick would
always say, 'Are you sure I can do that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Having an outsider's perspective has breathed extra life into such
quintessentially American films as Forman's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," and Wim Wenders' "Paris, Texas."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're an immigrant, you make films with an accent just as
you talk with one," says Annaud. "You shouldn't try to hide it. It's
the accent that gives you a special flavor."</TE>

<HD>Sanz Matures; Fans Don't</HD>
<DH>Latin singer-songwriter performed only one new song at the
Greek, but he demonstrated significant depth. And the women went
crazy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alejandro Sanz performed only one new number during his 16-song
concert at the Greek Theatre on Sunday. With most of his band off
stage, the Spanish singer-songwriter retreated to a keyboard and soon
seemed lost in the aching, tender sentiment of the tune he had penned
just a week ago, "Te lo dire bajito" (I'll Tell You Softly).</LD>
<LD>   His delivery was hushed, as if privately speaking to a loved one
while we eavesdropped. Fragments of the pensive lyrics lingered in
the cool night air: "Todos somos heroes en busca de auxilio." (We are
all heroes seeking to be rescued.) It was a moment that might have
matched the still beauty of the nearly full moon glowing over the
Greek but for the uncouth fans whose hysterical screams shattered the
artist's delicate mood.</LD>
<LD>   The new jewel in the Sanz repertoire came sandwiched between a
bouncy trifle from his 1991 debut album and his catchy 1997 hit
"Corazon Partio," the concert's sing-along closer. By juxtaposing old
and new, the sequence highlighted just how much this pop troubadour
has matured as a songwriter.</LD>
<TE>   In content, this was essentially the same show Sanz gave last year
at the Universal Amphitheatre, with a core of five songs from "El
Alma al Aire," the 2000 album that won an armful of Latin Grammys.
But in style, Sunday's concert reflected the toned-down approach of
his more recent "MTV Unplugged."</TE>
<TE>   At last year's show, the singer connected emotionally only when
the overblown arrangements subsided, as when he played flamenco
guitar on "Buleria." He did the same song during his encore Sunday.
But this time fans didn't have to wait to the end to see the warm and
intimate side of Sanz, whose voice was also less hoarse than usual,
suppler, stronger and more precise.</TE>
<TE>   His stage persona was as unpretentious as his attire: jeans and a
casual striped shirt, worn unbuttoned and tails out. With his
natural, nice-guy aura, the short and unassuming Spaniard makes an
unlikely sex symbol. He doesn't have the visceral magnetism of a Luis
Miguel or the urbane charm of Julio Iglesias in his heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Sanz drives the women wild.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a possessive admirer nearly pulled the singer off
the stage when he leaned over to greet her. It took two burly
security guards to wrestle the determined woman to the ground while a
third pulled Sanz back from the brink. Talk about our hero needing to
be rescued. Still, he later ordered guards to let another excited
female fan approach. The risk yielded an impromptu duet at the edge
of the stage--and points for Sanz as one of our most accessible Latin
superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Bacilos, Miami's interesting new Latin folk-rock group, opened the
show and left fans asking for more.</TE>

<HD>The Rocky Road to 'Brideshead'</HD>
<DH>Television* The miniseries survived two production
shutdowns and a script that began at the end. The complete,
remastered version is on DVD today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since Anglophiles were
in the throes of "Brideshead Revisited" fever. Every Monday night,
viewers were glued to PBS' "Great Performances" to catch the latest
installment in the 11-hour miniseries based on Evelyn Waugh's classic
novel about the waning days of the British aristocracy between the
two world wars.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy Irons starred as Charles Ryder, an officer in the British
Army during World War II, who recalls his friendship with the
flamboyant, self-destructive Sebastian (Anthony Andrews), whom he met
when they were both students at Oxford, and his relationship with
Sebastian's very wealthy Catholic family who reside at the opulent
castle Brideshead.</LD>
<LD>   Critics raved about the drama and it won 17 international awards,
including an Emmy for Laurence Olivier, who played Sebastian's
father, Lord Marchmain. "Brideshead" transformed Irons into a major
international player.</LD>
<TE>   The complete, uncut and digitally remastered "Brideshead" makes
its DVD debut today in a lovely three-disc set (Acorn, $80), complete
with a companion guide, production notes, location photos, facts and
photos about Castle Howard, biographies of the cast, crew and even
Aloysius, the teddy bear owned by Sebastian.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the success of "Brides- head," the production was beset
with one harrowing crisis after another, director Charles Sturridge
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Production began in England in late spring of 1979 and within six
weeks was shuttered by a technicians strike. The strike lasted four
months. "It not only brought production to a halt, it threw every
contract, arrangement, location that had been booked out the window,"
says Sturridge, who most recently directed "Shackleton."</TE>
<TE>   It also became clear during the strike that the original director,
Michael Lindsay-Hogg, wouldn't be able to continue because he had
another engagement.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, they had shot it like one enormous feature film,"
Sturridge says. "They had shot a disparate groups of scenes. They
started, in fact, with Sebastian's final scenes in Morocco. They
hadn't done any Oxford or Castle Howard scenes, but they had done
some of the London parties."</TE>
<TE>   Sturridge was brought in and production started again in September
1979. It continued for 42 of the next 52 weeks. Why the second
interruption?</TE>
<TE>   "When we re-contracted everybody, Jeremy had expressed a desire
that he wanted to do [the film adaptation of] 'French Lieutenant's
Woman,' which he hadn't been cast in at that point. He said, 'If I am
cast, I want to get out to do it.' This bargain was accepted,
frankly, in hope that he wouldn't get the part. But he did get the
part, so we had a second hiatus, slightly more organized this time in
that we could see it coming. So in the summer of 1980, we again
stopped production and used the time to work on post-production to
cut what we had done."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the miniseries had been commissioned and written as a
conventional, six-hour TV adaptation that didn't have Charles Ryder's
voice-over.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take the personal observation out of it, if you take out
the fact it is Charles Ryder's version of the events of the story and
start to tell the story from a neutral point of view, the story
becomes very different and starts to fall apart," Sturridge says.
"This had begun to become obvious when Michael was shooting and
during the strike it became quite clear that the six-hour abridged
version didn't have the potency of the story."</TE>
<TE>   So the original script was tossed out and the decision was made to
expand the miniseries by five hours.</TE>
<TE>   "A trick I have always tried to repeat is to take advantage of
accidents," Sturridge says.</TE>
<TE>   Sturridge, who was only 28 and had very little directing
experience before "Brideshead," had only nine days of preparation
from the day he got the job to when production was to resume. To make
matters more complicated, the final episode had to be shot first
because of Olivier's schedule. And there was no script.</TE>
<TE>   "Olivier was very concerned that he wouldn't know his lines and he
kept saying, 'I must have the script. I must have the script.' So
producer Derek Granger and I, in a disused chapel in Yorkshire,
hammered out what became that episode and then hammered out the basic
structure of all the other episodes."</TE>
<TE>   Sturridge says one of the most extraordinary things about his
"Brideshead" experience was "to make a film about the complexity of a
group for relationships over a period of time over such a long
period. As a cast and crew we spent nearly two years together, which
is unusual for a film. It is more like being in a theater company."</TE>
<TE>   And he's remained close with a lot of the cast members. In fact,
he's been married 17 years to "Brideshead" star Phoebe Nicholls, with
whom he has three children. "We are quite close," Sturridge says,
laughing. "Derek [Granger] is godfather to my children."</TE>
<TE>   He also worked with Irons a few years back in the TV miniseries
"Longitude" and recently talked to Andrews about teaming up for a
project. "It is an experience that is part of us all," Sturridge
says.</TE>

<HD>Working Together in South Africa</HD>
<DH>Eloquent performances in ''Master Harold' ... and the boys'
match the wit and insight of playwright Athol Fugard's play about
injustice and dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a South African tea room on a rainy afternoon in 1950, the owners'
17-year-old son and two black waiters are excitedly working out an
idea. The boy has a cultural-history paper due at school, and he is
pumping the men for information about the big ballroom dance
competition for which they have been preparing whenever business is
slow.</LD>
<LD>   Grinning with a giddy sense of common purpose, the three of them
embody the theme they're developing for the paper: a perfect world
where people glide gracefully alongside each other without colliding.</LD>
<LD>   It is a wonderfully evocative scene, and witnessing it again in
International City Theatre's vibrant revival of " 'Master Harold' ...
and the boys" prompts renewed appreciation for the power and poetry
of Athol Fugard's writing. The 1982 play, written before apartheid's
fall, also lays instructive groundwork for the South African
playwright's new "Sorrows and Rejoicings," currently at the Mark
Taper Forum in its West Coast premiere.</LD>
<TE>   Fugard once explained in an interview that two people had
profoundly influenced his writing about injustice and the dream of
future healing. One was his mother, who "kept alive in me--when
society was trying to blunt it--a sense of what is right and wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The other was Sam Semela, a black man who worked for Fugard's
family. Despite his affection for the man, Fugard had, when he was
young, angrily spit in Semela's face. "I knew that it was ugly the
moment I did it," the playwright recalled. "What I began to
understand--as the seconds and the days and the years passed--was how
ugly and evil was an attitude of racial superiority that allowed you
to do that with impunity."</TE>
<TE>   Sam is one of the waiters in " 'Master Harold' "; Fugard himself
is the boy, Hally; and his mother, though unseen, calls with the news
that speeds the play toward its shattering climax.</TE>
<TE>   The performances in the International City production are as
eloquent as Fugard's writing. As Sam, Leon Morenzie stands tall,
moves with grace and speaks with crisp wit and insight. No wonder
Travis Vaden's Hally adores him, his eyes narrowing with pleasure
every time Sam lobs him an intellectual challenge. As Willie, the
other waiter, Gregg Daniel watches and reacts to Hally and Sam's
interactions--a sort of theatrical stand-in for South Africa itself.</TE>
<TE>   Don Llewellyn has designed a tea room that imaginatively combines
realism and symbolism. Its symbolic touch is a giant kite that dips
low over the room as the audience enters to take its seats, then, as
the play begins, rises to become the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The kite is central to another of the story's images: of a younger
Hally and Sam laughing together as their rickety, handmade kite
catches the wind and becomes "something alive," as Hally remembers
it, tugging "as if it wanted to be free." It is Fugard's vision of a
South Africa where people work together to get dreams off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Under caryn morse desai's direction, the action flows along on
waves of goodwill until Hally gets some bad news and explosively
lashes out at a convenient and socially sanctioned target: Sam.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorrows and Rejoicings" provides a coda to this story. In it, a
white woman and a black woman, representatives of their respective
cultures in post-apartheid South Africa, struggle to reconcile with
one another. Will they manage it? That is the question that Fugard
now asks in his plays, but only the people of his homeland can write
the ending.</TE>

<LD>   Disney Concert Hall: A Hard-Hat Perspective</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Concert Hall, the $274-million edifice designed by
Frank Gehry, won't be open until the fall of 2003. But after 2 1/2
years of construction, the building--situated on a 3.6-acre plot on
the corner of 1st Street and Grand Avenue in downtown L.A.--is taking
shape, inside and out.</LD>
<TE>   A "hard-hat tour" provides a glimpse into the 293,000-square-foot
future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Fifteen thousand pieces
of steel have been reviewed by the design team--most of them
custom-made, in light of the irregular angles and curves. If each
were laid end to end, they'd extend 41 miles, we're told.</TE>
<TE>   The building is divided into a series of spaces--an inverted
tulip-shaped founder's room, an open-air children's
amphitheater--that makes for surprising intimacy. The 2,265-seat
concert hall, for starters, is much smaller than expected. The last
row in the sky-lit venue is the same distance from the orchestra as
the back row of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion's founder's
circle--considered by some to be the best place to sit, says the
Philharmonic's deputy director of development, Dan Rothblatt.</TE>
<TE>   The last piece of wood paneling is being hoisted onto the ceiling
of the hall, scheduled for completion next spring. And the seats,
when installed, will be a random sprinkling of bold colors (teal,
greens, oranges), constructed by the manufacturer of seats for
Ferrari and Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   In 'Minority Report,' Pot Calling Kettle Black?</TE>
<TE>   One of the themes tackled by "Minority Report," the new Steven
Spielberg sci-fi film, is the bombardment of culture by advertising.
But according to Daily Variety, the movie is guilty of that itself.</TE>
<TE>   Ad placement by major brands are said to have knocked off roughly
$25 million from the movie's $102-million budget, a production of
Twentieth Century Fox and DreamWorks. More than 15
companies--including American Express, Burger King, USA Today and Ben
&amp; Jerry's--forked out big money to get some screen time.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota paid $5 million to secure a prime placement for a
futuristic Lexus that Tom Cruise uses to climb the sides of
buildings. And Nokia spent $2 million to design the sci-fi headsets
through which most of the characters communicate. Outside observers
are debating whether Spielberg is poking fun at Madison Avenue or
just trying to make a buck. In 1982, he was the guy who helped
introduce the era of product placement by making E.T. a Reese's
Pieces fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   "The creative decisions by Spielberg came first--he wanted
pop-culture icons that would exist in the future," said Jeffrey
Godsick, Fox's executive vice president of publicity and promotion.
"It was never a question of economics, just fulfilling his vision."</TE>
<TE>   Crowe's Blackmail Claim Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   Two men were cleared Monday of trying to blackmail Oscar-winning
actor Russell Crowe.</TE>
<TE>   The judge hearing the case in Australia ordered the jury at Coffs
Harbor district court to acquit the men, saying prosecutors failed to
prove they demanded money from Crowe in return for destroying a video
of the star brawling outside a bar.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Cropper and Malcolm Mercer, both 38, had pleaded innocent
to charges of trying to extort money from Crowe using the video,
which showed the "Gladiator" star fighting with a man and arguing
with a woman outside an Australian nightclub in 1999. The pair had
faced a maximum sentence of 10 years if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   What Price Oscar? Angela Bassett Asks</TE>
<TE>   Angela Bassett says she turned down a lead role in the movie
"Monster's Ball"--the one that won Halle Berry her Oscar--because she
believed an affair the character had was demeaning and stereotypical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about character, darling," she is quoted as saying in the
July 1 issue of Newsweek. "I wasn't going to be a prostitute on film.
I couldn't do that because it's such a stereotype about black women
and sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   The actress made it clear that she didn't mean to criticize Berry,
who played the troubled waitress who had an affair with her husband's
executioner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   John Responsible for Expensive Tour Tabs</TE>
<TE>   Elton John lost a case Monday that he hoped would revive a
negligence claim against his former accountants.</TE>
<TE>   The singer had sued PricewaterhouseCoopers for allegedly failing
to advise him that he was paying $10.5 million in touring costs that
he said should have been paid by his manager.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Justice Robert Walker, who joined one of the two other
justices at the London Court of Appeal in ruling against the singer,
concluded that the 1986 contract with the management company John
Reid Enterprises did not obligate it to pay for the tours.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing last year, the High Court dismissed John's claim of
negligence against Andrew Haydon, former managing director of John
Reid Enterprises. John did not appeal that verdict, and he had
previously reached a settlement of his action against Reid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Kim Delaney will re-team with former "NYPD Blue" cast member David
Caruso on "CSI: Miami," Jerry Bruckheimer's new forensic drama for
CBS to air in the fall.... Tony Bennett and k.d. lang, who have
saluted Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday on past
albums together, are now paying homage to Louis Armstrong. The new
album, to be produced by T-Bone Burnett, is due in November, USA
Today reports.</TE>

<HD>Soaps Work Up Lather During the Summer</HD>
<DH>Television* Networks pile on plot stunts, love triangles
and pop music during these months in the hopes of hooking vacationing
young adults.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might be summer doldrums for network prime-time shows, with reruns
doing much of the place-holding on television, but the daytime soaps
will be turning up the heat over the next few months, planning
high-profile stunts, focusing on teen love triangles and adding pop
music to the stories.</LD>
<LD>   The main goal is to latch onto viewers at the most desirable end
of the TV demographic, the 18- to 24-year-olds who are out of school
and available to watch in numbers unmatched the rest of the year. If
they become samplers now, the theory goes, they could grow into
long-term soap addicts later.</LD>
<LD>   Another aim of summer stunts is to win back lapsed viewers or lure
new ones who are bored with prime time and looking for alternatives,
even if they have to tape the shows and watch them later. The bigger
the "wow" factor, the better.</LD>
<TE>   "The audience will only give you 15 to 20 seconds, especially the
younger end of the spectrum," said Felicia Minei Behr, senior vice
president for daytime programming at ABC. "The pressure is on for
quicker payoffs, more drama, more envelope-pushing."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "One Life to Live" has an ambitious set of story lines
planned, following a recent stunt week in which all the shows from
May 13 to 17 aired live (on the East Coast), a soap first. Regis
Philbin did daily intros, and the week's ratings bumped up about 8%
with the key soap demographic: women between the ages of 18 and 49.</TE>
<TE>   A number of summer episodes--involving two ongoing story
lines--were shot recently in Hawaii, the longest-distance remote the
show has ever done. An upcoming song-and-dance episode will feature
nearly a dozen extras from Broadway shows, along with cast regulars
who have musical theater and singing backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The musical, dubbed "Babes Behind Bars," will center on actress
Catherine Hickland, who starred as Fantine in "Les Miserables." Her
felonious character, Lindsay Rappaport, is surrounded in jail by
singing and dancing co-convicts and visitors. Among that chorus are
veterans of Broadway shows including "Grease," "Annie" and "Chicago"
doing vamp versions of "Bad Girls" and other breakin'-the-law-themed
pop songs.</TE>
<TE>   "We all need to do something to make ourselves distinct," said
Gary Tomlin, "One Life to Live's" executive producer. "We're trying
to give our show a different feeling."</TE>
<TE>   "Babes" will air July 4, a date the show is trying to stake out as
an event. The episodes last July 4, in which characters switched
places, helped "One Life to Live" win its first Emmy for outstanding
daytime drama.</TE>
<TE>   Young characters will play prominent parts this summer on NBC's
"Days of Our Lives," when Shawn (Jason Cook) and Belle (Kirsten
Storms) spend weeks trying to unravel a mystery together.</TE>
<TE>   This will come after a meteor shower hits the mythical setting of
Salem on July 3. Also, a young love triangle, with a terminal illness
thrown in, will get major face time.</TE>
<TE>   But for balance, two former characters return to the show: The
allegedly dead villain, Tony Dimera, has come back (played again by
Thaao Penghlis), as will Billie, a character played by Lisa Rinna.</TE>
<TE>   "Last summer, we focused so much on the young characters that we
gained younger viewers, but we isolated certain parts of the
audience," said Ken Corday, "Days' " executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   "They got dismayed, they complained and they stopped watching.
We'll balance better this summer."</TE>
<TE>   Soap viewing has gone through a much-documented decline over the
last decade, as lifestyles have changed and women viewers aren't home
during the day. Making matters worse, soap and network executives
say, are multiple cable choices and the difficulty of keeping soap
stories fresh for some 260 episodes a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our viewers like soaps, sitcoms, 'Spider-Man' and 'Law &amp; Order,'
" said Sheraton Kalouria, senior vice president for daytime programs
at NBC. "Everyone has a finite amount of time to devote to
entertainment, and we're competing with all of it. We have to earn
our place at the table."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Passions" has been able to do that with young viewers, in
particular, by establishing itself as the campiest of the melodramas.
Those antics will continue this summer as the character Timmy, a
talking doll-turned-real boy, will put on a Don King fright wig and
take part in a pro wrestling spoof with the show's master villain,
Julian Crane.</TE>
<TE>   A pop music tie-in featured the emerging band Seven and the Sun
performing its single, "Walk With Me," on a May episode of
"Passions." The song will be used in the show throughout the summer
as it's getting airplay on Top 40 radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   "The People's Court" Judge Marilyn Milian and her bailiff, Douglas
MacIntosh, will preside over a trial on "As the World Turns," one of
two Procter &amp; Gamble-owned soaps airing on CBS. The series also will
have a high-profile but trouble-plagued wedding.</TE>
<TE>   "Guiding Light," the other P&amp;G soap, will feature the
third-time-around wedding of a super-couple. A well-known character
will die as another fights for his life.</TE>
<TE>   Not every soap team believes in summer stunts. Executive producer
David Shaughnessy, whose "The Young &amp; the Restless" on CBS has been
rated No. 1 in total viewers for 13 years, says loyalists quickly see
through attempts to spike ratings during such times as sweeps,
holidays and summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is so fierce and so ferocious," Shaughnessy said,
"but the audience tends to react in a negative way and criticize us
for stunting. They want good storytelling all year round."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "Y&amp;R" is planning the biggest stunt on any soap. Former
"Diff'rent Strokes" child star Todd Bridges will play a recurring
heel named Juice, a part originated by another actor. Bridges'
episodes will start airing in a few weeks, and he could join the cast
permanently, said Shaughnessy. The show also is in negotiations to
bring back a couple of favorite former characters and is trying to
incorporate more musical artists into the show a la "Ally McBeal."</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "The Bold &amp; the Beautiful," which also resists stunting,
nevertheless will bring its young characters to the fore this summer,
with one dealing with the aftermath of an affair between her husband
and her mother and with the baby that union will produce.</TE>
<TE>   "When you try stunt casting or live programming or location
shoots, you may see a quick blip of a tenth or two [of a ratings
point], but it's not sustainable," said Brad Bell, executive producer
of "The Bold &amp; the Beautiful." "And if you focus on young characters
or newcomers, you need to tell good solid stories and intertwine them
with old favorites."</TE>

<HD>Seeing the Big Spin</HD>
<DH>In his new opera, 'Galileo Galilei,' Philip Glass unravels
the tale of the great astronomer in backward order</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO--Galileo's life and work had the character of intricate,
intertwined dance. The great 17th century astronomer, mathematician
and inventor understood that movement was the way of nature. He
demonstrated the dance of the heavens, proving once and for all that
the Earth revolved around the sun. And he delicately danced around
Vatican politics as he attempted to subvert an Earth-centric
scriptural interpretation with the uncommon grace of his arguments.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Glass' new opera, "Galileo Galilei," which premiered Monday
at the Goodman Theatre, has its own original ideas about movement and
dance. It proceeds backward in time, from stillness and doubt to
sublime, purposeful motion. The first image we see is the blind,
dying astronomer no long able to peer into his telescope and having,
instead, to turn his gaze grimly inward. Some 90 minutes later, with
the planets personified in their orbits in a delirious opera within
an opera, the music and movement become one big, happy, infectiously
life-affirming swirl.</LD>
<TE>   Galileo is a natural subject for Glass. In his first opera,
"Einstein on the Beach," Glass and director Robert Wilson represented
the life and work of another great scientist not as biography but as
a series of images, particularly of a train and spaceship, which
allude to Einstein's own studies of motion. Over the next 26 years
and in nearly as many operas and music-theater works (the distinction
between the two is often blurred), Glass has repeatedly returned to
the interrelated themes of discovery, religion and the cosmos.</TE>
<TE>   In "Akhnaten," a pharaoh proposes a single celestial deity. Operas
on discoverers Columbus in "The Voyage" and Vasco da Gama in the
"White Raven" transcend their historical milieus and our planet. The
science-fiction operas--"1000 Airplanes on the Roof," "The Making of
the Representative for Planet 8" and "Marriages Between Zones Three,
Four and Five"--concern aliens from other planets.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the backward narrative, "Galileo Galilei" is the closest
Glass has come to conventional biography. His main collaborator is
Mary Zimmerman, who won a Tony this year for her production of
"Metamorphoses." The idea for the opera was Glass', but she wrote the
libretto (with contributions from Glass and Arnold Weinstein) and
directs the production.</TE>
<TE>   The decor (sets by Daniel Ostling and costumes by Mara Blumenfeld)
represent the period at first dully but, as Galileo gets younger,
with a hint of fancy. The intention here is realistic theater rather
than the magical, mysterious atmosphere that has been typical of
other productions of Glass discovery operas.</TE>
<TE>   There are eight scenes from Galileo's life. As he progressively
gets younger, he recants as heresy his proofs of the Earth's
revolutions, faces the Inquisition, has a sympathetic meeting with
Cardinal Barberini before the cardinal becomes the less sympathetic
Pope Urban VIII and presents his telescope to the Medici court in
Florence. There are idylls with his daughter, the nun Maria Celeste,
and there is a scene of gravitational experiments with falling balls.
At the opera's center, there is a brief theatrical setting of
Galileo's famous treatise, "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems
of the World."</TE>
<TE>   The epilogue, and the most wonderful and fanciful part of the
production, is the opera within an opera. The child Galileo watches a
mythological work, presumably by his father, a member of the
Florentine Camerata, which devised the notion of opera. At last,
conventional biography is transcended. The cosmos opens up as the
hunter Orion takes his place among the stars, and the court and
entertainers alike revolve merrily like planets. The last bit is
corny: The old Galileo has reappeared and is led to his own place in
the firmament by his daughter, now an angel. But the music by this
point is so joyous, the dance so irresistible, that the corn is
agreeably sweet.</TE>
<TE>   The history in reverse works to Glass' advantage. The score
progresses like a raga, warming up with quiet, mood-setting music and
gradually getting livelier. That is often how Glass proceeds,
noodling for a while as he finds his way into a drama. So, as we move
in reverse through a life, already knowing the plot, the main
surprise is ever fresher music. Zimmerman, too, seems happiest when
she can pull away from straight biography and exult in stage
movement. She is conventional in operatic settings, and the staging
of the "Dialogue," with three debaters floating on a gondola through
Venice, is flat. But the pantomime of the experiment--balls on an
inclined plane--is great fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Galileo Galilei" is a stretch for a theater company. The cast is
large, featuring fine young voices. Two veteran Glass performers,
though, portray the older Galileo (the tenor John Duykers) and the
younger Galileo (the baritone Eugene Perry). The facts that they do
not look alike, are of different builds, races and voice types, was
curiously untroubling. Both are compelling on stage, but both
struggled with the high tessitura and were often hard to understand.
Consequently, Galileo was at a vocal disadvantage when faced with a
powerful-sounding Pope (Andrew Funk), a piercing countertenor
Inquisitor (Mark Crayton) or a firm-voiced priest citing scripture
(Andrew McQuery). The women--the younger and older Maria Celeste
(Alicia Berneche and Elizabeth Reiter) and the Grand Duchess
Christina (Mary Wilson)--were affecting.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders, though, about the strain of opera singers working in
a theater company that requires them to sing six days a week (some
days with matinee and evening performances). The strain of a theater
company performing opera was also apparent in an 11-member
instrumental ensemble that sounds thin and sometimes scrappy.
Beatrice Affron is the dutiful conductor.</TE>
<TE>   But theater also offers the advantage of time for improvement. The
production travels to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and London's
Barbican Centre in the fall.</TE>

<LD>It's been nearly five years since news reports from Paris brought us
images of the twisted wreckage that spelled the end of the charmed
yet in many ways cursed existence of young Diana Spencer.</LD>
<LD>   And in a summer that will also mark the anniversaries of Lady Di's
birth (she would have turned 41 on Monday) and ill-fated marriage
into royalty (July 29), BBC America has planned a prodigious block of
programming aimed at feeding this country's apparent ongoing
fascination with the late princess.</LD>
<LD>   The cable/satellite channel, launched four years ago with such
cultishly popular crossovers as "Monty Python" and "Absolutely
Fabulous" running interference, now is available in nearly 30 million
U.S. homes. Today at 5 p.m., it will begin airing its sprawling,
summer-long overview of just about every aspect of the tragically
short life of the blond mother of two under the umbrella title "Diana
Forever."</LD>
<TE>   Included in the package are the controversial interview she did
shortly after her marriage breakup and "Diana: The Wedding Story,"
which features segments never before seen in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Forever indeed. Pop periodicals and TV newsmagazines that covered
the princess' every move haven't missed a beat with the royal family
since her death, and Paul Lee, BBC America's chief operating officer,
said Diana's openness and broad interests chronicled in this series
of specials helped usher that in.</TE>
<TE>   "Diana was a deeply modern woman who spoke to many modern issues,"
Lee said, citing her involvement on AIDS and land mines in Angola as
examples. "Later, she became afraid that her presence might become a
threat to the royal family. But it really reinvigorated the whole
story. You could see that with the [recent] coverage of the [Queen
Elizabeth] jubilee. Diana made Charles and the family take a real
look at what they stood for."</TE>

<HD>'Minority' Manages to Slip Past 'Lilo'</HD>
<DH>Movies* The Spielberg thriller takes in $35.7 million to
edge Disney's animated feature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the end, it wasn't as close as, say, Bush vs. Gore in the 2000
Florida presidential voting, but the weekend box office race between
the Steven Spielberg sci-fi thriller "Minority Report" and Disney's
new animated feature, "Lilo &amp; Stitch," had all the earmarks of a
hard-fought campaign with the potential to bruise many egos.</LD>
<LD>   When the dust had cleared on Monday, director Spielberg's
"Minority Report" had emerged--just barely--as the weekend's top
movie in North America. The film, released through 20th Century Fox,
sold $35.7 million in tickets.</LD>
<LD>   "Lilo &amp; Stitch" had given Spielberg and star Tom Cruise a scare by
nearly pulling off the unthinkable. The animated film raked in $35.3
million for second place.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the close results sent ripples through two major
studios.</TE>
<TE>   Fox was breathing a sigh of relief. On Sunday, the studio had
estimated that it had easily won the weekend with $36.9 million in
ticket sales. That figure ended up being off by $1.2 million. At
Disney, executives who at first were fuming that Fox was pumping up
its numbers, expressed glee that their little film had nearly toppled
Spielberg and Cruise and even outperformed a strong "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm done holding my breath," said Chuck Viane, the distribution
chief at Disney. "We not only leapfrogged 'Scooby-Doo' but came
within a whisker of 'Minority Report.' That's a credit to our
marketing department."</TE>
<TE>   Viane noted that because "Lilo &amp; Stitch" is a family film drawing
many children, it played strongly during daytime matinees, when
tickets are usually cheaper. So, in effect, while it lost the box
office race to "Minority Report," "Lilo &amp; Stitch" actually had more
people in the seats.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Lilo &amp; Stitch" came in a close second in box office sales
compared to "Minority Report," the movie may be far more lucrative
for Disney because "Lilo" was so much less expensive to make.</TE>
<TE>   "Minority Report" cost more than $100 million while "Lilo &amp;
Stitch" cost about $80 million. That's far cheaper than the typical
budget for an animated feature at Disney and reflects a new, more
cost-effective approach to making animated movies. The studio has
pared several hundred jobs from its animation division in the last
year in response to soaring production and labor costs in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   At Fox, distribution chief Bruce Snyder conceded that his rivals
may accuse him of "aggressively" overestimating the box office on
"Minority Report," but he noted that he wasn't off by much. That's
not too bad, he said, when the complexities of developing those
estimates are taken into consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess some people think I should be hanging my head, but I
think I should be patting myself on the back," Snyder said. "If they
wanted to say I'm aggressive, I guess they could say that. I'm
guessing so many numbers, I just want to get close to the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Hindes, executive vice president of operations at
ACNielsen/EDI, the company that collects the box office figures for
the studios, said the race was so close that neither studio has to
hang its head in shame.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' had a fantastic marketing campaign," he said.
"It was an unknown quantity but the film was also entertaining. The
fact that a Tom Cruise film with Steven Spielberg attached is
somewhat less of a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Hindes said that the way studios develop their estimates works
this way: EDI collects the box office information from the vast
majority of theaters in North America--some 4,000 theaters--that
report the grosses once that night's shows finally close. Hindes said
the grosses represent about "80% to 90%" of the actual grosses.</TE>
<TE>   EDI then sends those figures on to the studios, Hindes explained,
and "they use their own methods to calculate the missing grosses--the
grosses we do not collect."</TE>
<TE>   This past weekend, Snyder noted, he knew what "70%" of the grosses
were Friday and Saturday nights for "Minority Report" but had to
guess at the other 30%. Then on Sunday, he had to guess the entire
day's box office.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, Fox came under similar criticism when it estimated that
the George Lucas sci-fi prequel "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones" had made $86.1 million to come in No. 1. When the final
figures came in, however, the film had really made $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   As for last weekend's competition, Snyder said he actually thought
Disney would win when the final figures were reported. "I thought
they [would come in] between $35.8 million and $36 million," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was troubled with Fox's overestimate Sunday, Viane
replied: "Look, my estimators have missed. I've missed. Sometimes you
are right on. Sometimes you're over and sometimes you're under. But
that is why I would like it to be reality-based."</TE>
<TE>   The strong opening for "Lilo &amp; Stitch" gives Walt Disney Co. a
needed boost to its animation division. It was the biggest opening
for a traditional animated movie from the studio since 1999's
"Tarzan."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's more recent traditional animated movies, "Atlantis the
Lost Empire" and "The Emperor's New Groove," were both box office
disappointments, in contrast to the hugely successful digital movies
"Monsters, Inc." and "Toy Story" that Disney produced with Pixar.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thrilled," said Disney animation chief Thomas Schumacher.
"This kind of opening is far beyond what we expected."We've put a
great deal of work trying to get this to be an effective business,"
Schumacher said. "Half of it is pleasing the audience the other half
is pleasing shareholders." The film opened to raves from the critics
who praised its originality.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's margins also are higher to begin with because the studio
won't have to split profits as News Corp. and DreamWorks do. If
"Lilo" has staying power and generates strong DVD and merchandise
sales this year, it could give Disney's bottom line a key boost at a
time when other divisions, especially ABC, have been struggling,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The opening weekend numbers were outstanding," said David Miller,
an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris Group in L.A. "If the film has
legs, the studio could have a very good fourth quarter."</TE>

<HD>'The Body' May Be Gone but the Spirit Will Rock On</HD>
<DH>Ventura leaves a formidable political legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT BAI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The afternoon after Jesse Ventura was elected Minnesota's governor in
1998, I arrived at his ranch to interview him. Sitting in his frigid
barn in the first of many meetings we'd have over his term in office,
a sleepless Ventura smoked a stogie, recited lines from "Jaws" and
pledged to be a serious reformer. "I don't want to cheapen the
office," Ventura told me. "I'm not about to turn it into some
dog-and-pony show."</LD>
<LD>   By the time Ventura announced last Tuesday  that he wouldn't run
again, his tenure seemed more like an episode of "When Animals
Attack."</LD>
<LD>   Smug newspaper accounts repeated the conventional wisdom that
Ventura had accomplished little and exhausted the voters. But the
gloaters missed the point.</LD>
<TE>   For all the spectacle that sometimes engulfed him, Ventura lifted
the two-party system off its foundation, creating a new momentum
toward reform--and away from old party loyalties--that ultimately
helped change the balance of power in Washington. The political
elites always saw Ventura as a kind of unwanted house guest, and they
can hardly contain their relief at seeing him out the door. But
Ventura isn't leaving the place quite the way he found it.</TE>
<TE>   At his best, Ventura offered a vision of what politics could be,
of the way ordinary citizens--and especially younger citizens--could
relate to the people who serve them. When he won in 1998, carrying
every income group under $100,000 and every age group under 60, the
state's voter turnout ran a staggering 25 points higher than the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   In those early days, Ventura ignited a faith in government that my
generation, born into Vietnam and Watergate, had never seen. He'd
found out, he told me with surprise, that past governors hadn't
actually gone to visit employees at state agencies, and so he did. It
was surreal to see longtime bureaucrats break out in spontaneous
applause as the new governor strolled through the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura told audiences that he was "doing the people's business
with smiles on our faces and joy in our hearts," and the hokey line
drew long, standing ovations.</TE>
<TE>   The two national parties raced to replicate Ventura's style and
rhetoric. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, urged clients to seem
more genuine. In 2000, presidential candidates made pilgrimages to
Minneapolis in search of Ventura's blessing. (Al Gore hosted his new
friend at the Naval Observatory in Washington and offered Ventura
political advice on the front porch.)</TE>
<TE>   John McCain calibrated his message perfectly for these new Ventura
voters: conservative on fiscal and defense issues, libertarian on
social issues and thoroughly unscripted. McCain's evolution into a
Ventura-style reformer enabled him to build the kind of nonpartisan
movement on Capitol Hill that Ventura had envisioned for Minnesota.
And it's hard to imagine James Jeffords, the Vermont senator who
bolted the Republican fold last year, putting that scarlet I next to
his name had Ventura not proved that an independent could be taken
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The first president elected in the post-Ventura era mimicked
Ventura's call for reform, but neither he nor most other national
politicians could connect with voters as viscerally or match
Ventura's brand of political courage.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura won approval for substantial property tax reform, a
measure that a lot of governors--including Bush--had been unable to
get through their own legislatures. And when Minnesota's budget, like
all state budgets, began to groan under the weight of recession,
Ventura did what no politician ever does in this country: He came out
for increasing some taxes, explaining that times had changed and
sacrifices had to be made. Few politicians stood with him and few
national reporters took notice.</TE>
<TE>   Always, these moments were washed away by Ventura's own pettiness
and paranoia. He saw the media as an enemy. His own foolish
misadventures--declaring himself opposed to organized religion,
calling XFL games during the league's mercifully short life--did in
fact cheapen the office, and they enabled his detractors to treat him
as a distraction from "real" politics.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, aside from Bill Clinton, Ventura probably had more influence
on the course of national politics than any public servant of the
last decade, and it would be perilous for those of us in politics or
the media to think that what he represented--this yearning for a more
compelling brand of public discourse--will simply go away.</TE>
<TE>   They can bury The Body, but the spirit remains.</TE>

<HD>Bush Overplays the Terror Card</HD>
<DH>It's 'unpatriotic' to say that corrupt business is ruining
our economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has the war on terrorism become the modern equivalent of the Roman
Circus, drawing the people's attention away from the failures of
those who rule them? Corporate America is a shambles because
deregulation, the mantra of our president and his party, has proved
to be a license to steal. Yet to question our leaders' stewardship of
the economy has been made to seem unpatriotic.</LD>
<LD>   Although combating terrorism is of compelling importance--and
should have been before Sept. 11--one is likely to be branded a nut
for daring to suggest that the administration might be using current
security threats as a smoke screen to obscure our floundering
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, after the miserable performance of the stock market these
past five weeks, the forced resignations and indictments of corporate
titans (not to mention the conviction of a top accounting firm), the
humbling of the dollar and a rise in the trade gap, isn't it time to
ask whether the war on terrorism isn't being milked as a convenient
distraction?</LD>
<TE>   The question seems particularly relevant when our man in the White
House has had close personal and financial ties to the
company--Enron--whose demise is the most glaring symbol of the broad
moral disarray of the nation's corporate culture.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any doubt that the chicanery of Enron executives and that
of a growing Who's Who of top CEOs has done more long-term damage to
the U.S. economy than the efforts of anti-American terrorists? And
while sending in the Marines to clean up the boardrooms is not
feasible, we ought to wake up to the reality that business greed is
subverting the American way of life--and hurting the image of
American capitalism and democracy--more effectively than the ploys of
any foreign enemy.</TE>
<TE>   When even Martha Stewart is ethically suspect and her company's
stock has plummeted--though not quite to the depths of Enron, Global
Crossing, Tyco, Dynergy, Wal-Mart and Rite Aid--it is time to return
to the wisdom of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Depression-era
president who saved capitalism from itself.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy from birth, FDR had a healthy awareness of the tendency of
the upper classes to destabilize society and even destroy themselves
with their greed and hubris. Unlike Karl Marx, however, he believed
the unraveling of capitalism was not inevitable if these excesses
could somehow be corralled. Thus was born the idea of government
regulation as the vital support structure for the powerful, fertile
but unstable free market.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, greedy people and institutions don't like being
monitored, and they have the means to corrupt governments and skirt
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Since the so-called Reagan Revolution, powerful corporate
interests have succeeded in profoundly damaging the foundation of a
properly regulated economy. Company auditors, for example, have
become accomplices to deceptions of the public that should be
considered criminal but that often do not violate statutes written by
corporate lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Enron provides a startling illustration of a company jumping
through loopholes that its D.C. lobbyists have created. In fact, the
Enron scams made possible by deregulation in the first Bush
administration are still being revealed, such as last week's reports
that the company hid billions in income during the California energy
crisis while publicly denying it was profiting excessively.</TE>
<TE>   Yet former Enron officials continue to play an important role
under Bush the younger. The Bush family, in fact, has never been
seriously confronted by the media or Congress as to its questionable
ties to former Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, a close family
friend and top contributor to Bush family presidential campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the corporate corruption of our political system has
long been bipartisan. The Clinton White House, for example, sponsored
major deregulation acts, including the Financial Services
Modernization Act, which reversed consumer protections enacted under
Roosevelt, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which effectively
ended all public accountability for the communications industry and
has permitted a few media giants to gobble up vast markets.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the problem is bipartisan when a Democrat-controlled
Senate moves so hesitantly to confront the myriad examples of
sickness in our economy and corporate culture.</TE>
<TE>   The politicians hesitate to act because candidates of both parties
are lavishly financed by the very people who are conning a gullible
public.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Should Lead the Class in Global Education</HD>
<DH>Inadequate schooling is the silent crisis of the developing
world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SPERLING and OEINDRILA DUBE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When eight of the world's most powerful leaders meet Wednesday to
discuss global issues at the annual G-8 summit, they should not
forget the plight of the 125 million children who have never seen the
inside of a classroom and the 140 million others who drop out of
school before learning how to read or write. Of the world's
developing nations, 88 are off track for reaching universal primary
education by 2015, a goal that has been endorsed repeatedly by the
international community over the past decade.</LD>
<LD>   While the statistics are grim, there has been momentum for
launching a global compact between the rich and poor nations to
address this silent crisis of the developing world.</LD>
<LD>   The World Bank and its development partners have come forward with
an action plan that proposes "fast-tracking" assistance to 18 poor
nations that have developed credible national education strategies
and demonstrated their commitment to using aid effectively.</LD>
<TE>   Japan has announced that it would increase education aid for
Africa by $2 billion over five years. Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who is hosting the G-8 this year, has put basic education
on the summit's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Where is the United States? Missing in action.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, with global education advocates looking to the
U.S. for leadership, the Bush administration stepped forward with
only a micro-initiative to increase funding for an Africa education
program from $20 million annually to $40 million annually. But $20
million is about the cost of building just one U.S. high school; it
is woefully inadequate considering the education crisis on the
African continent.</TE>
<TE>   Africa is home to 75 million children who do not attend school and
to 36 nations that are off track for reaching the universal education
target. Barely half of African children finish primary school. For
girls, the number is significantly lower.</TE>
<TE>   Yet from Uganda to Ethiopia to Gambia, there are significant signs
of progress. Studies have shown that completing primary education can
have dramatic effects on a family's earnings, and girls' education in
particular leads to smaller, healthier families.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank estimates that Africa will need at least $2.1
billion more per year from the international community to achieve
primary education, or six years of schooling, for all its children.
Even this figure is a bare-minimum estimate that presumes optimistic
reform scenarios, such as poor countries footing 80% of the overall
education bill.</TE>
<TE>   No one is arguing for more money without clear evidence of poor
nations stepping up by taking ownership of smart, accountable and
performance-based plans. Proposals for a global compact--including
the World Bank's new fast-track plan--consistently call for increased
aid to only those nations that have devised viable education plans
and are ready to be monitored and audited. This is entirely
consistent with the administration's appropriate focus on aid
effectiveness and results. Yet small programs, such as the
administration's latest proposal, fly in the face of this focus.</TE>
<TE>   Ad hoc proposals can undermine the efficient use of aid, which
works best when it is well coordinated and not fragmented or
overlapping. Furthermore, a coordinated, global agreement to
financially back poor nations is essential for inspiring systemic
education reforms throughout the developing world. Without it, no
poor nation has the incentive to tackle entrenched interests and to
mobilize hard-to-come-by domestic resources for undertaking difficult
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, each G-8 nation should make specific financial
commitments to back the fast-track plan and put up its fair share of
the additional $5 billion to $10 billion needed each year to achieve
universal basic education by 2015. The U.S. must do its part by
putting at least $1 billion on the table, contingent on poor nations
doing their part by developing sound education strategies.</TE>
<TE>   The administration can rightly insist on controlling bilateral
assistance and demanding performance, but it should do so as part of
a coordinated global compact for basic education that poor nations
can believe in.</TE>

<HD>The Choice Is Theirs: Arafat or Statehood</HD>
<DH>The Palestinians at last must acknowledge the folly of
terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The choice is now clear for Palestinians: Yasser Arafat or a state of
their own--a state recognized and supported by the world community.
If Palestinians are to ever raise the flag over East Jerusalem with
American support, President Bush's speech Monday made quite clear
that Arafat must go and be replaced by "leaders not compromised by
terror."</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, the United States cannot be the sponsor of a terrorist
state--which is what a nation of Palestine would be under the current
administration. Bush made clear the three simple preconditions for a
state that Americans can support, saying, "when the Palestinian
people have new leaders, new institutions and new security
arrangements with their neighbors," then the U.S. will support a
nation, but Arafat must go.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals outlined in the speech were bred of an
administration increasingly frustrated by Arafat's inability--or rank
unwillingness--to stop the incessant acts of terrorism in the Middle
East or to provide a peace framework of his own.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat's failure to act against Hamas militants and other
terrorists in his own backyard ensures there will not soon be a
Palestinian state with him as its leader. But that sets up quite the
dilemma for the Palestinian people: Trust the U.S. and the world
community to follow through on their promise to help create a nation
or stand by a leader supported by an overwhelming majority of
Palestinians but lose any hope of statehood.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing in the days before the speech that terror had once again
delayed--perhaps indefinitely--his goal for a Palestinian state,
Arafat desperately agreed to a plan he had rejected during the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   But, as usual, he agreed to just a bit less than what was required
for peace, and the offer was made only with his back against the
wall. And now it is too late.</TE>
<TE>   If history is any guide, Arafat has no plans to resign, nor do his
minions plan to agree with the simple preconditions Bush outlined
Monday. And it is doubtful that even the promise of the direct
investment Bush has offered from the U.S., the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank would force Arafat to loosen his grip on
power, regardless of how much his people need this funding and
expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian minister of planning and
international cooperation, said preemptively Sunday that the idea of
preconditions, such as prosecuting terrorists and ending the murder
of civilians, "is a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat himself has rebuked outside demands.</TE>
<TE>   In response to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice's
statements earlier this month about the nature of the Palestinian
Authority, he said, "We are doing what we see as good for our people,
and we do not accept any orders from anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech, no doubt much to Arafat's chagrin, struck a very
different tone than the one the president would have given had there
not been the recent spate of terror attacks against Israeli
civilians. The first president to publicly call for a sovereign
Palestinian state, Bush has since tempered his views as a result of
Hamas and other terrorist groups intentionally derailing movement
toward Palestinian self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, Islamic Jihad and their ilk don't care to see a state. They
want only the destruction of Israel. A nation of Palestinians means
formal recognition of a Jewish nation and a civilian authority as
replacement for their de facto governance. The radical groups can
stomach neither.</TE>
<TE>   So it is not Bush's conditions that are preventing progress on a
Palestinian flag over East Jerusalem; it is the willful obstruction
through violence, and Arafat's refusal to stop it or step aside.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be Palestinian nationals must recognize that the largest
barrier to freedom, prosperity and a homeland is not the U.S. or
Israel. It is their failure to choose peace and divorce themselves
from the terrorists.</TE>

<HD>Bush Declares His Path</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's long-awaited speech Monday marked a decisive break
with his administration's on-again, off-again approach to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Never again can he pretend, as he did
for months, that the United States can conduct a war on terrorism and
at the same time remain aloof from the spiraling Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   While it was a relief to see the president acknowledging that only
the U.S. could broker an agreement, he raised far more questions than
he answered, particularly in calling for an all-new Palestinian
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Bush sketched out a hopeful, even optimistic, vision of two states
living "side by side" and poignantly referred to the unacceptable
squalor of a daily Palestinian life that bred terrorism. In its
stead, Bush invoked a Reaganite vision of capitalism and democracy
that would allow Palestinians to shed their misery.</LD>
<TE>   He called for monetary assistance from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund to help reconstruct Palestinian society
and said that Israel should release now-frozen funds to "responsible"
Palestinian hands. He also stated that Israel should stop
constructing settlements, which are a constant thorn to Palestinians.
He rightly called for Egypt and Jordan to assist Palestinians in
building a stable government.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush placed the onus on the Palestinians to comply with
Israeli demands for a complete cessation of terrorism before
negotiations on bringing a Palestinian state into existence could
begin. He set out a discouragingly long time frame, three years to
statehood. In his boldest moment, Bush insisted that Palestinians rid
themselves of "the Palestinian leadership," which could hardly be
interpreted as not including Yasser Arafat. This is an emotionally
satisfying idea but ultimately an impotent demand.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how contemptible Arafat may be, the U.S. needs to tread
warily in declaring who is, and is not, a proper leader of other
countries or peoples. What if the successor to Arafat is more
militant? Would Bush refuse to deal with him or her as well? What
criteria will the U.S. use to determine who is an acceptable
representative of the Palestinians, especially since Arafat himself
was democratically elected?</TE>
<TE>   The president's words might also be read as permission for Israel
to expel Arafat, something that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been
itching to do but which would inflame Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   As Palestinians continue to carry out indiscriminately deadly
terrorist attacks and Israeli tanks rumble into the West Bank and
Gaza Strip--in what Sharon calls, in part, a "massive operation"
against Hamas--Bush correctly declared that the current situation was
untenable. In coming months, it will take a sustained, patient and
flexible operation by his administration to bring the two parties
back from the edge of the abyss.</TE>

<LD>Thank you so much for your June 22 story by Mary McNamara about Msgr.
David O'Connell, who lives the life of a good and hard-working
priest. I didn't realize how much I needed a story like that until I
took it in along with my morning coffee.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks now, I have avoided going to Mass. I would intend to go
and then a fatigue of body, mind and spirit would send me back to bed
on Sunday morning. An image would confront me of a priest offering me
the Eucharist with the same hands that did terrible things to a
child, an adolescent or a vulnerable person of any age. A good image
has driven out the bad image now, and I can think of priestly hands
comforting the sick, the bereaved or the outcast and celebrating Mass
with a clean spirit and joy in Christ's gift to us.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks so much for your article pointing out the fact that there
are more than 46,000 Catholic priests in this country who strive to
fulfill their duties. Congratulations to Msgr. O'Connell on his 23rd
anniversary. As a Catholic I have known many priests like O'Connell.</TE>

<TE>   O'Connell does what many (most) of us struggle with: making a
commitment to a life of service and finding a joy and peace in giving
of oneself.</TE>
<TE>   I especially enjoyed his fearless comments about how the inclusion
of women in the church hierarchy would solve what the imbalance of
power has wrought.</TE>
<TE>   And the monsignor was right when he said: "If there had been some
parents in there running things, none of this would ever have
happened."</TE>
<TE>   His candor reminded me of that famous saying that absolute power
corrupts absolutely.</TE>

<TE>   I am troubled by Article 16 of the U.S. Catholic bishops' Charter
for the Protection of Children and Young People, which begins: "Given
problem of the sexual abuse of minors in our society...." This gives
the impression that what happened with the Catholic Church is a
mirror of our society. There is a vast difference between sexual
abuse under the color of God and the priesthood and sexual abuse by
nonpriests. In the former, the young victim is intimidated by a
messenger of God, in the latter the victim is intimidated by just an
adult.</TE>
<TE>   This is why police are severely dealt with if an officer takes
sexual advantage of an individual under the color of authority.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Mahony Asks Forgiveness for Handling of Scandal," June 24:
Cardinal Roger Mahony's apology rang hollow for me. It just looked
and sounded too scripted.</TE>
<TE>   Why was the apology delivered at St. Charles Borromeo Church?
Could he not have gone and randomly pick a parish church, maybe even
a parish that housed priests who had perpetrated these abuses? Don't
get me wrong, an apology is always in order, and forgiveness is of
paramount importance in all religions. I just don't like it when the
apology is cloaked in a public-relations mantle.</TE>

<HD>Bush Could Let Offshore Oil Leases Expire</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Helps Simon on Oil Issue," June 20: There is a simple way to
protect California's coast from new offshore oil drilling. President
Bush could decide right away to drop his administration's appeal of a
federal judge's order freezing all activities on the 36 old oil
leases in federal waters and to let the leases expire. This could be
done legally without paying any compensation to the oil companies.</LD>
<LD>   The effect would be to protect California's coast without making
taxpayers foot the bill. Bush has taken no such action, even though
it is directly within his power. Just the opposite; the Bush
administration is fighting in court against Gov. Gray Davis'
administration's efforts to halt the 36 oil leases. If there is to be
any finger-pointing on offshore oil, the finger should point straight
at the White House.</LD>

<HD>Reverse Discrimination in South Africa</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised but gratified to see The Times reporting on reverse
discrimination in South Africa ("South African Whites Say Deck Is
Stacked Against Them," June 19). When affirmative action was
implemented in the United States, it was to help a relatively small
minority that had experienced discrimination to "catch up." In the
case of South Africa, the affected class is the vast majority of the
population--you quote a figure of 77%.</LD>
<LD>   The long-term effect of all this will be to force the white
minority out of positions of authority and opportunity. This in turn
will force the emigration of a large proportion of whites, an
emigration that you indicate has already begun. I am not arguing that
this will be an irreparable "brain drain," but the blacks will have
to work hard to catch up. One must hope that the result will not be
as it has in almost every other sub-Saharan country in Africa:
tribalism, demagoguery, dictatorship, poverty and genocide. South
Africa has more durable parliamentary institutions than its
neighbors. Let us hope it survives in fact as well as in form.</LD>

<TE>   During white rule in South Africa, change for blacks came very,
very slowly and after a protracted struggle to correct the apartheid
system. Yet whites expect change under black rule to be quick and
immediate. It seems to me that patience and perseverance are
synonymous only to blacks. That bothers me.</TE>

<HD>Redistributing Sales Tax Could Harm Services</HD>

<LD>When a city resident calls 911, the salary of the responding officer
is most likely paid, in part, with local sales taxes. "Share the
Sales Tax Wealth" (editorial, June 19) blasted opposition by the
League of California Cities to AB 680, a bill in the state
Legislature that mandates a pilot program for redistributing the
growth in the local 1% sales tax. The editorial seems to suggest that
cities should trust the state government to solve the problem.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 25 years the local sales tax has actually declined
from 11% to 10% of total city revenue. Moreover, city per capita
sales tax revenue (adjusted for inflation) declined from $146 in
1977-78 to $130 in 2000-01. In contrast, state sales tax revenue grew
in the same period from $593 to $705.</LD>
<LD>   The state's habit in recent years of using billions of local
property tax funds to balance the state budget has made funding local
services even harder. Cities could safely consider redistributing the
growth of the local sales tax if the state is willing to
constitutionally protect the revenue that funds police and other
local services and to return the billions of dollars in property
taxes it is still taking from local governments to balance its
budget. Changing the rules in the absence of these steps is likely to
put vital local services further at risk.</LD>

<LD>Re "Execution Abolished for Mentally Retarded," June 21: Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia's point seems to be: Hey, it's going to
be tough to sort out these guys. Let's just go ahead and execute them
all. That's certainly the solution if simplifying things, rather than
justice, is your main concern.</LD>

<LD>Dear Ann Landers: From 1955 to 2002 we read your down-to-earth advice
columns. We laughed. We gasped. We nodded in agreement mostly. But
always we were impressed with your curiosity, human warmth, reporting
and judicious judgment as America's public aunt. When you began your
first and last real job, acne, petting and sassy teens were common
fare. Now, it's AIDS, spouse and child abuse and strippers with
secret lives. How did you, Eppie Lederer, the daughter of a poor
Russian Jewish immigrant who sold chickens in Iowa, stay so current,
so compassionate and so true to fundamental values amid 2,000 letters
per day? --AMAZED IN ATLANTA</LD>
<LD>   Dear Amazed: It's not who your ancestors were. It's what you
achieve yourself that counts. I'd much rather be posted on 1,000
refrigerators than win a Pulitzer Prize.</LD>
<LD>   Dear Ann: We've always marveled at your topic range. Nude slumber
parties? You were clearly wrong about toilet paper; it should roll
off the top, not from the bottom. But your concise advice and
frequent referrals to professional societies helped so many letter
writers and countless more letter readers in 1,200 newspapers around
the world.</LD>
<TE>   It was part of a day's opening ritual. Even if we missed some, on
our return at least your attitude, breeziness, good humor and
helpfulness never changed in this too-dynamic world. When the subject
was far from our own experience, we still read on because in part,
thank goodness, it wasn't our problem, but also because your common
sense, tart at times, helped develop useful approaches to such
thinking. --PRAISING IN POMONA</TE>
<TE>   Dear Praising: So what's your point?</TE>
<TE>   Dear Ann: I heard that at a fancy London lunch once you turned to
an exiled king and said, "So what should I call you?" The king
replied, "Your Highness." So you said, "Cut that stuff out!" Was that
polite?</TE>
<TE>   --QUERULOUS IN QUINCY</TE>
<TE>   Dear Querulous: He's just another person.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Ann: Were you really 83, and how did you convince your boss
to let you work from a custom-made bathtub in your luxurious,
art-filled apartment overlooking Lake Michigan?</TE>
<TE>   --JEALOUS IN JOLIET</TE>
<TE>   Dear Jealous: Mind your own business.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Ann: We understand that since the January diagnosis, you kept
your bone cancer a secret from even close friends. We also understand
you dictated the last line of your last column, to be published in
late July: "Thanks for writing." Can we make that the headline of our
editorial about you?</TE>
<TE>   --APPRECIATIVE IN L.A.</TE>

<KH>THE CASE FOR UNITY</KH>
<HD>A Hollywood Block Buster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood secession moved from petition to ballot so quickly that
some Los Angeles residents are just now realizing that their
neighborhoods fall within the boundaries of the proposed city--and
they are not happy with the discovery.</LD>
<LD>   Blame the confusion, at least in part, on some bad habits that
Californians have acquired over recent years. One is to be a little
too casual about signing petitions thrust before us on grocery store
parking lots. Another is to not pay attention to what is happening in
the local political realm until it happens on our block. Sometimes
the two overlap, as they have in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Many of those who signed the petition that launched the secession
process believed that they were asking for a study only, not
realizing that should the study favor secession, a vote would
automatically follow.</LD>
<TE>   Others didn't expect the study to move so much more quickly than a
similar San Fernando Valley study begun two years earlier--after
decades spent talking about it. This means that future breakup
proposals for other sections of the city, including within the
Valley, could move as quickly, especially if voters in November
approve Valley and Hollywood secession. For lack of attention,
residents throughout Los Angeles, not just around Hollywood, could
find themselves leaving a city they never sought to leave, without
ever putting their homes on the market or calling a moving van.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen neighborhood groups asked to be removed from the
proposed Hollywood city boundaries. The Local Agency Formation
Commission, the little-known government group charged with overseeing
secession, agreed to some requests. But it refused requests by the
Los Feliz Improvement Assn. and the Melrose Hill Neighborhood Assn.
to exclude parts of those neighborhoods because that would have
deprived a Hollywood city of income it needed to be financially
independent--a qualification for getting on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   And the commission made no secret of its determination to get both
Hollywood and the Valley on the same ballot. Yet even within a group
that proved to be more cheerleader than judge, three commissioners
complained that in the rush, questions about Hollywood boundaries
went unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has until a July 24 hearing to reconsider the
boundaries of the proposed Hollywood, an unlikely prospect. If
neighborhoods that never wanted to be part of a proposed Hollywood
wound up in it after the secession vote, what could they do? They
could petition to secede from Hollywood. Where does it end?</TE>

<HD>John Dempsey, 83; His Cartoons Were a Staple of Playboy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Dempsey, a veteran freelance magazine cartoonist whose
full-page, color cartoons lampooning contemporary America were a
staple of Playboy magazine for five decades, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Dempsey died of complications of a stroke May 18 at Scripps
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in the late 1940s, the World War II Navy veteran began
selling his cartoons to Colliers, Cosmopolitan, Look, the Saturday
Evening Post and other national magazines.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in 1954, he submitted a batch of single-panel cartoons to a
new men's magazine, Playboy.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Hefner purchased one of the drawings.</TE>
<TE>   The cartoon ran in the December 1954 issue, and from then on, as
Dempsey once put it, he was "in the groove."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one if not two Dempsey cartoons ran in virtually every
issue of Playboy since then.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the most California of all the artists," said Michelle
Urry, Playboy's cartoon editor.</TE>
<TE>   "He did very California figures."</TE>
<TE>   Dempsey did surfers on the beach. He did the first "Mrs. Robinson"
cartoon, in which the older woman is eyeing her daughter's boyfriend.
And, most famously, he did cartoons set in nudist clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "He did these incredibly hip cartoons for a man who was basically
the Gary Cooper of cartoonists: a slow-talking, slow-walking, long
drink of water," Urry said. "He was very thoughtful and noticed
everything. He lived on the beach--he loved beach life--and did all
those California characters: out-of-work actors, the would-be
starlets, the randy preacher....</TE>
<TE>   "He was not exactly politically correct, nor did he have to be
with us. Sex for him managed to be so nuanced, so full of life, that
he really got Everyman, but it was a California version of Everyman."</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker cartoonist Sam Gross, who had known Dempsey since the
'70s, praised his use of color in his Playboy cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   "He was what I would consider one of the premier cartoonists that
could work in color," Gross said. "He enhanced the whole idea of
color."</TE>
<TE>   In one memorable cartoon, Gross said, Dempsey drew a gardener
pushing a lawn mower who was so fixated on a neighbor woman who was
gardening that "he doesn't realize the mower is going into the flower
bed and flowers are flying all over the place, these beautiful
flowers. If you did this in black and white, there would be no reason
for it. It was just absolutely magnificent."</TE>
<TE>   Gross said Dempsey had an ability to "tell an off-color joke,
which is what a Playboy cartoon would be, but with a real gentlemanly
way of doing this, of knowing how to do it without being raucous."</TE>
<TE>   Dempsey had just finished working on a drawing in his studio in
downtown Del Mar, a few blocks from his home, when he suffered the
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   The drawing was for a series of four themed cartoon books he was
working on, ranging from dogs to couples talking to their marriage
counselor.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a collection of his Playboy cartoons
published in 1970, the series would have been his first cartoon
books.</TE>
<TE>   "He never was a businessman at all with his drawings," said his
daughter, Joanna, who has been working on finding an agent for her
father and still plans to see that his books are published.</TE>
<TE>   Even at 83, Dempsey never considered retiring from his drawing
board.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me once that he felt like he had the job that every man
would have wanted to do, to make people laugh," his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Sierra Madre, Dempsey spent his early years in the
foothills east of Los Angeles, where some of his earliest drawings
were of the horses he and his friends rode through orange and avocado
groves.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Monrovia High School, where he received A's
in art, he worked on a cattle ranch in southern Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   He then worked as a surveyor on the Pan American Highway in Alaska
and Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in the Navy Seabees. While
stationed in Hawaii, he became a staff artist for Seabee magazine and
began contributing cartoons to Yank magazine.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge from the Navy, Dempsey attended Chouinard Art
Institute in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But after two years, he sold one of his cartoons to Collier's
magazine and quit school to focus on freelancing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, he moved to Laguna Beach, where he joined a close-knit
group of fellow Laguna cartoonists, including Frank and Phil
Interlandi, Ed Nofziger, Dick Oldden, Virgil Parch, Don Tobin and
Dick Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Dempsey's friends wound up in his cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   A Del Mar resident since 1970, Dempsey contributed to ZOO NOOZ,
the magazine of the San Diego Zoo; and the local Del Mar newspaper,
the Sandpiper.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter, Dempsey is survived by his wife of 35
years, Ann; a son, Jason of Paris; a brother, Sam of Lemon Grove; and
a sister, Dorothy of West Covina.</TE>

<HD>Fadzil Noor, 65; Leader of Islamic Fundamentalist Party in
Malaysia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Fadzil Noor, the leader of Malaysia's opposition Islamic
fundamentalist party, died Sunday after failing to regain
consciousness after heart bypass surgery two weeks ago, hospital
officials said. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   The death of Fadzil, the president of the fundamentalist
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, threw Malaysian politics into deeper
uncertainty a day after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced
that he was resigning, then reversed himself when supporters begged
him to stay and lead his party into elections against the
fundamentalists.</LD>
<LD>   Fadzil's death is a setback for the fundamentalists, who have been
under pressure since the aftermath of Sept. 11, when their
pro-Taliban statements alienated many Malaysians and strengthened the
standing of Mahathir's United Malays National Organization.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling party is increasingly expected to call elections a year
early in 2003 in a bid to reverse increases that the fundamentalists
made in 1999 when they gained more seats in Parliament and took
control of a second of Malaysia's 13 states.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Fadzil predicted that the fundamentalists would seize
power in three more states at the next elections, which are not
required until late 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Mahathir, who has ruled for 21 years, has accused the
fundamentalists of promoting extremism among Malay Muslims, the
country's largest ethnic group. Alcohol and gambling have been banned
and other strict Islamic laws imposed in the states they lead.</TE>
<TE>   Fadzil, who led the party since 1989, was viewed as a moderate
compared to hard-line clerics in the party who want to declare the
country an Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   He believed that imposing harsh Islamic laws across the board
would bring unrest in a multiracial country with large non-Muslim
ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities. His deputy, the more hard-line
Abdul Hadi Awang, is considered the likely successor.</TE>
<TE>   Fadzil successfully cobbled together a coalition of opposition
parties in 1999 to challenge Mahathir's ruling coalition, but it
collapsed last year.</TE>
<TE>   The late leader epitomized a traditional Malay trait of politeness
in politics, preferring veiled references over direct attacks. He
recently recalled that Mahathir was his family doctor in the rural
Kedah state before the two men entered politics.</TE>
<TE>   Fadzil is survived by his wife and eight children.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anica Vesel Mander, 67, feminist author and professor whose research
helped to legally classify rape as a war crime, died Wednesday of
breast cancer at her home in Bolinas, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, Mander traveled to her native Yugoslavia to
interview Bosnian rape victims as part of a fact-finding mission. Her
interviews led an international tribunal to declare rape a war crime.</LD>
<LD>   Mander fled the Nazis with her family at age 7 and hid for years
on an island in the Adriatic Sea. The family came to America in 1949,
and her father taught at the Army language school in Monterey.</LD>
<TE>   Mander herself became a professor of Italian and French at San
Francisco University until she was fired for joining black students
in a campus strike to demand ethnic studies courses.</TE>
<TE>   After that experience, she devoted her life to the feminist
movement and to issues of gender and racial equality. She co-authored
"Feminism as Therapy" in 1974 and wrote "Blood Ties, A Woman's
History" in 1976, the same year she founded a division of Random
House called Moon Books. Based in Berkeley, the company was
considered the first feminist publishing house.</TE>

<HD>Ralph Shapey, 81; Known for His Atonal Compositions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Shapey, a classical composer and conductor known for his
Abstract-Expressionist style that pushed the limits of the musical
establishment, died June 13 in a Chicago hospital of complications
from heart and kidney disease. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   The author of more than 200 compositions, from solo pieces to
orchestral works, Shapey liked to describe himself as a "radical
traditionalist."</LD>
<LD>   Born in Philadelphia, Shapey was a violin prodigy who began
playing at the age of 7. As a teenager he studied the violin with
Emmanuel Zetlin.</LD>
<TE>   After serving in the Army during World War II, Shapey moved to New
York City, where he studied composition with Stefan Wolpe and worked
as a free-lance violinist.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954 he founded the Contemporary Chamber Players of the
University of Chicago, which under his direction became an
influential new-music performing group.</TE>
<TE>   Although over the years his music was applauded by critics, and
Shapey conducted symphony orchestras in Buffalo, Chicago, New York
and Philadelphia, the atonality of his work made it somewhat
inaccessible to most classical audiences and orchestras .</TE>
<TE>   But Shapey was undeterred by the response, saying, "I have said to
my audiences, 'Bring your brains and humanity to the concert. Leave
your prejudices at home.' "</TE>
<TE>   Shapey made his living in the world of academia. He taught briefly
at the University of Pennsylvania before moving to the University of
Chicago. He taught composition there until 1985, when he joined the
faculty at Queens College of the City University of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Shapey was awarded a number of prizes, including a
MacArthur "genius" grant, a fellowship at the Institute of Arts and
Letters and a creative arts award from Brandeis University.</TE>
<TE>   He also created works on commission from the National Endowment
for the Arts. He was a member of the American Academy and Institute
of Arts and Letters.</TE>
<TE>   His brush with celebrity came in 1992 when the Pulitzer Prize
board overruled the unanimous recommendation of its music jury, and
decided not to award that year's music prize to Shapey's "Concerto
Fantastique." At the time, the Pulitzer board president said the
board wanted to present "a consumer's point of view." Shapey
responded: "If that is what they want, why don't they start shopping
for their music at Kmart."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his son, Max; two stepchildren and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>District Favors Firm It Faulted</HD>
<DH>Schools: L.A. Unified officials recommend hiring a joint
venture that was criticized in 2000 for excessive management costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials are proposing that $33 million in
contracts be awarded to a joint venture that was criticized two years
ago for letting the management costs for campus repairs soar. In
addition, one firm in that joint venture recently was dismissed from
a large school modernization job in Maryland amid complaints of lax
supervision.</LD>
<LD>   Three contracts on the Los Angeles Unified School District board's
agenda today would go to the joint venture of 3DInternational Inc.
and URS Corp. to help manage school construction projects that will
be financed by state and local bonds. The firm, 3D/I-URS, is one of
21 being recommended to share an overall $230 million in contracts to
manage the modernization of existing schools and construction of 85
new ones in the Los Angeles district.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, a predecessor of the 3D/I-URS joint venture faced severe
criticism for its management of thousands of repair and construction
projects in the Los Angeles district. The problems culminated in the
dismissal of six members of the firm's management team after the
district complained that it was overstaffed.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the Baltimore County school system, which covers a
suburban area, terminated a contract with Houston-based 3D/I Inc. to
supervise construction at 46 schools. The company, which received a
settlement, had completed more than $6 million worth of work under
what was to have been a $15-million contract in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Los Angeles district say they did not know of the
Maryland situation. They said they selected 3D/I-URS, along with the
other 20 firms up for the contracts, because they did well in the
recent bidding process. The district said it resolved past problems
with the 3D/I joint venture by handpicking the best of its people for
their technical skills and managing them directly, as it would under
the new contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hiring individuals," said Kathi Littmann, the district's
head of new school construction. "The folks I have here from that
firm now are just some of the best in the industry." She said some of
the problems in the past resulted from the district's poor
supervision, not from wrongdoing by the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of 3D/I in Los Angeles did not comment directly on the
joint venture's previous contracts, but said its relationship with
the Los Angeles district has dramatically improved since construction
professionals, instead of educators, have come to run the district's
facilities division. For the upcoming contracts, resumes of his
employees were scrutinized more closely than any time in his 40-year
career, said Joseph Scarano, regional manager for 3D/I in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the company's problems in Baltimore County, Scarano said
the separation was mutual and that a settlement included "an awful
lot of money" that the company was owed.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any big firm, you are going to have situations with certain
clients that don't work out the way we would like them to work out,"
Scarano said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles district's staff recommendation for the contract
has incensed critics who think the district lacks adequate internal
controls to oversee a multibillion-dollar construction program.</TE>
<TE>   "This has the appearance of an impropriety," said school district
watchdog Gene Krischer at a recent meeting of the citizen committee
that oversees the bond project. Krischer has filed a lawsuit on
behalf of the district seeking to recover millions of dollars from
the previous 3D/I joint venture and others for air-conditioning
equipment that he alleged was too expensive and exceeded noise
specifications.</TE>
<TE>   He said the firm was found to have charged the district
"exorbitant fees, and they were found to be incompetent."</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they could not have excluded the joint
venture, which has had a name change since one partner was purchased
by another company. They stress that the previous joint venture was
not terminated in Los Angeles and that 3D/I's termination in Maryland
came after the review for the current Los Angeles contract was
completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We developed with this procurement, which was potentially
controversial, a system that was very fair, very well structured,
very well executed and largely, if not entirely, without outside
intervention," said Jim McConnell, L.A. Unified's chief facilities
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the citizen panel that oversees the district's
bond program said he had some concerns about hiring a company that
didn't perform well in the past, but that the committee checked out
the 3D/I-URS team and believes it will do a good job.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the advice I've received, the team that is doing this
contract is a nationally respected team that can get the job done,"
said Proposition BB committee Chairman Robert Garcia. "On that basis,
it can be approved."</TE>
<TE>   The contracts must be in place by Sunday, when current contracts
for bond managers expire.</TE>
<TE>   The school board's vote on construction management contracts comes
at a time when district officials are still deciding how to set up
internal controls to maintain integrity in the contracting process.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent memo, Inspector General Don Mullinax recommended that
the board authorize his office to conduct a variety of checks
including audits of the applicants before contracts are awarded to
"determine the reliability, propriety and accuracy of contractors'
estimating, accounting, internal control and other systems."</TE>
<TE>   The board has not acted on his recommendation, Mullinax said.</TE>
<TE>   Had he been asked, Mullinax said, he would have done a
pre-contract audit on the construction management bidders. One of his
staff members observed the bidding process, but his office was not
asked for a pre-contract analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture did not list the Baltimore County schools among
its references, said Robert Moeller, who led the three-member panel
that reviewed applicants for managing new school construction.</TE>
<TE>   Moeller said the panel called references but did not canvass news
media sources for any disputes involving the applicants. The Maryland
school district's dissatisfaction with 3D/I surfaced in March in the
Baltimore Sun's report on the possible exposure at two elementary
schools to asbestos particles released during construction.</TE>
<TE>   School officials blamed an industrial hygienist from the company
for misjudging the severity of an asbestos release at one of the
schools, causing students and parents to be exposed to the
cancer-causing material but not in dangerous quantities.</TE>
<TE>   Donald F. Krempel, executive director of facilities, was quoted in
the Baltimore Sun as saying, "They [3D/I] don't always have, in my
judgment, the necessary talent and experience in their project
managers."</TE>
<TE>   Krempel was not available Monday. Richard Cassell, head of
engineering and construction for the Baltimore County schools, said
the terms of the termination agreement prohibit him from commenting
on 3D/I's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say they have been replaced with other firms," Cassell
said. "There were many reasons for it."</TE>
<TE>   After L.A. district voters approved a $2.4-billion bond in 1997,
the district hired 3D/I-O'Brien Kreitzberg, a joint venture in which
3D/I was a principal, to oversee 10 outside project management firms
that were responsible for 12,000 repair and modernization projects at
schools.</TE>
<TE>   URS Corp. purchased the parent company of O'Brien Kreitzberg Inc.
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture's problems culminated in the winter of 2000,
when then-interim Supt. Ramon C. Cortines fired six members of its
management team. Cortines said at the time that his decision was
precipitated by a threat made by the program manager from the joint
venture against the district's facilities chief, Lynn Roberts, who
had criticized the firm for overstaffing.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, an audit by the district inspector general's office
found that fees charged by 3DI/I-O'Brien Kreitzberg and the 10
management firms it was supervising averaged 20% of project costs,
well above the industry standard of from 4% to 11%.</TE>
<TE>   Mullinax did not blame the companies. Instead, he pointed to a
variety of possible causes, including the rush to get projects
started, repeated staff changes and a lack of teamwork between the
district and its outside managers.</TE>

<HD>Brothers Die While Diving in Old Mine</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: A friend refused to follow the Santa Ana pair as
they explored pools in one of the Cleveland National Forest's
abandoned shafts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON, DAVE McKIBBEN and TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two brothers who disappeared after exploring the murky waters of an
abandoned mine in the Cleveland National Forest were found dead
Monday by a team of sheriff's divers.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery ended an anxious overnight vigil for family and
friends, who waited for a trained cave diver to lead the search. The
two men were reported missing Sunday by a friend who had refused to
follow them into the water.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's divers said they found Nicholas, 23, and Glenn Anderson,
18, of Santa Ana near each other in branching channels about 600 feet
from the mine's entrance. The two were floating in about 10 feet of
water.</LD>
<TE>   "They dove in a hole, and they just didn't come back," their
mother, Terry Kling, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The century-old complex known as the Blue Light Mine has been a
magnet for hikers and teenagers, even though federal forestry
officials deemed it a serious safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the air in the shaft where the brothers were
found contained just 4% oxygen and a collection of as-yet-unknown
gases.</TE>
<TE>   "The water went from a few inches to waist-deep to deep," said
sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino. "The water is jet-black. There's
zero visibility. It would be very easy to become disoriented."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers and the friend, Matt Murphy, 17, hiked up rugged Pine
Canyon on Sunday afternoon to explore the abandoned 19th century
mines in the mountains above the former boomtown of Silverado.</TE>
<TE>   After entering the Blue Light's labyrinth of tunnels, they
encountered water in the tight chamber. The Andersons kept going;
Murphy did not.</TE>
<TE>   "[Murphy] said, 'I'm not jumping in--you're crazy,' " Amormino
said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy waited about two hours, but never heard from the brothers,
who were described as strong swimmers and experienced cavers. Murphy
then hiked down the mountain and phoned authorities, who began
searching the area about 7 p.m. and stayed throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until Monday morning that a cave-diving specialist
from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department could be flown in.
He and six other Los Angeles and Orange County sheriff's divers
entered the inky underground pool and, using lights, found the
Andersons in 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were wearing shorts and T-shirts and "had no special
equipment on them," said Jim Slikker, an Orange County sheriff's
diver.</TE>
<TE>   The perilous retrieval was done in water filled with slick,
chocolate-brown silt, sharp rocks and old railroad ties. The mine
shaft is only 4 feet high in parts and 5 feet wide. The divers waded
through the muck single file, connected by a safety line.</TE>
<TE>   "Loose rocks were falling on top of us," Slikker said. "The water
is extremely cold, and you can get hypothermia really fast without
the proper equipment.... Without equipment to test the air quality, a
couple of breaths inside the cave and it can be all over that
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were surfers and involved in the aquatics program at
El Modena High School in Orange. Glenn had graduated June 14.</TE>
<TE>   He was a good student, interested in technology, and played goalie
on the water polo team, Principal Nancy Murray said. He was popular
with girls who loved his golden, shoulder-length hair. In his senior
class yearbook, Glenn was named the boy with the nicest hair. "He
joked about how long it took to grow," Murray said. "He was very
quiet, polite and reserved."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was described as an "informal leader" well-liked by
co-workers at United Parcel Service in Aliso Viejo, where he was
awaiting a promotion to a part-time management position.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really nice, likable guy, and he took an incredible
amount of pride in the job he did," said his supervisor, Bryan Byrd.
"He was capable of doing a lot of different things, and we relied on
him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   A 1997 El Modena graduate, Nicholas was an avid hiker. He was a
regular at the Silverado Canyon Market, a few miles from the mine,
where he often stopped for sodas and ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a darling," said Judi Davis, who owns the market. "He was
just a daredevil--very adventurous. He had a beautiful smile too. Now
I can just imagine him in that murky water. It's just so tragic."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were familiar with the area, its trails and mine
shafts, and had dived into flooded caves in the desert, Amormino
said.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials have long warned hikers of the dangers
posed by abandoned mines that pockmark California. Each year, half a
dozen people die and dozens more are injured in deteriorated shafts.</TE>
<TE>   The state has a hotline to report abandoned mines but virtually no
money to plug even a fraction of the tens of thousands of tunnels
gouged into the earth by prospectors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, a U.S. Forest Service report rated the Blue Light Mine as
a high physical hazard and a medium chemical hazard. The report says
the mine contains stagnant water, a sulfuric smell and algae growth.
"They also observed a lot of trash, meaning there had been a lot of
visitors," said Carol Dahmen, a Department of Conservation
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, veteran caver Bill Carr displays a 20-year-old
picture of himself wading into the Blue Light Mine's waters. Carr
said he would never consider doing so today. "I'm still exploring
mines to this day, but I stay away from that one," said Carr, 45, of
Seal Beach. "Exploring any mine is dangerous, but that one in
particular is the most dangerous one I've ever come upon. It's
pitch-black in there. And there's so many different branches of
tunnels and vertical shafts you could step in."</TE>
<TE>   Or a caver could be overcome by carbon dioxide, as Carr almost was
during his three-hour exploration of the Blue Light Mine.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a cave-in section that I crawled over," he said. "I
started to black out. That means that tunnel was full of carbon
dioxide. It's heavier than air, and it collects in pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Pat Antrim grew up in the area.
As a teenager, he found adventure in the Blue Light Mine's spooky
shafts, the layers of which are connected by wooden ladders. "Parents
always tell you to be careful," Antrim said. "But kids will be kids."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, exploring the area's mines is considered a rite of passage
by many locals.</TE>
<TE>   "There are about 40 mines up in the canyons, and a lot of them are
closed and blocked off," said Gabriel Castorena, 62, who lives in
Silverado Canyon. "But some of them aren't, and kids find a way to
explore them."</TE>
<TE>   Renee Wortman, who has lived in nearby Modjeska Canyon for 30 of
her 52 years, would like to see all the mines closed. "The mines are
as dangerous as the rattlesnakes, mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes,
fires and poison oak," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dahmen said that abandoned mines "will continue to be a problem as
the population continues to push into the foothills, because that's
where most of the abandoned mines are."</TE>

<HD>Charges to Be Dropped for 2 in Abductions</HD>
<DH>Crime: Men accused in scheme that led to five deaths will
instead testify against other suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors said Monday that they will drop charges against
two Russian citizens accused of laundering ransom money in an alleged
kidnapping plot that authorities believe led to the deaths of five
Southern California residents.</LD>
<LD>   Andrei Liapine and Andrei Agueev, who were placed in custody in
Los Angeles after their arrests in Dubai in January, will instead be
deposed as material witnesses in the case against five other
California-based suspects, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyers said they convinced prosecutors that there was
insufficient evidence against the two men. But Mrozek said
prosecutors chose to dismiss the case because they were concerned
that Liapine and Agueev, as suspects, would invoke their 5th
Amendment rights and refuse to share information crucial to the case.</LD>
<TE>   Mrozek said U.S. District Judge Nora Manella is expected to order
the two men to give statements under oath. The charges would be
dropped after that, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The dropped charges will not hurt the government's broader mission
of seeking justice for the killings of five Los Angeles-area
residents who were discovered in October and March in Northern
California's New Melones Reservoir, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Liapine and Agueev were arrested by local authorities in the
United Arab Emirates, then held in Abu Dhabi, Guam, and eventually
the United States. Their lawyers say the two businessmen had no idea
they were mixed up in anything illegal in December and January, when
they began receiving and distributing ransom money wired to Agueev's
Middle Eastern accounts by the family of victim Alexander Umansky.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev's lawyer, Victor Sherman, said he and Liapine's attorney,
Edward Robinson, were able to convince prosecutors that their clients
never took any of the $234,000 in wire transfers that Umansky's
relatives sent in response to instructions from the kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   "We convinced them that, in fact, they were innocent parties doing
a favor for a friend," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   The friend Sherman referred to was Russian businessman Alexandr
Afonin, the subject of a worldwide manhunt who has been charged with
persuading Liapine, 41, and Agueev, 34, to accept the ransom money.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say some of the money ended up in the business account
of a Ventura Boulevard aquarium company, Designed Water World. The
two men listed on that company's account, Iouri Mikhel, 37, and
Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, are in custody, charged with conspiracy and
hostage-taking resulting in death.</TE>
<TE>   Also in custody and facing similar charges are Petro Krylov, 29;
Aleksejus Markovskis, 32; and Natalya Solovyeva, 26.</TE>
<TE>   All five suspects face a possible death penalty. They have pleaded
not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, after agreeing to cooperate with
investigators, another suspect, Ainar Altmanis, 42, pleaded guilty to
having a role in the kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects, who all have roots in the former Soviet Union,
allegedly targeted wealthy residents in Southern California, most of
whom were also of Eastern European descent. Developer Meyer Muscatel,
58, disappeared in October, followed by West Hollywood bookkeeper
Rita Pekler, 39; Umansky, 35; Beverly Hills businessman George
Safiev, 37; and aspiring filmmaker Nick Kharabadze, 29.</TE>
<TE>   All were killed and dumped in the remote lake. Some were killed
even after families and business associates paid the ransom,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev and Liapine will remain in custody until authorities take
their depositions, Mrozek said, adding that a conference on their
release date has been scheduled for July 8.</TE>

<HD>Hahn, Garcetti Vow 500 Housing Units in Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn and City Councilman Eric Garcetti committed to
building 500 affordable housing units within three years in Hollywood
during a packed meeting of housing advocates and parishioners from a
dozen churches Monday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Though not necessarily tied to their efforts to keep Hollywood
from breaking away from the city, the move is an effort by the mayor
and the councilman to prove their attention to Hollywood's needs.
And, the meeting's organizers say they expect to help the city
officials in their efforts to fight secession--if they follow through
on their housing pledge.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Untiedt, director of the nonprofit Hollywood Interfaith
Sponsoring Committee, said the group has connections to thousands of
people who will be motivated by the actions of Hahn and Garcetti.</LD>
<TE>   "This will have an enormous impact on what the pastors are doing"
on secession, Untiedt said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also agreed to designate an aide to regularly meet with
the group to discuss housing issues. Spokeswoman Julie Wong said the
mayor has long been committed to these issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Housing Trust Fund is a $100-million effort aimed at creating
more affordable housing. Hahn unveiled the plan six months ago,
saying it would be the largest of its kind in the nation. The money
is being redirected from the Community Redevelopment Agency, federal
community block grants and an anticipated increase in vehicle license
fees.</TE>

<LD>U.S. Secret Service agents are investigating a Russian immigrant
suspected of tampering with computers at Caltech and Pasadena City
College to try to steal credit card numbers and other personal
information.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Dimitri Sinilnikov, 48, was arrested by campus police
at Pasadena City College on May 24 and was to be returned to Florida.
Although authorities have not charged him in connection with the
California incidents, the arrest warrant cited Sinilnikov for
violating his probation on a previous conviction in Florida on
identity fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Security officials at Caltech and Pasadena City College said
Sinilnikov sought to install software in the schools' computer
systems that could record the keystrokes made by students and other
computer users on campus. They said the apparent aim was to record
credit card numbers and possibly other personal information.</LD>
<TE>   Secret Service officials initially tipped off Caltech authorities
May 24 that they had detected Sinilnikov through electronic
surveillance trying to tamper with a computer. After apparently
failing to break into the Caltech computer system, campus police
said, Sinilnikov crossed the street to Pasadena City College and
started working on a computer.</TE>

<HD>County Stalls Initiative to Increase Pensions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials have derailed a proposed initiative that
sought to increase pensions for sheriff's employees, winning a court
order to keep it off the November ballot until a judge or jury
decides whether the measure is legal.</LD>
<LD>   In his bid to stop the initiative, County Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman
held it up for two weeks and briefed the supervisors on his intention
to file a lawsuit against the proponents in a series of meetings that
critics say appear to violate the state's open-meeting laws. Pellman
defended his decision and his meetings with the supervisors as
necessary to protect the county against what he said is an
unconstitutional ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second time in six months that the cash-strapped county
has tried to head off initiatives asking the public for increased
wages or benefits.</LD>
<TE>   Both attempts have angered proponents, who argue that the county's
approach is secretive and unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "Their role is to try to assist those who want to get something on
the ballot," said Greg Emerson, an attorney representing the
proponents of the pension measure. "They had no interest in doing
that. They just went out and shut us down. It was undemocratic."</TE>
<TE>   The measure would allow retirees as young as 50 to receive a
pension equal to 3% of their salaries for each year they worked for
the Sheriff's Department. Pellman says that would cost the county
$400 million initially and $19 million a year after that.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Sheriff's Professional Assn., which represents
about 1,500 deputies but is not the union that is certified to
represent the department's rank-and-file, proposed the initiative
because the other union was unable to secure the pension increase in
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The group filed a letter with the county registrar-recorder on
June 3, indicating its intent to begin gathering signatures to place
the question on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, Pellman normally has 15 days following such a
filing to prepare an unbiased title and summary of the measure to
appear on the ballot. Instead, he filed a lawsuit to block it on June
13.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle last week signed an order
releasing Pellman from his responsibility until the question of the
measure's legality can be worked out in court.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposed initiative would be unconstitutional on its face,"
Pellman said, so he was duty-bound to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   He said he alone made the decision, without a vote by the board, a
move he has the authority to make whenever the county is in danger.</TE>
<TE>   However, he also said he met with the board members individually
to inform them of his intention to fight the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "I specifically said to some of them, 'I'm not asking you for
anything, I'm telling you, whether you like it or not,' " Pellman
said. Thus, he said, he didn't violate the state law requiring
meetings of public bodies to be held in public.</TE>
<TE>   First Amendment advocates criticized Pellman's individual sessions
as an effort to skirt the law, which holds that a series of meetings
with a majority of a public body is the same as holding a collective
meeting, that meetings have to be publicized and that they must
almost always be held in public.</TE>
<TE>   They were dubious of Pellman's assertion that he was not asking
the board's permission.</TE>
<TE>   "If he feels he has the inherent authority, don't have a series of
meetings. If you're going to let everybody know, then it's a meeting
under the Ralph M. Brown Act," the state's open-meeting law, said Tom
Newton, a lawyer with the California Newspaper Publisher's Assn.
"They apparently want it both ways."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment
Coalition, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is nothing really to seek authority for, then why is an
interactive discussion required at all?" Francke asked. "A simple
memorandum would have been adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said the board did not direct
Pellman to block the initiative, but said she agreed with him that
the measure would have been a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are such that it would have bankrupted the retirement
system," she said, vowing to keep the initiative off the ballot. "The
choice is whether we let this whole retirement system go down the
tubes, and we're not going to allow that to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Gloria Molina also criticized the
measure at a board meeting earlier this month. They did not return
calls seeking comment, nor did supervisors Michael Antonovich or Don
Knabe.</TE>
<TE>   The county's adherence to open-government laws has been in
question since March, when it inadvertently released documents to The
Times that showed the board secretly voted to kill another
initiative, which sought to increase the wages of low-paid in-home
health aides for the elderly and infirm.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the board voted 4 to 1 in a closed-door meeting,
with Yaroslavsky dissenting, to instruct Pellman not to issue a title
and summary for the health aides initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, it occurred to Pellman that he was opening up the
county to a civil-rights lawsuit, and he called a majority of the
board members to inform them of that risk and to recommend that the
required documents be issued.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing controversy led the board to adopt a series of reforms
in April, including recording its closed-door meetings and allowing

that it is unconstitutional. The county estimates the measure would
cost about $245 million a year.</TE>

<HD>Governor Blocked Tax on Large Donors</HD>
<DH>Budget: Timber firms gave $105,000 to Davis, who refused to
include industry with the many facing new levies. Aides defend the
decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN, DEBORAH SCHOCH and JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis this spring blocked efforts to impose a new
$22-million tax on the timber industry, three months after leading
timber interests donated $105,000 to his reelection campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The legislative analyst's office suggested the timber tax hike,
and several Democratic lawmakers embraced it as a way to help close
the state's $23.6-billion budget deficit. But the governor
successfully opposed it during budget talks, according to legislators
who participated in those discussions.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' revised budget, released in May, included general tax hikes
that will affect almost all Californians but did not endorse the
proposed timber tax.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials and timber company representatives say
there is no connection between the campaign contributions and the
governor's opposition to the timber tax hike. Although some
environmentalists complain about the governor's actions--and accuse
him of yielding to a campaign contributor--Davis aides and
legislators who represent logging areas say the tax would have hurt
already struggling companies.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, a Davis spokeswoman said, was sound policy.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's position against the timber tax is the latest
in a series of steps Davis has taken as governor that have helped
bring the timber industry, long allied with Republican candidates,
into the fold of the Democratic incumbent. Altogether, timber
interests have donated about $450,000 to Davis since he took office
in January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over those contributions and Davis' actions, or
inactions, including charges by environmentalists that the
administration has been slow to protect a species of salmon
threatened by logging, represents the latest challenge to Davis'
fund-raising practices. Environmental leaders who once backed Davis
now question whether the governor has given timber interests a break
in part because those companies have helped pay for his political
campaigns and have denied support to Republican gubernatorial
challenger Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club, for instance, endorsed Davis in 1998, but has not
yet taken a position in this election. Carl Pope, the club's
executive director, expressed disappointment with Davis'
environmental record, especially on timber, water quality and
fisheries. He described Davis' record on air quality issues as
"pretty solid."</TE>
<TE>   "The Sierra Club has not decided what to do in this race," Pope
said. "Our two real options are endorsing the governor, or not
endorsing" anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry's donations are a concern, Pope said. "When a
special interest is giving substantial campaign contributions, and
the governor is not keeping his campaign commitments--which on
forestry issues, he is not--you've got a very serious problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized Davis for allowing extended vacancies on the
state Board of Forestry. He called the state's timber regulations
inadequate, and said the board and its staff have failed to make them
more stringent.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell if the policy is following the money or the money is
following the policy," Pope said. "Whether it's quid pro quo or pro
quo quid, I don't care which way it runs."</TE>
<TE>   Shrinking Industry</TE>
<TE>   David Bischel, president of the California Forestry Assn., said
the timber industry has been shrinking for years in California and
cannot afford more costly taxes and regulations. In the last year, he
said, Pacific Lumber has closed century-old mills in Scotia, and the
state's last factory that manufactured pencils closed in Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with those difficulties, Bischel said, the industry
contributes to Davis and other candidates who "support balanced
natural resource policies."</TE>
<TE>   "The process hasn't gotten any less complex or any less expensive
[under Davis]," Bischel said. "But the administration has
demonstrated a commitment to try to be balanced. We're not happy with
everything the administration does. Nor are we upset with everything
the administration has done."</TE>
<TE>   Because of intense opposition from timber companies and
agricultural interests, some environmentalists are concerned the
Davis administration may stop short of designating the coho salmon as
a threatened or endangered species. The salmon, which lives in
Northern California, has been declining for decades, and
environmental groups see its downward spiral as an indication of
over-logged forests and muddied streams. The timber industry,
meanwhile, fears additional protection for the fish will lead to new
restrictions on logging in northern coastal forests.</TE>
<TE>   As the election nears, the issue is coming to a head. The state
Fish and Game Commission is scheduled to hold a hearing Aug. 1 in San
Luis Obispo on whether to add the coho salmon to the state list of
endangered species. That would protect the fish and could limit
logging and farming in the northern part of the state.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to avert a head-on collision between the timber
industry and environmentalists, state officials initiated talks
earlier this year with the same groups that sought the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hight, director of the state Department of Fish and Game,
said he believes a compromise that would avoid the designation but
create a recovery plan to restore the fishery would help the fish
survive by avoiding time-consuming lawsuits and moving ahead with a
plan to hasten the salmon's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The state's talks with environmentalists took an unexpected turn
June 7 during a discussion of ways to protect coho salmon while a
recovery plan was drafted, according to two people in the meeting.
Some listened on a conference call, while others gathered in a
Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   When some environmentalists voiced opposition to one scenario,
Hight cut off the conference call and left the room, the sources
said. Hight confirmed the account.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't productive. Sometimes negotiations come to a point
where everyone has to take a hard look at where they're going," he
said. As for the recovery plan, he said, "We still believe this is
the best approach."</TE>
<TE>   Hight called the talks a "negotiation in process."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the proposed compromise is connected to timber
contributions to Davis, Hight said: "Absolutely, unequivocally, no."</TE>
<TE>   The state is proposing the recovery plan approach, he said,
"because it's the right thing to do for the fish."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, some are skeptical. One environmentalist
involved in the talks, Cynthia Elkins of the Environmental Protection
Information Center, said she believes timber and agriculture money
has influenced Davis' position on forestry issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Because these industries have contributed so heavily to his war
chest, he feels indebted to these industries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The timber company donations, while significant, do not place the
industry among Davis' largest donors. Since becoming governor, Davis
has raised more than $50 million for his reelection effort.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's support for Davis has, however, denied Simon a
natural source of contributions from companies that historically have
backed Republicans. California Republican Party spokesman Rob
Stutzman said Simon may still receive timber industry money. But he
also said, "The business community in general has come under a lot of
pressure to contribute only to the governor."</TE>
<TE>   "The timber industry is heavily reliant on favorable state
regulations," Stutzman said. "And it is no secret that the governor
has created a pay-to-play atmosphere in Sacramento. There is no
reason to think the timber industry would be immune from the
governor's grip."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, timber companies supported then-state Atty. Gen.
Dan Lungren in his gubernatorial race against Davis. Lungren had
spoken out for property rights and tangled with environmentalists as
he defended loggers' right to fell trees.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1998 campaign, Sierra Pacific Industries, which owns
vast tracks of timberland in the Sierra Nevada, donated $110,000 to
Lungren and provided an additional $18,000 in free airplane flights
for the Republican candidate. Simpson Investment, a Seattle-based
timber concern, donated $105,000 to Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   After Davis beat Lungren, the timber companies changed course.</TE>
<TE>   Shift in Donations</TE>
<TE>   In December 1998, Sierra Pacific and Simpson, which owns coastal
redwoods, each donated $10,000 to Davis' inaugural committee. The
California Forestry Assn., the industry trade group, added $5,000.
Campaign contribution reports show the two timber companies gave the
governor $10,000 apiece in December.</TE>
<TE>   Davis received his first timber industry contribution this
election year in February--$25,000 from Pacific Lumber Co., the
Maxxam subsidiary that owns significant redwood land on the north
coast, and that sold the Headwaters Forest in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the other timber companies--Sierra Pacific, Simpson and
two Oregon-based firms with timber interests--donated a combined
$65,000. The California Forestry Assn. gave $15,000 to Davis. To
date, Sierra Pacific and Simpson have given Davis a combined
$167,000.</TE>
<TE>   The governor did not include the timber tax in his January budget
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In February, however, the legislative analyst, which advises the
Legislature on budget matters, recommended imposing new fees on
timber companies to cover the state's cost of reviewing logging
permits and enforcing compliance with timber harvest plans. Under the
analyst's proposal, the fees would cost timber companies $22.1
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection opposed the
proposal in April. And Davis rejected the timber tax when he issued
his revised budget in May.</TE>
<TE>   While both houses recommended that a version of the tax be
imposed, the issue died this month when Davis' Department of Finance
reiterated opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, this is an industry that operates on fairly small
profit margins," said Department of Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison.
"Imposing this fee would increase the cost of what already is a
costly process, and there is a concern that it could put small
timberland owners out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata), who represents the state's largest
timber-producing county, Humboldt, sits on the budget conference
committee. Chesbro opposed the tax, as did Republican conferees. But
Chesbro said Davis' opposition was key.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is a pretty important player," Chesbro said.
"Unless there is a real strong sense on the conference committee, a
lot of weight is going to the administration's view."</TE>
<TE>   Chesbro and Ross Johnson, deputy director of the Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection, said the tax, which would have been
based on the value of timber felled, could have had an unintended
consequence of causing smaller landowners to cut more trees to pay
for the new tax.</TE>
<TE>   "It hits the smaller landowner more," Johnson said. "You're going
to have to increase cutting to pay for it."</TE>

<HD>Surgery on Twins May Be Delayed</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A tear made during a preliminary procedure could
hamper plans to separate scalps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surgery to separate 11-month-old twins conjoined at the head and
facing opposite directions may be delayed several weeks because of
complications from a preliminary procedure performed at UCLA on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Surgeons at Mattel Children's Hospital implanted a silicone
balloon under the scalp of each of the Guatemalan-born twins, Maria
de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej-Alvarez. Doctors had planned to
inject the balloons with saline solution to stretch the skin enough
to cover the wound from the final separation surgery.</LD>
<LD>   But during the procedure, a slight tear was made in the scalp of
Maria de Jesus, the smaller twin. Waiting for it to heal could
postpone the main separation surgery several weeks past its July 15
scheduled date.</LD>
<TE>   The tear "is going to haunt us in the future," said Dr. Henry
Kawamoto Jr., a specialist in craniofacial reconstructive surgery,
who led the procedure. Because scar tissue is not as elastic as
regular skin, he fears that as the balloon expands it may rip the
scar tissue.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors will not inject the balloon until the tissue can
withstand the pressure, and so the twins probably will not have
enough skin by July 15 to proceed with the surgery, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maria de Jesus' skin is probably a half to three-quarters the
thickness of other infants he has treated, Kawamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure gave the surgical teams the opportunity to work out
logistical problems of operating on the girls, whose faces are
rotated 120 degrees away from each other.</TE>
<TE>   They arranged the twins on the operating table so that Maria de
Jesus was on her stomach, with a horseshoe-shaped pillow under her
face to keep her airway clear. Maria Teresa was on her back,
supported by rolled towels.</TE>
<TE>   Their hair was shaved to improve access. Anesthesia took two hours
and the implantation took one, Kawamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   After the implantation, Kawamoto wrapped the twins' heads in a
clear plastic bandage to cover the balloons' valves, which protrude
from their scalps.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want the kids to grab the darn thing and pull it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the balloons expand, the area above their foreheads will
swell, forming an inner-tube shape.</TE>
<TE>   Healing the Children, an international charity, flew the twins to
UCLA a month ago for the separation surgery and to block off the
veins they share. UCLA is donating the estimated $1.5 million in
medical costs.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, this will be the first separation of
conjoined twins at UCLA, hospital officials said. Only five other
cranial separations have been completed worldwide in the past decade,
experts said. Craniopagus twins, or those joined at the head, account
for only 2% of all conjoined twins, already a rare population.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference before the procedure, the twins' mother, Alba
Leticia Quiej-Alvarez, 22, spoke in Spanish through an interpreter.
She said she was nervous but added, "Espero en Dios," I trust in God.</TE>
<TE>   She said the twins differ in what they want to eat, what they want
to wear.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a big shame," she said, if the separation procedures
were not attempted. She could not be reached after the procedure.</TE>

<CX>   Twins' costs--A California section article Tuesday about conjoined
twins at UCLA's Mattel's Children's Hospital incorrectly stated that
UCLA is donating the costs of the twins' medical care. The university
hopes donations to the fund it set up for the conjoined twin girls
will help offset the estimated $1.5-million cost, and the university
will make up the difference. Doctors are donating their services.
Checks to the UCLA Foundation may be mailed to UCLA Medical Sciences

<LD>Where Ann Cheung comes from, people drive on the left side of the
street. They don't worry about maintaining a safe distance from the
car in front of them. They don't look over their shoulders to see
whether another motorist is cruising in their blind spot. Where
Cheung comes from, the roads are narrow. Merging lanes, bicycle lanes
and turning lanes don't exist.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that is why the Hong Kong native, 38, failed her first
driving test when she tried to get her California license at the
Department of Motor Vehicles office in Santa Monica earlier this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Although she had taken 19 hours of lessons from a Los Angeles
driving school beforehand, had been a licensed driver in her own
country for 10 years and speaks English well, Cheung said she
couldn't always understand the grouchy test examiner's instructions.</LD>
<TE>   "Because you are nervous, it's harder. It's not like doing it in
your mother tongue," she said, still mortified at the test's outcome.
"The inspectors should realize, 'Hey, they are not from here. They
need clear directions.' "</TE>
<TE>   Learning to control a motor vehicle and master the rules of the
road are hard enough if you're a teenager who has grown up riding the
freeways and has lane changes and rolling California stops coded into
your genes. But what if you're a foreign-born adult who has spent
years driving under dramatically different conditions or, even more
daunting, never driven at all?</TE>
<TE>   Yet every year, thousands of new arrivals in Los Angeles find
themselves in that situation when they move to a city where cars are
not only a cultural icon, but can be crucial to economic survival.</TE>
<TE>   "Our driving environment in California, with the multi-lanes, is
different from most every other environment outside the U.S.," said
Robert Stall, an officer of the Driving School Assn. of California
and owner of the San Fernando Valley's Dollar Driving School.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are talking about surface streets that have three or
four lanes in each direction, and when you consider that many
countries have single-lane highways where the drivers really never
need to make a lane change, it can be quite a shock for people."</TE>
<TE>   Stall said the nonnative students who seek training at his school
come from all over the world. They range from experienced Western
European and Middle Eastern drivers who need to be "re-educated" in
skills such as observing speed limits and scanning the road for
hazards, to low-income Central Americans and Eastern Europeans who
"have never driven a day in their lives, or maybe never even been in
a car," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For those in the latter category, obtaining a license can be a
long process. New adult drivers, especially those from other
countries, must sometimes take and retake the written and
behind-the-wheel tests half a dozen times before they pass, said
George Hensel, president of the California Driving School, the
region's largest.</TE>
<TE>   "The foreign-born has not only all the problems that the regular
driver has in learning how to drive, but they also have problems
overcoming the language differences," Hensel said. "A simple sign
that says something like 'Shoulder Work Ahead' can be very confusing.
You have to explain, what is a shoulder? Obviously, these are all
problems that can be overcome with training and with time, but it
does take time."</TE>
<TE>   To assist foreign-born drivers in securing licenses, the DMV
translates its traffic-law manual into five languages--Spanish,
Tagalog, Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean. The written test all drivers
are required to pass before taking their behind-the-wheel exam is
available in more than 30 languages, including Hmong, Arabic, Polish,
Japanese, Italian and Hindi.</TE>
<TE>   The road test, on the other hand, is a different story. "During
the drive test, applicants need to be able to read signs in English,"
said Armando Botello, a DMV spokesman. Bilingual test examiners are
permitted to speak to applicants in their native languages. "However,
they have to make sure [the applicants] understand the signs that are
in English," Botello said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is home to dozens of driving schools that
cater to immigrants. The Santa Monica-based Pacific Japan Driving
School, for instance, specializes in teaching both young Japanese
adults who are attending college in California and Japanese
housewives who are known as "paper drivers" because they were
licensed in Japan but never drove, having lived in crowded cities
where cars were impractical.</TE>
<TE>   Hiromi May Hayashi, the school's owner, said that because many
traffic signs use symbols that are universal, her students generally
have an easy time following them. What is difficult for them,
however, is getting used to driving on the opposite side of the road
from what they are used to.</TE>
<TE>   "They often put the window wiper on instead of a winker signal by
mistake," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest schools offering bilingual drivers' training is
Ford Driving School in Hollywood, where the staff includes
instructors fluent in Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.
Fernando Rees, the owner, estimates that half his students are
newcomers to America and says those with previous driving experience
can be the toughest to teach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard, very hard for them to understand that the laws here
are made to be followed to the letter, because in many countries,
they are not followed at all," Rees said. "The mechanical part is
easy. Rules you can learn. But the attitudes have to be changed, and
that is very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Like Cheung, most immigrants who sign up for driving lessons are
adult women, according to several driving school instructors. Many
come from countries where driving is considered either too dangerous
or improper for women, or from rural provinces where everyone but the
very rich gets around on bicycle or on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard, because they never imagined they would drive
here, or in Mexico, or anywhere else," said Enrique Gallegos, owner
of Expo Driving School in Huntington Park. "They get to a point where
they realize you have to drive here. You need a car to get around, to
take the children to school, to go shopping and everyday things like
that."</TE>
<TE>   That was the case for Isti Budihati, 27, who moved to California
from Indonesia a year ago. Budihati never learned to drive in her
country--"It's too crazy for women to drive"--and relied on her
father, brother or boyfriend to get around. Her mother didn't drive
either. "All the men drive, not the women. The woman is just a
passenger," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Weary of riding buses and begging rides from her roommates,
Budihati decided it was time to overcome her fears and cultural
stereotypes and sign up for driving school. She had her first lesson
last week and hopes to be driving on her own by midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   Getting her license "means everything," she said. "I'll be
independent. I won't have to depend on somebody else for the small
things. When I can drive myself anytime I want, that's good."</TE>
<TE>   Although the DMV does not track the number of California license
holders who are from other countries, foreign-born motorists include
another class of driver: illegal immigrants who are driving without
licenses because they cannot get them.</TE>
<TE>   When they apply for their licenses, newcomers to California are
required to furnish either a Social Security number or, if they are
here as students, a letter from the Social Security Administration
explaining that they are ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the state Legislature approved a bill that would
remove that requirement and allow individuals who are in the process
of legalizing their immigration status to be licensed.</TE>
<TE>   Similar legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo
(D-Los Angeles), was vetoed two years ago by Gov. Gray Davis, who is
negotiating with Assembly leaders about the fate of the new bill,
said David Galaviz, Cedillo's legislative aide.</TE>
<TE>   Hensel of the California Driving School says he supports the
change as a way to make roads safer. "If they can't get a license, we
can't train them, and this forces a lot of people who came here
illegally to learn from a friend or somebody else, or even worse, to
get behind the wheel without any training at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hensel also supports revising DMV rules to require new adult
drivers to receive the same classroom instruction that teenage
drivers must undergo.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of somebody born here, they feel it's their natural,
God-given right to have that license," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of the foreign-born, in many cases they never thought
they would be able to obtain one. To them, it's more than a status
symbol. It's more like, 'I've arrived.' "</TE>
<TE>   Four days after failing her first driving test, Cheung was back
behind the wheel at the Santa Monica DMV. This time, she got a
different examiner, a man who greeted her with a smile and a
handshake and immediately put her at ease.</TE>
<TE>   "She shouldn't have any problems," her California Driving School
teacher, Oscar Hunt, said as they pulled away. "She knows how to
drive, but basically she didn't drive enough before, so we had to
brush up on things like parking and lane changes."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, Cheung was back in the DMV parking lot,
wearing a broad smile and waving a test paper with "Excellent!"
handwritten across it.</TE>
<TE>   "This inspector, he was very friendly. Not like the other one. It
made a big difference," she beamed.</TE>

<LD>State Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) said Monday that he
will run for mayor of the proposed San Fernando Valley city, becoming
the first candidate for an office that will exist only if voters
decide to break the region off from Los Angeles on the same Nov. 5
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a multimillionaire physician who spent $425,000 of his
money to win his Assembly seat two years ago, plans a formal
announcement of his candidacy Wednesday. His platform will focus on
what he said were years of neglect of the Valley by the city of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a lifelong history in the San Fernando Valley, and our
community is very important to me," said Richman, 48. "I'm fully
committed to Valley independence, and I will be working to address
that goal in the months ahead."</LD>
<TE>   The freshman lawmaker is also seeking reelection to the
Legislature. If he wins both offices and the Valley secedes, he will
resign from the Assembly, and a special election will be held to fill
his Assembly seat, Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the group spearheading the Valley secession drive on
Monday issued its first fund-raising appeal, seeking $1,000 each from
25,000 people. The letter from the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee was signed by eight prominent secessionists, including
former ARCO Chairman Lod Cook, County Supervisor Michael Antonovich,
former Assemblyman Richard Katz and former city Ethics Commissioner
David Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   In the mayor's race, Richman might face state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar), who said Monday that he continues to seriously consider a
run, even though he has not decided whether to support secession
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon also is vying for another term in the Senate, and a
special election would be held to fill that seat, if needed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a legal move that surprised Cypress officials, the Cottonwood
Christian Center on Monday sought a federal court injunction to block
the city from taking 18 acres of the church's land to build a Costco.</LD>
<LD>   A church spokeswoman said the 102-page motion would prevent the
city from taking "immediate possession" of Cottonwood's property near
the Los Alamitos Race Course, an act allowed under eminent domain
proceedings. City Atty. Bill Wynder said the parties had agreed to
suspend any legal action while meeting twice weekly to find the
church an alternative location.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members unanimously voted last month to condemn the
undeveloped site at the corner of Walker Street and Katella Avenue,
where the 4,000-member church had planned to build a complex.</LD>

<LD>   Closet Factory Inc. did not admit any wrongdoing. The company was

<HD>AvalonBay Acquires Burbank Complex</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A national real estate investment company that wants to expand its
presence in Southern California bought the 400-unit Promenade
Apartments near Burbank's Civic Center last week for more than $70
million.</LD>
<LD>   AvalonBay Communities Inc., a publicly traded company based in
Alexandria, Va., bought the four-story complex at 350 S. San Fernando
Blvd. from an affiliate of Woodland Hills-based PMG Inc. Rents posted
for apartments in the 15-year-old property range from $1,350 to
$2,050 and about 95% of the units are occupied.</LD>
<LD>   The new owner plans to renovate the Promenade's interiors and
common areas, said Larry Scott, AvalonBay's vice president in charge
of development in Southern California. Ray Eldridge, Sean Deasy and
Chris Knowles of CB Richard Ellis brokered the sale.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AvalonBay, a real estate investment trust, trade on the
New York Stock Exchange. The acquisition boosts its Burbank holdings
to 1,150 apartments, and its Southern California portfolio to more
than 6,000 units. The company owns about 42,000 units nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   AvalonBay early this year completed its renovation of a 750-unit
Burbank apartment complex built in the 1960s now called Avalon at
Media Center.</TE>
<TE>   The company invested more than $76 million into that Pass Avenue
project, including the purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   AvalonBay also recently started construction of its first Southern
California apartment community built from the ground up--the
$50-million, 233-unit Avalon at Glendale Court in Glendale. Scott
said the company wants to develop 700 to 1,000 units per year in the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Projected population growth and the cost and difficulty of
developing apartments in Southern California are key factors behind
continued apartment investments, market observers say.</TE>
<TE>   Though Los Angeles-area apartment vacancy has risen because of a
spurt of construction and softened demand as low interest rates turn
many renters into buyers, rents have continued to creep
upward--albeit at a much slower pace than in the late-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Investors tracking the Southland's long-term outlook tend to
conclude that rents and property values face "little downward
exposure," said apartment broker Marc Renard of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
Low interest rates and the scant number of properties for sale also
are driving prices up.</TE>
<TE>   Like most apartment REITs, AvalonBay posted flat earnings in
recent quarters as apartment demand softened nationwide. Funds from
operations for 2002's first quarter totaled $69.7 million, or 99
cents a share, compared with $67.7 million, or 98 cents a share, for
the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   For apartment communities AvalonBay has owned for at least a year,
overall net operating income for this year's first quarter fell by
about $5.9 million, or 6.3%, compared with the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has been a relative bright spot for AvalonBay.
Net operating income from the established properties increased 2.9%
on a year-to-year basis.</TE>

<HD>TRW Gets 3 Bids For Defense Units</HD>

<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three defense giants have submitted bids for TRW Inc.'s defense
businesses, putting pressure on Northrop Grumman Corp. to sweeten its
offer for all of TRW, the Wall Street Journal reported.</LD>
<LD>   General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and Britain's BAE Systems
have bid for TRW units, the Journal said. Officials at the five
companies involved were not immediately available for comment. TRW
had set a deadline of Monday for bids for its defense assets, which
make satellites and missile-defense systems.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Monday, Los Angeles-based Northrop said it was extending
its offer for all of TRW by one week to Friday. The company made a
$6.7-billion hostile offer for TRW. TRW is studying a parallel
breakup plan.</LD>
<TE>   About 3.31 million TRW shares, just 2.6% of the total outstanding,
had been tendered in favor of the $53-per-share offer as of Friday,
the previous expiration date, Northrop said.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the bids told the Journal that Northrop
submitted a new bid for TRW but it couldn't be determined how it was
different from previous offers.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, TRW shares gained 15 cents to
$56.45 while Northrop shares fell 34 cents to $128.35.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Union representatives said a worker was fired from an airline
catering job in retaliation for criticizing his employer in a Los
Angeles Times story on the hazards of accelerated production.
Officials with LSG Sky Chefs, the largest in-flight meal producer in
the world, did not return calls for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Gamboa, who worked in the company's Inglewood kitchen for 13
years, was fired when he reported on time for his 2 a.m. shift
Monday. He said a company official said the dismissal was for
tardiness.</LD>
<LD>   Gamboa said he arrived 30 minutes late a week earlier, and 43
minutes late in May, but otherwise had a good record. He said he
called both times to say he would be delayed.</LD>
<TE>   Within hours of the firing, Noel Rodriguez, a local representative
of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union, and 35
employees met with managers of the Inglewood kitchen to demand
Gamboa's reinstatement, but said they were told he would not be
rehired.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he will file a grievance. The union has been in
contract negotiations with Sky Chefs for two years.</TE>
<TE>   In the June 19 article, Gamboa said he had been threatened with
dismissal for failing to keep up with what he called unrealistic
production goals of filling 180 meal trays an hour. He said he
strained his elbow trying to maintain the speed and had to take pain
relievers to continue working. The company denied the claims.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill seeking to stop California's $41-billion recording industry
from holding singers to long-term contracts is on its way to the
state Assembly after clearing the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's 25-10 vote keeps the bill alive as the record
industry and some of its biggest acts continue talks toward an
agreement on reforming a longtime practice of the music business.</LD>
<LD>   Recording artists complain that record companies lock hungry,
naive artists into standard seven-album contracts that can last 15
years or longer. The recording industry, which won a 1987 exemption
from state labor law, is California's only business to legally bind
employees longer than seven years.</LD>
<TE>   The bill has only weeks to pass the Assembly.</TE>

<HD>Daimler May Raise Its Forecast</HD>
<DH>Autos: Cost-cutting and increased sales are expected to
boost second-quarter earnings at its U.S. Chrysler unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler may raise its profit forecast for 2002 when it posts
second-quarter earnings next month because of better-than-expected
performance at its U.S.-based Chrysler unit.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp said Monday that
Chrysler will be profitable this year and that the company may raise
its forecast as a result, spokesman Thomas Froehlich said. Schrempp
made the comments in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, saying he
expects "very, very good" second-quarter results at Chrysler.</LD>
<LD>   "They have good reason to raise their forecast--Chrysler is well
ahead of plan, and the expectations at the beginning of the year were
extremely low," said Juergen Pieper, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler
with a "buy" rating on DaimlerChrysler shares.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler is in the middle of a three-year plan to eliminate 26,000
jobs; close plants in the U.S., Mexico and Canada; reduce production
and cut parts costs by 15%.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 3 U.S. auto maker had a $1.9-billion loss last year and
aimed to at least break even this year.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's U.S. sales in May rose 4.4% compared with the same
month a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Schrempp's comments come two weeks after Chrysler Chief Operating
Officer Wolfgang Bernhard said he expects the unit's results "to be
better than break-even this year" because better marketing and
incentives have helped sales. Chrysler lost $125 million in last
year's second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Stuttgart, Germany-based DaimlerChrysler "remains cautious about
the second half of the year given the economic and political
uncertainties," Schrempp said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said it expects full-year profit of "significantly
more" than $2.54 billion, excluding certain expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker will release second-quarter results July 18.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's cost-cutting and U.S. sales "will improve our operating
profits quite substantially when you compare it to last year,"
Chrysler's Bernhard said earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, DaimlerChrysler's U.S. shares fell 6 cents to close at
$43.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Douglas Emmett Builds Presence in the Valley</HD>
<DH>Owner of the Sherman Oaks Galleria is buying key buildings
in Warner Center in Woodland Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After amassing a huge collection of office buildings on the Westside
of Los Angeles, Douglas Emmett Realty Advisors is rapidly emerging as
possibly the biggest player in the San Fernando Valley office market.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based real estate investment and management firm
already owns a string of office buildings along Ventura Boulevard in
the Sherman Oaks-Encino business corridor, along with what may be the
Valley's most well-known property, the newly renovated Sherman Oaks
Galleria office and retail complex.</LD>
<LD>   Further west in Woodland Hills, Douglas Emmett has agreed to pay
about $340 million for a cluster of high-rises that account for about
one-third of the office space in Warner Center, which many consider
the Valley's most prestigious corporate address. By the time Douglas
Emmett completes its Warner Center acquisition, it will own or manage
about 4.5 million square feet in the area.</LD>
<TE>   In creating strongholds in the Valley's two most prominent
business districts, Douglas Emmett has duplicated a strategy it has
followed on the other side of the Santa Monica Mountains, where its
clusters of properties in such markets as Brentwood and downtown
Santa Monica have limited competition and have given it greater clout
with tenants and brokers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in key locations with limited opportunities for new
development," said longtime developer Gerald Katell, whose office is
in one of the nine Douglas Emmett office buildings along San Vicente
Boulevard in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Founded more than 30 years ago, Douglas Emmett took advantage of
the real estate bust of the early 1990s by teaming up with
institutional investors to scoop up scores of office properties
across the Los Angeles region. The firm, headed by Dan Emmett, has
continued to add to its portfolio and now controls more than 10
million square feet of commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   Though known primarily for its Westside holdings, Douglas Emmett
has built a considerable presence in Sherman Oaks and Encino, where
the company controls about a dozen office buildings on Ventura
Boulevard totaling about 2.5 million square feet of space, according
to real estate data provider CoStar Group. The hub of these holdings
is the busy intersection of Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, where
Douglas Emmett owns properties on three corners, including the site
of the Sherman Oaks Galleria.</TE>
<TE>   Quick access to the 405 and 101 freeways as well as the stores and
restaurants along Ventura Boulevard has made the Sherman Oaks-Encino
area popular with small and mid-size professional firms, brokers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Douglas Emmett has done a good job in cornering that market,"
said broker Nico Vilgiate at Insigna/ESG. "It will allow them more
leverage at the negotiating table with tenants and ... brokers
alike."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Sherman Oaks Galleria, Douglas Emmett
practically gutted the former mall of "Valley Girl" fame and
transformed it into an open-air center with three office buildings
towering over a bustling shopping and entertainment complex. Plans
for palm trees and other street improvements at the intersection are
part of an effort to create a more cohesive and visually attractive
hub.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a true gateway project," said Douglas Emmett President
Kenneth Panzer. "That's what makes it unique, and that's why a lot of
companies relocate to the Galleria."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few miles west in Woodland Hills, the five-building complex
Douglas Emmett is buying along Oxnard Street form the high-rise
nucleus of Warner Center. Unlike the smaller professional and service
firms that gravitate to Sherman Oaks and Encino, larger, corporate
tenants prefer the bigger buildings of Warner Center, brokers say.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be controlling quite a bit of product in two strategic
locations," Cresa Partners broker Carlo Brignardello said of Douglas
Emmett.</TE>
<TE>   But Douglas Emmett faces tough competition for tenants in Warner
Center, where it will have to fill nearly 300,000 square feet left
vacant when health maintenance organization HealthNet Inc. moved into
a new building at nearby LNR Warner Center. John Sabourin, a
Colliers-Seeley broker who represents LNR Warner Center, said he
expects to square off against Douglas Emmett when a
179,000-square-foot building opens next year at his project.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have to be pretty price-competitive," he said.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy to Cut Dividend, Sell Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. will cut its dividend by half and sell stakes in a
pipeline acquired from Enron Corp., a British natural-gas terminal
and other assets to raise as much as $2 billion to preserve an
investment-grade credit rating.</LD>
<LD>   Second-quarter profit will fall to about break-even, partly
because of a slump in energy trading, Chief Operating Officer Steve
Bergstrom said in a conference call with investors. Dynegy expects
$300 million in costs from its communications unit and $150 million
in severance payments and other expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch Inc. cut Dynegy's debt to a BB-plus "junk" rating, and other
services are considering downgrades. Shares of Dynegy and its rivals
have fallen with energy prices and as Enron's collapse eroded
investor confidence. Dynegy's chief executive quit last month as
regulators probed its energy trading and accounting.</LD>
<TE>   Houston-based Dynegy reaffirmed that it has enough cash to meet
its obligations even if it were to lose its investment-grade rating
from one or more services. The company said its 2002 profit forecast
"no longer applies," and it will provide a revised projection late
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy was expected to earn 21 cents a share in the second quarter
and $1.35 this year, the average estimates of analysts polled by
Thomson First Call. Dynegy's second-quarter earnings last year rose
60% to $146 million, or 43 cents a share, as sales of power and gas
surged in North America. Trading profit more than doubled to $150
million.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Holdings, which has most of Dynegy's debt, is rated Baa3,
the lowest investment grade, by Moody's Investors Service. The
Standard &amp; Poor's ranking is BBB, the second-lowest investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's stock has plunged 83% in the last year. The shares fell
12 cents, or 1.6%, to $7.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief
Financial Officer Louis Dorey, who took over as CFO on Wednesday,
helped improve investor sentiment, said John Olson, an energy analyst
with Sanders Morris Harris Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted their hands held, and he did that," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy plans to sell half of Northern Natural Gas, the 16,600-mile
pipeline that runs to the Great Lakes from Texas, Dorey said during
the conference call.</TE>
<TE>   The company got the line as compensation for $1.5 billion spent on
Enron before an agreement to buy the insolvent energy trader
collapsed in November.</TE>

<HD>Enron Report Angers Lawmakers</HD>
<DH>Energy: State's elected officials say allegations the
company hid gains during California crisis confirm their suspicions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California lawmakers reacted Monday with outrage to revelations that
Enron Corp. may have shunted profit made during California's energy
crisis into hidden reserves to reduce the political heat directed at
the Houston energy company.</LD>
<LD>   According to the allegations, reported in Sunday's New York Times,
Enron hid as much as $1.5 billion in trading profit from long-term
contracts in undisclosed reserves as energy prices leaped in
California in late 2000 and early 2001. Enron at the time said price
spikes in California were having little effect on Enron's finances.</LD>
<LD>   Enron reportedly was hiding these profits at the same time that it
was hiding corporate borrowings and losses in off-the-books
partnerships, which led to the company's financial collapse and
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in December.</LD>
<TE>   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne refused to comment on the
allegations except to say that Enron is cooperating with the many
investigations into the company's accounting and trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   R. Neal Batson, appointed last month as special examiner in the
Enron bankruptcy, did not return a call for comment on whether
Enron's use of reserves would be part of his investigation into
accounting irregularities at Enron. Batson, an Atlanta bankruptcy
attorney, is looking into Enron's complex tangle of partnerships and
off-balance-sheet deals, which could help determine how much
creditors will receive.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said the accusation of hidden
Enron reserves adds fuel to California's demand that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission refund $8.9 billion in alleged
electricity overcharges and that $43 billion in long-term electricity
contracts negotiated during the worst of the crisis be renegotiated.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been saying all along that they used California as a cash
cow and they bled us dry. The fact that they hid that shows how
corrupt they were," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us more ammunition to show how we were gamed, how it
was a plot, how it was hidden and how much we deserve to have our
money back and deserve to have the long-term contracts reexamined,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said such accounting allegations
are not part of his committee's investigation into possible market
manipulation, which is focusing on trading ploys and market
misbehavior.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are more likely to figure into the ongoing
investigation into Enron's accounting practices by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which has proved to be more aggressive than
FERC, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is interesting that while we were in the raging
hours of our crisis, they [Enron] were trying to make sure no one
knew how much money they were making," Dunn said. "Some thieves bury
money in the backyard. Enron hid it in their financial statements."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis in a statement said: "Enron's made such a killing
off this state, they were embarrassed to disclose it to their
shareholders ....Unfortunately, Enron will live on as a symbol for
everything that has gone wrong with electricity deregulation."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Enron was told Monday it can immediately pay as much
as $2,000 in severance to some former workers after U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Arthur Gonzalez preliminarily approved a $28.8-million plan.</TE>

<HD>GE to Sell B2B Unit After Sales Decline</HD>
<DH>Internet: Francisco Partners is buying the once highly
touted e-commerce arm for $800 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. is selling its business-to-business e-commerce
unit, a once highly touted enterprise that was supposed to change the
way companies process orders and manage inventory.</LD>
<LD>   Global Exchange Services, better known as GXS, will be acquired by
buyout firm Francisco Partners for $800 million, according to a joint
statement issued Monday by GE and Francisco. GE, which formed GXS in
2000 and has been its biggest customer, will retain 10% ownership of
the unit.</LD>
<LD>   GXS services have been used by about 80% of companies listed on
the Fortune 500, according to GE. But sales last year fell to $602
million from $640 million. And the unit's chief executive, Harvey
Seegers, said sales this year were running at a rate similar to 2001.</LD>
<TE>   GE officials said the unit--which took purchase orders, shipping
notices, invoices and other formerly paper documents online--was
being sold because it did not fit in with the industry giant's core
businesses of manufacturing and financial services.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that [GXS] has a chance to do much better under the
ownership of a group that is focused exclusively on technology," said
GE spokesman David Frail.</TE>
<TE>   But Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Robert Freedman said he believes
GE's decision to sell had more to do with GXS' disappointing results.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they would hold onto a business that makes a good buck,
whether it's core or not," Freedman said. "They made a big investment
in this area and it did not pan out in the way they anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at privately held Francisco, located in Menlo Park,
declined to comment. The $2.5-billion fund owns computer and
technology companies including Legerity, a former Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. unit.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street seemed to have liked GE's unloading of GXS. The stock
led a midday rally and closed up 65 cents to $29.60 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   GXS established a computer network that could be used by companies
to process the documents. In addition to GE, the network was used by
Eastman Kodak Co., DaimlerChrysler, Target Corp. and Sara Lee Corp.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the company's sales derived from the network, Seegers
said. The rest came from sales of software used by mostly smaller
companies to do their own processing. GXS grew out of GE Information
Services, which in the 1960s teamed with Dartmouth College to develop
the BASIC computer language.</TE>
<TE>   GXS, which has 1,600 employees, has fared far better than many
formerly highflying "B2B" e-commerce firms. The stock of one its
major competitors, Ariba Inc., soared to near $330 in March 2000. On
Monday, it closed up 26 cents to $2.90 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   E-commerce consultant Frank Kenney said he thinks online B2B
commerce is still viable.</TE>
<TE>   "It is far from dead; people are still saving a lot of money by
using B2B," said Kenney of Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   He said GXS remains strong and might pick up some businesses from
struggling competitors.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar's Shares Are Hit Hard by Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. plunged to a 52-week
low Monday as investors reacted to a preliminary ruling on a highly
watched patent dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar tried to reassure investors that last week's ruling would
not affect current relationships with cable TV system operators that
license its interactive program guide or the consumer electronics and
other parts of its business.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena-based company's stock fell $3.20, or 39%, to $5 on
Nasdaq. An administrative law judge with the International Trade
Commission ruled against Gemstar's allegation that its competitors,
EchoStar Communications Corp., Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and Pioneer
Corp., were infringing its patents for some of its interactive-guide
technology.</LD>
<TE>   Gemstar said it intended to appeal the ruling to the full
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts downgraded the stock Monday, saying the decision
would hurt Gemstar's efforts to sign new deals for its program guide
with cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   What is unclear is whether the decision will put additional
pressure on Gemstar from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 42%
of the company. Rumors have persisted that Murdoch would like to
exercise more control.</TE>

<HD>Congress Ready to Hold Hearings Into Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The possible shredding at the firm is only one
reason for the panel's interest in the firm's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The congressional committee that investigated Enron Corp.'s
accounting fiasco and document shredding is turning its focus on
Global Crossing Ltd. and probably will hold hearings in the next few
months over destroyed records, finances and other issues involved in
the nation's biggest telecommunications collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce, said Monday that the panel has nearly finished reviewing
thousands of pages of records and interviewing witnesses and is
preparing for a hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Claims of document shredding came to light over the weekend in one
of the dozens of securities fraud cases filed against Global Crossing
since its Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing. For a committee that put a
spotlight on the shredding issues at Enron and its accounting firm,
Arthur Andersen, "We're sensitive to the words: document
destruction," Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   But those claims alone aren't spurring the congressional
investigation, he said; they represent "another in a long list of
reasons to hold hearings."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at all the circumstances surrounding the
company's collapse," said Johnson, who also is a spokesman for the
committee's chairman, Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   The committee had said that public hearings on the Bermuda-based
fiber-optic network builder were a possibility, but Johnson said the
hearings are now probable. "There are still a couple of aspects we
have to check," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said it is too early to say if subpoenas will be issued to
force the appearance of any witnesses, such as Global Crossing
founder and chairman, Gary Winnick. Typically, the committee asks
witnesses to appear voluntarily, reserving its subpoena power for
those who are necessary to the hearing but refuse to show up.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we would be very interested in having Mr. Winnick at any
hearing we hold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it has been turning over documents to the
committee and will continue to cooperate with it and with other
agencies that are investigating Global's accounting methods and other
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, the fourth-largest corporate bankruptcy filing
ever, is the target of probes by federal criminal authorities and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm and its executives also
are defendants in nearly 60 securities fraud cases, which probably
will get consolidated next month into one giant court proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of secret filings unsealed late Friday, two employees
said they heard a shredding machine operating behind a closed storage
room door at the company's main office in Madison, N.J., after Global
sent employees an e-mail Feb. 7 prohibiting the destruction of
records. Neither saw any shredding occur, but one said in court
papers that she saw the machine in the room.</TE>
<TE>   The company denied that shredding had occurred in that room but
acknowledged that employees in five outlying offices had destroyed
documents that were not relevant either to federal investigations or
to the securities fraud cases.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Fine Genentech $200 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Punitive damage award ends a bitter trial with City
of Hope. Legal experts expect amount to be reduced on appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury Monday ordered Genentech Inc. to pay City of Hope National
Medical Center $200 million in punitive damages for betraying its
trust with the renowned cancer hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The award ends a bitter, four-month trial over the contract that
established a brief collaboration between the hospital and Genentech
26 years ago. It comes one week after jurors ordered Genentech to pay
$300.2 million in compensatory damages to City of Hope for
withholding royalties from the Duarte medical center.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors awarded punitive damages to punish Genentech for acting
with fraud or malice.</LD>
<TE>   Genentech said Monday that it was disappointed by the award and
would appeal to the California Court of Appeal, setting in motion a
legal process the company said could take one to four years to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   The South San Francisco-based company said it would take a
one-time, $500-million charge in the second quarter to account for
the judgments against it. The amount is almost twice Genentech's 2001
pretax income of $283 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing to remember here is that no cash changes
hands until the appeals process is over," said Genentech Chief
Financial Officer Louis J. Lavigne Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech's shares rose after the judgment was announced,
indicating investors were relieved that punitive damages were not
higher.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's shares closed at $34.84, up $1.89, on the New York
Stock Exchange. City of Hope sought a punitive award of $300 million
to $580 million.</TE>
<TE>   "In the grand scheme of things, it could have been a lot worse,"
said Bear Stearns analyst Ronald C. Renaud, noting the company has
$2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. "This makes it seem
less dramatic, and investors are pleased."</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope general counsel Glenn Krinsky said the hospital was
elated with the punitive award and predicted that Genentech would
lose any appeal. "Our legal team is persuaded that their appeal will
be fruitless," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute centered on a 1976 contract that created the
scientific collaboration that led to discovery of human insulin, the
world's first biotechnology drug.</TE>
<TE>   In research funded by Genentech, City of Hope scientists Arthur
Riggs and Keiichi Itakura in 1978 developed a way to use bacteria to
produce human proteins, a discovery that paved the way for the
biotechnology revolution and billions of dollars in drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   In return for laboratory funding and a 2% share of future drug
sales, the cancer center agreed that Genentech would own any patents
stemming from the Riggs and Itakura research.</TE>
<TE>   But the parties disagreed on whether the royalties should apply to
all drugs produced by third parties that had licensed the patents
from Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech claimed that the contract applied to only two drugs,
human growth hormone and human insulin, and that it had paid all
royalties owed on those drugs, a total of $305 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope claimed, and the jury agreed, that Genentech owed it
royalties on all drugs produced by Genentech licensees. Jurors agreed
with City of Hope's claim that Genentech concealed 27 licensing
agreements with 22 companies to avoid paying royalties to the cancer
center.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty is another blot on Genentech's corporate image. In
1999, it paid the University of California $200 million to settle a
patent case that claimed the company had used DNA taken from UC San
Francisco to develop human growth hormone--one of Genentech's key
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1999, the company paid $50 million to settle criminal
charges that it marketed human growth hormone for uses not approved
by the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   During five weeks of testimony, City of Hope emphasized the twin
themes of greed and deceit.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Morgan Chu accused former Genentech general counsel
Thomas Kiley and former Genentech Chairman Thomas Perkins of having
"recovered memories" when their testimonies contradicted their
statements in earlier depositions.</TE>
<TE>   Jury foreman Herman Askew said the majority of the jury did not
believe the Genentech executives who took the stand--many of whom
were called by City of Hope as adverse witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "What stood out most in our minds was--a lot of the Genentech
witnesses--we didn't believe their testimony," said Askew, a
supervisor for the Department of Water and Power. Askew said jurors
came to believe that Genentech was "hiding something or lying about
something."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict reflected the jury's opinion about which side was more
credible, Askew said. Jurors did not agree on a proper interpretation
of the contract itself, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still fuzzy to them. How is it going to be clear to us?"
Askew said. "It will always be unclear until someone sits down and
rewrites the contract."</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope received less than it wanted because jurors thought
the hospital could have been more vigilant, Askew said. The hospital
wanted compensatory damages of $457 million, in addition to higher
punitive damages. "City of Hope did not keep good records," Askew
said. "City of Hope had blame. They did not keep up with the money."</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in 1999, after Genentech refused to share the
settlement in a patent dispute with European drug maker Novo Nordisk
over human growth hormone. After filing its suit, the hospital found
that Genentech had licensed widely the Riggs-Itakura patents.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech said the licenses had been previously disclosed in news
releases and legal documents. It said City of Hope was not entitled
to royalties on products produced by third parties because the
hospital's scientists did not actually work on those drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts predicted the award would be reduced on appeal. They
said the punitive award was proportionate to the compensatory award,
an important legal test. However, nine-figure awards almost always
face judicial scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Courts are pretty skeptical of upholding those kinds of numbers,"
said Loyola Law School professor Richard L. Hasen. "How much is
needed to punish and deter and send a signal?"</TE>
<TE>   Besides filing an appeal, Genentech said it would ask Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Edward Y. Kakita to grant a new trial and
to reduce the punitive award.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kakita already has turned down several mistrial motions
by Genentech attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Johnston, Genentech senior vice president for intellectual
property, called prospects for a settlement "speculative."</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope has not decided how it will use the money, once it
receives it.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech royalties have gone to the cancer center's Beckman
Research Institute, which is headed by Riggs. Itakura is a scientist
there.</TE>
<TE>   The funding arrangement results from a lawsuit the scientists
filed against City of Hope in the early 1990s. They insisted that the
royalties be used for research and not to fund the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Krinsky said that if the money goes to Beckman, City of Hope could
reduce its financial support of the research institute. In fiscal
2000 Beckman received about $30 million from City of Hope, according
to its tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   "The money will go to City of Hope's charitable uses," he said,
which include patient care.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of City of Hope's settlement with the scientists also
gave them 10% of Genentech royalties, or about $30 million of the
amount Genentech already has paid City of Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Krinsky said the scientists, who sat through the daily court
proceedings, would share 10% of the contingency award, or another $30
million, but that no decision had been made on whether they would get
a piece of punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Riggs said Monday after the judgment that he would donate his
share to scientific and environmental charities, including City of
Hope.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not know why the scientists would not share in the
punitive award, but he said it had not been discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Itakura said his share "will go to science."</TE>
<TE>   The case is a huge win for City of Hope's Los Angeles law firm,
Irell &amp; Manella, which, according to American Lawyer, was among the
nation's 50 most profitable firms last year.</TE>
<TE>   Krinsky refused to say whether the cancer center agreed to pay its
lawyers on a contingency fee basis. Partial contingency arrangements
are not uncommon in commercial cases.</TE>
<TE>   Such fees can run from 10% to 20% of the award, whereas in
consumer cases, fees can be as high as 40%, said Joseph Calvo of the
National Law Review.</TE>

<HD>Hewlett-Packard Plans Line of Low-Cost Inkjet Printers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected today to introduce a line of bargain
printers, marking an aggressive push by the computer giant to
dominate the market for inkjet printers priced less than $100,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Palo Alto-based HP controlled 55% of the U.S. printer market as of
the end of April, but it had just 36% of the market for printers
priced less than $50, according to the latest figures available from
NPD Intelect, a market research firm in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Noting that the niche is "one area of the inkjet market where HP
has yet to dominate," Don Young, an analyst with UBS Warburg,
predicted HP could garner an additional $80 million to $100 million a
year on printer sales.</LD>
<TE>   The figure doesn't include sales of replacement ink cartridges,
which have especially high profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   HP executives declined to comment on the announcement, scheduled
to take place this morning at the opening of the PC Expo in New York.</TE>
<TE>   About 58% of inkjet printers sold in April cost less than $100,
according to NPD. Although HP has sold low-priced printers, it has
not been as good at squeezing out costs as its rivals, including
Lexmark and Epson, said Paul McGuckin, vice president of Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   More than one-fifth of HP's $81-billion annual revenue comes from
the sale of printers and ink cartridges. The business is widely
regarded as HP's crown jewel.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 56 cents to $15.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Tech Rally Pushes Stocks Back Up</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Late-session buying reverses broad sell-off, but
analysts see little chance of sustained rebound soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A burst of buying set off an afternoon tech rally on Wall Street on
Monday, reversing an earlier sell-off that sent the Nasdaq composite
index briefly below the closing low it reached after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Declining issues outnumbered winners on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange, an indication that the rally was less than
wholehearted. Still, the major indexes scored their first advances in
nearly a week.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the gains in part reflected buying by traders to
cover bets that stocks would fall further, rather than any
improvement in investor confidence. However, others noted that the
market had been sliding for five straight weeks, and was due for a
bounce.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we're sold out," UBS Warburg's head equity trader, Robert
Harrington, told Bloomberg News. "Maybe people will say, 'Hey, we've
discounted a lot of bad news because we've been down so much.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stocks fell throughout the morning, then turned abruptly higher
about 1 p.m. EDT.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-heavy Nasdaq closed up 19.38 points, or 1.3%, at
1,460.34, rebounding from an earlier decline of 26 points that put
the index nearly 9 points below its Sept. 21 close of 1,423.19. Sept.
21 marked the end of the first week of trading after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Other indexes also recovered. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which had
come within 5 points of its Sept. 21 close, advanced 3.58 points, or
0.4%, to 992.72. The Dow Jones industrial average, down 170 points
and facing its fourth straight triple-digit loss, rebounded to close
up 28.03 points, or 0.3%, at 9,281.82. The Dow remains more than
1,000 points above its Sept. 21 finish.</TE>
<TE>   Declining issues led advancers 3 to 2 on the NYSE and 5 to 4 on
Nasdaq. Trading was heavy.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow owed much of its comeback to its tech components,
including IBM, Microsoft and Intel. IBM rose 95 cents to $69.70
despite falling early in the session after Goldman Sachs reduced its
estimates on the stock because of difficult business conditions.
Microsoft climbed $1.88 to $54.16, and Intel rose 60 cents to $19.33.</TE>
<TE>   Still, tech investors were selective. Lucent Technologies dropped
6 cents to $2.28, and telecom giant Nortel lost 18 cents to $1.67
after UBS Warburg reduced its outlook for both companies.</TE>
<TE>   At least some of Monday's gains were attributed to what is known
as short covering.</TE>
<TE>   In a short sale a trader borrows stock and sells it, hoping to buy
it back at a cheaper price later. The repurchase is known as covering
a short position.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also said the market got a boost in the last 15 minutes
of trading as President Bush began a speech outlining his road map
for achieving Palestinian statehood.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' attention now turns to the Federal Reserve, which
begins a two-day meeting today. The central bank is widely expected
to leave its key short-term interest rate at a four-decade low of
1.75%, and many analysts say the fragile nature of the economic
recovery will keep rate rises at bay until November or beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Many Wall Street pros say they have little faith that a sustained
market rally can ensue, as investors remain dogged by fears about
anemic U.S. growth and corporate America's credibility amid a swirl
of scandals on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a show-me state of mind.... [Analyst] upgrades,
[strong] earnings and rosy outlooks are what the market is looking
for, and we have none of that right now," said Arnie Owen, managing
director of capital markets at Roth Capital Partners.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar, after falling early in the day,
closed higher against the yen and unchanged against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields rose as investors shifted money into stocks. The yield
on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.83% from 4.77% on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * European markets fell with the early sell-off in the U.S. Key
indexes lost 2.5% in Germany, 1.4% in Britain and 3.4% in France.</TE>
<TE>   * Much of Monday's rally came from the semiconductor group, with
the SOX index of chip stocks jumping 4%. In addition to Intel,
gainers in the group included Advanced Micro Devices, up 66 cents to
$8.70, and Broadcom, which added $1.22 to $20.24.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsemi of Irvine sank $5.28 to $7.95--a 40% loss--after the
chip maker said profit and sales for the current quarter would trail
earlier forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense contractor Raytheon slid $4.17 to $40.95 after the stock
was downgraded by Morgan Stanley to "underweight/attractive."</TE>

<HD>House Panel Widens Stewart Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Statements from a broker's assistant cast
doubt on whether a 'stop-loss order' was the trigger for the sale of
ImClone Systems stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators Monday were looking at new information
that appears to contradict what Martha Stewart and her now-suspended
broker have said about her sale of ImClone Systems Inc. stock.</LD>
<LD>   A House committee is interested in a widening circle of Stewart
acquaintances. The latest is a doctor who also sold shares of the
biotech company shortly before the government announced it had
rejected ImClone's approval application for the cancer drug Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, who commands a multimedia empire and a profitable
corporation, increasingly is under the glare of government scrutiny
and tabloid attention--bringing investor displeasure.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.,
plunged 21.4% to finish at $12.55 on Monday. Omnimedia stock is
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, of which Stewart recently
became a director.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Stewart's company have been battered since June 6, when
reports of the congressional investigation of her ImClone stock sale
surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Former ImClone Chief Executive Samuel Waksal, a friend of Stewart,
was arrested June 12 by FBI agents at his Manhattan apartment on
charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. Waksal invoked the 5th
Amendment the next day at a House hearing.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Peter Bacanovic, the Merrill Lynch broker shared by
Stewart, Waksal and Waksal's two daughters, and Bacanovic's assistant
were suspended with pay by the brokerage firm for what it called
"factual issues regarding a client transaction."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee are
examining whether Stewart had inside information when she sold nearly
4,000 shares of ImClone on Dec. 27, a day before the announcement
that the Food and Drug Administration had decided not to consider
Erbitux, an experimental drug that the company had touted as
miraculous in combating colorectal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Stewart's telephone log showed that Bacanovic
called her Dec. 27 and told her, according to her secretary's entry,
that he "thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward."</TE>
<TE>   That's curious because the stock had been declining for several
weeks, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House panel.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did Mr. Bacanovic call her on that particular day?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of his call, which is not yet known, is crucial.
Investigators want to know whether it occurred before or after
ImClone stock hit $60, the level at which Stewart has said she had a
standing order with Bacanovic to sell her shares.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators also want to look at Bacanovic's client list to
see whether others dumped ImClone stock before the FDA rejection
became publicly known.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission have been investigating possibly suspicious trading of
ImClone stock by several people.</TE>
<TE>   News of the FDA rejection brought a sell-off in ImClone shares.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has repeatedly said her trade was legal and based on
information available to the public at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic's assistant at Merrill Lynch, Douglas Faneuil, who
handled Stewart's ImClone sale, has given information to the firm
that appears to contradict what Stewart and Bacanovic maintain was
the trigger for the sale.</TE>
<TE>   They have said the stock was sold because of a previously arranged
order to dump the shares when ImClone fell below $60.</TE>
<TE>   Such a "stop-loss order," a common practice, would back up
Stewart's position that she didn't trade on inside information.</TE>
<TE>   But recent statements from Faneuil to Merrill Lynch legal
officials have cast doubt on whether such an order existed, the Wall
Street Journal reported Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional investigators are setting up interviews with
Bacanovic and Faneuil for this week, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   There is another discrepancy that has made them question whether
Stewart had a stop-loss order on the stock: Bacanovic has said he and
Stewart decided to put it in place on or after Dec. 10, whereas
Stewart told the investigators it took effect in late November.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out Stewart was not alone on the private jet she took
from Connecticut to San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, on Dec. 27, the day of
her stock sale. With her was Mariana Pasternak, the ex-wife of Bart
Pasternak, a doctor who sold 10,000 ImClone shares the next day,
before the company announced the FDA rejection.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators have interviewed Bart Pasternak and want to meet
with Mariana Pasternak, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   In what he called "another one of those strange coincidences" in
the ImClone affair, Johnson noted that Bacanovic had worked at
ImClone in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Bart Pasternak told the Associated Press on Saturday that he, his
ex-wife and Stewart had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly did not do anything that is under investigation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our friendship with Martha makes us the subject of questioning.
I'm absolutely convinced she did nothing wrong."</TE>

<HD>Boeing Wins Big Military Contract</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The deal for a new radio system, worth up to $7
billion, is a significant boost to operations in Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. won a significant Pentagon contract Monday--potentially
worth $6 billion to $7 billion--to develop a new generation of radios
that would allow forces on the land, sea and air to communicate more
quickly and easily.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. military strategists hope the system will dramatically
improve battlefield coordination between different military branches.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise boost to Southern California's defense industry,
Boeing's Seal Beach-based space and communications unit beat out
favorites General Dynamics Corp. and Raytheon Corp. for a contract
with an initial potential value of at least $2 billion. Follow-up
orders for additional radios and potential foreign sales could boost
value of the so-called Joint Tactical Radio System contract to as
much as $7 billion, Boeing executives said.</LD>
<TE>   It marked the second time this year that Boeing has won a major
Army contract after having historically focused on aerospace-related
contracts. In March, the company won the Future Combat Systems
contract with a potential value of at least $4 billion to design an
entire network of new weapons, communication systems and
intelligence-gathering sensors.</TE>
<TE>   "What is striking about this is that Boeing keeps winning
contracts that have traditionally been outside its domain," said
Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with Arlington, Va.-based think
tank Lexington Institute. "Boeing has basically been an aircraft
company with some space programs, but this tells you they are
successfully diversifying into areas where they weren't
well-established before."</TE>
<TE>   The contract represents a big boost locally, particularly to
Boeing's operations in Anaheim, which has been garnering increased
attention for developing battlefield command and control systems that
could revolutionizing the way battles are fought.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing engineers in Anaheim will spearhead the development of both
the radio technology and the Army's Future Combat System. Not far
west of Boeing's Anaheim facility along California 91, TRW Corp.
engineers in Carson will help integrate the radio system for ground
forces, Boeing said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're absolutely thrilled," said Allen Ashby, general manager for
Boeing's battle management and strategic systems business in Anaheim.
"This will be a critical part of the integrated battle space."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby said there would be an immediate need for about 200
engineers to work on the program and an additional 200 within 10
months.</TE>
<TE>   Under the contract, Boeing will develop a family of radios capable
of transmitting voice, video and data among all the military
services. The radios will not resemble the familiar military field
radios but rather will look like advanced cell phones, with displays
and e-mail capabilities. Radios in vehicles will more closely
resemble laptop computers.</TE>
<TE>   The radios will use a common software that will allow individual
soldiers on the battlefield to communicate with anyone else, whether
they're in a plane, armored vehicle or aboard a ship. The entire
system will resemble a mobile Internet system, providing secure
communications and strictly defined access for each radio.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, U.S. forces use a disparate system of radios and
frequencies that have hindered coordination. An infantry unit, for
instance, operates on one frequency, tanks on another and supporting
aircraft on yet a whole different system and frequency.</TE>
<TE>   Representing one of the most notorious cases of the military's
jumbled communication system, a soldier in the invasion of Grenada
had to use his personal telephone calling card at a local pay phone
to call in air support. The embarrassing scenario helped push efforts
to develop a common radio system.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to designing the system, Boeing will oversee
manufacturing of the initial 20,000 radio units, most of which will
be installed on vehicles and helicopters. The Pentagon sees making
100,000 units in the second round of the program, with a goal of
eventually fielding hand-held devices for individual infantrymen.</TE>
<TE>   The unit would not only be able to send and receive voice
communications but also e-mails as well as maps showing the locations
of both U.S. and enemy forces.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement was made after the markets closed. Boeing shares
were off 23 cents to $42.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>3 SUVs at Bottom of Rollover Ratings</HD>
<DH>Autos: In the crash tests by NHTSA, four vehicles received
the highest score with five stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche, two-door Ford Explorer and Land Rover
Discovery Series II 4x4 received the lowest rollover ratings among
the latest group of sport utility vehicles to be rated by the federal
government.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the vehicles received two out of a possible five stars
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The Explorer did well, however, in side-impact crash tests,
earning five stars for protection to the driver and passenger.</LD>
<TE>   The Toyota Sequoia and Saturn VUE each received three-star
rollover ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mathematical calculation," General Motors Corp. spokesman
Jay Cooney said in response to the ratings. "The Avalanche is a very
good vehicle with an excellent real-world safety record."</TE>
<TE>   Messages left at Ford Motor Co. were not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Rollover ratings are based on a vehicle's width and center of
gravity.</TE>
<TE>   The more top-heavy a vehicle is, the more likely it is to roll
over in a single-vehicle crash, according to NHTSA.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles with five-star ratings are said to have a less than 10%
chance of rolling over, while those with one star have a rollover
risk of greater than 40% in a single-vehicle crash.</TE>
<TE>   Because sport utility vehicles tend to be top heavy, they
generally receive lower ratings than passenger cars, which have lower
centers of gravity, NHTSA said.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Cadillac DeVille four-door, Ford Thunderbird convertible,
Hyundai Sonata four-door and Mitsubishi Eclipse two-door all received
five-star rollover ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Among 2003 models rated for rollover resistance, the Pontiac Vibe
four-door 4x4 and 4x2 and the Toyota Matrix four-door 4x4 and 4x2
received four stars.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 Toyota Corolla and Camry also received four stars.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Mazda MPV van earned five-star ratings in front- and
side-impact crash tests and a three-star rollover rating.</TE>
<TE>   In frontal-impact crash tests, the 2002 Ford Thunderbird
convertible earned four stars for protection to the driver and five
stars for the passenger.</TE>

<LD>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and a partner offered to buy Legrand,
the world's biggest maker of power switches, for $3.6 billion in
cash, a third less than what Schneider Electric paid last year.</LD>
<LD>   Kohlberg Kravis, a leveraged buyout firm, and Wendel
Investissement, a French holding company, entered into "exclusive"
talks with Schneider, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   European Union competition regulators had blocked Schneider's
purchase and ordered the company to sell. Schneider is appealing the
decision and success for Kohlberg Kravis and Wendel hinges on the

<LD>The Federal Trade Commission challenged Cytyc Corp.'s planned
$283-million purchase of medical-test rival Digene Corp., saying the
acquisition would threaten competition.</LD>
<LD>   The commission authorized its staff to seek a court order to block
the transaction. The purchase would allow Cytyc, the largest maker of
kits for Pap tests, to consolidate its dominance of the market for
cell-collection equipment used by medical-testing laboratories, the
FTC said.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC said it will seek to block the purchase until an
administrative law judge considers the agency's complaint.</LD>
<TE>   Digene shares fell 31 cents to $12.69, while Cytyc shares fell 24
cents to $11.46, both on Nasdaq. The FTC announced its challenge
after the close of regular trading.</TE>

<LD>The National Labor Relations Board has been too quick to accuse
companies of illegally suing unions, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The justices, overturning an NLRB policy that dates back two
decades, unanimously said a company doesn't violate federal labor law
simply by losing a lawsuit that was filed in retaliation for union
activity. The ruling was a victory for California industrial
contractor BE&amp;K Construction Co.</LD>
<LD>   The court said the 1st Amendment protects employers as long as
they had a "reasonable basis" for filing the suit.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. judge ended court supervision of Home Depot Inc.'s employment
practices after more than four years, finding "enthusiastic"
compliance with the settlement of a sex discrimination class-action
lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Susan Illston lifted a consent decree
requiring the world's largest home-improvement retailer to boost the
number of women it hires for higher-level store jobs. The judge said
she ended the order more than a year early because the Atlanta-based
company is meeting its goals.</LD>
<LD>   The $87.5-million accord ended a class-action bias suit that
claimed women were more likely to get cashier jobs than sales jobs at
Home Depot stores, which made it harder for them to win promotions to
supervisor or manager positions. In addition to paying $65 million to
about 6,000 female employees and ex-employees, the company agreed to
change its hiring practices.</LD>
<TE>   Home Depot shares rose $1 to $36.67 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>AOL Restructures Newhouse Cable Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. agreed to hand over management of cable systems
serving 2.1 million subscribers to Advance/Newhouse Communications
and take control of the money-losing Roadrunner Internet service
after the Newhouse family sought a restructuring of their
partnership.</LD>
<LD>   The shift will reduce Time Warner Cable customers by 16% to 10.8
million. If the change was made last year, sales would have been
lowered by $1.25 billion, or 3.3%, and cash flow would have been cut
by $570 million, or 5.8%, the cable operator said.</LD>
<LD>   AOL may have been forced to pay about $8 billion to keep the 2.1
million customers on its rolls if the company was unable to reach an
agreement with Advance/Newhouse, analysts have said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new pact, Newhouse later this year will assume control
of systems in Florida, Alabama, Indiana, Detroit and in Bakersfield
from AOL's Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable will continue to
provide certain services, including programming, to all cable systems
within the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The original pact was formed in 1995 to pool resources to create
stronger cable clusters.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner closed up 44 cents at $15.50 on the Big
Board before the news was released.</TE>

<HD>Pulling Back Pay Raises</HD>
<DH>Some workers will see growth of less than 4%, survey shows</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in nine years, many white-collar workers will get
pay raises of less than 4% in 2002, according to a report released
Monday. The Conference Board survey is the latest indication that
compensation gains are slowing, and raises concerns among economists
that smaller raises could dampen consumer spending and economic
growth.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of workers will get the traditional 4% pay increase,
but a larger share of employees will see lower raises this year than
they received in the last several years, according to the survey of
533 companies conducted by the New York-based, nonprofit business
research organization.</LD>
<LD>   "An increasing number, but not a majority, are going to be getting
less than 4%," said Charles Peck, compensation specialist for the
board. "That's a fairly significant comedown. For year after year,
hardly any company has been budgeting less than 4%."</LD>
<TE>   Peck said companies are pulling back because of the recent
economic downturn and uncertainty in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the Enron Corp. meltdown and other corporate
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Wage growth typically slows at the start of a recovery, economists
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Salary increases are a lagging economic indicator--a function of
what happened yesterday as opposed to today," said Sung Won Sohn,
chief economist for Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "Employees and labor unions are
reluctant to demand higher wages when the labor market is so soft,
and businesses are reluctant to hire people."</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board report added to worries that the strong
consumer spending that has buoyed the economy may not be sustainable.</TE>
<TE>   Slower wage gains "limit buying power," Sohn said. "It helps hold
down inflation, but also it keeps economic growth modest, and that
means you tend to have a jobless recovery. It limits ability to spend
money, so demand is limited."</TE>
<TE>   Of the three employee categories listed by the Conference
Board--executive, exempt, and nonexempt--the lowest-paid group is
bearing the brunt of the salary retrenchment. The typical pay hike
for clerical workers will drop this year to an average of 3.7% in all
six industries surveyed: banking, services, insurance, manufacturing,
trade and utilities.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, executive pay raises are holding steady across the
board at 4% this year. The picture is mixed for managers, supervisors
and professionals who are falling back in manufacturing, trade and
utilities, but holding firm in other industries.</TE>
<TE>   Shrinking pay raises come after many companies have imposed
layoffs and hiring freezes. Bonuses have been slashed, and many stock
options are underwater. Still, with inflation expected to rise 1.5%
this year, even secretaries will come out ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a nice little buffer, a real earnings gain," Peck said.
"People look at 4% and say that's pretty paltry, but inflation is
1.5%. That makes a real difference."</TE>
<TE>   Employers surveyed said they anticipated returning to median pay
hikes of 4% in 2003, but real gains will shrink if inflation rises
2.6% as projected.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Conference Board survey does not look at the wage
trends of blue-collar workers, but government statistics indicate
slowdowns there as well, said Lawrence Michel, an economist and vice
president of the Employment Policy Institute, a Washington-based
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the consequence of the higher unemployment," Michel said.
"Workers don't have the ability to push their case with their
employers, so the companies are able to set the wage growth low.
We've already seen it in blue-collar workers."</TE>
<TE>   Slower wage and salary growth may help corporate bottom lines, but
it comes at a price, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumption has been holding up the economy, so less wage growth
may dampen consumption," Michel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Other elements of demand are faltering. We really need
consumption growth to generate a strong recovery. If wage growth
slows down, that will hurt perhaps the speed of the recovery."</TE>

cents to 6 cents and analysts' average estimate of 5 cents. Revenue
should come in at $200 million to $215 million, rather than the
$238.5 million analysts forecast, it said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana chip maker Microsemi Corp. slashed its fiscal third-quarter
earnings outlook, blaming weaker-than-expected sales to the aerospace
and computer industries. Its stock plunged 40% on the news.</LD>
<LD>   Microsemi, which specializes in analog and mixed-signal
semiconductors for military applications, said it expects to earn 4
cents to 5 cents a share for the quarter ending June 30, down from an
estimate, given in April, of 9 cents to 11 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue is expected to total $51 million to $52 million, down from
the company's previous outlook of $56 million to $58 million.</LD>
<TE>   The company blamed its lowered outlook on tepid demand in the
commercial aircraft, commercial space, computers and mobile-handsets
markets, as well as a delay in expected growth in its military
business.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects the trend to extend into the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Microsemi shares fell $5.28, to $7.95 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. is planning a new project to improve security by
creating within its Windows software a virtual "vault" where
customers would conduct electronic transactions and store sensitive
information.</LD>
<LD>   The effort, called Palladium, would require consumers to buy new
computers and other devices equipped with ultra-secure computer chips
from Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which already are
involved in the project, or other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The project's success depends on broad consumer adoption of such
devices, since these highly secure computers could safely exchange
information only among themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft said the technology, which stemmed from early work by
its engineers to deliver digital movies that couldn't be pirated,
won't be available for at least 18 months. Company officials have
told other executives in private briefings they do not expect to see
mainstream products for at least five years.</TE>

<HD>Temporary Agencies See Signs of Recovering Demand</HD>
<DH>Labor: Requests from defense, finance firms are especially
strong as more skilled workers take short-term jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Employers wary about the nation's weak economic recovery are
understandably reluctant to add many permanent workers.</LD>
<LD>   The answer: Add temporary workers.</LD>
<LD>   Staffing firms say they've seen demand for temps begin to pick up
in recent weeks, after slumping from late 2000 through early this
year during the recession.</LD>
<TE>   Demand has been particularly strong in finance and defense, said
Colin Bennett, an economist with the Employment Policy Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "[Employers] let people go because of how poor the economy was.
They bring our people on first because they're not sure if it's
stable," said Jeffrey Joerres, chief executive of Manpower Inc., one
of the nation's largest temporary-employment companies.</TE>
<TE>   The recent pickup in demand for temps could contribute to the
longer-term growth of temporary work and the broadening of such work
beyond traditional clerical fields, temp agency officials say.</TE>
<TE>   More workers in such areas as computer programming and engineering
have been turning to temporary work to earn a paycheck, said Alec
Levenson, a professor at the Center for Effective Organizations at
USC's Marshall School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   But getting a temp job can be difficult because though demand for
temp workers recently began rising, staffing agencies have not yet
started to hire more workers.</TE>
<TE>   The number of temps and contractors employed at staffing firms had
declined since late 2000 during the recession, although the cuts have
slowed, according to the American Staffing Assn.'s most recent
survey.</TE>
<TE>   "We've certainly got a big pool to draw from nowadays," said Sue
Foigelman, manager for Manpower in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Foigelman said, her office would do a series of
skills tests for anyone who came in. Now, there is so much
competition that many people seeking temporary work are not even
given an application.</TE>
<TE>   The large pool of applicants means that employers have a more
highly skilled group of temps to choose from, including older and
more experienced workers.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Reilly, 39, lost his job as an office manager in September
"and just struggled to find work" for months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has temped between jobs for more than 10 years and found a
temporary position in Irvine at Jostra-Bentley Corp. three months
ago. That recently led to a permanent job as accounts receivable
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "You can shop around until you find something that you like,"
Reilly said. "That's what's always lured me toward going to a
temporary agency."</TE>
<TE>   More accounting and information technology professionals also are
going the temp route than in the past, Levenson said. Most are
seeking a permanent job, but others have no intention of finding one.</TE>
<TE>   "You love the freedom, the independence," said Steven Pfrenzinger,
who left a job as a computer programmer with dreams of becoming a
writer and a public speaker on the side--which he did, while doing
temporary work for three years. He later started a staffing and
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Rowland Heights resident Jimmy Moore has done consulting and
temporary work for 22 years for 45 companies--by choice--in the Los
Angeles area. He thinks as much as 40% of people who try temping stay
with it, and he calls permanent workers "captive employees."</TE>
<TE>   But Jeff Davis, an Oceanside, Calif., resident who left middle
management at a pharmaceutical company to work in three- to six-month
spurts as a computer programmer and developer, warned that temping
isn't for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   In his field, "when you come into a contract position, often it's
a situation where they're having a real problem. They're looking for
someone to come in and clean up the mess," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   And though a couple of years ago he could fetch $80 an hour, now
it's closer to $50 as demand for his talents has waned.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts believe that the longer-term trend toward more use of
temp workers will continue.</TE>
<TE>   The number of temporary workers employed by staffing agencies has
increased steadily from 907,000 on an average day nationwide in early
1992 to 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2000, according to the
American Staffing Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "You're finding more and more use of temps on a regular basis ...
with the increase in companies trying to minimize how much they
spend, to try to limit their head count to only the people they
actually need on hand," Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Some labor groups object to the trend because temps sometimes
receive less pay, benefits, job stability and control in the
workplace.</TE>
<TE>   But David Lewin, a professor of management and human resources at
the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, said much of the growth in
temporary work was fueled by people who do it by choice.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of temporary work is actually going to increase because
both sides want it," Lewin said.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary agencies are optimistic that business will continue to
improve in the coming months. Until recently, gloomy expectations
meant companies were reluctant to spend even on temporary workers,
Foigelman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really only the last month or two that I've really seen some
stronger indications," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But in certain niche areas, the demand for temporary workers has
remained strong.</TE>
<TE>   Aerospace is a bright spot. More government spending on defense
and intelligence has helped boost the outlook for defense
contractors, economist Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Schimmel, human resources manager for defense contractor
Cartwright Electronics in Fullerton, is using more temps because
contracts have kept the company busy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been no drop-offs," Schimmel said.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank-based employment agency OnStaff has seen dramatic
increases in demand in some areas, President Jeffrey Evans said.
OnStaff saw requests for debt collectors quadruple last quarter,
compared with a year earlier, and also had a pickup in requests for
accountants and financial analysts.</TE>
<TE>   One thing has remained consistent in the last year, however.</TE>
<TE>   In information technology, "jobs are still scarce, very scarce,"
temp worker Moore said. "But the ones that are opening up are for
temps."</TE>

<HD>To Russia With Theaters (and Digital Sound)</HD>
<DH>Media: National Amusements, Viacom's parent company, plans
to enter the Moscow market by building a modern multiplex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Amusements Inc., the parent company of media giant Viacom
Inc., plans to build and operate the largest modern multiplex in
Moscow, becoming the first major U.S. theater chain to venture into
Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The 11-screen theater complex, which will feature state-of-the-art
screens, digital sound and stadium seating for 3,500, is expected to
open next spring under the name KinoStar.</LD>
<LD>   The project is a joint venture between National Amusements--the
Dedham, Mass.-based theater circuit headed by President Shari
Redstone--and exhibition entrepreneur Paul Heth. The two also are
partners in the Bridge Cinema in Los Angeles and the soon-to-open
second Bridge location in Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   The Moscow theater will be located at Mega, a development of IKEA
Russia, which will be billed as the largest family retail and
entertainment center in Russia when it opens in December.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone said this is the first of a series of cinema ventures she
and Heth are pursuing in the Moscow area under their newly formed
outfit, Rising Star Media. Heth is an expert on the Russian cinema
market, operating three single-screen theaters in Moscow during the
mid- to late 1990s, including the first Western-style cinema that was
the highest-grossing complex in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, whose closely held National Amusements owns and operates
1,400 screens in the United States, Britain and South America, said
she believes that Heth's hands-on experience in Russia and her
company's expertise as a major international multiplex operator will
result in expanding what has long been an under-performing territory
for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to open the market for the U.S. studios," said Redstone,
whose father, Sumner Redstone, heads Viacom, with entertainment
assets including Paramount Pictures, CBS Television, MTV Networks and
Blockbuster Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Heth said that when he first embarked on the theater business in
Moscow in 1993, the total box-office gross for the country was about
$1 million. Last year, it was about $74 million, and it is expected
to climb this year to $90 million to $110 million.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone said that she and Heth and his core team of executives at
Rising Star will work closely with their new Russian landlord IKEA
and National Amusements' sister company MTV to run various movie
promotion campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to exhibiting American-made movies, the Moscow theater
will showcase Russian films.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a lot of Russian production," Redstone said. "We
hope this will stimulate more of that."</TE>
<TE>   Redstone said that Heth, who began his career in Moscow and has
been instrumental in helping to revitalize the Russian cinema sector,
first approached her about doing business there in 1994. But "the
timing wasn't right," said Redstone, who only recently had taken the
reins at National Amusements.</TE>
<TE>   This April, however, Redstone went to Moscow on a three-day
"massive due diligence" tour, meeting with bankers, local
distributors, vendors, government officials and others to size up the
market. She said she was impressed with what she learned.</TE>
<TE>   "What I found was that people in Russia have a fascination with
American film product and they love going to the movies," Redstone
said.</TE>
<TE>   She found Moscow to be a "very sophisticated, first-class city
where people have a high-quality lifestyle--why shouldn't they have a
first-class movie-going venue?"</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Redstone and Heth are realistic about the numerous
difficulties they will face, including cultural differences, currency
and tax issues, language barriers and banking and legal systems that
are underdeveloped compared with those in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a land of opportunity without challenges," Redstone
said.</TE>

<HD>American Airlines to Abolish Paper Tickets by End of 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines said Monday that it plans to stop issuing paper
tickets by the end of 2003 and start charging a $20 fee for them next
month if buyers qualify for an electronic version.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest airline said it will eliminate paper tickets
for U.S. flights by March and for other service by the end of next
year to cut costs. American plans to put self-service ticket machines
in 70 of its 170 U.S. airports, double the current number, spokesman
Todd Burke said.</LD>
<LD>   American and other major U.S. carriers have lost billions of
dollars since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as air-travel demand
declined. Continental Airlines Inc. in November said it would charge
$10 to cover processing costs if customers chose paper tickets when
an electronic version was available.</LD>
<TE>   American's ticket change is part of the carrier's "reexamination
and refinement of its business model," an effort Chief Executive Don
Carty said earlier this month is aimed at saving money to stem
losses. The company didn't say how much the move is expected to save.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AMR Corp., American's parent, fell 5 cents to $17.60 on

<HD>Tobacco Stocks Fall on Lawsuit Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Philip Morris Cos. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc.
plunged anew Monday, after the tobacco industry's latest legal defeat
increased speculation that cigarette makers' litigation costs will
rise.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge John Lungstrum on Friday ordered Reynolds to
pay $15 million to a Kansas smoker, saying the company "concealed the
addictive nature of tobacco." Lungstrum's punitive-damage award was
76 times greater than the $196,416 of damages levied by the jury in
the case.</LD>
<LD>   The award is the first involving punitive damages against a
tobacco company in more than a decade by a federal court, where
standards of establishing proof are higher than on the state level.
That typically has favored the tobacco companies.</LD>
<TE>   The decision also was the first courtroom victory for an
individual smoker in the Midwest against the industry, which recently
has lost cases in Oregon, California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people had felt the litigation picture overall was going to
be improving," said Arthur Cecil, an analyst at money management firm
T. Rowe Price Associates, which owns Reynolds and Philip Morris
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds stock (ticker symbol: RJR) dived $5.85, or 9.5%, to
$55.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris (MO) sank $3.85,
or 7.3%, to $48.80, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Also sliding Monday were British American Tobacco (BTI), down $1
to $21.97 on the American Stock Exchange; and Imperial Tobacco Group
(ITY), down $2.03 to $30.97 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Both Reynolds and Philip Morris shares had been among the
better-performing blue-chip issues this year, until recent sessions.
That may have contributed to investors' rush to sell and lock in
profits, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But the underlying fear is that the industry will face a new wave
of damage awards.</TE>
<TE>   "While we haven't seen a dramatic pickup in individual trial cases
[against cigarette makers], it could happen," said analyst Matt
Spitznagle at Northern Trust Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies have lost five verdicts in a row on the West
Coast, with awards ranging from $21.7 million to $100 million. All of
the decisions are being appealed by the companies.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the industry last week was told by a Miami jury to pay $5.5
million to a flight attendant who claims second-hand smoke on
airlines caused her breathing problems.</TE>
<TE>   In the 3 1/2 years since cigarette manufacturers reached the
$206-billion settlement of health-care claims with U.S. states, the
majority of individual suits had been decided in the companies'
favor. In the settlement with the states, the companies agreed to
limit advertising and pay for a foundation to reduce teen smoking if
the states didn't sue over the industry's past behavior.</TE>
<TE>   For investors willing to take the risk, the tobacco stocks'
dividend yields--annual cash dividend divided by the stock price--are
surging as the shares fall. RJR's yield is 6.8%. Philip Morris' yield
is 4.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Those yields are far above the 1.59% average dividend yield of
stocks in the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, and higher than
what shorter-term Treasury securities pay. The yield on two-year U.S.
Treasury notes, for example, is 2.9%.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shares Fall Despite Asset Sale</HD>
<DH>Media: Cutting stake in Vivendi Environnement worries
investors. Analysts say steep drop puts pressure on Messier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Vivendi Universal on Monday announced details of a plan to pull
back from the water business in a move to cut its debts, investors
continued to give its management a vote of no confidence, pushing
down the company's share price to a new low.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi said Monday that it will begin selling up to 15.6% of its
water services utility, Vivendi Environnement, the world's largest
water company. The subsidiary also plans to sell new shares worth 1.5
billion euros beginning July 4.</LD>
<LD>   The transactions were first announced last week as part of a plan
to help Vivendi lower its debt by as much as $1.65 billion and reduce
Vivendi Universal's overall stake in Vivendi Environnement from 63%
to 42%, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier had hoped it would send a
signal to investors that Vivendi was aggressively lowering its
$30-billion debt, which has been criticized as excessive by analysts
and credit rating agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But the details of the plan, combined with other unwelcome news
Monday, did little to dampen investor concerns.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. shares of Vivendi Universal fell 14.7%, down $3.41, to
$19.80. Shares of Vivendi Environnement fell 11.3%, off $3.59, to
$28.11, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Vivendi shares were
suspended twice in Paris on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The steep drop puts more pressure on Messier, who is losing the
support of investors over his strategy and the company's debt load.
He meets with the company's board of directors today during a
regularly scheduled meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Investors initially welcomed Vivendi's plans to scale back its
investment in the water business, transactions that the company said
would only occur when market conditions were ripe. When the
restructuring happened sooner than many expected, it raised questions
about whether the company faces a cash crunch, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's concern in the market that Vivendi did this because they
are facing a liquidity crisis," said Mark Harrington, an analyst with
J.P. Morgan &amp; Chase. "My view is that's very unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has about $11 billion of non-core assets it could sell off
to cover its financial needs, Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi declined to comment on the stock price slide but has
denied facing any cash squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the uncertainty analysts said, were reports that Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. may not buy Vivendi's Italian pay-TV arm
Telepiu, a deal which could help reduce Vivendi's debt.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Tumbles After Downgrade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. stock plunged to a 12-year low Monday after Salomon
Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman, once one of the company's biggest
Wall Street advocates, recommended investors avoid shares of the
second-largest U.S. long-distance firm.</LD>
<LD>   With the stock already down more than 90% since December, Grubman
cut his rating on WorldCom to "underperform" from "neutral." In April
he stopped recommending investors buy the stock for the first time in
more than four years.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom stock, which fell 31 cents to 91 cents on Nasdaq, may be
delisted if it trades under $1 for 30 straight days.</LD>
<TE>   Some investors doubt WorldCom can survive unless the company
repays $30 billion in debt, secures new loan terms and sees increased
spending on its services by businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we see that kind of turnaround, the stock is going to keep
going down," said John Maxwell, a telecommunications analyst at
Waddell &amp; Reed Financial Inc.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's stock close, WorldCom's market value was $2.7 billion.
The company once was worth $115 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers, who built the Clinton,
Miss.-based company with more than 75 acquisitions in 17 years,
resigned in April under pressure from WorldCom's board. The
resignation came after the Securities and Exchange Commission
launched an investigation into a $412-million loan the company made
to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon's Grubman cut his 2002 sales estimate for WorldCom to
$19.6 billion from $20.2 billion, saying business spending on
telecommunications services may be less than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there is a risk of WorldCom lowering guidance again,"
he said in a report.</TE>
<TE>   He also said WorldCom may undergo a recapitalization to lower debt
that would "significantly dilute equity holders." He wasn't more
specific.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman has long been bullish on the telecommunications sector and
has attracted controversy for what some critics have said was a
too-close relationship in the late-1990s with management of failed
telecom firm Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>

<HD>Investor Confidence Index at 9-Month Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investor confidence has crumbled right along with the stock market
this month, according to a poll released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Index of Investor Optimism, based on a monthly survey of U.S.
investors' outlook for the financial markets, fell in June to 72,
down from 90 in May and its lowest reading since September.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, a joint effort of financial services firm UBS and
pollster Gallup Organization, was conducted during the first two
weeks of June. The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 6%
during that period and has continued to slide since.</LD>
<TE>   The confidence index bottomed at 50 in September. It rebounded
along with the markets in late 2001 and early 2002, reaching a recent
peak of 121 in March. Since then, stock prices and investor
confidence have been battered by a daunting combination of corporate
accounting scandals, escalating Middle East violence, repeated
terrorist warnings and mixed signals about the health of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that only 38% of those polled were optimistic
about the prospects for financial markets during the next 12 months,
down from 46% in May. And 40% said stocks were less attractive as an
investment than they were six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, 59% said they viewed real estate as a more attractive
investment than they did six months ago, reflecting the continued
rise in home prices and the comparatively strong performance of real
estate investment trusts.</TE>
<TE>   Two other areas that have outperformed stocks this year--bonds and
gold--got a less enthusiastic reception. Only 35% of investors said
bonds were more attractive than they were six months ago, and 28%
thought the same of gold.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies held steady at
89% of those who had an opinion. The Fed begins a two-day meeting
today, and two-thirds of the investors surveyed thought the Fed would
leave its key short-term interest rate unchanged at a 40-year low of
1.75%. That mirrors Wall Street's expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The survey each month asks investors what level of returns they
expect on their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest survey, investors with less than five years'
experience in the market said they expected their portfolios to
return an average of almost 16% in the next year. Investors with more
than 20 years' experience were expecting a much more modest 7%
return.</TE>
<TE>   The UBS/Gallup investor confidence index was established in
October 1996 with a baseline of 124. It is based on a telephone
survey of 1,000 randomly selected private investors. The index peaked
at 178 in January 2000 as the 1990s bull market was nearing its
crest.</TE>

<LD>LeapFrog Enterprises Inc., a developer of interactive-learning tools

<LD>   LeapFrog, which develops educational software geared toward young
children, will remain majority-owned by Knowledge Universe, a firm
controlled by Ellison and the Milken brothers, Michael and Lowell,
after the offering.</LD>

<HD>Jobs Center, County Square Off Over Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a Catch-22 that could lead to the collapse of an El Monte-based
job-training center, the county and the center owe each other money,
but neither is willing to be the first to write a check.</LD>
<LD>   The result: The Mid San Gabriel Valley Consortium could lose all
county funding.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Department of Community and Senior Services
said the consortium was given almost $1 million in "excessive
revenue" that the training center has not accounted for.</LD>
<TE>   The center said it would gladly give the county the money, and
would certainly have the money to pay if the county first reimbursed
the agency for services it provided clients last year. The county
countered that the center has to pay its debt first.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to do is clean up this mess," said Eudora Ang,
the consortium's finance and human resources manager. "We told the
county we have stopped all the practices of the past. It's time to
fix it and move on."</TE>
<TE>   Ang, who started working at the consortium in January after the
fiscal year in question ended, said previous managers overbilled the
county each month to provide a cushion for the next month. The money,
she said, can easily be deducted from the money owed the consortium
for this fiscal year. She said new record-keeping procedures will
prevent future overbilling.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium's job-training center is used by about 2,800 mostly
working-class people a month--people like El Monte resident Rachel
Topete.</TE>
<TE>   Topete, a 47-year-old mother of grown children, is unhappy with
her job. Hoping to find a position in a factory, she went to the
consortium to use its resources.</TE>
<TE>   "This is cool. I'm going to bring my husband tomorrow," Topete
said Friday as she surfed a job-search Web site. Topete, who had
never used a computer before, said job-searching at the consortium is
a lot easier than scanning the classifieds and pounding the pavement.
The agency "gives people access to computers, faxes, lists of jobs.
It's nice."</TE>
<TE>   The county gave the consortium until Aug. 15 to pay off a $979,018
debt incurred when an audit, covering the 2000-01 fiscal year, found
that the agency has been overbilling the county for services.</TE>
<TE>   The first installment of that payment, $489,509, was due June 15,
but the county received only $180,000 and a request for a revised
payment plan, said Adine Forman, a spokeswoman for the county
department.</TE>
<TE>   Although the county rejected the consortium's request for a new
payment plan, it gave the agency until today to pay the remainder of
$309,509.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do not receive a payment of $309,509 by June 25," Forman
said, "we will take appropriate administrative and/or legal action to
recover the full amount overpaid to the consortium, as well as
consider other potential actions, including but not limited to
terminating their existing contractual relationship with the county."</TE>
<TE>   The consortium is contracted to provide services to the county
department's clients. The county then reimburses the agency for its
services. If the contract is voided, the consortium could lose its
primary source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the $6.5 million the consortium is set to receive from the
county for the 2001-02 year, the consortium receives about $14,000 a
month in fees billed to schools that use the agency's crossing-guard
program, Ang said. The money is mostly for salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium provides services in El Monte, South El Monte,
Baldwin Park and elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>Tollway Price Is Fair, OCTA Says</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Buying a 10-mile stretch along the
Riverside Freeway for $207.5 million is justified, and revenue will
cover debts, agency directors say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Monday defended its
offer of $207.5 million to buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes,
a controversial tollway that has been blamed for aggravating
congestion on the heavily traveled Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a fair price," said Arthur T. Leahy, OCTA's chief
executive officer and chief negotiator in the pending sale. "Demand
for the road is very high and projected revenue will cover its
debts."</LD>
<LD>   To help explain the proposed sale price, the agency's board of
directors on Monday released thousands of pages of studies assessing
the roadway's value. This was in response to a public records request
by the Los Angeles Times and the Orange County Register.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal of this board is to build public confidence that the
decisions made thus far ... have been made after a thoughtful and
deliberative analysis," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who chairs the
OCTA board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway, built for about $135 million in the mid-1990s, runs
for 10 miles in the median of the Riverside Freeway from north
Anaheim to Riverside County. There are two lanes in each direction.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale goes through, the county agency would assume tollway
debts and pay California Private Transportation Co. $72.5 million, a
healthy profit given the company's initial investment.</TE>
<TE>   Some at OCTA board meetings have questioned whether it is a fair
price for an operation that has had trouble turning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fine that OCTA wants to control the road," said Eric Norby
of Laguna Beach, who helped with the successful supervisorial
campaign of his brother Chris Norby. "I just want to make sure the
price is supported by third-party evaluations and that OCTA is not
paying too much."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus to buy the lanes is the desire to end the tollway's
controversial non-compete agreement with Caltrans that barred the
highway agency from widening or making significant improvements to
the Riverside Freeway that could cut into the company's toll fees.
The Riverside Freeway is one of the most crowded routes in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   After months of negotiation, OCTA announced in late April an
agreement with the tollway's owners. The sale is contingent upon an
OCTA evaluation of the company's financial records and contracts. The
state Legislature also must grant OCTA the power to charge tolls. The
parties hope to complete the sale by September.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say they will operate the Express Lanes as a
tollway and use the revenue to pay off its bonds. The authority, with
cooperation from Riverside County, also plans to begin long-awaited
improvements to relieve congestion on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed sale price is based on an analysis by the accounting
firm of Ernst &amp; Young, research by OCTA's financial staff, and a
separate OCTA comparison of the costs to build a similar project
today.</TE>
<TE>   Using a range of traffic and revenue projections, Ernst &amp; Young
concluded that the Express Lanes are worth an estimated $202 million
to $220 million. An OCTA study valued them at $210 million to $215
million. The construction comparison concluded that it would cost
about $200 million today to build 10 miles of 4-lane highway.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative financial estimates by OCTA indicate that the Express
Lanes will provide ample revenue so the authority can pay the
interest and principal on the tollway's bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning it will be a little bit tight," said Kirk Avila,
OCTA's treasury and public finance manager. "But in the long run,
revenues will be going up, there will be some inflation affecting
operating costs, and debt service will remain flat."</TE>
<TE>   Given the region's projected population growth, the studies
indicate that there will be increasing demand for the Express Lanes
and the Riverside Freeway, the only major highway link between the
Inland Empire and Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA estimates that from 2003 to 2025 annual revenue for the
Express Lanes will increase from about $26 million to about $64
million. Operating costs and capital improvements will rise from more
than $10 million a year to about $26.5 million. Meanwhile, interest
and principal payments will remain about $12 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials further justified the sale price by comparing
OCTA's actual costs of designing and constructing car pool lanes in a
center divider equal in length to the tollway. Researchers also
relied on carpool lane costs from the Southern California Assn. of
Governments.</TE>

<LD>I wrote about the vacation find of Wally Schultz of Rancho Cucamonga:
an Italian restaurant where visitors are required to deposit their
cell phones in small lockers. It's for la tranquillita di tuti,
naturally.</LD>
<LD>   Well, Robert Helfman of L.A. recalled seeing a more impromptu type
of cell phone control at Millie's in Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   "Millie's menu has a one-line 'No Phones' caveat prominently
shown," he said. "One morning, a friend and I observed a 20ish couple
sit down at a table. The woman's cell phone rang, and she pulled it
out and started talking.</LD>
<TE>   "All the servers clustered around her table like crazed Wagnerian
Harpies and began chanting, 'No phones! No phones!' " Helfman
continued. "Within seconds, all the other patrons gleefully took up
the cry. The woman looked around, gave us all a mad-dog stare and a
one-digit salute, and stomped out to the sidewalk to finish her
conversation." She still couldn't let go of that phone, though!</TE>
<TE>   Easy for them to say: Cy Baumann of Irvine found another one of
those instructional signs that can challenge the tranquillita of the
daily commute (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Dieters beware: Mary Jane Linder of La Canada saw a warning in one
restaurant that, if read the wrong way, could result in quite a mad
scramble, what with the diners grabbing for each other's food (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Annals of strange crimes: Phyllis Waggner of West Hollywood sent
along a prowler/burglary report from the Palisadian-Post about a
suspect who was confronted after a break-in.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a bad person--please do not scream," the intruder said
before fleeing. No property was taken.</TE>
<TE>   The report described him as a 30ish male "dressed as a woman."</TE>
<TE>   This litigious trend has gone too far: Dan Fetterly of Van Nuys
noticed a "shocking" statement in a product label (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Secessionist songbook: Don Barrett's laradio.com Web site reprised
some of the titles that the Only in L.A. column said could serve as
anthems for (or against) the San Fernando Valley independence
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   But a couple of Barrett's readers challenged my inclusion of "L.A.
Breakdown," the old Jack Jones recording, as inspirational stuff for
the breakaway effort.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed out that the lyric actually is "L.A., break down and
let me in." Curses! My fiendish plot to infiltrate the secessionist
movement with anti-secessionist songs has been uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Richard Showstack of Newport Beach would confer a
"Duh!" Award on the car company whose television commercial shows an
SUV swimming underwater with sharks. The caption reads:

<HD>Padilla Opposes City Borough Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla on Monday said he is
against placing on the November ballot a plan to carve the city into
boroughs as an alternative to secession by the San Fernando Valley
and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech to a downtown business group, Padilla drew applause
from most in the audience when he laid out arguments against
secession. But he said the borough plan would confuse voters and add
layers of government.</LD>
<LD>   "More politicians?" Padilla said at the Los Angeles Current
Affairs Forum. "Is that what the public wants?.... We should not rush
into putting a hastily written measure on the ballot."</LD>
<TE>   Padilla has been skeptical of the borough plan since competing
proposals were presented several weeks ago by Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel and Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks). Monday, he
made his opposition clear, weakening the proposals' prospects for
getting council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he does not believe voters will look kindly on the
Hertzberg plan, which would split the city into nine boroughs, each
with five council members. The resulting council would have 45
members, three times the current number.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he noted, voters have rejected proposals to
expand the county Board of Supervisors and increase the number of Los
Angeles council members.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said Greuel's proposal seems rushed. It calls for creation
of a commission that would draft a specific borough plan within a
year, then place it on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg said later that he did not count Padilla among the
supporters of his proposal. Eight council members must approve
putting the borough plan before the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "During these difficult times for our city," Hertzberg said, "I
had hoped he'd be more open to an idea that responds to the
legitimate concerns of the voters of the Valley, whom we both
represent."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel spokesman Matt Szabo said, "The councilwoman has great
faith in the voters' ability to see what is best for our city
government."</TE>

<CX>   Boroughs--A story in some editions of Tuesday's California section
said that a proposed borough system for Los Angeles would result in a
45-member City Council. Under the proposal, each of nine boroughs
actually would have its own five-member board that would deal with
local issues. Citywide matters would be handled by a board of nine
borough presidents.</CX>

<DH>Academy: Activists see dream of a charter school on the
Eastside grow into a reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a college student, Marcos Aguilar joined a hunger strike to help
establish a Chicano studies department at UCLA. The goal: to offer
Mexican American students an environment and courses sensitive to
their cultural background.</LD>
<LD>   As a schoolteacher a decade later, his effort to found a charter
school did not require such dramatic tactics.</LD>
<LD>   But when he opens up a former Masonic Lodge in El Sereno as an
elementary school for 160 children in September, the Academia
Semillas del Pueblo will mark the second chapter in Aguilar's efforts
to provide education that embraces the students' heritage.</LD>
<TE>   The six founders of Semillas include Aguilar's wife and elementary
schoolteacher, Minnie Ferguson, and UCLA history professor Juan Gomez
Quinones--and others involved in the high-profile battle that led to
the founding of the Cesar Chavez Center for Chicana and Chicano
Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Organizing the charter school after having organized the Chicano
studies center," said Aguilar, 32, "is kind of like picking up where
we left off."</TE>
<TE>   Academia Semillas del Pueblo--Seeds of the Town Academy--will be
the first start-up, independent charter school on the Eastside under
the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The academy presents the founders, dissatisfied with public
schools, a chance to provide a quality education in a part of the
city riddled with low-performing elementary and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Their "alternative, community-based and culturally sensitive"
approach to education will focus on learning being "purposeful,
social and transformative," said Aguilar, who last taught social
studies at Garfield High School.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of the system include teaching four languages. Besides
the English reading, writing and math standards required by law,
Spanish, Mandarin and Nahuatl--an indigenous language once spoken by
people throughout the Southwest and Mexico--will also be taught.</TE>
<TE>   The academy will also nurture critical thinking skills that
incorporate indigenous ways of looking at the world, which is the
heritage of many of the students in the mostly Latino community,
Aguilar said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Aguilar said, the indigenous ideal of everyone in a
community participating in its governance will be practiced at the
academy: It will count heavily on parents' advice on key decisions
about the school's curriculum and direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not following something we bought and paid for two months
ago with a grant," he said. "What we are developing is a living,
breathing way of teaching as a community."</TE>
<TE>   Despite emphasizing a culturally sensitive approach to education,
the key mission of the school, to nurture high performers who can
succeed in college, is not lost on Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to sacrifice the success of the school by
getting lost in a touchy-feely kind of thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To found the school, the academy's founders raised about $2
million in public and private funding over the last three years from
sources including the state Department of Education and the National
Council of La Raza.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the requirements to get the charter approved by state
and local school district authorities, Aguilar got eight like-minded
teachers to commit to teaching at the academy. Distributing fliers
and visiting community events, they've kept a list of parents
interested in enrolling their children.</TE>
<TE>   For some parents, the appeal of the school is its focus on
culturally sensitive instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that is a big advantage for the children, not to lose our
roots," said Martha Patricio, who is considering enrolling her
7-year-old daughter, Perla.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar said some of the academy's teachers and founders will
enroll their children in the academy. His 3-year-old son and
5-year-old daughter will attend.</TE>
<TE>   The academy will open Sept. 3 with kindergarten through third
grades. The school plans to add 40 new students each year until it
has all the grades up to eighth.</TE>
<TE>   A typical day might open with a social activity involving the
whole school, such as martial arts exercises, singing or performing
Chinese or Aztec dances celebrating "Mother Earth."</TE>
<TE>   This "would give us a sense of unity: We are here to learn," said
Maria Isabel Rodriguez, one of the academy's teachers who has taught
in L.A. Unified for almost three decades. "It would help us come in
touch with our inner selves, find balance between mind and body."</TE>
<TE>   The school then would break up into eight classes, each containing
one teacher and 20 students of all ages between kindergarten and
third grade.</TE>
<TE>   Some ideas the academy will use are not rocket science, Aguilar
said, such as a small ratio of students per teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But some of its techniques that are not typical of L.A. Unified
protocol include children of four different grades learning together
and teachers teaching the same students for four years.</TE>
<TE>   This setup illustrates the academy's goal of making education
social: Older children will help teach kindergarteners how to read.</TE>
<TE>   But the teachers' job will not end in the classroom. Aguilar sees
them as "organizers" of the 20 families represented in their
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that everything has to come from the needs of the
students," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the parents' involvement in the school is so key that
another teacher, Abel Aguilar--Aguilar's brother--may be a full-time
community "educator," updating parents about school business, such as
the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to understand the concept of the school, said Aguilar,
walking through the empty school building, is to listen to its name:
Seeds of the Town Academy.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of our school is that it be a part of the
community," he said. "We have to produce something that goes beyond
the building."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In November, Maywood Police Chief Rick Lopez refused South Gate's top
police job after running smack into the city's famously raucous
politics.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez said South Gate appeared to be "imploding" from political
turmoil, and he accused some cops of being "renegades" and "out of
control."</LD>
<LD>   But on Monday Lopez returned to South Gate, and this time he took
the job. The political climate, however, has only gotten hotter, and
his appointment intensifies the struggle between two police unions
and city leaders over control of the department.</LD>
<TE>   It's a struggle that could also determine the future of the
crisis-racked city, where police have emerged as strong supporters of
political corruption probes and voter recall drives targeting several
city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's appointment follows a series of moves by South Gate
officials that have shaken up the top brass and radically altered
working conditions on the 98-member force.</TE>
<TE>   One unusual measure calls for almost every officer, including
detectives, to wear uniforms. Another move allows voters to decide
whether Spanish-language proficiency should be a requirement to be
chief.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say such measures will enhance public safety. But
the unions think officials are retaliating against the unions for
their support of voter recall drives aimed at ousting city leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Placing himself in the center of the battle is Lopez, who was
sworn in at a morning ceremony at City Hall. He said his change of
heart came after much reflection, and a sense of civic duty.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is crying for leadership," said Lopez in a
telephone interview, "and I have a proven track record of being an
effective leader."</TE>
<TE>   But the unions believe Lopez was hired in a corrupt selection
process, and fear he will punish police officers who are outspoken
opponents of city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The belief is, given the turmoil that is going on, no reputable
chief of police would take on this endeavor," said Sgt. Frank "Pico"
Rivera, treasurer of the South Gate Police Officers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They also claim Lopez, who does not have a college degree, is not
qualified. Lopez now commands Capt. Robert Todd, an adjunct professor
at the same community college, Rio Hondo, where Lopez is a student.
Lopez, who was Maywood's chief for five years, said he is working
toward a bachelor's degree in administration of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Union-administration relations have worsened steadily since
officers last year helped launch a recall drive against three council
members and Treasurer Albert Robles, the city's perceived political
boss. The unions and other recall supporters believe the four
officials are corrupt, accusations the leaders deny.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between Robles and the unions have always run high. The
city explored the possibility of replacing the police force with the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, a move officers say was
inspired by Robles' disdain for the unions. Robles has also been
criminally charged with threatening to kill Lt. Vince Avila, one of
his outspoken critics.</TE>
<TE>   Robles denies the allegations. He has said the Police Department
has been resistant to change, especially to measures that could
result in cost savings, such as contracting services from the
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   By bringing in Lopez, officials said they hope to bolster their
emergency response capabilities. But the appointment has resurrected
allegations of corruption in the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   The most serious involves accusations made by Pat Connolly, a
retired former police chief. In a declaration, Connolly said a
condition of his participation on the selection committee was
agreeing to choose a pre-selected candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly said Lou Moret, the city's reorganization consultant,
told him in September that he must select the candidate they want.
Connolly said he refused. Moret was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The allegation anchors a lawsuit filed by the unions that aims to
block Lopez's appointment. The legal action, which also attempts to
block several recent changes, is set for a hearing next week.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit sparked a counterclaim in which Lopez alleged that
some South Gate police officers threatened him while serving him with
the court papers. The claim was thrown out by a federal judge, citing
a lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lopez's title is assistant chief of police, he will be
the highest-ranking officer. Union officials say city leaders have
left the police chief position unfilled to get around a provision
requiring union approval.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez acknowledges that he arrives under difficult circumstances,
but said he is ready to "embrace" the challenges ahead of him. He
denies being Robles' hand-selected candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez will be tested immediately. The council recently passed
several controversial measures, and his response will be closely
watched.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's predecessor, Deputy Chief Tommy Tunson, quickly fell out
of favor with the administration after resisting some changes. He now
reports to Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   One recently approved measure requires all officers, except
undercover personnel, to wear uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Several law enforcement experts said the rule is highly unusual
and potentially dangerous. They said it could especially hinder
detectives, who usually dress inconspicuously to interview potential
witnesses or suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also changed officers' schedules from
three-day, twelve-hour shifts, to five-day, eight-hour schedules.
Unlike other communities where such moves are made after extensive
studies, South Gate officials enacted theirs without research.</TE>
<TE>   Causing additional conflict is the city's decision to allow voters
to decide if police chiefs should speak Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Such a referendum is necessary, officials said, to improve
communication between police brass and the city's majority Latino
population.</TE>
<TE>   But union leaders believe the rule is aimed at punishing
non-Spanish-speaking command officers who have led the recall effort.</TE>

<HD>Reseda Man Held in Teacher's Stabbing Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police arrest him after finding his ex-girlfriend's
body. The suspect is injured when he jumps from an apartment balcony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cal State Northridge employee who jumped from a third-story
apartment balcony Monday as Los Angeles SWAT officers closed in was
arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   Marlon Smiley, 30, was in serious but stable condition at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center after he fell onto a wooden
partition near a parking lot at his complex in Reseda, Police Det.
Mike Oppelt said.</LD>
<LD>   Smiley was expected to be transferred to the jail ward at
County-USC Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   He is suspected of stabbing to death Stacey Baker, 26, a teacher
at Beachy Avenue Elementary School in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a call from a friend, officers found Baker's body
about 1:30 p.m. Sunday in the shower at her Granada Hills condominium
in the 10600 block of Woodley Avenue, Oppelt said.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent motive for the killing was the couple's breakup after
dating three years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley has worked in plant management at CSUN since 2000,
dispatching maintenance workers to the campus' 53 major buildings,
said Carmen Ramos Chandler, a university spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors at the apartment complex where Smiley has lived since
1999 described him as quiet and friendly.</TE>
<TE>   But friends of the victim named Smiley as a possible suspect soon
after the killing was discovered, Oppelt said.</TE>
<TE>   When Smiley failed to respond to phone calls, SWAT officers went
to his apartment in the 8100 block of Reseda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley apparently tried to escape by jumping from the balcony,
hitting the partition before falling to the pavement, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker's death was acutely felt at Beachy Avenue Elementary School,
where she had taught four years.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids really knew that she cared, and they worked to please
her," Principal Adrianne Kirman said. Students greeted Baker with
hugs and invited her to their Saturday soccer games, Kirman added.
"She was very committed to the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Baker taught a class of about 20 students who needed help working
up to their grade level. Her organized, businesslike approach to
teaching made her perfect for the job, Kirman said. "It's going to be
real hard to replace her."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a legal move that surprised city officials, the Cottonwood
Christian Center on Monday sought a federal court injunction to block
the city from taking 18 acres of church property on which to build a
Costco.</LD>
<LD>   A church spokeswoman said the 102-page motion would prevent the
city from taking "immediate possession" of Cottonwood's property near
the Los Alamitos Race Course, an act allowed under eminent domain
proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Bill Wynder said the parties had agreed to suspend any
legal action while meeting twice weekly to find the mega-church an
alternative location.</LD>
<TE>   City Council members unanimously voted last month to condemn the
undeveloped redevelopment site at the corner of Walker Street and
Katella Avenue, where the 4,000-member church had plans to build a
sprawling complex.</TE>

<LD>A Fullerton couple were arrested on suspicion of shackling their
21-year-old daughter to a bed for dating a married man, police said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   David Mata Avila, 53, and Guadalupe Mata, 51, were being held on
allegations of conspiracy of false imprisonment, criminal threats and
assault and battery.</LD>
<LD>   Giovana Mata called authorities after her father hit her with his
fist, Fullerton Police Det. Mike MacDonald said.</LD>
<TE>   When officers arrived at their apartment in the 100 block of
Valencia about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, they could hear the woman screaming
for help from a rear bedroom, MacDonald said. Officers found her on
her back, shackled around the arms and ankles with 30-pound chains
and padlocks.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to discipline their daughter," MacDonald said. "They
didn't like the fact that she was dating a married man."</TE>
<TE>   When her father unchained her, the girl "jumped out of bed and ran
to the officer and embraced him, thanking him for helping her,"
MacDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman told police it was the first time she had been chained,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   She may have been shackled for as long as 30 minutes, and suffered
bruises to her back and redness to her wrist and legs, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The parents are being held at Fullerton City Jail in lieu of
$25,000 bail each, police said. They are scheduled to be arraigned
Wednesday at North Justice Center in Fullerton.</TE>

<HD>California's Big Cities Are Among Safest</HD>
<DH>Statistics: Eight of the 10 most crime-free in the U.S. are
in the Golden State, two in Ventura County. Affluence is seen as a
key factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California suburbs, overgrown bedroom communities rather than
traditional cities, ranked as the most crime-free large cities in the
U.S. again last year, FBI and census figures show.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the nation's 10 large cities with the fewest reported
major crimes are in California, six are in Southern California and
most are on the urban fringe, according to a Times analysis of FBI
data released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The low-crime rankings were compiled by The Times based on a ratio
of population to crimes reported by local police agencies to the FBI
in seven categories--murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, theft and auto theft. Each crime is given the same weight,
so a homicide counts no more than a bike theft.</LD>
<TE>   Among American cities with at least 100,000 residents, two
affluent Ventura County suburbs are the most crime-free.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley nudged rival Thousand Oaks for the top spot, while
another Southland commuter city, Santa Clarita, ranked fifth.
Glendale was seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley or Thousand Oaks has ranked first for 11 of the last
14 years. Amherst Town, a college community in suburban Buffalo,
N.Y., was first the other three.</TE>
<TE>   This year, four Orange County cities ranked in the nation's top
25, with Huntington Beach eighth and Irvine ninth. If 98,500-resident
Mission Viejo had been a bit larger, it would have placed first, just
ahead of Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although comparing crime rates among cities is discouraged by the
FBI, the cities atop the informal rankings embrace them and even say
they're good for home sales and luring clean, high-tech businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bragging rights, I suppose," Simi Valley Mayor Bill Davis
said. "Our City Council loves being in first place. And if you're No.
1, 2, or 3, it undoubtedly brings business to town."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said executives moving their companies to Simi Valley often
say they've heard the city is very safe. "They want to know how we
accomplished that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Author and demographic researcher Joel Kotkin said the safest big
cities are essentially small towns that don't have much poverty or
the types of businesses that usually generate crime such as bars and
nightclubs--or major shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do they have much in common with the traditional big cities of
America, which often rank low on the safety list.</TE>
<TE>   "In California you have oversized suburbs that always get on the
list," said Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University and the
Milken Institute. "They're able to create enclaves of safety that are
pretty uniformly middle class. People move there for safety, so it's
a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the top-rated cities are white-collar commuter havens with
high employment, so relatively few people are around during the day
to commit crime. And city officials often use planning devices to
zone out the poor, building few apartments and scant housing for
low-income workers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a rule, employment tends to be more high and more stable in
affluent suburbs, and crimes rates tend to be lower," said Barry
Glassner, a USC sociologist and author of "The Culture of Fear."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, crime rose 2% last year after spiraling downward for a
decade, the FBI reported Monday in preliminary figures. Violent
offenses were up 0.6%, including the homicides of the Sept. 11
attacks, and property crime was up 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   State's Crime Rate Up 6%</TE>
<TE>   In California, a crime survey of large cities showed about a 6%
increase in 2001, but only after the crime rate had bottomed at the
lowest level in three decades. The California crime rate was about 37
offenses per 1,000 residents, well below the U.S. rate of 41, in the
most recent annual reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again we're defying the stereotype that much of the nation
has of California--the image that this is not a particularly safe
state," USC's Glassner said.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the way are the suburbs that ring the state's largest
cities: Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Santa Clarita on the fringe of
Los Angeles, and Sunnyvale and Daly City in the Bay Area. Their crime
rates are about half the California norm, or less.</TE>
<TE>   "These cities are very homogeneous--they have no great divisions
between those who have and those who have not," said professor Paul
Jesilow, of UC Irvine's department of criminology, law and society.</TE>
<TE>   This economic--if not ethnic--sameness fosters a community of
common values in which residents feel they can solve their problems
by working with their neighbors, Jesilow said. "To some extent these
low crime rates are the result of how people in cities such as Irvine
and Glendale respond to crime," he said. "In suburbia, burglaries are
committed by the children of residents. So if they have a burglary,
they don't necessarily call police. They'd rather talk to Johnny's
parents down the street."</TE>
<TE>   The state's largest cities, which also experienced drops in crime
over the last decade, saw major offenses climb sharply in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose, San Diego, Anaheim, Long Beach and Santa Ana all have
relatively low crime rates, but each had a crime hike last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, San Jose, the nation's 11th-largest city, ranked 12th of
235 on the safe-cities list with a rate of 27.99 offenses per 1,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's rate was 41.23 per 1,000. Los Angeles' rate was a
fraction of a decade ago at 51.22 per 1,000, but that represented an
increase of nearly 9,000 offenses from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   That rate is lower than in the nation's other biggest cities,
except for the a 34.19 rate in New York City, which saw crime fall by
14,484 offenses, or 5%, despite nearly 3,000 homicides from the World
Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, St. Louis had 151 crimes per 1,000--the highest in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Highest Rate in Berkeley</TE>
<TE>   In California, Berkeley had the highest rate, 89.5 crimes per
1,000, followed by Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento, Oakland and San
Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's most crime-free large city, Santa Clarita,
fell from third to fifth in the rankings. Officials said they think
last year's 17.9% crime spike will be a one-year blip.</TE>
<TE>   The city's entire increase consisted of 480 thefts or burglaries,
while violence offenses were slightly lower.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Michael Dunkle, of the Santa Clarita Valley Station,
said that in a prosperous community like this one residents sometimes
leave windows open and car doors unlocked--then find their
possessions gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall security you get living in what you perceive as a
safe neighborhood can contribute to a relaxed state of mind," he
said. "That leads to victimization."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale, which ranked seventh, attributed its lower crime rate
partly to a change in how police report felony assaults, dropping
that total from 518 to 235 in one year.</TE>
<TE>   But Police Chief Russell Siverling said much of the drop results
from a decade of community-oriented policing.</TE>
<TE>   "These are improvements that occur over many years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In low-crime Orange County, all eight large cities were among the
45 most crime-free in the nation--the top 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Crime held relatively steady in three cities with very low
rates--Huntington Beach, Irvine and Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Anaheim, Fullerton and Orange all had
double-digit increases.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said he wasn't surprised
by that city's 15% jump, since crime had dropped for more than a
decade, fueled by a decline in gang slayings. "It's been so low for
so many years, maybe this is a leveling off," he said. "It would be
extremely difficult for law enforcement to keep crime off for such a
long period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana saw a 20% jump in property crimes, while violent crime
remained steady. Nearly 500 more cars were stolen in the city last
year than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Officials attributed the spike in crime to a slow economy and to
the return of gang members sentenced to prison in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, which has the lowest crime rate in the West,
not only did Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks top the ranking, Oxnard
ranked 19th and Ventura 28th.</TE>

<LD>   The suit filed by Santa Barbara County claims the Lompoc Oil
Field, owned by Nuevo Energy Co. and run by Torch Operating Co.,
should have cleared vegetation as required by law.</LD>
<LD>   State fire investigators determined the Sept. 13, 2000, Harris
Grade Fire started when sparks from a power pole ignited dry brush in
the Lompoc Oil Field near Vandenberg Village.</LD>
<TE>   The fire burned across 9,700 acres and ignited an underground fire

<LD>The state Assembly on Monday unanimously passed a bill giving victims
of child abuse more time to claim damages and sue a third party.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved on a 73-0 vote, had previously passed the
Senate.</LD>
<LD>   It was written in response to recent allegations of abuse by
priests, said the author, Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco).</LD>
<TE>   Current law requires that a victim claim damages or file a lawsuit
by age 26.</TE>

three-year window from discovering the abuse to bring an action
against a third party.</TE>

<HD>Agency Defends $207-Million Offer for Tollway</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The price for the 10-mile stretch along the
Riverside Freeway is justified and revenue will cover debts, Orange
County officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Monday defended its
offer of $207.5 million to buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes,
a controversial tollway that has been blamed for aggravating
congestion on the heavily traveled Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a fair price," said Arthur T. Leahy, the agency's chief
executive officer and chief negotiator in the pending sale. "Demand
for the road is very high, and projected revenue will cover its
debts."</LD>
<LD>   To help explain the proposed sale price, the agency's board of
directors on Monday released thousands of pages of studies assessing
the roadway's value. This was in response to a public records request
by the Los Angeles Times and the Orange County Register.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal of this board is to build public confidence that the
decisions made thus far ... have been made after a thoughtful and
deliberative analysis," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who heads the
transportation agency's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway, built for about $135 million in the mid-1990s, runs
for 10 miles in the median of the Riverside Freeway from north
Anaheim to Riverside County. There are two lanes in each direction.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale goes through, the county agency would assume tollway
debts and pay California Private Transportation Co. $72.5 million, a
healthy profit given the company's initial investment.</TE>
<TE>   Some at board meetings have questioned whether it is a fair price
for an operation that has had trouble turning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fine that OCTA wants to control the road," said Eric Norby
of Laguna Beach, who helped with the successful supervisorial
campaign of his brother Chris Norby. "I just want to make sure the
price is supported by third-party evaluations and that OCTA is not
paying too much."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus to buy the lanes is the desire to end the tollway's
controversial non-compete agreement with Caltrans that barred the
highway agency from widening or making significant improvements to
the Riverside Freeway that could cut into the company's toll fees.
The Riverside Freeway is one of the most crowded routes in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   After months of negotiation, the agency announced in late April an
agreement with the tollway's owners. The sale is contingent upon an
evaluation of the company's financial records and contracts. The
state Legislature also must grant the agency the power to charge
tolls.</TE>
<TE>   The parties hope to complete the sale by September. Agency
officials say they will operate the Express Lanes as a tollway and
use the revenue to pay off its bonds. The authority, with cooperation
from Riverside County, also plans to begin long-awaited improvements
to relieve congestion on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed price is based on a cash flow analysis by the
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, research by agency financial staff,
and a separate comparison of the costs to build a similar project.</TE>

<HD>Piru Looks to Its Past to Secure a Better Future</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: A $2.2-million project will create a town
square with a replica 1800s rail depot. The town hopes to draw
visitors from L.A.</DH>

<LD>It's easy to forget about Piru.</LD>
<LD>   Long overshadowed by neighboring Fillmore, this dusty town of
1,800 had its heyday as a bustling railroad stop more than a century
ago.</LD>
<LD>   In recent decades it has looked more like an abandoned Mayberry,
its quaint Main Street lined with boarded-up shops and lunch
counters.</LD>
<TE>   Motorists whiz by on California 126 never knowing the community
near Magic Mountain exists. But Santa Clara Valley tourism promoters
say that this is about to change.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers are halfway through building a $2.2-million
Town Square, complete with a replica of an 1800s railroad depot,
community fountain and bandstand gazebo.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also call for a 2 1/2-mile bike path connecting Piru with
Rancho Camulos, an authentic Mexican rancho that inspired Helen Hunt
Jackson's epic romance novel "Ramona."</TE>
<TE>   Once construction is complete, the Fillmore &amp; Western Railroad
will send turn-of-the-century locomotives to town, linking it once
again with Fillmore and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serving as the community's formal gathering spot,
Town Square is envisioned as the primary entry point for visitors to
the area. Organizers hope to lure day-trippers from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest project in Piru in decades," said Monica Nolan,
an analyst with Ventura County's redevelopment agency. "We're looking
at this as the kick-start to reinvigorate the community."</TE>
<TE>   People are already taking notice. Nolan said a businessman is
interested in buying and upgrading the aging 10-room Round Rock
Hotel. Overnight accommodations are needed for a planned equestrian
center to be located nearby, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The county redevelopment agency is financing the project, using a
combination of state and federal grants and loans. Piru is
unincorporated and falls under the county's planning jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the sale of
$750,000 in tax bonds today to cover the county's portion of
construction costs. Officials expect the project to be completed by
October.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to revitalize the town began after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake, which severely damaged many homes and businesses in
Piru's predominantly low-income, Latino neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The county declared the devastated area a redevelopment zone and
began making plans for its restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "Following the earthquake, all of that downtown area was boarded
up. We red-tagged it," said Supervisor Kathy Long, who represents
Piru. "So this is still climbing out of that earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   Piru is often selected as a location by filmmakers looking for an
old-fashioned town. But county officials believe they can bring in
more tourists by emphasizing the railroad and the Old West past of
the towns dotting the bucolic Santa Clara Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We did an analysis and it said people increasingly are interested
in historical tourism," Long said. "We figure we could attract up to
a half-million visitors to the Santa Clara Valley a year if we do
this right."</TE>

<HD>California's Cities Are Among the Safest</HD>
<DH>Statistics: Eight of the 10 most crime-free in the nation
are in the Golden State, six of them in the Southland. One expert
says they're 'oversized suburbs,' not true cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California suburbs, overgrown bedroom communities rather than
traditional cities, ranked as the most crime-free large cities in the
U.S. again last year, FBI and census figures show.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the nation's 10 large cities with the fewest reported
major crimes are in California, six are in Southern California and
most are on the urban fringe, according to a Times analysis of FBI
data released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The low-crime rankings were compiled by The Times based on a ratio
of population to crimes reported by local police agencies to the FBI
in seven categories--murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, theft and auto theft. Each crime is given the same weight,
so a homicide counts no more than a bike theft.</LD>
<TE>   Among American cities with at least 100,000 residents, two
affluent Ventura County suburbs are the most crime-free.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley nudged rival Thousand Oaks for the top spot, while
another Southland commuter city, Santa Clarita, ranked fifth.
Glendale was seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley or Thousand Oaks has ranked first for 11 of the last
14 years. Amherst Town, a college community in suburban Buffalo,
N.Y., was first the other three years.</TE>
<TE>   This year, four Orange County cities ranked in the nation's top
25, with Huntington Beach eighth and Irvine ninth. If 98,500-resident
Mission Viejo had been a bit larger, it would have placed first, just
ahead of Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although comparing crime rates among cities is discouraged by the
FBI, the cities atop the informal rankings embrace them and even say
they're good for home sales and luring clean, high-tech businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bragging rights, I suppose," Simi Valley Mayor Bill Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said executives moving their companies to Simi Valley often
say they've heard the city is very safe. "They want to know how we
accomplished that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Author and demographic researcher Joel Kotkin said the safest big
cities are essentially small towns that don't have much poverty or
the types of businesses that usually generate crime such as bars and
nightclubs--or major shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do they have much in common with the traditional big cities of
America, which often rank low on the safety list.</TE>
<TE>   "In California you have oversized suburbs that always get on the
list," said Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University and the
Milken Institute. "They're able to create enclaves of safety that are
pretty uniformly middle class. People move there for safety, so it's
a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the top-rated cities are white-collar commuter havens with
high employment, so relatively few people are around during the day
to commit crime. And city officials often use planning devices to
zone out the poor, building few apartments and scant housing for
low-income workers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a rule, employment tends to be more high and more stable in
affluent suburbs, and crimes rates tend to be lower," said Barry
Glassner, a USC sociologist and author of "The Culture of Fear."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, crime rose 2% last year after spiraling downward for a
decade, the FBI reported Monday in preliminary figures. Violent
offenses were up 0.6%, including the homicides of the Sept. 11
attacks, and property crime was up 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   In California, a crime survey of large cities showed about a 6%
increase in 2001, but only after the crime rate had bottomed at the
lowest level in three decades. The California crime rate was about 37
offenses per 1,000 residents, well below the U.S. rate of 41, in the
most recent annual reports.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the way are the suburbs that ring the state's largest
cities: Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Santa Clarita on the fringe of
Los Angeles, and Sunnyvale and Daly City in the Bay Area. Their crime
rates are about half the California norm, or less.</TE>
<TE>   "These cities are very homogeneous--they have no great divisions
between those who have and those who have not," said professor Paul
Jesilow, of UC Irvine's department of criminology, law and society.</TE>
<TE>   This economic--if not ethnic--sameness fosters a community of
common values in which residents feel they can solve their problems
by working with their neighbors, Jesilow said. "To some extent these
low crime rates are the result of how people in cities such as Irvine
and Glendale respond to crime," he said. "In suburbia, burglaries are
committed by the children of residents. So if they have a burglary,
they don't necessarily call police. They'd rather talk to Johnny's
parents down the street."</TE>
<TE>   The state's largest cities, which also experienced drops in crime
over the last decade, saw major offenses climb sharply in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose, San Diego, Anaheim, Long Beach and Santa Ana all have
relatively low crime rates, but each had a crime hike last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, San Jose, the nation's 11th-largest city, ranked 12th of
235 on the safe-cities list with a rate of 27.99 offenses per 1,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's rate was 41.23 per 1,000. Los Angeles' rate was a
fraction of a decade ago at 51.22 per 1,000, but that represented an
increase of nearly 9,000 offenses from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   That rate is lower than in the nation's other biggest cities,
except for the a 34.19 rate in New York City, which saw crime fall by
14,484 offenses, or 5%, despite nearly 3,000 homicides from the World
Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, St. Louis had 151 crimes per 1,000--the highest in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Berkeley had the highest rate, 89.5 crimes per
1,000, followed by Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento, Oakland and San
Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's most crime-free large city, Santa Clarita,
fell from third to fifth in the rankings. Officials said they think
last year's 17.9% crime spike will be a one-year blip.</TE>
<TE>   The city's entire increase consisted of 480 thefts or burglaries,
while violent offenses were slightly lower.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Michael Dunkle, of the Santa Clarita Valley Station,
said that in a prosperous community like this one residents sometimes
leave windows open and car doors unlocked--then find their
possessions gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall security you get living in what you perceive as a
safe neighborhood can contribute to a relaxed state of mind," he
said. "That leads to victimization."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale, which ranked seventh, attributed its lower crime rate
partly to a change in how police report felony assaults, dropping
that total from 518 to 235 in one year.</TE>
<TE>   But Police Chief Russell Siverling said much of the drop results
from a decade of community-oriented policing.</TE>
<TE>   "These are improvements that occur over many years," he said.</TE>

<HD>Deep Hole Dug on San Andreas Fault for Quake Study</HD>
<DH>Research: International team of scientists will use
instruments at a depth of 1.4 miles to better predict temblors. A
magnitude-6 has been expected since 1985.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford University and the U.S. Geological Survey announced Monday
that they have begun drilling a 1.4-mile-deep hole along a
particularly active portion of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield
as an experiment to better predict earthquakes.</LD>
<LD>   When the project is completed later this summer, an international
team of scientists will implant instruments underground that they
hope will enable them to monitor the earthquake process in an area
where a magnitude-6 quake has been expected since 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Zoback, a Stanford geophysicist, said that a major objective
of the experiment is to facilitate a more ambitious project, for
which Congress is being asked to appropriate $30 million over six
years. The project calls for a 2.4-mile-deep hole to be drilled
through the fault itself, not just alongside it.</LD>
<TE>   The research is to focus on an area in Central California where
there have been magnitude-6 quakes at more or less regular intervals
since the mid-19th century. The last one occurred in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, in what was named the Parkfield prediction experiment,
scientists said they considered it 95% likely that another such quake
would occur by the end of 1993.</TE>
<TE>   But none has, and some scientists have speculated that the 6.5
Coalinga quake of May 2, 1983, may have reduced stress in the area
and delayed it.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, numerous small quakes have continued to occur in the
area, and instruments in the new hole will prove useful in studying
those.</TE>
<TE>   The entire project, including the second drilling, would be the
first underground earthquake observatory to penetrate a seismically
active fault zone at such an extreme depth.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilot hole is really a warmup exercise for SAFOD, the San
Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth," Zoback said. "It was conceived
about a year ago as a way to begin studying the upper crust adjacent
to the fault zone, while at the same time helping us identify
earthquake targets for SAFOD."</TE>
<TE>   When the first hole is drilled, researchers will lower instruments
into it to measure stress, fluid pressure, heat flow and other
characteristics of the San Andreas geologic environment. The idea is
to better delineate the amount of stress necessary to make the fault
slip.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Ellsworth, chief scientist for the Geological Survey's
earthquake work in the Western states, said the quakes that occur
near Parkfield "are quite remarkable. Many of them recur time and
time again with near clocklike regularity. The ... instruments will
give us a powerful new tool for understanding what makes them tick."</TE>
<TE>   Instrumental readings will be analyzed in laboratories at
participating institutions to determine how changes in fluid
circulation and chemistry relate to the earthquake cycle.</TE>
<TE>   One of the factors inhibiting understanding of earthquakes is that
they have occurred deep under the surface, where scientists were
unable to directly examine them.</TE>
<TE>   Parkfield is about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
in a region where the San Andreas fault is slipping all the time
through a combination of steady creeping and small-magnitude quakes.
This contrasts with other regions where the slippage is much more
infrequent.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot hole is being drilled on private land about a mile
southwest of the fault and is closed to visitors.</TE>

<HD>Looking for a Party, but Finding Trouble</HD>
<DH>Tijuana: Navy and Marine Corps warn young servicemen and
women to stay away from the Mexican border town, but many see it as a
rite of passage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>TIJUANA -- Four nights earlier, a 19-year-old U.S. sailor was stabbed
to death in a brawl at Myster E's, a bar and dance parlor on
notorious Avenida Revolucion.</LD>
<LD>   But the next Friday, the place was once again packed with young
American sailors and Marines--talking loudly over the blaring music,
dancing with available women, and downing enormous amounts of a
high-octane concoction called AMF, short for a pungently unprintable
phrase that begins "adios."</LD>
<LD>   Each reveler has this in common: He is absolutely certain that
nothing bad can happen to him here. He's young and indulging in what
has long been a rite of passage for young enlisted personnel.</LD>
<TE>   For as long as there have been sailors and Marines in San Diego,
Tijuana has beckoned as an "anything goes" place for hard drinking
and fast partying. The drinking age is 18, the nightclubs and strip
joints rock all night, and prostitution flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   "The military can be pretty confining," said a Marine who had just
returned from Afghanistan. "Tijuana is where we go when we want to
cut loose and get [messed] up fast."</TE>
<TE>   Under an arrangement with the Mexican government, Navy Shore
Patrol officers visit the jails of Tijuana and Rosarito twice a day
to try to bail out sailors, Marines and other military personnel who
have cut loose unwisely. The Shore Patrol's station at the San Ysidro
border crossing is staffed 24 hours a day to handle problems south of
the border.</TE>
<TE>   At San Diego bases, younger personnel are routinely warned about
the dangers of going to Tijuana, particularly about the nightlife
strip along Revolucion.</TE>
<TE>   "A young sailor on payday is a good target," said Chief Petty
Officer Dan Smail, whose job includes lecturing sailors who are
seized by the urge to go to Tijuana or bust. "It's as if the sailors
have a neon sign on them."</TE>
<TE>   Among Smail's tips: Be wary of quick friendships, avoid cab rides,
stay away from corner ATMs, keep your wallet in your front pocket,
and, most important, don't do anything foolhardy like drinking to
excess.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know which will have ears to listen," Smail said.
"Sometimes we act like mothers and fathers to these kids, but they're
adults, and they've got to learn to make their own decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Marines and sailors returning from a six-month tour in the Arabian
Sea were lectured on the ship home by a San Diego County sheriff's
deputy: "Unless you left something there, there is no reason for you
to go to Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   When a ship based in Bremerton, Wash., pulled into San Diego for
an overnight resupply, the captain banned the crew from going to
Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   When she learned that a group--later known as the Tijuana
Seven--had disobeyed her order, she immediately convened a punishment
hearing in front of the crew.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Navy adopted a policy already used by the Marines.
It allows the three lowest ranks to go to Mexico only with permission
from a senior noncommissioned officer and only after getting an
individual safety lecture and providing the name of a "liberty buddy"
who will accompany them.</TE>
<TE>   On busy weekends, the Shore Patrol checks for liberty chits as
sailors and Marines stream through the southbound turnstiles. Younger
personnel without chits are turned back and reported to their
commands for punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The liberty chit and "liberty buddy" plan did not protect Joshua
Dietrich, 19, of Albuquerque, N.M., who was within days of his first
overseas deployment aboard the transport ship Denver.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of June 8, Dietrich and several friends from the
Denver went to Myster E's for a last round of partying before their
ship was to leave on a six-month tour in the Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   As the music blared and the drinks were being downed, somebody
said something raw to a woman in the Denver group. A drink was
tossed, punches were thrown and Dietrich was stabbed in the heart. He
staggered down the stairs into the busy avenue and collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "They covered him up and he laid there in the gutter for a long
time," said Roberto Rodriguez, a cabdriver who was standing on the
corner outside Myster E's. "It was all very sad."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican authorities say they have no suspects in Dietrich's
killing and don't know the nationality of his attacker. Marines and
sailors aren't the only Americans who frequent the bar. Myster E's is
popular with college students and high school students with fake IDs.</TE>
<TE>   "These Americans come down here and fight and drink," said a
barker for a strip club near Myster E's. "You should never get into a
fight when you're in somebody else's country."</TE>
<TE>   The military counsels sailors and Marines that, if they must go to
Tijuana, they should go in groups for their own protection. But there
is a point of view that being in a group can actually encourage risky
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "If a sailor is in a group, he thinks he can be bold and get into
a fight and not get hurt," said Tijuana Police Officer Antonio
Villegas Martinez, whose beat includes Avenida Revolucion.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no "status of forces" agreement with Mexico.
In other countries, such agreements allow the military to investigate
off-base incidents and assume jurisdiction over any military member
arrested or charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   But in Mexico, without such an agreement, there is no assurance
that even intervention by high-level U.S. officials can free a sailor
or Marine from jail.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine sergeant sent to the border to retrieve two Marines who
had gotten drunk was arrested by Mexican authorities because he had
an unloaded, disassembled rifle in the back of his truck.</TE>
<TE>   He was in jail for two weeks despite pleas for his release by a
general and several members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them: Yes, Mexico is very close but it's a foreign
country and it's their rules, not ours, that you have to obey," said
Chief Petty Officer David Aguilera, chief of the Shore Patrol's
border station.</TE>
<TE>   While word of Dietrich's death spread quickly at San Diego bases,
it didn't slow the southward flow of fun seekers.</TE>
<TE>   The same day he heard of the fatal brawl at Myster E's, Seaman
Philip Rawson, from the Northern California city of Anderson, applied
for a liberty chit for Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of problems down there," Smail told Rawson. "It's
not necessarily the safest place."</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old listened attentively and promised to be careful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a party atmosphere down there," he said. "I've heard a lot
about it."</TE>

<HD>Vast Arts Complex at College Ruled Out</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A south Orange County community college board Monday unanimously
killed a proposal to allow a developer to lease campus land for a
$463-million privately funded arts and entertainment complex.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal for Irvine Valley College would have been easily the
largest project of its type at any California college or university,
officials said. Faculty members objected to the proposal, saying they
didn't see how the school would benefit. The South Orange County
Community College District board of trustees met in closed session
Monday to consider the plan.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would have given developers a 99-year lease on 50 acres
at Irvine Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "It's giving away half the land at IVC," board Trustee Dorothy
Fortune said Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which evolved over the past few months, called for
construction on 25 to 35 acres of what are now orange groves and
athletic fields at Jeffrey Road and Barranca Parkway. It would
include a 2,000-seat theater; a 2,000-seat concert hall; a
seven-story art gallery/planetarium; a four-story, 2,000-car garage;
a seven-story hotel; a seven-story building of offices, shops and
restaurants; a 13-acre movie production complex; a 5,000-seat
baseball stadium; a 10,000-seat soccer and track stadium; a lake and
botanical gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The ambitious project would make the campus "one of the most
important cultural centers in Southern California," Howard Gensler,
IVC's dean of humanities and library sciences, wrote in a May 23
report to the college district chancellor, Raghu Mathur.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty members said the project didn't appear to benefit
instruction in any way. What they really needed was a much smaller
theater appropriate for college productions, they said. The college
has plans for a 400-seat performing arts center, to be completed in
2006.</TE>
<TE>   The complex was to be built by the Newport Financial Group of
Newport Beach. One company figure is Charles Ross, 91, of Laguna
Woods, who proposed a similar project at UC Riverside, without
success, Fortune said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Deshazer, director of Irvine Valley's Center for Applied
Competitive Technology, said he brought Gensler and Ross together.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Monday he would not discuss the plan, but that if the
district turned it down, he would take it elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The board also made permanent Glenn Roquemore's interim
appointment as campus president.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer to Seek Contempt Citation Against Carona</HD>
<DH>Jails: Civil rights attorney says the county sheriff has
failed to protect inmates' rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prominent civil rights lawyer said Monday he will ask a federal
judge this week to find Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona in contempt
of court for failing to prevent mistreatment of inmates in the
county's jail system.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Richard P. Herman accused sheriff's deputies of beating
jail inmates and of violating a landmark court order that governs how
much time inmates must be given to exercise and eat meals.</LD>
<LD>   Herman's announcement comes just two weeks after the county agreed
to pay $650,000 to settle a suit brought by the family of a man who
died in custody four years ago. It was the county's largest
settlement for a jail beating case.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department spokesman Jon Fleischman said he could not
comment on Herman's allegations without seeing them. But he said
Carona has done much to improve jail conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "This sheriff has been very proactive in making sure that we have
the best-run jails in America," Fleischman said.</TE>

<HD>Would-Be City Has a Mayoral Hopeful</HD>
<DH>Election: Assemblyman Richman announces his bid to lead the
Valley, if voters approve the area's split from Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK MCGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) said Monday that he
will run for mayor of the proposed San Fernando Valley city, becoming
the first candidate for an office that will exist only if voters
decide to break the region off from Los Angeles on the same Nov. 5
ballot as the mayor's race.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a multimillionaire physician who spent $425,000 of his
own money on his Assembly campaign two years ago, plans a formal
announcement of his candidacy Wednesday. His platform will focus on
what he termed the city of Los Angeles' years of neglect of the
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a lifelong history in the San Fernando Valley, and our
community is very important to me," said Richman, 48. "I'm fully
committed to Valley independence and I will be working to address
that goal in the months ahead."</LD>
<TE>   The freshman lawmaker also is seeking reelection to the
Legislature. If he wins both offices and the Valley secedes, he will
resign from the Assembly and a special election will be held to fill
his seat, Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the group spearheading the Valley secession drive
issued its first fund-raising appeal Monday, seeking $1,000 each from
25,000 prospective donors. The letter from the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee was signed by eight prominent secession
supporters, including former Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook, county
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, former Assemblyman Richard Katz and
former city Ethics Commissioner David Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   In the mayor's race, Richman might face state Sen. Richard Alarcon
(D-Sylmar), who said Monday that he continues to seriously consider a
run, even though he has not decided whether to support secession
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon also is vying for another term in the state Senate, and a
special election would be held to fill his legislative seat, if
needed. He said Richman is a "fine person," but that his Republican
views may be in conflict with those of most Valley voters. In the
Valley, 51.4% of voters are Democrats and 28.7% are Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The assemblyman, however, noted that the mayor's office is
nonpartisan. He described himself as a moderate who supports abortion
rights and opposes school vouchers, and has been active in promoting
health care for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   By staking out a pro-secession agenda early, Richman hopes to take
a large chunk of votes from Alarcon.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters know the difference between a candidate with past
enthusiastic support for secession and one who gets dragged there
with fingernails scraping the ground," said Dan Schnur, a Republican
strategist who is working for the Richman campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate has lived in the Valley since he was 3 years old. He
served for more than two years as an appointee to the city Community
Redevelopment Commission during the Richard Riordan administration.</TE>
<TE>   In the Legislature, he has served on committees overseeing health
issues and the state's energy problems.</TE>
<TE>   A founder of the Lakeside Medical Group, Richman specialized in
general internal medicine.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, former state Assemblywoman Paula Boland formally
announced her candidacy for the north Valley's 3rd District council
seat. Boland, a Republican, is the most prominent candidate so far to
seek a Valley council post.</TE>

<HD>Coad May Withdraw Support of Irvine's El Toro Annexation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, whose pivotal vote
helped Irvine win early support to annex the former El Toro Marine
base, may withdraw that support today because she is skeptical of the
city's promise to create a trust fund for parks in her district.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have any guarantee from Irvine, and I've asked for
something like a signed assurance," Coad said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Coad is a staunch advocate of building a commercial airport at the
former base. But after county voters in March approved a ballot
measure rezoning the land to allow only a park and limited
development, she joined a 3-2 board vote to allow Irvine to annex
about 3,700 acres at El Toro. The board will reconsider that vote
today.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine elected officials said they hope to keep Coad's support to
avoid resulting delays if supervisors rescind their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Mears, an Irvine council member, said Coad "has it within
her power to throw a three- to four-month-long monkey wrench in the
annexation process.... But she certainly isn't going to stop
annexation or the sale of the base."</TE>
<TE>   Mears said it is unreasonable for Coad to demand a guarantee that
the city will set aside $800,000 a year for 100 years to help buy and
improve parks in north Orange County. The city offered the money to
help persuade supporters of the airport to back the park plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy, which still owns El Toro, plans to sell the land to the
highest bidder. Last week the Navy wrote the board to say Irvine's
annexation of the former base is critical to sale.</TE>
<TE>   H.T. Johnson, assistant secretary of the Navy, also urged the
board to vote for a tax transfer agreement that will be part of
Irvine's annexation application to the Local Agency Formation
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Mears said the Navy's message is that the board should not hinder
the city's annexation progress.</TE>
<TE>   A delay would offer a final opportunity for pro-airport forces. A
lawsuit challenging Measure W, which killed airport planning at El
Toro, is due for a hearing in September. And another lawsuit was
filed against the Navy last week in federal court in Washington
seeking to block plans to sell the property for parkland and
park-related development.</TE>
<TE>   If a judge overturns Measure W, the county would resume planning
an airport, said Supervisor Chuck Smith, an airport supporter.</TE>

<LD>It is the sound of summer--Bzzzzzzz. Splat!--and a reminder that warm
weather provides perfect conditions for blood-sucking mosquitoes and
the viruses they can spread when biting humans.</LD>
<LD>   Given potential health risks, the Ventura County Environmental
Health Division is advising the public to eliminate backyard water
sources where mosquitoes can lay eggs.</LD>
<LD>   Watering troughs, ornamental ponds and neglected swimming pools
are common breeding grounds during the hot summer months when
mosquito populations can explode.</LD>
<TE>   "It creates a more optimum environment for the mosquitoes," said
Randy Smith, the county's supervising environmental health
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "What we look for, and are worried about, are the encephalitis
viruses," Smith said. "There is a potential for malaria being
transmitted here, too."</TE>
<TE>   Encephalitis, which has different strains, is a mosquito-borne
viral disease that affects the central nervous system and causes an
inflammation of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Only one case, of St. Louis encephalitis, has been reported in
Ventura County in recent years, Smith said. But other areas of
Southern California have experienced outbreaks. Headache, fever and
drowsiness are common symptoms. The elderly and children are most at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   While rare, West Nile virus is also a concern.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce mosquito populations locally, health officials recommend
frequently emptying backyard water containers or stocking ponds with
insect-eating fish. Wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and using
bug repellents are recommended to prevent bites.</TE>

<HD>Day Laborers Shift to a City-Funded Site</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Workers appreciate the amenities, including
tables and a portable toilet. But neighbors express concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forced from another spot because of nuisance complaints, a group of
day laborers gathered Monday at a new hiring site established by the
city of Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The men placed two handwritten banners at the old location to
remind contractors that they had moved a few blocks to the site along
Royal Oaks Drive next to the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a nice place, and we won't have any more problems with
the people in the houses [nearby]," said Florentino Perez, 20, who is
often hired for construction work.</LD>
<TE>   Compared to the corner where they congregated for more than 15
years at Fairview Road and Crescent Way--where leaning against a
fence was as close to relaxing as one could come during the wait--the
laborers said the new site offers a number of advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Shaded by oaks, the site offers amenities such as picnic tables, a
portable toilet and a circular drive so contractors can pick up
workers safely away from the road.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, contractors will adjust to the new location,
said the laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Skilled in such tasks as construction, carpentry, painting and
gardening, the laborers may still be faced with challenges beyond
just finding jobs, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents near the new site are as concerned about seeing the
laborers arrive as the residents at the old location were relieved to
watch them leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really in favor," of the relocation, said Barbara Dubose,
who lives across the street from the new hiring site.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody asked us what we thought," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a divided vote, the City Council approved funding for the new
hiring site in March after years of complaints from neighbors near
the former location about the crowd of laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Manuel Villacorte, who lives at the corner where the former
site was located, said initially he would cook breakfast for some of
the hungry workers. But the group grew to become a nuisance, at times
blocking traffic, drinking beer and tossing litter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Linda Parks said the city's intent was to
improve the situation for the neighborhood and for the laborers.</TE>
<TE>   But the new site, which is also in a residential area, is not a
much better solution, said Parks, who voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   She said she supports the laborers' efforts to find work but would
rather see them at a commercial location, possibly outside a home
improvement store, such as Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   "It impacts residents across the street who want to feel safe ...
and not have people who are essentially loitering when they're not
working," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents near the new site echoed those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Michael Childers said there is no fountain at the new
hiring site and worries the men could wander into private yards in
search of water, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dubose said the laborers could get hurt because the new site is
located next to a sharp curve where cars tend to speed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not really a good place for them," Dubose said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the laborers have not felt any resistance to their
relocation, they said.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Urge Board to Oust College Chancellor</HD>
<DH>Education: An audit finds questionable expenses filed by
Philip Westin. Panel's president orders a 90-day freeze on travel
spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barraged by protests over excessive spending by Ventura County
Community College Chancellor Philip Westin, the president of the
college board on Monday ordered a 90-day freeze on all travel
expenses and a study of other college districts' spending policies.</LD>
<LD>   The action by President Norman Nagel came during a raucous
trustees meeting packed with more than 100 protesters who called for
Westin's resignation, citing everything from improper meal and car
repair expenses to his vindictive treatment of employees.</LD>
<LD>   Some said that had they known about Westin's spending habits they
would never have voted for the $356-million construction bond
measure, approved in March, that will be used for improvements at the
district's three campuses.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm tremendously angry that none of these issues were disclosed
in March," said David Maron of Ventura. "I think Dr. Westin should
resign. I don't think a tiger can change its stripes."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor John Flynn was among a dozen speakers who
questioned the trustees handling of Westin's expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you still have your moral codes," Flynn said. "If you
don't, I would ask you to get one."</TE>
<TE>   Westin sat stone-faced throughout the meeting as his critics
assailed him and waived placards, including one that read "Remember
Enron" and "Do Not Collect $203,000, Go Directly To Jail," a
reference to his salary.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting, Nagel asked trustees Bob Gonzales and Al
Jacobs to form a subcommittee to study spending policies of other
college districts and report back to him. He also imposed a freeze on
travel expenditures, with any exceptions requiring his approval.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy erupted in March when a Camarillo law firm
presented a report on Westin's business expenses to the district's
board of trustees. The report covered the period from December 1996
to October 2001 and found $46,000 in questionable expenses, including
$22,000 in auto repairs and $7,600 for computer software.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also revealed that Westin had charged $23,000 for
business meals from January 1999 to October 2001, which was first
reported in the Ventura County Star. Since then, Westin has come
under fire for excessive spending practices.</TE>
<TE>   Westin, who was awarded a new four-year contract along with a 16%
raise last month, said in an earlier interview that he favored
adoption of a new policy that would place strict limits on spending
by the chancellor. Westin was given the contract after an auditor
hired by the district found no criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Westin has filed a complaint with the state bar, accusing attorney
David Bender and his partner, David Wood, of conducting an
unauthorized expense report in an attempt to oust the chancellor and
gain control of the district's legal services contract, which last
year totaled more than $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bender and Wood have filed a claim with the district,
stating that their report was authorized by trustee Gonzales and that
the law firm is due $61,000 for expenses incurred. The firm hired a
Long Beach private investigator to conduct the audit after allegedly
being tipped off about Westin's expenses by an unnamed source,
according to district documents.</TE>
<TE>   But Gonzales has told district officials that he never authorized
the audit and made it clear to the law firm that as a sole trustee he
had no power to do so, according to district documents.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said the law firm maintains that its report was authorized
and that his firm had "absolutely not" acted improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Wood provided The Times with a copy of a June 18 letter from the
bar informing him that the organization had reviewed Westin's
complaint and determined "there are insufficient grounds for
disciplinary action."</TE>

<HD>Day Laborers Shift to City-Funded Site</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Workers appreciate the amenities, including
tables and a portable toilet. But neighbors express concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forced from another spot because of nuisance complaints, a group of
day laborers gathered Monday at a new hiring site established by the
city of Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The men placed two handwritten banners at the old location to
remind contractors that they had moved a few blocks to the site along
Royal Oaks Drive next to the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a nice place, and we won't have any more problems with
the people in the houses [nearby]," said Florentino Perez, 20, who is
often hired for construction work.</LD>
<TE>   Compared to the corner where they congregated for more than 15
years at Fairview Road and Crescent Way--where leaning against a
fence was as close to relaxing as one could come during the wait--the
laborers said the new site offers a number of advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Shaded by oak trees, the site offers amenities such as picnic
tables, a bike rack, a portable toilet and a circular drive so
contractors can pick up workers safely away from the road.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, contractors will adjust to the new location,
said the laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Skilled in such tasks as construction, carpentry, painting and
gardening, the laborers may still be faced with challenges beyond
just finding jobs, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents near the new site are as concerned about seeing the
laborers arrive as the residents at the old location were relieved to
watch them leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really in favor," of the relocation, said Barbara Dubose,
who lives across the street from the new hiring site.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody asked us what we thought," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a divided vote, the City Council approved funding for the new
hiring site in March after years of complaints from neighbors near
the former location about the crowd of laborers.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Manuel Villacorte, who lives at the corner where the former
site was located, said initially he would cook breakfast for some of
the hungry workers. But the group grew to become a nuisance, at times
blocking traffic, drinking beer and tossing litter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Linda Parks said the city's intent was to
improve the situation for the neighborhood and for the laborers.</TE>
<TE>   But the new site, which is also in a residential area, is not a
much better solution, said Parks, who voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   She said she supports the laborers' efforts to find work but would
rather see them at a commercial location, possibly outside a home
improvement store, such as Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   "It impacts residents across the street who want to feel safe ...
and not have people who are essentially loitering when they're not
working," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents near the new site echoed those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Resident Michael Childers said there is no fountain at the new
hiring site and worries the men could wander into private yards in
search of water, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dubose said the laborers could get hurt because the new site is
located next to a sharp curve where cars tend to speed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not really a good place for them," Dubose said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the laborers have not felt any resistance to their
relocation, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They even celebrated the move with a barbecue Monday. The men,
many of whom send money to their families in Latin America, are
counting on the new site to bring them additional work, said Antonio
Romero, who frequently reminds fellow laborers not to litter at the
new site.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel a great happiness," said Juan Manuel Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   "We come to try to find honest work and help ourselves, and it is
a victory that they are taking us into consideration as a group."</TE>

<HD>Taking a Byte Out of Soccer</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Afshin Ghotbi is helping provide information to
South Korea's team through a computer program that's paying huge
dividends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>When Afshin Ghotbi arrived in the United States a quarter-century
ago, he had with him something that has carried him all the way to
the semifinals of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   It's called a love of the game, a passion for soccer that he
acquired on the streets and playgrounds of his native Tehran.</LD>
<LD>   Ghotbi was 13 when his family moved to California, and in all the
years since, he has tried to instill that same love of soccer in
youngsters in the U.S., first by playing alongside them and later by
coaching them.</LD>
<TE>   Ghotbi discovered and developed U.S. World Cup midfielder John
O'Brien, now starting for Dutch powerhouse Ajax Amsterdam. Ghotbi
discovered and developed U.S. Olympic team midfielder Peter Vagenas,
now playing for the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Both came to the fore at the American Global Soccer School that
Ghotbi founded in 1988 and is now run for him by former Galaxy
defender Dan Calichman.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other success stories, many of them, but none that
strains the imagination as much as the story Ghotbi is helping to
write here.</TE>
<TE>   At 38, he has stumbled upon something that could revolutionize
soccer worldwide. It's all stored in the laptop computer that almost
never leaves his side.</TE>
<TE>   That computer, along with the software within, has plucked Ghotbi
out of his home in Rancho Santa Margarita and deposited him on the
bench of one of the most successful teams in Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of watching the World Cup on television, the former
Glendale High and UCLA player is right here in the thick of it,
helping Coach Guus Hiddink make the decisions that have carried South
Korea to the final four.</TE>
<TE>   Ghotbi is one of 10 members of South Korea's technical staff, an
assistant coach in fact if not in name. He is the team's "match
analyst," a position new to soccer but likely to become increasingly
prevalent.</TE>
<TE>   While Ahn Jung-Hwan has been scoring goals, while Hong Myung-Bo
has been making tackles and while Lee Woon-Jae has been producing
saves--in short, while South Korea has been disposing of such
European "powers" as Poland and Portugal, Italy and Spain--Ghotbi has
kept his hard drive humming and clicking quietly in the background,
providing the technological underpinning to Hiddink's Korean miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Three things put Ghotbi in this position: a thorough knowledge of
soccer, an engineering degree from UCLA and the expertise to
understand and use a complicated but intriguing computer program.</TE>
<TE>   He is on the cutting edge of the sport, right at its forward
outpost, technologically speaking.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, a company is developing two-legged humanoid robots that
will have the ability to play soccer. In a sense, what Ghotbi has
inside his computer is an early version of a soccer brain for such
robots. But it is being used to help real flesh-and-blood players,
not science-fiction creations.</TE>
<TE>   On a rainy Monday afternoon in Seoul, Ghotbi took time out to give
a reporter a little insight into what he does.</TE>
<TE>   He flipped open a laptop and began hitting keys. In rapid
succession, graphics appeared, then videos. Before long, it was
apparent that what Ghotbi had in hand was every byte of information
on every World Cup team and player.</TE>
<TE>   Not only in the form of charts and graphs but in full-color,
full-screen video, capable of being manipulated in a dozen ways at
the touch of a button and then projected onto a large screen for
players and coaches to study.</TE>
<TE>   Want to know what German striker Miroslav Klose will do on a
corner kick from the right? Click here. Want to see how the Italian
defense reacts when attacked up the middle? Click here. Want to learn
how U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna positions himself when taking a
free kick from the left flank? Click here.</TE>
<TE>   It's all there, an invaluable database that Ghotbi has compiled
during the year and a half he has been working for Hiddink and South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   His enthusiasm for his job and the software program, developed in
Australia, is plain to see. So is the influence Hiddink and his Dutch
assistants have had on Ghotbi. He speaks of football but he means
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "What it does is allow you to digitize or bring in video
images--from satellite, VHS tape, or a digital camera that you can
use yourself," he said of the program. "You put [the images] in the
hard drive in your computer and, as they are coming in, you code
them.</TE>
<TE>   "So you actually are like a football librarian, placing images in
categories that you think are interesting or important to you....
Then later, when the coach wants to see any book, any chapter, any
page, any sentence, any word, it's there.</TE>
<TE>   "You can take the image and play it in slow motion, play it
backwards, freeze it, and you can draw on it, print it, everything.
It's brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sampson, former U.S. national team coach, sent Ghotbi down
this technology trail four years ago, just before the France '98
World Cup, with a software program recommended to Sampson by Norway's
coach, Egil Olsen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so late in the World Cup preparation that we didn't really
get to use it the way we wanted to use it," Ghotbi said. "But we used
it and we tried to motivate the players, show them tactical moments,
and so on."</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated by the potential, Ghotbi, who played for UCLA as a
walk-on under then-Bruin and now Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid between
1981 and '85, began exploring other software programs, finally
happening upon the Australian one and adding to it by creating his
own graphics.</TE>
<TE>   He became an expert and soon found himself traveling to Europe and
Asia to show club coaches the potential. On one such trip to Japan he
met Pim Verbeek, a Dutchman coaching a J-League second division team.</TE>
<TE>   When Verbeek became Hiddink's chief assistant with the South
Korean national team early last year, he recommended Ghotbi to
Hiddink. Ghotbi has been on the payroll ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievably tedious work," he said of inputting and sorting
all the data necessary, "but we literally knew everything about every
team we played."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's success at the World Cup is unprecedented. It became
the first Asian country to reach the semifinals and seemed to have
the measure of more experienced and higher-rated opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In part, that was because Ghotbi's data have been shared daily
with South Korea's players. Instead of watching simple video, they
are presented with individual breakdowns on the teams and opponents
and situations they will face. They know exactly what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Their own performances are analyzed too.</TE>
<TE>   "Every player, in my opinion, wants feedback," Ghotbi said. "If
you're a top professional, you want to know after a game, 'How did I
do? What did I do well? How didn't I do well? What can I improve on?'
And these images allow us to not only say it but show it."</TE>
<TE>   Ghotbi said the approach will become commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be one of the most important parts of the football of the
future because organization and detail are what separate good teams
from great teams, and Korea is a living example of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the Korean players on paper, they're not even
close to the Italians or the Spaniards. In salary, in quality, you
name it. But the Korean team is very tactically organized and has the
fighting spirit of a warrior.</TE>
<TE>   "The players go into every game knowing everything about their
opponents. They know exactly where the possibilities are when we
attack, and what we need to do defensively to not allow opponents
space to do the things they like to do."</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 World Cup has been a revelation to Ghotbi.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this experience for me in football has been the greatest
of my life," he said. "If this team wins the world championship, I
think we should all retire. We can never duplicate it. I don't think
so.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how any other nation would be able to support a team
like [the Korean fans] have. I don't see any other players who
surpass their qualities, who play better than their best, day in and
day out. What they have achieved already is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not Korean and I didn't know too much about Korea before I
took this job, but when I'm in the stadium and I see the 50,000 fans
and they play the Korean national anthem, I have goose bumps. Just
because I see the faces of the people and [realize] what this team
has brought them: pride, confidence, the ability to unite. I'm proud
of it."</TE>
<TE>   It's all a far cry from 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came to the States, people couldn't even spell soccer, but
it was my life," Ghotbi said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish more Americans could experience what's going on in the
streets and in the stadiums here, because they'd light up like a
Christmas tree when they realize what this game means."</TE>

<HD>Kile Left a Lasting Impact on Several Players, Teams</HD>

<LD>Theirs is a profession in which 40 is considered old, where time
passes so quickly that temporary is an upgrade from fleeting.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball players should be prepared for things to end quickly. But
life? One of their own found dead in what should still be the prime
of his career?</LD>
<LD>   If the weekend death of St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Darryl Kile at
age 33, from apparent blockage in his coronary arteries, showed how
short the time on this earth and in this league can be, it also
reinforced how much of an impact can be made in that span.</LD>
<TE>   Teams get broken up, players move around. But a little bit gets
left behind, things as simple as a haircut or a golf swing.</TE>
<TE>   Kile played for three major league teams in his career, but
outside of his current team it would be difficult to pinpoint any
club that felt more of an immediate hit.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Colorado Rockies, who opened a four-game series at Dodger
Stadium on Monday night. After coming up with the Houston Astros and
spending his first seven seasons there, Kile played for the Rockies
in 1998 and 1999. But just three years later there are only four
players left who wore Colorado's purple and black with him: right
fielder Larry Walker, first baseman Todd Helton, utility man Terry
Shumpert and pitcher John Thomson.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if there's not a lot of guys here, it hits home," Walker
said. "It's a baseball family, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   The current roster also includes pitchers Mike Hampton and Todd
Jones, who were with Kile in Houston, and Mark Little, who played
with Kile in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   You can probably find some connection to Hampton in every National
League clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' Jesse Orosco had one season with Kile in St. Louis.
(After 22 years in the big leagues, who hasn't Orosco played with?)</TE>
<TE>   When the Rockies heard the news of Kile's death on Saturday, "It
was a very, very somber day," Manager Clint Hurdle said. "There were
lots of heavy hearts on the field and in the clubhouse beforehand."</TE>
<TE>   There was some discussion about whether or not the Rockies or
those close to Kile should play.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that to pay our utmost respects to Darryl Kile and the
family, we all took the ball and played," Hurdle said. "That's just
what we decided, because that's all we saw him do for the two years
he was at Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   They face more decisions, including whether to attend a memorial
service Wednesday in St. Louis. Hampton and Walker have expressed an
interest. It should be less of an issue for Hampton, who pitched
Monday and won't come up in the rotation again until the weekend. But
Walker and anyone else who feels it's necessary should go. (Hampton
said after Monday's game that he and Walker will attend.)</TE>
<TE>   Baseball and division races don't seem very important right now. I
keep thinking about Kile's wife, Flynn, their 5-year-old twins,
Kannon and Sierra, and 10-month-old son, Ryker Davis.</TE>
<TE>   That's all I've been able to think about since Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon, with school out, the Dodger dugout looked
like a day-care center before the game. Players' kids scooted around
cracked-open sunflower seeds and played catch with the big leaguers
out on the field. I thought about what a special perk it must be to
have a father in Major League Baseball. And just like that, it's gone
for the Kile kids.</TE>
<TE>   Family was the first thing on Hampton's mind when he talked to
Thomson on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hampton was like, 'The hardest thing is to realize, when the
5-year-olds ask Mom, 'When's Dad coming home from the road trip?' "
Thomson said. "What's she going to tell them? 'He's not.' It's going
to be the biggest reality hit for the kids when the mom finally tells
them."</TE>
<TE>   Even after he was traded to St. Louis after the 1999 season, the
Kiles kept a home in Denver until last winter. The Walkers developed
a close friendship with them, and Larry Walker said his wife has
spoken to Flynn Kile.</TE>
<TE>   "Not much of a conversation," Walker said. "They were crying the
whole time."</TE>
<TE>   Thomson said that Darryl and Flynn "were basically like the
perfect couple."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has their own problems in their own house or whatever,
but you never saw them not smiling when they were together," Thomson
said. "You could tell how much they were in love with each other and
how much they loved their kids. It's going to be hard now.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be sad for the 5-year-olds, but the
10-month old is really never going to know who his dad was, other
than pictures and memories that his mom is going to tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "The 5-year-olds, they're 5. They didn't get to spend really any
time, just a few years that they're going to remember."</TE>
<TE>   Thomson remembers a friend and a mentor, the first pitcher to take
him aside and teach him.</TE>
<TE>   He'll think of him every time he looks in the mirror, sees his
bald head and remembers the time he and Kile decided to shave their
hair off in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He'll remember his golfing buddy. They could both shoot in the
70s, which made for some pretty competitive rounds.</TE>
<TE>   And he'll face one of those nagging little questions, the little
things that pop out of the void whenever someone dies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd always try to outdrive him, because he always hit the ball
longer than me," Thomson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who am I going to try to outdrive now?"</TE>

<HD>Texas Is Two Tough Now</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rangers sweep doubleheader, 8-5 and 3-2. Lackey,
a 23-year-old pitcher, is a bright spot for the Angels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>They came into town as hot as the Texas heat, the top hitting team in
the American League and a winner of four in a row.</LD>
<LD>   But the Angels ran into an even hotter team and lost a
doubleheader to the Texas Rangers on Monday night, 8-5 and 3-2, at
the Ballpark in Arlington in front of a crowd of 23,103.</LD>
<LD>   Yet amid the rubble, the Angels hope they found a diamond.</LD>
<TE>   John Lackey, a 23-year-old pitcher called up from the triple-A
Salt Lake Stingers to start the second game, went seven innings in
his major league debut, giving up three runs and six hits, striking
out six and walking one.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing seemed to faze Lackey. Not the fact that the Abilene,
Texas, native was pitching in front of relatives and friends. Not the
fact that he gave up a 433-foot home run to Alex Rodriguez in the
first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I had a pretty good start," said Lackey, who was sent
back to Salt Lake after the game, right-hander Matt Wise called up to
fill his roster spot. "It's not my time, but hopefully it will come
soon."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia hopes his team's time to return to the
win column will come even sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even look at the standings," he said. "Our challenge is
internal. Our club had a bad night, but we'll come back and win
Tuesday. I know this group."</TE>
<TE>   Ranger right-hander Dave Burba (4-4) got the victory in the
nightcap, Texas' seventh in a row, with reliever Hideki Irabu picking
up his 14th save by getting David Eckstein to bounce out to the mound
with the tying run on third in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Benoit (2-0) beat Aaron Sele (6-5) in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad continued his hot hitting by going five for nine in
the doubleheader with two home runs and three RBIs in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   The way the first game began, it appeared the Rangers would be the
ones facing a long evening.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels looked as if they were still in Milwaukee, teeing off
on every poor soul who took the mound. After scoring 24 runs in
sweeping the Brewers over the weekend, the Angels scored three runs
in the first two innings Monday. A first-inning run came across when
Ranger first baseman Mike Lamb's throw to the plate on a chopper with
the bases loaded was high, allowing Erstad to score.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, who had eight hits and seven runs batted in in the Brewer
series, also started off as if he were still in Miller Park. After
his first-inning single, he hit the first of his two home runs,
driving in Jorge Fabregas ahead of him in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   That gave the Angels a 3-0 lead against Benoit, a 24-year-old
making only his third major league start. Benoit threw 35 pitches in
the first inning, 52 after two. With 88-degree heat, high humidity
and the league's best-hitting team in front of him, his chances for
success seemed as dark as the stormy sky above him.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, it was his Angel counterpart, Sele, not Benoit,
who withered.</TE>
<TE>   Sele lasted only 4 1/3 innings, giving up nine hits and five runs,
his ERA ballooning to 5.54, while Benoit, surrendering only two
earned runs and five hits in five innings, his ERA improving to 3.00.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen the best of Aaron Sele yet," said Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia. "Hopefully his consistency will come around."</TE>
<TE>   Sele certainly didn't dispute Scioscia's assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell behind more than half the hitters I faced," he said. "It
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that is not the right
way to pitch."</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that shaky
pitching and shaky defense are a bad mix. For a while, the Angels'
defense had been flawless. When Troy Glaus made an error Saturday in
Milwaukee, it ended a streak of 98 innings over eleven games plus of
errorless ball for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   But with the bases loaded for the Rangers in the sixth inning and
Texas leading, 5-3, Herbert Perry's ground ball went under the glove
of Eckstein, the Angel shortstop, allowed two crucial runs to score.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, the Texas third baseman, also had three hits in the game
and drove in a pair of runs. Designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro and
second baseman Michael Young had two RBIs each.</TE>
<TE>   Even with their two victories, the Rangers, last in the AL West,
still trail the division-leading Seattle Mariners by 12 games. The
view from where the Angels sit is a lot better. With the Mariners
losing Monday, the Angels dropped only half a game, leaving them 2
1/2 back.</TE>

<LD>Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News commenting on arrogant
Barry Bonds: " ... What must be understood about Bonds is that he
basically views reporters as cockroaches who have invaded his throne
room.</LD>
<LD>   "He has never understood why he, Barry Bonds, the blue-blooded son
of former star Bobby Bonds and godson of former superstar Willie
Mays, should lower himself to answer questions from losers who
couldn't play big league baseball ...</LD>
<LD>   " ... He has such contempt for those asking him the questions that
he invariably says something that infuriates fans. He's
self-defeatingly contrary.</LD>
<TE>   " ... Bonds was born with a Silver Slugger in mouth, and life
never taught him much perspective, humility or gratitude."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for most assists in a

<TE>   Naughty, naughty: Anna Kournikova was wearing tight black shorts
and a white T-shirt while practicing at Wimbledon--against the rules
of the All-England Club, which demands white clothing.</TE>
<TE>   She was spotted by a tournament official and was forced to borrow
a pair of white shorts from her coach, Harold Solomon.</TE>
<TE>   Then she had to cut out the logo on the shorts because the
manufacturer was a rival of her sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   His legacy: Dwight Chapin of the San Francisco Chronicle recalls
that Hank Luisetti, the Stanford basketball star of the 1930s, who
turned 86 recently, is still remembered for introducing the
one-handed shot in a game against Long Island University on Dec. 30,
1936, at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford's victory ended LIU's 43-game winning streak. Wrote
Chapin: "Luisetti's one-handers on that big stage in New York
revolutionized the game, as young players across the nation copied
his style."</TE>
<TE>   Tedious: Gary Peterson of the Contra Costa Times commenting on
Sergio Garcia's agonizing pre-shot routine: "Imagine the chaos that
would ensue if Play and Rewind ever staged an epic battle for a
golfer's soul.</TE>
<TE>   "Where other players live by the credo, 'Grip it and rip it,'

<HD>Mysterious Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They might get Miller, they might keep
their picks. Even they aren't sure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers are going to trade the eighth and 12th picks in the NBA
draft Wednesday, plus forward Corey Maggette, to get standout point
guard Andre Miller from the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Unless they don't.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe they will deal the 12th pick and keep the No. 8.</LD>
<TE>   Or maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they won't deal at all.</TE>
<TE>   Or ...</TE>
<TE>   This much is certain: The draft begins at 4:30 p.m. at Madison
Square Garden in New York and will be shown live on TNT.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Clippers, who acknowledged Monday that they have been
speaking to the Cavaliers about Miller, seem hazy on what they expect
to happen Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A deal with Cleveland hinges on the Cavaliers' willingness to
trade Miller and begin an overhaul of the roster.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Clippers were involved in discussions with the
Chicago Bulls about swapping the second overall pick--which turned
out to be high school sensation Tyson Chandler--to get power forward
Elton Brand.</TE>
<TE>   The talks progressed as the draft began, ending with Chandler and
Brian Skinner going to Chicago for Brand.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario could be repeated Wednesday, with the Clippers
holding two high picks in the first round and one, at No. 41 overall,
in the second. The Clippers, 39-43 last season, are bent on
continuing their slow but steady improvement.</TE>
<TE>   There have been persistent rumors that the Clippers will package
picks and/or current players in order to get a point guard to replace
Jeff McInnis, an unrestricted free agent whose fiery demeanor
troubled Coach Alvin Gentry and several teammates at times last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Until the last few days, the most frequently mentioned Clippers
involved in possible trades were forward Lamar Odom and center
Michael Olowokandi. But General Manager Elgin Baylor has sought to
quash any notions of a deal involving either.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't believe everything you read," Baylor said. "There's
nothing to it. We're talking to teams. We're listening to teams. None
of the teams above us [in the draft order] are willing to move
down.... We have not talked to any team [about Odom]. Any team that's
asked about Lamar we've told, 'We're not trading Lamar.' We have not
called any other team and asked about trading Lamar.... We don't want
to move Michael."</TE>
<TE>   With that said, Baylor added, "There are only two untouchables in
the league, Shaq [O'Neal] and Tim Duncan."</TE>
<TE>   To which Gentry said, "No, because you could trade Shaq for Tim
Duncan."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers do appear in need of a point guard if McInnis isn't
to be re-signed. They could be in luck if the Cavaliers decide to
trade Miller, who will become a free agent after the 2002-03 season,
although sending them picks plus Maggette--or perhaps Quentin
Richardson--could be a steep price to pay.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Clippers could end up keeping their picks, although Duke
point guard Jay Williams is expected to be taken by the Bulls as the
second overall pick, after the Houston Rockets take center Yao Ming
from China.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what's going to happen between now and the draft,"
Baylor said. "The closer it gets, the more teams are going to be
willing to talk trades."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about simply keeping the picks, Baylor said, "We're
looking for a player to help us--if not immediately, then down the
line."</TE>
<TE>   Should the Clippers make their selections, it could be awhile
before the first-round picks crack the starting lineup. The Clippers
are loaded, if a wee bit inexperienced. Brand, Odom and Olowokandi
form a versatile front line, with veteran Eric Piatkowski at shooting
guard and a glaring question mark at the point.</TE>
<TE>   One way to solve the void at the point would be to sign Marko
Jaric, their second-round pick in the 2000 draft. Jaric, who is 6
feet 7, has until July 15 to opt out of his contract with his Italian
club team and sign with the Clippers, holders of his NBA rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking, trying to work out the details with his agent,"
Baylor said. "Jaric is considered one of the best point guards in
Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Odom, considered one of the game's most versatile players, has
played the point on occasion. But, at 6-10, he's a good deal more
effective closer to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Odom is coming off season-ending surgery on his right wrist. The
cast was removed two weeks ago, and he has been cleared to begin
dribbling a basketball as part of his rehabilitation exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling, a third-year player who missed much of last season
because of a badly sprained ankle, doesn't have the experience to run
the point the way the Clippers need it to be run.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their last four drafts, the Clippers will be adding depth
with their picks, rather than filling glaring holes on the roster.
Last season, they dealt for Brand. In 2000, they picked Darius Miles,
a key reserve forward, third overall. In 1999, they took Odom fourth.
In 1998, they selected Olowokandi first.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to get [are] good players," Gentry said. "We'll take
veteran players if they're good players. We want to add talent. We're
not in the market to get a player just because he's a veteran.
Hopefully, we draft a good player and he has to earn his way into the
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have a tough time playing ahead of guys who were
here last year."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Slowed Down by Hampton</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Colorado pitcher sets aside emotions of difficult
week and stops L.A.'s five-game win streak in Rockies' 4-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a wide range of emotions Colorado pitcher Mike Hampton must have
felt on the Dodger Stadium mound Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   There was the frustration of a miserable season--Hampton began
Monday's game with a 3-8 record and 7.07 earned-run average--that had
the left-hander, in the second year of an eight-year, $121-million
contract, on the verge of a demotion to the bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   And there was the profound grief from the loss of St. Louis
pitcher Darryl Kile, his friend and former Houston Astro teammate
whose death Saturday so devastated Hampton that he couldn't even talk
about it.</LD>
<TE>   It was a one-two punch that could have floored many players, but
Hampton found the strength to muster up one of his best games of the
season, leading the Rockies to a 4-1 victory before a crowd of 34,641
and ending the Dodger win streak at five.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton gave up one run and five hits in six innings, striking out
two and walking one, and he also homered off Dodger starter Kazuhisa
Ishii in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Before every game I pitch I say a prayer," said Hampton, who will
fly with teammate Larry Walker to St. Louis for Kile's memorial
service Wednesday. "I said a prayer for his family, [his wife] Flynn
and the kids. Just for them to be strong and get through this
somehow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a while, but they're going to find a way to
get through this. She's got a job to tell her kids every day how much
their daddy loved them, especially the youngest one. The biggest
thing I think about is Ryker, the 10-month old. He never had a chance
to know his daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Though Kile was "in my thoughts and my prayers and in my heart,"
Hampton knew he had a job to do Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to get back to business, get back to pitching and playing
a game that I loved and he loved," Hampton said. "He's inside. But
tonight was me going out and doing my best."</TE>
<TE>   Hampton's only blemish was Shawn Green's home run in the first,
which hardly came as a shock.</TE>
<TE>   Green has a lifetime .684 average with three homers and 11 runs
batted in against Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   But Hampton did retire Green on a one-hopper to the mound in the
fourth inning, and he got Green to bounce into a 4-6-3 double play to
end the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers threatened in the ninth off closer Jose Jimenez,
putting runners on first and second with one out, but Eric Karros,
who was batting .328 with runners in scoring position, bounced into a
game-ending 6-3 double play.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the Dodgers' only potential loss. Catcher Paul Lo
Duca, who is batting .306 with 18 doubles and 31 RBIs, suffered a
mild strain of his left groin running out a grounder in the first
inning, left the game in the fifth and was listed as day to day.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have more information [today], but right now it doesn't
appear that serious," Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt a cramping between his stomach muscle and groin. Rather
than push him, we pulled the plug on it."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii (11-3) survived a rocky start, when he gave up three runs
and five hits and walked three in the first two innings, leaving the
bases loaded twice.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his pattern of early trouble, followed by dominance,
Ishii blanked Colorado on two hits over the next five innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried everything," Tracy said, when asked what the Dodgers
could do to improve Ishii's early-inning performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the next step is to have him pitch a few innings before the
game. Let's get him on one of those half-fields like we have in
spring training."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's first-inning rally, which was aided by shortstop Cesar
Izturis' error, included RBI singles by Todd Zeile and Juan Uribe,
the Rockies' shortstop who also made two outstanding plays in the
hole to rob Izturis of hits in the sixth and ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Green's homer in the bottom of the first pulled the Dodgers within
2-1 and gave him 23 homers and 59 RBIs, with 20 of those homers
coming in his last 31 games. Green is third in the National League in
homers behind Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds and third in RBIs behind
Lance Berkman and Colorado's Todd Helton, but few seem to have
noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Green is 14th among NL outfielders in All-Star voting, and one
spot ahead of Green in the balloting is Armando Rios, a part-time
Pittsburgh outfielder who is batting .257 with no homers and nine
RBIs.</TE>

<HD>He's All Wigged Out About First-Place Dodgers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here we are in first place all by ourselves, goose bumps and all on
Fuzz Head Wig Night at the stadium, and now they're telling me
there's some kind of rule prohibiting me from wearing an official
white and blue wig in the Dodger press box.</LD>
<LD>   You can imagine my disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   DOWN IN the Dodger clubhouse before the game, management wheeled
in a 2002 Vespa, the motor scooter painted in Dodger colors with the
team's insignia on the sides and seat. A baseball-shaped case was
attached to the rear of the scooter to hold a Dodger batting helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win the World Series," I told Shawn Green and Eric Karros,
"I'll buy the cycle, wear the Dodger helmet and lead the championship
parade."</TE>
<TE>   A Dodger spokesman chimed in: "We're holding you to that."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't surprised; I couldn't imagine anyone else offering to buy
the bike.</TE>
<TE>   A team spokesman said the cycle sells for $4,500, but that was
before Green and Karros autographed it, so I could probably afford
the $2,500 it's worth now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS I made my way from locker to locker Monday in the Dodger
clubhouse, sidestepping the moat and landmines that mark Kevin
Brown's hole, I thought about how far we've come together this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Where were you when we started the season 0-3?" said catcher Paul
Lo Duca, and how quickly we forget. Lo Duca was one for 12 in the
first three games of the season, and I believe I was two for three in
column writing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE IMPORTANT thing now is we're in first place together.</TE>
<TE>   "What's this 'we' stuff?" Karros said. "Aren't you going on
vacation for a month starting next week?"</TE>
<TE>   I wonder what that means when the athletes in town have my
vacation schedule memorized.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE VACATION does start Monday, and Karros said, "We wouldn't want
you concerned, worried or checking the box scores to see how we're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   I thought it was very thoughtful of Karros to tell me to just go
away.</TE>
<TE>   But when he said he'd like to see me riding the Dodger motor
scooter around the stadium naked after the team wins the World
Series, I was worried maybe the wrong guy was taking the vacation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I mentioned to Brian Jordan "there's no stopping us now that
we're in first place," he replied, "Oh, no!"</TE>
<TE>   I was a little surprised he'd disagree with me like that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW IF Eric Gagne had been the slug he had been a year
ago--pitching at this time of the year in Las Vegas--all those media
people who had predicted we wouldn't be this good this season
would've looked a lot smarter than they do now. I could name names,
but Plaschke gets upset when I do that.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, a former hockey player obviously thrilled at playing a
sport some people actually watch, went into Monday night's game with
27 saves in 28 opportunities, a 1.14 earned-run average and 57
strikeouts in a little more than 39 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I'm surprised--like you," said Gagne with a grin. "I always
had confidence in myself, but the Dodgers had given me six or seven
chances, and I didn't know how long they were going to stay with me.
I guess I just had to pay my dues."</TE>
<TE>   I asked him if he scares himself looking into a mirror. If he
thinks he looks like "Wild Thing" Charlie Sheen in the movie, "Major
League." If his wife has told him he's ugly with that hairy growth
hanging from his chin.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife likes it," he said, so we're talking true love here. "I
usually shaved it every year in spring training because Tom Lasorda
would make me. He didn't say anything this year."</TE>
<TE>   Lasorda keeping his mouth shut--we never could have predicted that
either when this season began.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A FEW years ago Gagne, and a buddy who is now a construction
worker in Montreal, had $150 between the two of them, and they used
it to have small green four-leaf clovers tattooed to their shoulders
with their initials.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Gagne remains broke, pitching now under a
salt-sweat-stained baseball cap torn in four different places and
looking as if a family of hamsters has been using it as a nest. "It
doesn't smell," Gagne said, and we took his word for it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE MIGHT not be here in first place without Manager Jim Tracy, and
I would like to have heard his secret to success, but I couldn't
bring myself to talk with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to Tracy," Times columnist Diane Pucin had written in the
morning newspaper, "and you will want to run wind sprints until you
puke."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure now I can ever talk to him again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M THINKING of going to Edison Field on Saturday to spend one
more night with our guys before taking time off to learn how to ride
a motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BCS' decision to drop the margin of victory from computer
rankings will not have any impact on USC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WILL be on assignment again today--playing in the 20th annual
Tom Flores Boy Scout Invitational at Pelican Hill to benefit
youngsters with disabilities. I mention this because it's Tom Flores'
tournament, the former Raider coach, and a number of former Raiders
will be participating and I never like to go anywhere with that many
Raiders in one place without letting folks know of my whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Connie:</TE>
<TE>   "I opened Sunday's paper, turned to the second page of sports, and
it was like I had won the lottery. You were on assignment, and I
didn't have to waste my valuable time reading one of your dumb
columns."</TE>
<TE>   Glad to see you put that time to good use e-mailing me.</TE>

<HD>Captured as a Pawn of Politics</HD>
<DH>North Korea allegedly kidnapped dozens of Japanese to abet
the cause of Communism. The parents of one have sought her since
1983.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KOBE, Japan</DL>
<LD>After nearly two decades of tears, anguish and bureaucratic
frustration, the Arimoto family finally met their daughter's
kidnapper.</LD>
<LD>   For years, they'd imagined what they would say to the person
responsible for taking their round-faced Keiko away so many years
before. How they'd convey the pain and anger they'd suffered, and the
fear as they'd imagined the worst, before finally learning years
later that the 23-year-old had been lured to Communist North
Korea--where she may still be alive.</LD>
<LD>   Then self-confessed kidnapper Megumi Yao walked into their hotel
suite in Yokohama, fell to the floor and begged forgiveness. Keiko's
mother, Kayoko Arimoto, found herself weeping with Yao and trying to
comfort her.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't really get mad at her," Arimoto says. "She was crying
so much. It just made me cry as well."</TE>
<TE>   One of the strangest chapters in North Korea's bizarre recent
history involves the totalitarian regime's alleged practice during
the 1970s and '80s of kidnapping Japanese--11 by official count, and
as many as 70 according to Japanese abductee groups.</TE>
<TE>   The victims ranged in age from 13 to 52 at the time they are said
to have been taken from Europe and Japan for various purposes: to
help train North Korean spies, to serve as wives for other kidnapped
Japanese or, eventually, to help spread a Communist revolution to
Japan. The North Korean government vehemently denies there were
abductions, or having any role in Keiko's disappearance from London,
but has nonetheless said it will search for the missing.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Keiko's father kept up a lonely fight for information
on the whereabouts of his lost daughter. He hounded Japanese police,
Foreign Ministry bureaucrats and slick politicians who refused to
listen to or believe him, brushing him off with one excuse or
another. It wasn't their jurisdiction. They couldn't do anything
without a body. She'd probably met someone and run away.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern over the years has been the lack of activity by the
Japanese government," said Christopher Poll, who was Keiko's host
father in England at the time of her disappearance. "It completely
failed to protect its people despite evidence that something had
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Ten days after Yao met with the Arimotos in March, she voluntarily
testified before the Tokyo District Court in a further bid to assuage
her guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Her testimony electrified the nation, as she described how she'd
sidled up to Keiko after trying to snare two other young Japanese.
How she'd earned Keiko's trust by playing up their shared upbringing
before delivering the hook: a job offer and the lure of an exciting
life overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi discussed the issue during their Tokyo summit. And
after Yao's confession, Japan officially listed Keiko as abducted by
North Korea--a step sought by her father for years.</TE>
<TE>   At a Japanese-North Korean Red Cross meeting in Beijing in late
April, North Korea agreed to step up its search for Japanese "lost"
in its country. The pledge was made even though the government has
"searched" before to no avail, decrying as recently as December
Japan's "fuss" over the "nonexistent" issue.</TE>
<TE>   The obstacles ahead are daunting: The two countries have
technically been at war for more than half a century. And it may be
difficult to get a sovereign nation--and a mercurial one, at that--to
admit it's been in the kidnapping business.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the impediments, the Arimotos still hold out hope that
they'll one day see their daughter alive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keiko was born Jan. 12, 1960, the third of six children, and grew
up in the same house her parents live in today. Family members recall
her as an easy baby and a quiet child. Her grandfather, who refused
to baby-sit for the youngest children, gladly cared for Keiko. Ask
her to do anything, her mother recalls, and she'd bow her head
politely and say yes.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko's four sisters and a brother always had loads of friends
running through the house. Keiko was a quiet soul and tended to get
lost in the shuffle. Her one close girlhood friend, Masae Koya,
remembers how serious, and distinctly unimpressive, she appeared to
most of her teachers and classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Keiko would let loose and show a wilder side, her
mother says, by laughing and carrying on, but generally only with her
younger sister Ikuko. In high school, Keiko started studying English
in earnest. Her mother believes that this represented less a thirst
for foreign culture than an interest in the technical aspects of
linguistics. Ikuko disagrees, citing her sister's keen interest in
British pop bands.</TE>
<TE>   There are other signs that Keiko was trying to stretch her wings.
She moved out of the house toward the end of high school, a
relatively unusual step in Japan, and enrolled in college classes at
night, staying with an unmarried aunt.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1982, armed with an Anglo-American studies degree, she
graduated from the Kobe City University of Foreign Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko enrolled in an English-language school in London. Perhaps
anticipating her parents' displeasure, she paid the tuition before
telling them with savings earned from sewing jobs and other part-time
work. Grudgingly, they gave their blessing, never expecting they'd
never see her again.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko wrote home every few weeks through the spring of 1983. A
sister and her aunt visited her in London that May, and Keiko told
them she'd be home soon. A postcard to her parents dated June 6 said
she'd arrive in Osaka on Singapore Airlines at 17:15 on Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, her English host family started to get some
very different signals from the shy, unworldly young woman, says
Poll, her host father.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of May, she suddenly announced she was going away
for the weekend with friends. Poll says he was surprised, given that
she appeared to have no real friends, but she would give no details.
She was even more evasive and distant when she returned, and
announced a few weeks later that she was leaving two months early.</TE>
<TE>   "She was totally transformed overnight," Poll says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Korea experts say that, in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
the government adopted a policy of abducting Japanese to help teach
its spies Japanese customs and language, to provide wives for
Japanese abductees or Red Army radicals who'd hijacked a Japan Air
Lines jet to the Communist state in 1970 and to help export the
revolution to Japan. Three people, including Keiko, are said to have
been taken from Europe, the rest from Japan, including couples seized
while relaxing on deserted Japanese beaches reportedly frequented by
North Korean spy ships.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko--young, impressionable and without a husband or
boyfriend--apparently fit a profile. Yao's instructions in the spring
of 1983, she says, were to recruit "Japanese women under 25" in
Europe who were honest, obedient, imbued with a strong sense of duty
and free of strong political views. Once in North Korea, the women
would become wives for two men previously kidnapped from Spain and
the beginning of an envisioned "Japan Revolutionary Village."</TE>
<TE>   Yao initially tried to draw in two other women at Keiko's school
before realizing they had boyfriends or husbands and were tough
prospects. She settled on Keiko, who was just wrapping up her
language program, and won her trust by emphasizing their childhoods
in Japan's Kansai region.</TE>
<TE>   "She was perfect," Yao testified. "I convinced myself that
cheating people was unavoidable, and I believed at that time in what
I was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Yao met secretly with her North Korean handler that spring in
Zagreb, Croatia, then part of the former Yugoslav federation, and
they decided to spring the trap in Copenhagen. Denmark was one of the
few Western countries that had diplomatic relations with North Korea,
which would protect the North Korean diplomat working with her if he
was caught.</TE>
<TE>   Yao returned to London and proceeded to sell Keiko on the idea of
marketing work in North Korea. The "job interview" was set for July
16 in Copenhagen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic she was offered a market research job in a country
with no real market," Keiko's mother says.</TE>
<TE>   Keiko apparently was so eager and so trusting that she arrived in
Copenhagen two weeks early and waited for the meeting, which took
place in a Chinese restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Yao's handler, Kimihiro Abe, played the part of the trading
company president, and the North Korean diplomat, Kim Yu Chol, stood
in as a ginseng trader.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be fun, and it's very interesting work," Yao told Keiko.
After hearing about the work, plus free food and lodging, Keiko
agreed. They held her passport overnight before whisking her the
following day onto a flight bound for the Stalinist state via Moscow.
Yao waved goodbye at the airport. She says it was the last time she
saw Keiko.</TE>
<TE>   "It's even more eerie that she wasn't even forced," Keiko's mother
says. "My God! If she'd only reconsidered and returned to Japan."</TE>
<TE>   It would take nearly 20 years, however, for Keiko's parents to
piece together many of these details. All they knew in the summer of
1983 was that they hadn't heard from their daughter in a while.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 8, they received a telegram saying she'd gotten a job and
would arrive home sometime later. They went to meet the Singapore
Airlines flight anyway in hopes she'd changed her mind. Then, in
mid-October, they got a last, vague letter postmarked Copenhagen with
no details for contacting her. Certain weather references were also
suspicious, suggesting it was written earlier, says author Koji
Takazawa in his book "Destiny," about Japanese revolutionaries and
abductees in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In the years that followed, the family came to suspect that Keiko
had been murdered or forced into prostitution, even as they reread
every note from her dozens of times, checked their mailbox
incessantly and jumped whenever the phone rang at an unusual hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In September 1988, the Arimotos got a call from a family on
Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. They said they'd just received a
letter from their son, last seen in Spain in 1980, saying he was with
Keiko in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, which described life as tough and filled with
shortages of food, clothing and books, included Keiko's insurance
card as well as photos of the pair. It had evidently been smuggled
out of North Korea and mailed from then-Soviet bloc Poland,
presumably by some East European diplomat or delegation member.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry for making you worry so much," it concluded. "I just want
you to know we're alive."</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the two families reflected on their fate. In a nation
where bloodlines are often joined by arranged marriage, theirs
appeared to be joined by abduction.</TE>
<TE>   It quickly became apparent how their philosophies differed.
Akihiro Arimoto, a tough, salt-of-the-earth entrepreneur running a
ball-bearing factory, has waged a fearless fight for his daughter,
condemning both Japan and the North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to get Keiko back, he concluded early on, was to go
public.</TE>
<TE>   "When something's so obviously wrong, you must oppose it," he
says, spitting out his words. "My priority has been to keep pushing
the government and the worthless politicians who haven't done their
jobs. They should be trying to save my daughter."</TE>
<TE>   His "in-laws," on the other hand, have not identified themselves
in public. They believe the best way to get their son home is to
studiously avoid confrontation or publicity and instead trust
Japanese diplomats to reach some understanding with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Just sneaking that letter out probably risked his life," said his
older brother. "Our family believes making noise will jeopardize his
safety."</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapper Yao's change of heart was the result of growing
disenchantment with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, who had socialist leanings, moved to North Korea voluntarily
in 1977. She says she was forced to marry one of the Japanese
hijackers. They had two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, she believed in the cause, she says. Later, however,
operatives in North Korea would have to exert pressure on her, using
her children as hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after the Keiko operation, Yao returned to Japan. She
says she hopes her apologies and testimony can in some way repair the
damage to the Arimotos and families of other victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so sorry," Yao said from the witness stand. "I have done
things no human should do."</TE>
<TE>   Keiko's parents think they would recognize Keiko. Her mother
worries she could have been brainwashed but hopes she could become a
caring person even with all she's been through.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, they're aware that time is running out for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I can feel myself getting weaker and older every day," the
76-year-old Kayoko says with tears in her eyes. "All I want is to see
my daughter before I die."</TE>

<HD>Karzai Swears In Afghan Cabinet</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>President Hamid Karzai swore in his new Cabinet on Monday, having won
over a candidate who threatened to start an opposition party but
without having filled the women's affairs post.</LD>
<LD>   Younis Qanooni, the interior minister in the former interim
government, accepted jobs as education minister and as special
security advisor to Karzai. On Sunday, Qanooni had said he was
considering forming a political party to oppose Karzai, but he
changed his mind at the urging of supporters.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai has not filled the position of women's affairs minister
since the outgoing head of the ministry, Sima Simar, opted for the
lower-profile job of human rights commissioner. The outspoken Simar
has been sharply criticized by many in the religious establishment
who believe women have no place in public affairs.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai said he planned to offer the post to Mahboba Aoqoqmal,
deputy chair of this month's Afghan grand council, or loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   The ministers took their oaths in the tree-shaded courtyard of the
presidential palace in Kabul, the capital. Four guards in military
dress stood by as the national anthem was played.</TE>
<TE>   The ministers, who will earn an average of $100 a month, sat on
chairs around a table perched on Afghan carpets. Most wore Western
dress. Karzai arrived later, wearing a gray lambskin hat and black
coat, and took a seat at the head of the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to be very honest with all the promises I made to the
Afghan people," he said. "I'm going to do my best for my people and
my homeland."</TE>
<TE>   The new government will hold power for 18 months, until elections
are held.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With his new blueprint for defusing the Israeli-Palestinian
confrontation, President Bush is accepting far more responsibility
than he initially sought for ending violence in the Middle East. But
for the plan to work, Bush may have to take on far more
responsibility yet.</LD>
<LD>   In a nod to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Bush argued that
negotiations on the major issues dividing Israel and the Palestinians
should come only after comprehensive reform and the election of "new
leaders" in the Palestinian Authority--presumably meaning the removal
of its current leader, Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   But such reforms, difficult under any circumstances, may not be
possible without vastly intensified U.S. involvement in the grueling
work of restructuring Palestinian institutions and nurturing
political alternatives to Arafat. Meeting the tests Bush established
in his speech could carry him into the kind of "nation-building" for
which he frequently criticized the Clinton administration.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't see any other alternative; otherwise, the Palestinians
themselves won't take reform seriously," said Gary J. Schmitt,
executive director of the Project for a New American Century, a
hawkish think tank. "It's not on the scale of rebuilding Japan or
Germany, but there is certainly the case that this is
nation-building."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Sen. Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said after
the speech: "Now that the president has dictated the terms, America
has a responsibility through continued engagement to help achieve the
results."</TE>
<TE>   Though fiercely blunt at points--particularly in the call for
Palestinians to elect new leaders--the speech was notable as much for
what Bush didn't say.</TE>
<TE>   The president offered no hints of U.S. views about the possible
final settlement of the underlying issues dividing the two sides,
from the ultimate borders of a Palestinian state to where Palestinian
refugees might be allowed to resettle.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was much more specific on the internal reforms he
expectsbefore negotiations on those issues can proceed. He called on
the Palestinians to write a new constitution, invest their parliament
with "the full authority of a legislative body," devolve more
specific powers to local officials, develop independent courts,
accept an "externally supervised effort" to rebuild their security
services and hold "fair multi-party local elections by the end of the
year, with national elections to follow."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, he urged the Palestinians to produce "leaders not
compromised by terror."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even on this front, Bush left several key points vague. He
offered no hint of how the U.S. will proceed if the Palestinians
don't reform their leadership. And although he strongly suggested
that Arafat should be removed, he never mentioned him by name--a
point senior administration officials noted after the address.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Bush specify when he would ask Israelis to take the steps
he urged on them: withdrawing military forces from the West Bank
positions they now hold, freezing new activity in settlements in the
occupied territories and providing Palestinians more freedom of
movement. All of those moves Bush conditioned on "progress on
security," a phrase that Sharon and Arab leaders are likely to define
in very different terms.</TE>
<TE>   Though the address generally drew praise from Democrats as well as
Republicans, the few notes of criticism focused on unanswered
questions. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who is exploring a bid for
the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, charged that the
speech was too "one-dimensional" and too focused on internal
Palestinian reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it brings us very far at all," he said. "I agree
that ... reform and transition is important.... But I don't think
there is enough vision in here of [a final agreement] that will allow
politicians ... on all sides to hold on to."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was precisely that focus on internal Palestinian reform
that drew the loudest applause from Jewish groups, leading
conservatives and some Democrats. Amplifying the theme from his
earlier addresses, Bush moved the demand for Palestinian change to
the center of the Mideast peace process.</TE>
<TE>   That emphasis brought Bush back in line with U.S. conservatives.
As the president in recent months has oscillated between denouncing
Arafat and urging restraint on Sharon, the right has grown uneasy
with his policy in the region--an uneasiness that intensified as
recent reports indicated that Bush in this address would support the
declaration of a provisional Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did, in fact, embrace that idea. But by demanding fundamental
internal reform before the U.S. would support such a state--in effect
by making the provisional state conditional--Bush drew praise from a
wide range of conservatives, including neoconservatives such as
Schmitt, religious conservatives such as televangelist Pat Robertson,
and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   In the region, the heavy stress on reform as the precondition
toward progress on Palestinian statehood represents a gamble. On the
one hand, analysts say, Bush is trying to wean average Palestinians
away from Arafat by offering the prospect of their own state--with a
more vibrant economy and clearly defined civil liberties--if they
install new leadership.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, this approach risks generating restiveness
among other Arab countries and increased violence from Palestinian
extremists by asking so little of Israel in the short run and
offering an extended timeline for an independent Palestine. In his
address, Bush said an accord might be reached in three years "with
intensive effort by all of us."</TE>
<TE>   In the months ahead, one critical question may be whether the
combination of foreign pressure and aid that Bush envisions can
produce enough tangible improvement in the day-to-day lives of
Palestinians to outweigh disappointment over the deferral of progress
toward independence and statehood.</TE>
<TE>   With his sweeping vision of a transformed society, Bush seemed to
be setting himself in competition for the hearts and minds of average
Palestinians--offering order and prosperity as an alternative to the
nationalism and grievance that have defined Palestinian public life
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   After all of Bush's hesitance about assuming too much
responsibility in the region--an instinct still visible Monday in the
lack of specifics about next steps--the real test may be whether he
has the stomach and the stamina to carry that competition through the
inevitable reversals ahead, some of them sure to be measured in
blood.</TE>

<LD>A 45-day countdown for 3,000 white Zimbabwean farmers to abandon
their land began today, but many vowed to stay put rather than watch
vital crops rot as the nation is short of food.</LD>
<LD>   The farmers had been given until midnight Monday to stop working
the land and just over a month to leave entirely after President
Robert Mugabe's government amended its land acquisition law last
month.</LD>
<LD>   But Jenni Williams, spokeswoman for the Commercial Farmers' Union,
said the farmers would finalize papers today seeking a court ruling
to stop the order.</LD>

<HD>Hong Kong's Leader Solidifies His Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Tung Chee-hwa, the Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong, reinforced his
grip on the former British colony Monday, appointing 14 Cabinet
ministers who will report to him alone.</LD>
<LD>   The new officials include career bureaucrats left over from
British colonial rule, pro-China businessmen and an eye doctor. No
representatives of the Democratic Party were appointed, even though
it has the largest single bloc of seats in the legislature.</LD>
<LD>   The new team will assume key portfolios and run the 180,000-strong
civil service. It will give orders to senior civil servants who have
run the bureaucracy since Britain's hand-over to China in 1997 but
whom Tung found resistant to changes he wished to make.</LD>
<TE>   Tung said he has created an "accountability system" that will run
the territory more smoothly, but critics believe that the new system
will only increase his power and boost Beijing's control over Hong
Kong, which was promised a high level of autonomy under Chinese rule.</TE>
<TE>   "No accountability system in the world is like this," said
lawmaker Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party. "It's got nothing
to do with accountability to the people. I call it a sham."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have questioned whether there can be any accountability in
the new system when neither Tung nor the 14 new ministers were
popularly elected.</TE>
<TE>   Since Hong Kong was returned to China, its apolitical civil
service, with a reputation for fair and honest dealings, has been
viewed as a cornerstone of its continued success as a vibrant and
free financial center.</TE>
<TE>   The new ministers can be fired at will by Tung.</TE>

<HD>Israel Tightens Its Grip on the Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The army has imposed a curfew across the West
Bank. A strike on a Hamas radical opens a new battlefront in the Gaza
Strip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Even as Israel denied that it was reoccupying the West Bank, its army
on Monday tightened its control over the Palestinian population,
imposing a curfew that put an estimated 800,000 people under virtual
house arrest and ringing the headquarters here of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat with tanks and armored vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Israel also opened another front in its war against terrorism in
the Gaza Strip, where attack helicopters Monday swooped down and
bombed the car of an activist in the radical Hamas movement. The
activist, Yasser Rizik, and five other Palestinians were killed.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised that the assassination
was only the first strike in a campaign of "massive activities"
against the Islamic group, which takes responsibility for many of the
suicide bombings that have terrorized Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Early today, Israeli troops stormed the hilltop local Palestinian
Authority headquarters in the West Bank city of Hebron, leaving
Jericho the only Palestinian town on the West Bank not taken over by
the army. Palestinians reported that police fought back and that two
of them were killed before the soldiers took control of the building.
Hebron is the only West Bank town where rule is divided between the
Palestinian Authority and Israeli troops who guard enclaves of Jewish
settlers living there.</LD>
<TE>   The army said it arrested ''dozens of terror suspects,'' and put
Hebron under curfew.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of attacks last week has prompted one of Israel's largest
military operations in the West Bank since the Palestinian territory
was captured in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said Monday
night that Israel is in military control of 99% of the West Bank and
that about 800,000 Palestinians are now subject to the curfew.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is not occupation, what is?" Erekat asked.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials reiterated Monday that the 6-day-old operation
is designed only to root out terrorism and that Israeli forces will
remain in the West Bank only as long as it takes to accomplish their
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not occupation," Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer declared. "We are there in order to guarantee the safety
of our people."</TE>
<TE>   But the campaign, code-named Operation Determined Path, is
unnerving many Israelis, who fear they are slipping back into a
costly and dangerous entanglement from which they will not be able to
extricate themselves. The campaign is inspiring editorials in Israeli
newspapers that are tantamount to obituaries for the historic
1993-1995 peace accords that had turned over Gaza and much of the
West Bank to Palestinian self-rule and raised hopes for the birth of
a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "The reoccupation of the territories may squash terror for a
certain length of time, but it will rise up again in various forms,
perhaps more lethal," wrote Israeli columnist Hemi Shalev in the
daily newspaper Maariv. "Israel ultimately will have to withdraw
[again] from the territories it occupied and return to square one."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that Israel has entered
Palestinian-ruled territory over the 21-month course of the current
conflict, but Israel is warning--and many believe--that its presence
in this round could be a protracted affair. The scope of the
operation, however, is difficult to determine because the Israeli
army has barred journalists from entering many West Bank cities.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters approaching Arafat's compound Monday were ordered out of
Ramallah, where Israeli tanks rolled in before dawn. While
loudspeakers warned residents not to leave their homes, up to 80
tanks and armored vehicles surrounded Arafat's walled compound,
effectively immobilizing the Palestinian Authority government.</TE>
<TE>   About noon, the city was eerily quiet. A few curious children
dared to peek out at the tanks, but there were few adults outside and
no cars moving. It appeared that not a single store was open, all
commercial life sealed behind turquoise metal shutters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are caged in on our own land," said Afaf Salem, a 45-year-old
mother of six.</TE>
<TE>   Salem said that there was no resistance to the Israeli military
presence and that people were more resigned than frightened.</TE>
<TE>   Isla Jad, 50, a professor of women's studies at Ramallah's Birzeit
University, recalled that she was awakened at 4 a.m. by the sound of
military helicopters, and shortly afterward by the tanks.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, here we go again," Jad said.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrances to Ramallah, cars and trucks backed up for miles
at Israeli checkpoints, forcing Palestinians to scramble over rocky
hills and through patches of thistle. Staggering with fatigue and
drenched in sweat, 48-year-old Awad Nassar had a catheter in his
chest, having just been released from a hospital in Ramallah where he
had an exploratory heart procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been walking for four hours," said Nassar, who clutched a
doctor's report in his hands. "The Israeli soldiers keep yelling at
us, 'Curfew, curfew!' but I have to get home."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ramallah and Hebron, the Israeli army over the last
six days of the campaign has entered Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm,
Bethlehem and Kalkilya--other West Bank cities that had been under
semiautonomous Palestinian rule. Those cities are also under a tight
curfew.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army has been taking advantage of the curfew to search
for militants and infrastructure that might be used for attacks
within Israel. Monday the army reported finding and destroying two
explosives laboratories in Jenin. In Hebron, a dozen members of Hamas
were reported to have been arrested, and there have been further
arrests in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   During this operation, Israel is not expected to reoccupy the Gaza
Strip, but further military actions against Hamas are anticipated. In
addition to Rizik, who allegedly was behind a January attack that
killed four Israeli soldiers, Monday's strike killed his brother, a
driver, two bodyguards and a bystander.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that Arafat, although himself under virtual house
arrest, has also been trying to rein in Hamas. Early Monday,
Palestinian police in Gaza said they placed under house arrest Ahmed
Yassin, a Muslim sheik who is the spiritual leader of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   However, Yassin invited journalists inside later in the day and
said he was unaware of any such order.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has informed me about any house arrest decision," Yassin
said.</TE>

for the time being.</LD>
<LD>   By beating Spain on Saturday, South Korea became the first Asian
team to reach the semifinals of the prestigious World Cup. But the
road that got it there has taken on far more significance than just a
string of sports victories.</LD>
<LD>   "Now people believe they can do anything," said Lew Seok Choon,
sociology professor at Yonsei University. "It's a real recognition on
the global stage of all that Korea has achieved."</LD>
<TE>   A win today against Germany would put the team in the finals this
weekend and deliver fans of the "Red Devils" very close to soccer
heaven. Even if their team loses, most South Koreans say they feel
blessed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is beyond our wildest dreams," said Jun Sun Ju, a
25-year-old company worker. "Korea will never be the same."</TE>
<TE>   At each successful stage, millions of fans have poured into the
streets decked in the team's trademark red to dance, yell and hug to
the chants of "Dae Han Min Guk," or Great Republic of Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer mania has interrupted funerals and weddings and diverted
Buddhist monks from prayer amid reports that the roar of the crowd in
Seoul Plaza hit 104 decibels, the equivalent of a jet taking off.</TE>
<TE>   Most demonstrations in South Korea until relatively recently
tended to be pitched street battles as citizens dodged tear gas
canisters to protest the tyranny of their government. Red was often
associated with the evils of communism.</TE>
<TE>   "The rallies show how people's consciousness and cooperative
spirit have really been elevated by democracy," said Kim Ki In, a
71-year-old retired teacher. "And as far as red goes, I was raised to
hate the color. Now to see the whole country in red is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   The assemblies, involving up to 6 million people watching the
games in plazas nationwide, have been blessedly free of vandalism,
crime or the violence long associated with soccer in Europe and Latin
America. Even police officers have joined the party, keeping people
in line with the rhythmic whistles of the team's fight song.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, soccer mania seems to have dampened trouble. Divorces
and petty crime have dropped since the team started winning, and
there are claims that wives are getting along better with their
mothers-in-law, a traditional bugaboo in close-knit South Korean
families.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been completely trouble-free. Two people died of heart
attacks after getting too excited while watching televised games. A
couple of teenagers died when a truckload of fans crashed. And one
man was hospitalized with a sprained wrist from clapping.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, South Korea's winning ways have dominated
newspaper front pages with headlines such as "Glory, Glory Korea."
The soccer hoopla has become a staple of TV variety shows and even
cooking programs.</TE>
<TE>   An added confidence booster for many South Koreans is the fact
that co-host Japan--an economic rival with nearly three times the
population of South Korea, and which occupied the peninsula from 1910
to 1945--hasn't done nearly as well, although it still put up a good
fight.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government had hopes of using the games as a
friendship bridge with North Korea. It invited its quirky neighbor to
host some of the games and to attend the Seoul welcoming ceremonies
as an observer. In classic form, Pyongyang never responded.</TE>
<TE>   South Koreans were heartened to hear that North Korean guards
cheered for the South when games were broadcast on propaganda
loudspeakers across the demilitarized zone. North Korean defectors
arriving here Monday also charmed their new country by announcing
that one of their greatest pleasures would be to watch the South
Korean team win.</TE>
<TE>   The games have also made a hero--some might even say a saint--out
of Guus Hiddink, the South Korean team's Dutch coach. The former
leader of the Netherlands national squad has been widely praised for
his ability to bring out the best in the South Korean soccer players.
The team has now cut its odds of winning the final to 1 in 6 from the
1-in-151 chance it was assigned at the start of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   There's talk of erecting Hiddink statues, renaming streets after
the coach and making him an honorary citizen. Internet chat rooms beg
him to become a South Korean, and adoring fans have nicknamed him Hee
Dong Gyu, or "Blissful Eastern Star."</TE>
<TE>   On Web sites, Hiddink has even been accused, tongue in cheek, of
crimes against South Korea: He's made the population so excited, it's
lost sleep. He's hurt business by driving restaurants to give away
free food in celebration. And his victories have released so many
endorphins in the population that the medical business is suffering.</TE>
<TE>   As an outsider in a nation where school ties, regional connections
and political affiliation carry enormous sway, Hiddink was able to
cut through the favoritism and pick a team solely on merit.</TE>
<TE>   During 18 months of intense training, his open, down-to-earth
approach and ruthless insistence on global standards are now openly
seen as a model for South Korean business, politics and society.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if our politics could also become among the eight
strongest in the world," said ruling party presidential candidate Roh
Mu Hyun.</TE>
<TE>   Although most South Koreans doubt that will happen anytime soon
given a string of recent scandals, the show of national unity during
the games has raised hope that the country can move beyond the
deep-seated regional rivalries that have divided it for so long.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Kluck, a commerce official at the Netherlands Embassy, says
the wealth of good feeling that Hiddink has engendered far outstrips
decades of marketing budgets by his government. "Suddenly everything
from the Netherlands is good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are limits, however. "I don't expect Koreans to all start
wearing wooden shoes, although maybe a few will do so during the
rainy season," said Lee Sung Jae, a fabric company president.</TE>

<HD>A Palestinian State Requires New Leadership, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Without mentioning Arafat, the president indicates
that independence for his people depends on their rejecting him.
Israel endorses the approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Monday called on the Palestinians to
reject their current leadership and elect a new generation of
democratic reformers to oversee the transition to a permanent state,
a process he said could be completed within three years if the
Palestinians move quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Although he did not mention Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat by name, Bush's blunt language was widely interpreted as
urging a complete break with the founding father of Palestinian
nationalism because of his failure to rein in violence against
Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   "Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership so that
a Palestinian state can be born," Bush said. "I call on the
Palestinian people to elect new leaders not compromised by terror."</LD>
<TE>   After the speech, a senior administration official told reporters
that the latest spate of Palestinian suicide bombings against Israel
had "crystallized" the administration's thinking and underscored its
growing disappointment with current Palestinian leaders. "Finally,
you have to say something has to change, something has to be
different," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's long-awaited speech represented a new tack in efforts to
revive the Middle East peace process, which has been deadlocked by
the escalating violence between Palestinians and Israelis since
September 2000. But his implicit call for the replacement of Arafat,
who was elected in 1996, could spark controversy among Palestinians
and Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat: "President Arafat
was elected by the Palestinian people in a direct election.... And
President Bush must respect the choice of the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   In a brief statement, Arafat himself said he welcomed Bush's ideas
and called the speech a "serious effort to push the peace process
forward." He said he hoped for direct discussions with the
administration, although it is unclear whether the White House will
designate anyone to talk with him again. Bush himself has never met
with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office endorsed Bush's
approach, saying diplomatic progress can be made only after the
Palestinian Authority gets new leadership and undergoes "genuine
reforms."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's proposals could face questions or challenges from U.S.
allies in Europe, Russia and the United Nations, all of whom are
partners with the United States in the "quartet" coalition overseeing
the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the speech, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said:
"The issue of who should lead the Palestinian people is one that only
the Palestinian people themselves can decide."</TE>
<TE>   In his vision for breaking the impasse in the Middle East, Bush
issued several other tough and sweeping demands for reforms as
conditions for the Palestinians to win statehood. These include a new
constitution, a stronger parliament, an independent judiciary, a
market-based economy and an end to corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The goal must be to overhaul a system where power is held in the
hands of "an unaccountable few," he said. The president warned that
the United States would not accept "cosmetic" changes or a "veiled
attempt to preserve the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   The president called for democratic elections for local
Palestinian offices by year's end, with national elections soon
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   To clamp down on extremism and provide a safe environment for both
Palestinians and Israelis, Bush said the Palestinians must undertake
an "externally supervised" reorganization of their police and
security forces.</TE>
<TE>   "A Palestinian state will never be created by terror. It will be
built through reform," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He charged that as the Palestinian Authority is currently
structured, officials are "encouraging, not opposing terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   As an incentive to the Palestinians to heed the president's
demands, senior administration sources said initial steps by them
could be rewarded by the creation of a state with provisional borders
in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Palestinian people have new leaders, new institutions
and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States
of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state, whose
borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty will be provisional
until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle East,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pledged that his administration is prepared to become deeply
involved in major aspects of creating a Palestinian state. For
instance, he said the United States, with European and Arab
governments, would help the Palestinians develop a new
"constitutional framework" for a "working democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Washington is further prepared to increase financial aid to ease
suffering among the Palestinians, who have seen their economy decline
significantly since the current intifada, or uprising, began 21
months ago. Along with the European Union, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the administration would help oversee
reforms in Palestinian finances, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Well into the speech, the president made tough demands of Israel,
including an end to Jewish settlement "activity" in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and an eventual withdrawal from lands occupied during the
1967 Middle East War--both demands that are likely to trigger stiff
resistance from key Israeli quarters.</TE>
<TE>   A final settlement "means that the Israeli occupation that began
in 1967 will be ended through a settlement negotiated between the
parties," with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders
based on U.N. resolutions, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not specify whether that meant Israeli withdrawal from
all occupied territories, although he implied that the Jewish state
would have to give up most of the land.</TE>
<TE>   The overall tenor of the speech reflected the Israeli position on
movement toward a Palestinian state, particularly with regard to
security guarantees and political reforms by the Palestinians as the
first steps. In two visits to the White House over the last two
months, Sharon has pressed Washington for such a sequence, meaning
Palestinians would have to take major strides before Israel would
reenter negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the
security that Israel longs for," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the president did address demands from several Arab
leaders for a timeline, the onus is clearly on the Palestinians to
act before Israel is required to make serious concessions, said U.S.
specialists on the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said: "As new Palestinian institutions and new leaders
emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform, I
expect Israel to respond and work toward a final status agreement."</TE>
<TE>   For example, as violence subsides, Bush said, Israel must allow
the Palestinian economy to develop and must restore freedom of
movement, so ordinary Palestinians can return to work and a normal
life.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pledged that more rewards could come quickly if the
Palestinians "energetically" adopt reforms. "With a dedicated effort,
this state could rise rapidly, as it comes to terms with Israel," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The final settlement, he said, could be obtained in three years
"with intensive effort by all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Arab Americans expressed disappointment in Bush for demanding too
much from the Palestinians. "The president has set U.S. foreign
policy and U.S.-Arab relations back," said James J. Zogby, president
of the Arab American Institute. "There is nothing here that could
give the Palestinians hope.... The United States has failed this test
of leadership in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics said Bush did not address how the process he
outlined will move forward. Bush said he was designating Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell to work with Middle Eastern and world leaders
on a comprehensive plan on Palestinian reforms. But the president did
not mention plans for a much anticipated international conference on
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said little about key issues that would be part of a
final settlement, such as the status of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The president's call for a leadership change among the
Palestinians seemed a shift from recent statements by him and other
administration leaders. In an April interview, Bush said, "Far be it
for an American leader to determine who can lead another country."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Powell said the administration had "an obligation"
to deal with Arafat as the elected and world-recognized leader of the
Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   The president delivered his speech in the White House Rose Garden,
flanked by Powell, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   "The hatred of a few holds the hopes of many hostage," Bush said.
"The forces of extremism and terror are attempting to kill progress
and peace by killing the innocent. And this casts a dark shadow over
an entire region. For the sake of all humanity, things must change in
the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech was well received in Congress, a bastion of strong
support for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), a conservative Republican
who is one of Israel's staunchest supporters, said Bush "showed
strong moral leadership by acknowledging that the path to peace
doesn't run through Arafat's compound."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan's President Could Confront Axis of Extremists</HD>
<DH>Asia: Under a worst-case scenario, three militant groups
could link up to try to topple Musharraf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf faces an ominous new challenge to his rule
from three Islamic militant groupings that now stand against him,
each clearly capable of using violence to bring him down, diplomats
and others following developments in Pakistan believe.</LD>
<LD>   The presence of an undetermined number of fighters from Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network who fled to Pakistan last winter
after the Taliban regime's collapse in neighboring Afghanistan merely
adds to the volatile brew.</LD>
<LD>   Those who track Pakistan's turbulent domestic political
environment worry openly about a nightmare scenario--one in which
elements from the three diverse strains of militancy set aside their
individual causes, link up with Al Qaeda members and unite around a
set of shared objectives: removing Musharraf, a key U.S. ally in the
war on terror; destabilizing the country; and driving the United
States from the region.</LD>
<TE>   Two of these groups--one consisting of Pakistanis who fought with
the Taliban in Afghanistan, the other made up of Muslim holy warriors
dedicated to capturing all of the disputed Kashmir region for
Pakistan and the Islamic cause--were once de facto allies of
Musharraf's government.</TE>
<TE>   The third--extremists from Pakistan's majority Sunni sect who have
waged a bloody, mafia-style war against the minority Shiites--was
already at odds with him.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers posed by these extremist groups have increased sharply
in recent weeks because of steps taken to ease the crisis with India
over Kashmir, diplomats and others following developments in Pakistan
believe.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce those tensions, Musharraf intensified a crackdown on
militants whom the Pakistani government had for years trained for
attacks on Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   With this crackdown coming just nine months after Musharraf
withdrew his government's support for the Taliban, angry and
disillusioned sympathizers of both the Afghan and Kashmiri causes
view the president, a general who took power in a coup, as a traitor
to militant Islam.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 1,000 uniformed Americans and a large FBI
contingent based here as part of the war on terrorism, so the United
States has a large stake in Pakistan's internal stability.</TE>
<TE>   At a different level, Americans also have a stake in a political
struggle being watched across the Muslim world--that of a leader who
cast his fate with the West in the wake of Sept. 11 and is now locked
in a battle to survive the backlash.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers believe that informal linkups between militant
groups may already have begun.</TE>
<TE>   Communications Minister Javed Ahraf Qazi, the former head of
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, said that this
month's bombing at the U.S. Consulate in Karachi had the earmarks of
cooperation between local religious extremists and Al Qaeda refugees
believed to be in the rough port city.</TE>
<TE>   "My suspicion is that sectarian elements did this at the behest of
Al Qaeda," he said. "They are [both] ruthless murderers."</TE>
<TE>   Presidential spokesman Rashid Qureshi acknowledged, "Some
[Pakistani] groups may have developed Al Qaeda links."</TE>
<TE>   So far, there is no hard evidence that followers of the three
militant causes have entered into any formal agreement or established
anything as structured as a common underground network to pursue
their shared goals.</TE>
<TE>   With Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban fighters in disarray, the
heads of several large Sunni groups in jail and many Kashmiri
militants only now beginning to contemplate an alternative future,
organizational leadership is in short supply, according to those who
monitor militant activities.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that, instead, little more than a camaraderie among
individuals attracts the militants together as small groups explore
possible cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda elements and others are now in the process of coming
together to find a specific-oriented agenda," said Aamer Ahmed Khan,
editor of the Herald, a Karachi-based monthly that closely follows
the activities of Islamic militant groups. "Some leaders haven't even
met yet, but groups are starting to work together."</TE>
<TE>   A previously unknown group calling itself Al Qanoon--"The
Law"--claimed responsibility for the consulate attack. In a note
faxed to local newspapers, it described the bombing as the beginning
of a campaign against "America, its allies and its lackey Pakistani
rulers."</TE>
<TE>   Although no one has claimed responsibility for a bombing last
month outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi that killed 11 French
defense contract workers, authorities talk privately of a possible
similar nexus in that attack.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government pressed its search for Al Qaeda remnants in
the wake of the U.S. Consulate attack.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, precinct-level police officers in all four provinces
were called to urgent meetings where superiors ordered them to search
for possible links between known Sunni militants in their areas and
Al Qaeda members who might have found refuge there.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Interior Ministry source said that as part of the search,
landlords have been told to report to police any tenants willing to
pay conspicuously more than the market rate for accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   The government also has invoked longer-term measures to choke off
support for Islamic extremists.</TE>
<TE>   A tough new law announced last week tightens controls on the
thousands of religious schools, known as madrasas, and cuts off
foreign sources of funding to them. With financial help from
foreign-based Islamic fundamentalist organizations, many of
Pakistan's madrasas instilled their students with extremist ideas
heavily laced with anti-Americanism.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have also launched investigations into the activities
of several Pakistan-based nongovernmental organizations funded by
Arab world money suspected in recent months of providing aid and
shelter to fleeing Arab Al Qaeda fighters and their families.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has linked Kashmiri militant groups to the string
of recent attacks against foreigners in Pakistan, primarily because
their break with Musharraf has only just occurred. But many fear that
the potential is now there.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very serious danger of the government losing control
over the Kashmiris," said Aamer. "It's a major failure that the
government didn't prevent the Kashmiri freedom movement from being
infiltrated by these [other] militants."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Pakistan-based diplomats claim that Musharraf had already
decided before Sept. 11 to end the government's support of Muslim
extremist elements in the country because the price in terms of
domestic violence and a growing international isolation had become
too high. His strategy, however, had been to take on the militants
quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to finish them off one by one," noted a respected
Islamabad-based Arab envoy. "Now he has been forced to fight on three
fronts simultaneously. Politically, this could be dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the extremist groups have made no public statements or
issued any credible claims regarding their intentions. But previous
shared ties could help bring them together despite their different
political agendas, diplomats and analysts fear.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of these ties abounds.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Kashmiri militants and Sunni sectarian extremists
from Pakistan were routinely trained at Al Qaeda-run camps in eastern
Afghanistan. In fact, there is now evidence that at least one of the
terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan hit by U.S. cruise missiles in
1998 was training recruits for Kashmiri militant groups, not Al
Qaeda. The U.S. attack came as a reprisal for the American Embassy
bombings in East Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Pakistani journalists who trekked across the
mountains into eastern Afghanistan for a May 1997 news conference
with Bin Laden recall that their guides and hosts for the trip were
members of the Kashmiri militant organization Harkat Moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   "The collective experience of having trained and fought together
has led to a camaraderie," said a senior member of Musharraf's
government who declined to be identified. "This camaraderie is now
playing itself out."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Pakistani authorities have had some notable successes in
the search for Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan in recent months. A
raid in the Punjab city of Faisalabad in March netted a senior Bin
Laden aide, Abu Zubeida. U.S. officials say that information provided
by Zubeida led to last month's arrest of Jose Padilla, the so-called
"dirty bomber."</TE>
<TE>   Despite this, senior Pakistanis worry whether their security
forces are up to a major confrontation with militants on the home
front. The police, they say, are ill-equipped, overextended and so
corrupt that the government has come to rely increasingly on
paramilitary units such as the Pakistani Rangers to carry out
sensitive tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider admitted that his forces aren't
in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my problems about police capabilities," he said. "I used
to get help from the [paramilitary forces], but they are now on the
border. So I'm left with a police force which has been tired ever
since September, when hundreds of thousands of [protesters] came onto
the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Haider said he had requested additional resources to beef up both
the manpower of the police and their investigative capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want the land of Pakistan to be used by any militants,
extremists or terrorists," he said. "This is the policy of our
president, and we'll do our best to implement it."</TE>

<HD>In Mideast, Sharon Looks Like a Winner After Speech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Beleaguered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was trying
to find something to like in President Bush's speech Monday, but the
clear victor was Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials could barely contain their delight at Bush's
game plan for the Middle East and his call for new Palestinian
leadership. The consensus among analysts in Jerusalem was that it
could practically have been drafted by Sharon himself.</LD>
<LD>   "The president said it well," Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin said,
noting that the greatest onus was put on the Palestinians and that
any Israeli commitment was pushed into the distant future.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's address came as Israeli tanks and troops continued their
march across the West Bank, taking control of most Palestinian cities
and belying the vague sketches of Washington's latest formula for
peace.</TE>
<TE>   David Landau, an editor of the Israeli daily Haaretz, pronounced
Arafat a "dead man walking," consigned to history.</TE>
<TE>   "Yasser Arafat, the seemingly immortal leader of the Palestinian
national movement, was politically assassinated Monday by President
George W. Bush," Landau wrote early today.</TE>
<TE>   "His role as Israel's prospective partner in any future diplomatic
process was effectively snuffed out by a stern-sounding American
president, delivering his verdict on two years of violent intifada
and his recipe for a turnabout toward peace in this war-torn region,"
Landau continued. "Bush's verdict: Arafat is the guilty party."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians were stunned at the stark terms used by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people. He is the elected
president of the Palestinian people," Saeb Erekat, a member of
Arafat's Cabinet and former chief negotiator, told reporters.
"Palestinian leaders don't come from parachutes from Washington or
anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, who had already judged the Bush administration to be
firmly in Israel's camp, said they resented being asked to pay the
price of sacrificing their leader to achieve their state. Many detest
Arafat but don't want the U.S., or Israel, telling them who can run
their affairs. He remains a symbol, albeit a tattered one, of the
Palestinian struggle for independence.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat himself seemed to ignore the headlines from Bush's speech
and instead praised it as a "serious contribution to pushing the
peace process forward."</TE>
<TE>   "President Arafat and the Palestinian leadership have welcomed the
ideas presented by President Bush," said a statement issued in
Arafat's name and transmitted on the official Palestinian news agency
WAFA. It called for urgent talks with the Bush administration and
international mediators to reopen peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, who was again trapped by Israeli armor in his headquarters
in the West Bank city of Ramallah, did not appear in public to speak
after Bush's address.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Sharon. His office issued a statement echoing Bush's words
and forestalling any peace negotiations indefinitely. Only when there
is a "complete cessation of violence, terror and incitement," and
when "genuine reforms" in the Palestinian Authority have put a new
leader on top, will it "be possible to discuss how to make progress
on the political tracks," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that Bush might put pressure on Israel to accept a
Palestinian state, Sharon had sought to persuade the administration
to delay the policy address that Bush finally delivered Monday
afternoon in the Rose Garden. Sharon's concerns turned out to be
unfounded. Bush said a state should be created only after new
Palestinian leadership is in place. Arafat's demise has been Sharon's
goal for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority has to reform, and until then there can
be no movement toward peace," Gissin said. "It's reform, reform, then
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials did take heart in Bush's call for an end to
Israeli occupation of the West Bank lands captured in the 1967 Middle
East War and a reversal of the large-scale army incursions of the
last weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But the question in the region was how relevant Bush's outline can
be, given conditions on the ground, where no one is in the mood for
talking, much less agreeing on anything.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian suicide-bombing campaign targeting Israelis shows no
sign of abating, and the Israeli military has taken over nearly all
of the Palestinian West Bank, including the very population centers
that would form an eventual state. How can Palestinians think about
nation-building, Erekat said, if they control no territory?</TE>

<HD>Putin Working to Make Russia 'Equal Partner' in World
Market</HD>
<DH>Economy: Binding the nation to the global system is the
president's priority. He says he knows firsthand how hard life is for
his people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin, in a wide-ranging news conference
Monday, spelled out his aim to join the World Trade Organization by
2004, and said his overarching priority is to grow Russia's economy
and bind it to the global economic system.</LD>
<LD>   At the two-hour-plus session in a Kremlin auditorium--only the
second full-fledged news conference of his presidency--Putin dwelt on
economic issues.</LD>
<LD>   He said his dizzying recent diplomatic forays, including
back-to-back meetings with President Bush, several conferences of
Asian powers and summits with the European Union and with Baltic
leaders, were aimed at improving the financial well-being of the
state.</LD>
<TE>   "For a country that used to be an antagonist or enemy of most of
the world's industrialized nations, Russia should become a
partner--moreover, an equal partner. This is the paramount mission of
Russian foreign policy,'' said Putin, seated on stage against the
blue-white-and-red Russian flag.</TE>
<TE>   His comments were bluntest when it came to WTO membership. He
challenged a reporter who suggested most Russian businesses were
afraid of joining the 144-member organization and facing tough
international competition that could throw workers at inefficient
enterprises out of their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia today is the only major world country outside WTO--the
only one,'' Putin said sharply. "The WTO countries account for 90% of
the world economy.... Staying outside ... is dangerous and silly.''</TE>
<TE>   Putin said Russia seeks to be a member of the WTO by 2004 so that
it will be able to take part in the anticipated next round of
negotiations on revising the trade organization's rules. "If Russia
is not a member by that time, this [negotiation] will take place
without us and will be most likely to create additional difficulties
for Russia's accession to the WTO,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Putin spoke just two days before the start of meetings in Canada
among the seven most industrialized countries and Russia, where Putin
is expected to push his country's WTO candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been negotiating entry into the WTO since 1995, but the
talks have been moving in fits and starts, with disagreements
remaining over how Russia can protect its financial institutions and
telecommunications industries.</TE>
<TE>   Putin said part of the problem is that Russia lacks enough experts
who can deal with hammering out the minutiae of a WTO accord. China,
which joined the WTO last year, had 1,000 people working on the
issue, he said, while Russia has only a few dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's ambitions to join the WTO were buoyed by decisions by the
United States and the European Union within the past month to
categorize Russia as a free- market country.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of the nationally televised news conference to
sell Russians on the advantages of membership, Putin said joining
would bring Russia into "the legal structures of the civilized
world.''</TE>
<TE>   "It will have a considerable benefit on the economy, on the social
and political spheres of the country, even on the level of
[financial] crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the WTO is favored by Russian exporters "because joining
WTO removes all the impediments and barriers ... to their business,''
Putin said. The only ones opposed, he said, are "those who consider
themselves not competitive as yet.''</TE>
<TE>   But Putin chided Russia's trading partners for sometimes preaching
free trade and practicing protectionism when it comes to Russian
steel and agricultural products. He noted that Russia had recently
managed to have a surplus of 5 million tons of grain to export for
the first time in 80 years.</TE>
<TE>   "So what happened? The European Union immediately introduced a
prohibitive tax. What does this amount to if not a restriction on
market entry for Russian goods?''</TE>
<TE>   Such self-interest is just a fact of life in world trade, he said,
but Russia must stay "consistently'' engaged in negotiations to
protect its markets.</TE>
<TE>   Putin, relaxed before about 450 journalists, many of whom had been
shipped in from Russian provinces at the Kremlin's expense, said he
was holding the news conference to sum up the year's activities
before the summer holidays.</TE>
<TE>   He commented on a number of other domestic issues--including his
hope to help restore normality in war-torn Chechnya through a
constitutional referendum there next year--and international topics,
such as Russia's opposition to any move to oust Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   In a personal aside, he said his main advantage as president has
been an innate understanding of the mind-set of common Russians.</TE>
<TE>   ''I may have lived in the presidential residence for two years,
but for nearly 30 years I lived in a communal apartment in Leningrad,
even when I was a KGB officer,'' he said. ''I know very well what
ordinary Russians live through.''</TE>
<TE>   In a similar vein, when a British journalist tried to find out who
were the chief thinkers or advisors behind Putin's military and
security policies, the president riposted: "The Russian people.''</TE>

<HD>More-Tested Bush Heads for Summit</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: With his successes in the war on terror,
president goes to G-8 meeting stronger. But differences with other
leaders remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Eleven months ago when he arrived at his first Group of
8 meeting, President Bush was largely untested, struggling to make an
impression among his American constituency and to overcome fears
among fellow summit participants that he was a Texas cowboy prone to
tough talk and impetuous action.</LD>
<LD>   As he leaves Washington today for the Canadian Rockies and his
second summit of the world's leading industrialized nations, Bush has
poll numbers that the other leaders can only dream about. His
leadership has survived a direct assault on the United States. And
his response--sophisticated diplomacy and sustained military action
that ended Taliban rule in Afghanistan--has strengthened his hand at
home and is sure to do the same at the summit.</LD>
<LD>   "The war on terrorism has given him enormous popular support. And
his performance over the past 12 months in foreign policy, far from
showing him as a Texas cowboy--the parody of him in Europe--has shown
him as someone who can deal effectively with the Russians and a major
security challenge," said Enzo Grilli, a former member of the board
of directors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, for all the grins and public bonhomie the meeting in the
mountains is likely to produce, Bush and his partners remain at odds
on a wide range of policy issues, with the Middle East dogging their
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The latest White House effort to calm the region has commanded the
president's attention for much of this month, culminating Monday in
his urging Palestinians to find new leadership as a step required for
their own eventual state.</TE>
<TE>   In private talks, Bush can be expected to argue the case for his
proposal. It could prove a hard sell among Europeans, who
traditionally have prodded the United States to adopt a more
sympathetic stance toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The summit's public agenda, although perhaps less dramatic,
focuses on other pressing concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Trade issues, global economic matters and the extension of the war
on terrorism may distance Bush from the other G-8 leaders meeting
Wednesday and Thursday in Kananaskis, a mountain village in Alberta.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Terror War</TE>
<TE>   Bush enters the meeting with one overriding need: to avoid any
sort of disagreement about the war on terrorism. Everything else is
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely important for the president to come out of this
meeting ... with a clear sense that this is a fight of all civilized
countries against a very extreme movement that is not acceptable to
anyone," said James B. Steinberg, deputy national security advisor
during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Bush in the last week proposed new U.S. spending to
fight AIDS in Africa and promote education there.</TE>
<TE>   This demonstrated a recognition that Bush should make "a gesture
to those important friends and allies" at the summit who believe that
"dealing with the underlying problems of development" is an important
element in the anti-terror fight, said Steinberg, now director of the
Brookings Institution's foreign policy studies program.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive Stance</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush's course at home could force him into a defensive
position on other key topics.</TE>
<TE>   Bush continues to push a free-trade agenda in public and private
discussions, yet he is defending a decision to impose tariffs on
imported steel. While opposing government subsidies for farmers
around the world, he signed a farm bill that subsidizes large
agribusinesses at home. He will exhort others to stimulate their
economies while facing concerns that the U.S. economic recovery may
be stumbling.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the crescent of trouble stretching from the shores
of the Mediterranean to Iraq brings an anxiety to the meeting because
most U.S. allies are uneasy about prosecuting a war against Saddam
Hussein before clear progress is seen in resolving the latest
conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the host, has structured
the summit around three issues: fighting terrorism, strengthening the
global economy and expanding aid for Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Bush moved last week to inoculate the United States from possible
criticism that it is not doing enough to help the developing
countries of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would seek to double, to $200 million over five years,
spending for a program to improve basic education and teacher
training in Africa. He also promised to seek an additional $300
million from Congress to help nations in Africa and the Caribbean
protect infants from HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, which
causes AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The G-8 meeting is the 28th in an annual series that began in 1975
when the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and Japan met in Rambouillet, France.</TE>
<TE>   Canada eventually joined the club, and the Group of 8 has become
the moniker for the world's seven major industrialized nations plus
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Tight Security</TE>
<TE>   For this year's gathering, Chretien made a point of finding an
out-of-the-way location to make securing the site against
anti-globalization protesters easier.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's summit in Genoa, Italy, the demonstrations outside
grew violent, and one protester was killed when he was shot by a
police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Kananaskis, about an hour and a half from Calgary, can be reached
by helicopter or by a single road. Access will be blocked to all but
officials and their guests.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian prime minister also emphasized his desire to keep the
proceedings informal--there will be no official communique issued at
the end of the meetings--and small.</TE>

<TE>   "Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so
that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian
people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I
call upon them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and
liberty. If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals,
America and the world will actively support their effort....</TE>
<TE>   "The United States, along with others in the international
community, will help the Palestinians organize and monitor fair,
multiparty local elections by the end of the year with national
elections to follow....</TE>
<TE>   "Today, Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing
terrorism. This is unacceptable. And the United States will not
support the establishment of a Palestinian state until its leaders
engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle
their infrastructure....</TE>
<TE>   "To be counted on the side of peace, nations must act. Every
leader actually committed to peace will end incitement to violence in
official media and publicly denounce homicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the flow of
money, equipment and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the
destruction of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah."</TE>
<TE>   On Israeli responsibilities:</TE>
<TE>   "Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic
Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and
democracy. A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to
achieve the security that Israel longs for. So I challenge Israel to
take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "As we make progress toward security, Israeli forces need to
withdraw fully to positions they held prior to Sept. 28, 2000. And
consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell committee,
Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop."</TE>
<TE>   On a timeline:</TE>
<TE>   "With intensive effort by all of us, agreement could be reached
within three years from now. And I and my country will actively lead
toward that goal."</TE>

<HD>Fired Army Chief Vows to Challenge Dismissal</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic's removal by the
president sparks fear over the military's role in an ongoing power
struggle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY and ZORAN CIRJAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Army Chief of Staff Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, who was appointed by
former President Slobodan Milosevic but then played an important role
in his mentor's downfall, refused Monday to accept dismissal, raising
fears of army involvement in an ongoing political power struggle.</LD>
<LD>   President Vojislav Kostunica issued a decree Monday "ending the
professional military service" of Pavkovic.</LD>
<LD>   "I will use all legal means to challenge the decision of the
president," Pavkovic said at an evening news conference. He urged
parliament to resolve the dispute.</LD>
<TE>   Pavkovic also began discussing Kostunica's action with an unknown
number of top generals at army headquarters shortly after the news
conference, and he was still with them well after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica, in state-run television remarks, said he fired Pavkovic
"for the sake of civilian control and for the sake of democracy." The
president, one of three members of Yugoslavia's Supreme Defense
Council, said he planned to meet with top generals today.</TE>
<TE>   The power struggle also involves Kostunica's key rival, Serbian
Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Serbia is Yugoslavia's dominant
republic, and an increasingly bitter rivalry between the
nationalistic Kostunica and pragmatic Djindjic--allies in the October
2000 overthrow of Milosevic--is the focus of the country's politics.</TE>
<TE>   As a Milosevic appointee, Pavkovic's continuation in his army post
has been a major barrier to better relations between the West and
Yugoslavia, so reformers such as Djindjic could be expected to
welcome his dismissal. But in recent months Pavkovic has sided with
Djindjic and played an important role in limiting efforts by the
popular Kostunica.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless how big were the merits of Gen. Pavkovic during the
[NATO] aggression in 1999, at the moment both the army and the state
need other skills," Kostunica said. "I regret that Gen. Pavkovic
decided to leave in a way that is so much unlike that of a soldier,
that he thought he is above the army and the army is above the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica "decided that my service ends as of tomorrow, as if I
were the greatest scum in this country," Pavkovic told state
television earlier. "I am not going to carry out such an order."</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic, also in televised remarks, called the clash between
Kostunica and Pavkovic "a scandal on the highest state level."</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening at the moment does not benefit the
international reputation of the country, and for sure does not
contribute to the internal stability that we need in order to deal
with what is most important, and that is the economy," Djindjic said.
Kostunica will "bear responsibility for the consequences of his
decision," he added.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting Monday of the Supreme Defense Council, the two
members more closely tied to Djindjic refused to vote for Pavkovic's
dismissal unless other generals, more feared by reformers, were also
dismissed, Serbian media reported.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers centered around Djindjic are particularly concerned by
Kostunica's closeness to Gen. Aco Tomic, the head of Yugoslav army
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic, a key reformer, said
it was good that Pavkovic had been dismissed. "I hope there will be
more changes in the army and that this is just the beginning of the
reforms," Svilanovic said.</TE>
<TE>   Appointments to positions such as army chief of staff are
controlled by majority vote of the defense council, which also
includes Milo Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro, the smaller
republic in Yugoslavia, and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica said that Gen. Branko Krga, Pavkovic's deputy, would
take over the functions of the chief of staff. But in apparent
recognition of legal doubts about his authority to make personnel
changes without approval of the defense council, he did not formally
appoint him to that post.</TE>
<TE>   Pavkovic led Yugoslav army forces in Kosovo during the country's
1999 confrontation with NATO. But the next year, after Milosevic
refused to acknowledge an electoral defeat, Pavkovic threw his weight
to reformers by refusing to use force to prevent protesters from
overthrowing the strongman.</TE>
<TE>   Pavkovic charged at his news conference that Kostunica's action
was "personal revenge" taken because he had resisted efforts by the
president to use the army, "especially the security department led by
Gen. Tomic," to gather intelligence for his own political party's
use.</TE>
<TE>   Pavkovic also claimed that last year he refused instructions that
the army "storm" a Serbian government office that Kostunica believed
was eavesdropping on him.</TE>
<TE>   "The main message [was] that there is a center for bugging ...
,that because of that the security of the state is in danger,"
Pavkovic said. He said he replied that "this is not the army's job,
we have no data on what's going on there and I do not want to take
part in that."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Holley reported from Rome and special
correspondent Cirjakovic from Belgrade.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines Asks for $1.8-Billion Loan Backing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines, severely damaged by the weak economy,
labor-management feuds and a slump in air travel after Sept. 11, said
Monday that it applied for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee to
help ensure its survival.</LD>
<LD>   Although the nation's second-largest carrier still has nearly $3
billion in cash, United and parent company UAL Corp. are losing
millions of dollars a day, face big debt payments later this year and
are nearly closed off from conventional lending sources. So the
airline decided to seek federal backing before the loan-guarantee
program stops taking applications Friday.</LD>
<LD>   United's petition for help--by far the largest request since the
program was created by Congress after the terrorist attacks--is
fraught with unknowns. Among them: whether United would even be
granted the guarantee and, if not, how much that would further
cripple the carrier. For 2001, United reported a loss of $2.1
billion, an airline record.</LD>
<TE>   Neither United nor most industry analysts suggest that the airline
would seek bankruptcy protection if it failed to receive federal
help. In fact, some observers wonder if the agency granting the
guarantees--the Air Transportation Stabilization Board--might view
United as not yet being in dire-enough straits to need the backing.</TE>
<TE>   But the request marks a steady decline in the fortunes of United,
once the nation's largest airline but now second to AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines. Some United employees said privately Monday that
they were embarrassed that the airline--which on peak days flies
250,000 people to 117 cities in 26 countries--must seek support from
Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   United's huge reach, in turn, presents the government with a
dilemma. If the Air Transportation Stabilization Board denies the
loan guarantee--a decision that could come within three months--and
United's condition further deteriorates to the point that its
survival is jeopardized, it could cause havoc for the whole travel
industry. At Los Angeles International Airport, United is the biggest
carrier, with more than 20% of the flights.</TE>
<TE>   Most airlines are still losing money as they grapple with the
post-Sept. 11 fallout and a depressed market for business travel. The
only major carrier that is profitable, Southwest Airlines, manages to
stay in the black because it has one of the lowest cost structures in
the business.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers such as American, Delta, Northwest and Continental are
considered somewhat healthier than United because either their
operating costs are lower than United's or their balance sheets are
stronger. And after the industry received $5 billion of immediate
cash aid as part of its $15-billion bailout after Sept. 11--United
garnered $725 million in cash aid--most airlines have not yet felt
the need to tap the loan guarantees. But United's move might prompt
some of them to apply to stay competitive with United.</TE>
<TE>   A few smaller airlines, such as America West and US Airways,
already have asked for loan guarantees. Only America West has secured
one so far, amounting to $380 million. US Airways, with routes
concentrated in the East and with the industry's highest cost
structure, is in much worse shape than United and is seeking a
$900-million loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Under a federal loan guarantee, the government agrees to pay loans
a company receives from the private sector in case the company
defaults.</TE>
<TE>   That backing gives the company lower interest rates on the loans
than it would otherwise receive. Once the company repays the loans,
the government could get the "spread" between the two different rates
as compensation, although there may be other terms as well. The
government has shown, as in the America West case, that it also might
seek an ownership stake in the company. But United said that would be
unnecessary because the airline has assets to pledge against its
loan.</TE>
<TE>   United's crucial role in aviation, and the size of its request,
recall two other times when big companies sought federal loan
guarantees: the $1.5-billion bailout of auto maker Chrysler Corp.
(now part of DaimlerChrysler) in 1979, and the $250-million bailout
of aerospace giant Lockheed Corp. (now part of Lockheed Martin) in
1971.</TE>
<TE>   Those bailouts were debated and approved by Congress to save a
specific company, and both survived before eventually merging with
other firms. United, however, is applying to a general program that
Congress created when the airline industry as a whole was pushed to
the brink, with the three-member air board deciding which carriers
will get help.</TE>
<TE>   "United is the perfect candidate for the ATSB program," United
Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Creighton said in a statement. The
program is aimed at helping airlines "weather the liquidity
challenges" that have followed Sept. 11, he said.</TE>
<TE>   United, with 84,000 employees, normally would pay or refinance its
upcoming bills by going to banks and the credit markets. But in light
of the problems at United and all the airlines, "access to the
traditional markets is greatly diminished," Jake Brace, United's
chief financial officer, said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders would make cash available to United if they know Uncle Sam
stands ready to pay them in the event United defaults. Ray Neidl, an
independent analyst who testified about the industry's condition at
congressional hearings when the bailout was created, said that "if
United can prove that it's on the road to cost cutting" with its
employees, creditors and suppliers, he believes it would the
guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, United has been racked by a sharp drop in
business travel, its biggest source of revenue, owing both to the
recession and business fliers' growing displeasure with United's
fares and service.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe United's problems are mainly because their
service has consistently gone downhill, and not just since Sept. 11,"
said Dave Lydon, a Los Angeles businessman who logs more than 100,000
miles a year on United.</TE>
<TE>   United, 55%-owned by its employees, also has experienced repeated
squabbles between its executives and labor unions over the carrier's
efforts to slash its relatively high labor costs, United's ill-fated
plan to merge with US Airways and other management strategies.
United's boardroom also has been filled with turmoil: The Elk Grove
Village, Ill.-based carrier has had three chief executives in the
last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks, and the subsequent plunge in air travel,
only exacerbated United's problems. United lost two of the four
jetliners involved in the hijackings and crashes. After its record
loss last year, United is expected to post a loss of more than $1
billion again this year. Plus, the airline faces debt payments and
capital spending requirements of $1.5 billion during the next 18
months, which will seriously deplete its cash.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transportation Stabilization Board has signaled that it
looks more favorably on an airline that has persuaded its employees
and other "stakeholders" to make concessions. Creighton, an interim
CEO for United until it finds a permanent replacement, has secured
about $950 million in savings over three years from concessions by
United's pilots and its management and salaried personnel.</TE>
<TE>   But the pilots' deal is contingent on United getting the loan
guarantee. And two other employee groups--United's mechanics and
flight attendants--so far haven't committed to any concessions.</TE>
<TE>   What if United doesn't get the guarantee? Chief Financial Officer
Brace said it would try again to borrow from private lenders on terms
United can afford.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's stock fell 25 cents, to $11.70, on the New York Stock
Exchange; the shares have tumbled 63% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Older Workers Dealt Setback by State Court</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Justices say the law barring age bias against
employees doesn't apply to benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Employers can discriminate against older workers in awarding job
benefits without violating state law, the California Supreme Court
ruled unanimously Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The court said the state protects workers over 40 from age
discrimination only in hiring, termination, demotion and suspension,
not in the awarding of benefits. The decision is expected to apply to
benefits and working conditions, including sick leave, job
scheduling, vacation and stock options.</LD>
<LD>   For 19 years, a state regulation had prohibited age discrimination
in benefits for employees over 40, who make up nearly half of the
state's work force. But the high court said the antidiscrimination
law on which the regulation was based provides no such protection.</LD>
<TE>   "The Legislature has prohibited employers from discriminating in
the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of a variety of
factors," Justice Joyce L. Kennard wrote for the court. "But the
employee's age notably is not one of those factors."</TE>
<TE>   Workers over 40 are not without recourse, however.</TE>
<TE>   They will still be able to sue under U.S. law, although federal
court is a less favorable forum for plaintiffs because of ceilings on
monetary damages and a unanimous jury requirement. In a state court,
only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict in a civil case.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Emanuel, a Los Angeles employment lawyer who represents
management, said he expects that California employers will follow
federal age discrimination rules even if workers are less likely to
prevail in lawsuits in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling "is surprising a lot of people, but once you read
the statute, it is clear that the state's age discrimination law does
not apply to benefits," Emanuel said.</TE>
<TE>   The case already has spurred introduction of a bill in Sacramento
to restore protections for older workers' benefits. An aide to
Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod (D-Chino), the bill's author,
said Monday that the Legislature probably will pass the legislation
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature passed another bill in 1998 to expand protections
for older workers, but then-Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed it. Wilson said
at the time that older workers already were protected by the state's
antidiscrimination law.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has taken no position on the new bill. A spokesman
said Monday that his legal advisors are studying the court's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   William C. Quackenbush, who helped argue Monday's case for
workers, said the court's ruling could have major consequences for
California employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The court is basically saying that under state law it is not
illegal to single out those over 40 and say you don't get these
benefits," said Quackenbush, a San Mateo lawyer. "The concept of
benefits would probably extend to any employee benefit other than
wages."</TE>
<TE>   Even if workers sued in federal court, the federal age
discrimination law exempts certain claims over employee benefit
plans, Quackenbush said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in a case in which an Orange County worker was
denied access to corporate assistance for education because of his
age.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Esberg of Corona was hired at age 42 by Union Oil Co. of
California as a telecommunications specialist. The company paid his
expenses to obtain an undergraduate degree.</TE>
<TE>   At 56, Esberg told his supervisor that he and another colleague
were planning to obtain master's degrees in business administration
and would finance their education through the company's education
benefits program. Esberg's supervisor was not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "You're too old to invest in," the supervisor told him.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, the company denied funding for Esberg's
graduate degree. Three younger employees, including a 42-year-old,
received the assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Esberg sued, and a jury voted 11 to 1 to award him $51,000 in
economic damages and $35,000 in noneconomic damages, including
emotional distress. Esberg's employer had a policy against age
discrimination, and the jury found that it had violated this
policy--a contract--with Esberg.</TE>
<TE>   But violation of a contract can not be penalized with emotional
distress damages. The trial judge struck down the $35,000 emotional
distress award on the grounds that the state's Fair Employment and
Housing Act, which does allow for such damages, offers no protections
against age discrimination in the awarding of job benefits. A Court
of Appeal agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal Corp., the parent company of Union Oil, denied
discriminating against Esberg because of his age. Esberg, 64, has
left Union Oil and now works for a construction company.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe we discriminated in this case, and our policy is
not to discriminate," said Barry Lane, a Unocal spokesman. He said
the firm refused to pay for the costs of Esberg's graduate education
because of his work performance, not his age.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding the lower court decisions in Esberg's case, the
California Supreme Court said the state's antidiscrimination law bars
bias in working conditions and benefits on the basis of race,
religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical
disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex
or sexual orientation--but not age.</TE>
<TE>   "Although as individuals we may applaud plaintiff's efforts at
self-improvement through education," Kennard wrote in Esberg v. Union
Oil (SO96524), "as judges we find nothing ... that obliges employers
to ignore an employee's age in deciding whether to fund such
efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Dale M. Fiola, an attorney for Esberg, said the ruling gives
employers more "leeway" to discriminate.</TE>
<TE>   The decision means that corporations can say, " 'We want the older
workers to work graveyard,' " Fiola said. "They can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush, who represents workers in employment cases, said the
ruling invalidates a regulation that has been on the books in
California since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "I would worry about things such as stock options," Quackenbush
said. "Stock options are an employee benefit, and if they want to get
rid of older employees, maybe they will just stop giving them new
options."</TE>

<HD>Amtrak's Future Remains Uncertain</HD>
<DH>Railroad: Secretary of Transportation, after meeting with
company officials, says he believes a system shutdown will be
averted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta expressed
confidence Monday that the nation's passenger rail system will not be
shut down this week, but he offered no immediate solution to Amtrak's
financial problems.</LD>
<LD>   During a break in an emergency meeting of Amtrak's board of
directors, Mineta said a solution will require a cut in Amtrak's
expenses and federal financial help.</LD>
<LD>   "I am confident that we will be able to avoid a shutdown of
services," Mineta said. "We have much more work to do but we will
continue to work on an effective solution."</LD>
<TE>   Mineta said the administration and Amtrak will work with Congress
to make sure passenger rail service continues. He said the
administration should not bear the responsibility alone for Amtrak's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This must be a team effort," he said. "The burden is not on the
administration to save the rail system from bankruptcy, nor should it
be."</TE>
<TE>   Mineta's announcement leaves Amtrak still facing the possibility
of the first systemwide shutdown in its three-decade history.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) said Mineta "gave
me his word" that the administration would find a way to resolve
Amtrak's immediate financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli discussed Amtrak with President Bush and Mineta during
the president's visit to New Jersey. Bush stressed the importance of
reform at Amtrak, said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan. The
president wants an Amtrak "driven by sound economics," she said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials could not immediately say whether Bush had
pledged to keep the railroad running.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli said Bush also "made clear his insistence that there be
some changes in Amtrak, some reform in structure and operation."</TE>
<TE>   Members of Amtrak's governing board were gathering in Washington
for a Monday afternoon meeting with Mineta, who last week outlined
several changes for the money-losing passenger railroad.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David L. Gunn says he is open to change but first
must find $200 million to close a budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Railroad Administration, a part of the Transportation
Department, is reviewing Amtrak's request for a loan guarantee for
the needed $200 million. Amtrak has had trouble tapping its existing
line of credit because lenders are unsure how long it can remain in
business.</TE>
<TE>   If the railroad administration ruled that Amtrak does not qualify
for a loan guarantee, the only options would be an order by lawmakers
that the agency grant one or a congressional appropriation.</TE>
<TE>   But time is running out: Gunn has said he would have to begin
turning away passengers and directing trains to storage yards by the
middle of this week.</TE>
<TE>   An Amtrak shutdown also could affect commuter railroads serving
hundreds of thousands of people, mostly along the Atlantic seaboard.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli and Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Jon
Corzine of New Jersey, both also Democrats, said Sunday that inaction
in the crisis would throw the New York metropolitan region into
chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli said Monday that he is open to long-term reforms, but
"right now we don't have time to worry about the long term. We have
to worry about people not getting to work on Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert would not say on NBC's "Meet the
Press" what Congress might do. But Hastert (R-Ill.) gave Amtrak's
managers a tongue-lashing for continuing to serve unprofitable routes
and failing to correct other money-losing policies before turning to
Congress when the cash runs low.</TE>
<TE>   Hastert suggested scaling back Amtrak service.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there are some selective routes that they may want
to shut down," Hastert said. "That's all a part of reform."</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak's president agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to change the way we do business," Gunn said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to turn [Amtrak] into a much more focused organization
with tight fiscal controls."</TE>
<TE>   Gunn said that ending the most unprofitable routes "will not solve
the immediate problem."</TE>

<HD>Woman's Asthma Death Linked to Smoke From Colo. Wildfire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FLORISSANT, Colo.</DL>
<LD>FLORISSANT, Colo. -- A woman's death three days after the start of
Colorado's largest wildfire has been blamed on a severe asthma attack
brought on by smoke and is the first death directly attributed to the
blaze.</LD>
<LD>   Ann Dow, 50, died of an asthma attack and smoke inhalation,
according to her death certificate and her doctor.</LD>
<LD>   Dow collapsed June 11 after telling her husband she couldn't
breathe. Her husband, Gary Dow, said she suffered from asthma most of
her life and carried an inhaler. She told him shortly before she
collapsed that the inhaler wasn't helping.</LD>
<TE>   Dow was pronounced dead in a hospital emergency room. It was
unclear whether Terry Lynn Barton, the U.S. Forest Service employee
charged with starting the 137,000-acre blaze southwest of Denver,
would face additional charges in Dow's death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to say anything," said Jeff Dorschner, spokesman
for U.S. Atty. John Suthers. "We'd need to evaluate all the
documentation before having any further comment."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Dow said Sunday he believed that Barton's "deliberate
actions" caused his wife's death. He said he plans to explore legal
options.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Health officials approved the nation's first skin test for
cholesterol, a system that detects the heart-clogging substance
through the palm of the hand. The action approves its use only in
certain already sick patients.</LD>
<LD>   It's not for routine cholesterol screening, the Food and Drug
Administration stressed. Drawing a little blood remains the only way
to test the general population for high cholesterol.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Cholesterol 1,2,3 test is for people already known to
have severe heart disease or for heart attack survivors, an extra
test to help doctors decide how high the risk of further heart damage
is and thus what next steps to take, the FDA said.</LD>

<HD>Providence Mayor Is Found Corrupt</HD>
<DH>Trial: Vincent A. 'Buddy' Cianci Jr. is convicted of
racketeering conspiracy, but the jury acquits him on 11 remaining
counts. He plans to stay in office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>Vincent A. Cianci Jr., this city's brash and long-serving mayor, was
convicted Monday of conspiring to turn City Hall into a virtual
shopping center where power and influence were up for sale.</LD>
<LD>   After seven weeks of testimony and nine days of deliberation, a
federal jury found the 61-year-old mayor guilty of a single count of
racketeering conspiracy, while acquitting him on the 11 remaining
charges.</LD>
<LD>   The jury found that Cianci and two co-defendants concocted and ran
an elaborate scheme to solicit hundreds of thousands of dollars in
bribes in exchange for city jobs and political favors. But Cianci was
found not guilty of directly accepting bribes or extorting cash.</LD>
<TE>   The single conviction could bring him up to 20 years in prison and
a maximum fine of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci's fate as mayor appeared cloudy. Immediately after the
verdict, the state attorney general issued an opinion permitting
Cianci to remain in office until he is sentenced, on Sept. 6, though
the City Council could seek to remove him sooner. The mayor has said
repeatedly that he intends to seek a seventh term in November.</TE>
<TE>   The normally voluble mayor received the verdict with no display of
emotion. Cianci--known universally here by his childhood nickname,
Buddy--left without commenting to a crowd assembled outside the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   But at a City Hall news conference later, Cianci enumerated the
charges on which he was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you that there is one charge remaining and I will
continue to fight to preserve my innocence," said the mayor, who also
told jokes and playfully praised the press corps for showing up in
such large numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Richard Rose left the court smiling but refused to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci's conviction disappointed James Siedzik, 19, who kept a
steady vigil Monday in Kennedy Plaza, across from the court.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is looking for a reason to pick on him when he has done
so much for the city and the state," said Siedzik, a telemarketer.</TE>
<TE>   But Avedis Bedizian, 75, said he was sorry the verdict wasn't
harsher.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy has been running a criminal enterprise out of City Hall,"
said the retired map maker. "There is no question the guy is up to
here in everything."</TE>
<TE>   Cianci did not testify, and throughout the long trial he stayed at
the helm of the once-seedy municipality that he personally
re-christened "the Renaissance City." He socialized, was a guest on
national radio broadcasts and wasted no opportunity to promote his
own brand of spaghetti sauce, The Mayor's Own.</TE>
<TE>   He has insisted that he plans to run in November for a fourth
consecutive term, and a Brown University poll released as the jury
began deliberations suggested that with a 59% approval rating,
victory likely would be no problem.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Cianci said he was focusing on what to say
at a high school graduation Monday evening--not whether he would file
reelection papers by Wednesday's deadline.</TE>
<TE>   He did vow, however, to "keep every option open."</TE>
<TE>   State law and city ordinance conflict over procedures for removing
an elected official convicted of a felony. The Providence City
Council was expected to hold an emergency meeting today to determine
whether--or when--to call for Cianci's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Lincoln Almond, a former U.S. attorney, issued his own
call Monday for the mayor to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the time has come to say the capital city cannot stand
this type of corruption," said Almond, a Republican. "Enough is
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Cianci, too, was a Republican when first elected in 1974. His
first two terms were tainted by the extortion and fraud convictions
of 22 city workers, and in 1984 Cianci left office under a cloud
after pleading no contest to beating his estranged wife's lover with
a fireplace log.</TE>
<TE>   During his five-year suspended sentence he established himself as
the city's most popular radio talk show host, returning to office in
1991 as an independent.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Cianci took full credit for transforming a grimy,
northeastern industrial city into a glittering hub of culture and
commerce. Among other accomplishments, Cianci rerouted a river and
introduced $300 million in transportation improvements.</TE>
<TE>   But a federal investigation known as Operation Plunder Dome
charged that Cianci profited handsomely from the urban face-lift.
Prosecutors accused Cianci and his top aides of turning Providence
into a "city for sale," squeezing bribes out of citizens seeking
jobs, tax breaks and city contracts.</TE>
<TE>   No direct evidence linked Cianci to the extortion. But tow truck
drivers took the stand to describe illegal contributions to Cianci's
campaign fund. A mother told the court she paid $5,000 to get her son
a job on the police force. A man testified he paid $5,000 to land a
$9-an-hour temporary city job.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said the contributions were voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   When jurors reported Monday that they were deadlocked on a few
counts, Judge Ernest Torres told them to keep trying for a verdict.
More than two hours later, they pronounced Cianci not guilty of
extorting a free lifetime membership from the University Club, an
exclusive social organization here. Cianci also was found not guilty
of mail fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Cianci's co-defendants--former chief assistant Frank Corrente and
tow truck operator Richard Autiello--also were found guilty Monday of
racketeering conspiracy. Corrente was convicted on seven of 16
counts, including racketeering, while Autiello was convicted on three
of seven charges.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, Torres seemed to leave the door open for changes
in the verdict when he told jurors, "There are some legal questions
that need to be dealt with."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides were told to file responses to questions raised by
Torres, who set sentencing for Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   But M. Charles Bakst, a columnist for the Providence Journal who
has long been critical of the mayor, cautioned against writing
Cianci's political obituary.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay tuned," he said. "Don't underestimate this guy's gift for
survival."</TE>

<HD>Hope Visits Death Row After High Court's Ruling</HD>
<DH>Sentencing: Inmates in several states could escape
execution, although the justices leave many unanswered questions,
experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two decades ago, an Alabama jury unanimously decided that Phillip
Tomlin should get life in prison instead of death for killing a man
involved in the murder of his brother and his brother's 15-year-old
girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   But under the state's laws, the judge overruled the jury and put
Tomlin on death row, where he has been ever since.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney who represented Tomlin in his latest trial--his
fourth--said Monday's Supreme Court ruling could give Tomlin and
hundreds of inmates like him a chance to get off death row.</LD>
<TE>   The court ruled that jurors, not judges, must decide the critical
issues that determine whether a convicted killer is sentenced to
death, potentially affecting nearly 800 cases in nine states, from
Delaware to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and defense lawyers were still assessing the effect of
the ruling Monday. It was unclear how many inmates could be affected
because the justices did not specify whether the ruling applies in
cases where appeals have been exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   But Colorado's attorney general sought to reassure the public that
none of the three convicted killers sentenced to death by judges in
his state would be released from prison. At a minimum, they would be
sentenced to life in prison, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, whose law was declared unconstitutional by the court,
Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano urged all presiding judges to suspend
sentencing in death penalty cases and called on the governor to plan
a special session of the Legislature to amend the state's death
penalty statutes to comply with the court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The Nebraska attorney general's office issued a statement saying
the decision "does not affect in any way the fact that Nebraska
prisoners currently under a sentence of death are guilty of
first-degree murder."</TE>
<TE>   Idaho, Colorado and Montana, along with Arizona and Nebraska,
leave it to judges to decide whether a defendant is sentenced to
death. In Alabama, Delaware and Florida, juries make recommendations
but judges make the final call. California was not affected by the
decision because juries decide whether a defendant should be put to
death.</TE>
<TE>   In Delaware, prosecutors weren't sure whether the ruling would
even affect the state.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a number of important questions left unanswered by the
Supreme Court's ruling," said state prosecutor Steve Wood. "We don't
know whether the ruling applies to Delaware. That question ultimately
will be answered by a federal court."</TE>
<TE>   Although Delaware has 15 inmates on death row, there has been only
one case since the death penalty law was adopted in 1991 where the
judge imposed a death sentence after a majority of a jury recommended
a sentence of life in prison--a case involving a man who fatally shot
a woman during a robbery in Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   However, there have been a number of cases where judges declined
to impose the death penalty, even though a majority of jurors
recommended it.</TE>
<TE>   The Idaho attorney general's office expects that the ruling will
be raised by all 21 inmates now facing the death penalty in that
state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see how it plays out on a case-by-case basis,"
said Michael Henderson, chief of the office's criminal law division.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is likely to apply to six of the 21 cases because they
remain in the direct appeals phase, Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   But even in some of those cases, Henderson said, the office hopes
to avoid new trials by arguing that the jury's verdict in effect
shows that it found aggravating factors required by the new ruling.
For instance, Darrell Payne was sentenced this spring to death for
the abduction and killing of a young Boise woman. The jury found that
the killing was premeditated and done during the commission of a
felony crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll argue that no harm was done because the jury would have
found the aggravating factor and did find the aggravating factor by
arriving at these verdicts," Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Montana Atty. Gen. Mike McGrath said the ruling will not have any
effect on the six death row cases in his state because the Supreme
Court did not specify that the ruling was effective retroactively. In
each of the six cases in Montana, the inmates have exhausted their
direct appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, judges have decided whether there were any aggravating
circumstances to warrant the death penalty in homicide cases, McGrath
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, juries must make these findings of aggravating
circumstances, such as that the homicide was in a prison or resulted
in multiple deaths, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in Montana, judges will still be responsible for imposing the
death penalty after the jury makes its findings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If there are legal challenges to the existing death penalty
convictions, McGrath said, his office will fight them, and he does
not expect any problems because the aggravating circumstances in each
is obvious given the facts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm familiar with all of them and each of them are clear cut," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, the attorney general's office was examining the effect
of the ruling on seven cases in which a jury recommended life but
judges imposed the death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama, attorneys for Tomlin said they expect his case to go
back to a jury for sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our argument is going to be that the death penalty is not valid
in that case," said Stephen Bright, an attorney and director of the
Southern Center For Human Rights in Atlanta. "If we win, he gets to
go back to have a jury trial" to decide his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Bright said his group has about 20 death row cases in Alabama, and
all of them could be affected.</TE>
<TE>   "But the best and strongest cases are cases like Tomlin's," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bright disagreed that the ruling only will affect cases that are
still under direct appeal and suggested that the ruling might offer a
ray of hope to others on death row.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you determine you're going to carry out 100 nonconstitutional
executions?" Bright asked. "I would think not."</TE>

<HD>Humans Consume More Than Earth Can Replace, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humans now consume more of the Earth's natural resources than the
planet can replace, raising doubts about the long-range
sustainability of modern economies, according to a new study being
published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 20 years, people have been depleting natural
resources, including fish, forests and arable land, at a rapid rate.
Economic expansion has boosted demand for resources and overshot the
planet's ability to regenerate them by 20%, the study says.</LD>
<LD>   "You can overdraw on nature's accounts and leave a debt. We are no
longer living off nature's interest, but nature's capital.
Sustainable economies are not possible if we live beyond the means of
nature," said Mathis Wackernagel, lead author of the study and
sustainability program director for Oakland-based Redefining
Progress, a nonprofit public policy group.</LD>
<TE>   The study, titled "Tracking the Ecological Overshoot of the Human
Economy," was produced by an international team of researchers and
will be published this week. It marks the first attempt to build a
comprehensive accounting method to assess the cost borne by nature of
human activity.</TE>
<TE>   The latest study is part of a growing body of work that attempts
to calculate the cost to the environment of a variety of human
activities, not just of a product in a marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   In estimating the "ecological footprint" of humanity, the authors
looked at six activities over the past 40 years, calculated how much
land and biological production is devoted to those activities and how
much is needed to sustain them. The researchers looked at growing
crops for food and other products; grazing animals for meat, milk and
wool; logging; fishing; providing space and materials for houses,
highways, dams and industries; and fossil fuel burning.</TE>
<TE>   According to their analysis, human demand has been outstripping
nature's ability to resupply since the early 1980s. Since 1961, human
demand on resources has nearly doubled and today exceeds the Earth's
replacement capacity by 20%, the researchers found.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the impact is in the area of fossil fuel use. For example,
energy consumption has increased so much over the past 40 years that
it takes about five times more land mass to produce fossil fuels and
absorb carbon-based emissions. Indeed, at the heart of the concern
over global warming is the fact that more carbon is being produced
than the planet can capture.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it takes at least 5.75 acres of land to sustain one average
person on Earth, although it takes nearly twice that much to support
one European and nearly four times that much to support one American,
the study shows.</TE>
<TE>   "You can debate any one of these measurements, but whenever
scientists look at this issue they come up with very disturbing
answers," said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope. "We are not
on a sustainable path and these measures show us the situation is
getting worse and we should be concerned and start taking action."</TE>
<TE>   But critics have challenged the assumptions behind such studies.
They note that technological breakthroughs and better land-use
practices can make farms, factories and power plants, among others,
more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, while the study compares consumption with the Earth's
replacement capacity, it does not factor in the large holdings of
natural resources effectively kept in reserve. How long that "natural
capital" can withstand being overdrawn is an open question.</TE>
<TE>   Wackernagel said the purpose of the study was to provide business
and government leaders a clearer idea of the ecological costs of
human activity and economic expansion. "We're not saying this is
inevitable, but if we don't have accounts of nature, it's the same as
a business that doesn't know how much it spends and earns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven researchers from six nations participated in the study.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision, which states that only a
jury can hand down a death sentence:</LD>
<LD>   "Capital defendants, no less than non-capital defendants, we
conclude, are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which
the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment."
-- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The Court has failed ... to offer any meaningful justification for
deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding that
application of the "increase in the maximum penalty rule is not
required by the Constitution." -- Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
dissenting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Apart from the Eighth Amendment provenance of aggravating
factors, Arizona presents no specific reason for excepting capital
defendants from the constitutional protections ... extended to
defendants generally, and none is readily apparent." -- Ginsburg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Court effectively declares five states' capital sentencing
schemes unconstitutional.... There are 168 prisoners on death row in
these states ... each of whom is now likely to challenge his or her
death sentence." -- O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be
unsuccessful, either because the prisoners will be unable to satisfy
the standards of harmless error or plain error review, or because,
having completed their direct appeals, they will be barred from
taking advantage of today's holding on federal collateral review....
Nonetheless, the need to evaluate these claims will greatly burden
the courts in these five States. " -- O'Connor.</TE>

<HD>Crews Prepare to Face Fire Advancing on City</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Arizona's biggest-ever blaze has burned hundreds
of homes in an L.A.-sized area and is within a mile of Show Low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>As firefighters readied hoses to extinguish house fires Monday, crews
frantically cut small pine trees behind homes at the forest edge in a
desperate effort to slow a monstrous fire that marched to within a
mile of this mountain town.</LD>
<LD>   The fire has destroyed at least 329 homes and 16 buildings in
surrounding communities. It outpaced efforts to divert it from this
city of 7,700 Saturday night, forcing residents to flee. The fire,
the largest in Arizona history, had burned 331,000 acres, or 517
square miles, an area bigger than Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Smoke and falling ash cloaked Show Low, building tension among
firefighters and causing some of the region's 30,000 evacuees to
wonder about their futures.</LD>
<TE>   Some, like James Christian of Show Low, said they were resigned to
losing their homes and had learned a lesson about forest living.</TE>
<TE>   He would take his insurance money and rebuild, Christian said,
biding his time at a Red Cross shelter at Holbrook, about 50 miles to
the north. "But it sure will not be under shade trees," he said,
referring to the ponderosa pines that surround his home.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency crews here patrolled empty streets, looking for spot
fires ignited by firebrands in trees and rooftops, as Show Low
awaited its fate.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said nothing stood in the way of the fire's forced
entry into the city's western neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll give up the forest to that point," said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Jim Paxon. "Those houses are being prepared for a fire. If
the fire comes out [of the forest], we'll catch it where we can
defend it. We'll have pavement, green lawns, metal buildings."</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters, positioned behind a neighborhood closest to the
oncoming flames, wielded axes to create a 100-foot buffer free of
small ponderosa pines that otherwise would funnel flames to larger
trees hanging over the rooftops of manufactured homes.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could have done prescribed burning to control the fuels
near the ground, that would have helped," said one crew boss, John
Patterson, echoing the sentiment of others--including Gov. Jane Dee
Hull--that thinning the forests would have decreased the intensity of
wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the homes, more than a dozen fire engines were parked
on the street. Their crews were powerless for the time being, so they
sat in lawn chairs waiting for what they believed was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping nothing comes through, but if it does, we expect it
to come up right behind us," Phoenix Fire Department Battalion Chief
Phillip Yeager said. If the house fires collectively grew too hot,
his crews would retreat to a nearby church parking lot and return
half an hour later to save what they could.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a three-mile-wide wall of flames 200 feet high was
roaring toward the city, but it cooled Sunday and Monday as
temperatures fell slightly into the upper 80s. The overnight humidity
also helped when it climbed to more than 40%, returning moisture to
trees that during the day were dried by desert-like, single-digit
humidity.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters spent the early Monday morning hours building fire
lines with bulldozers and carefully controlled burnouts to the
southwest of the city. But smoke between the fire and the city was so
dense Monday that air tankers dropping fire retardant focused instead
on the fire's northern front, where still more homes were threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the fire that was headed for Show Low out of the west
appeared less treacherous, Paxon warned that flames could still feed
on "jackpots of fuel" that would send fiery ash into town.</TE>
<TE>   The only question, he said, was whether hundreds of firefighters
positioned throughout the city would be able to extinguish any
rooftop fires before they engulf homes.</TE>
<TE>   The fire had grown so large the forest service set up four
different command posts. The blaze, now called the Rodeo-Chediski
fire, is the combination of two fires that merged Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,200 firefighters had been assigned to the fire, and
Paxon said that twice that many were expected by today.</TE>
<TE>   In Holbrook, Show Low resident Gerald R. Vermuele, 68, was
resigned to the fact he would lose his home and his treasured
antiques. Sitting next to his friend Jim Christian, Vermuele said,
"I've been collecting them for 25 to 30 years." His favorite: an
1850s serpent-head flowerpot stand.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you do about it?" he said of the fire. "It's just old
mother nature."</TE>
<TE>   "And she's not been very kind to us, the old bag," added
Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Ramsey, a 69-year-old resident of Overgaard, which already
had been swarmed by fire, said she holds on to her religious faith
that her home would be there when she returned.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not," said Ramsey, "I will sit and bawl my eyes out."</TE>
<TE>   Becky and Dany Seymour, among the few who refused to abandon their
homes, watched the advancing smoke from their Show Low
brick-and-stucco home--with wood shake roof.</TE>
<TE>   They were about to host their daughter's wedding reception
Saturday night--scores of guests had already shown up--when
evacuation orders came, and everyone fled except the couple and two
of their children. The newlyweds began their honeymoon early, rushing
to Phoenix; the colorful four-tiered wedding cake was uncut, sliced
vegetables uneaten, sealed in their plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   "I have faith things will be all right," Becky Seymour said. "If
we see flames, we'll leave--but I'm not sure where we'd go."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush planned to tour the fire area today and encourage
the firefighters. The stop would be a brief detour from his trip to a
summit meeting of major industrial nations in the Canadian Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday it would
allocate $20 million to help pay for the firefighting effort here.</TE>
<TE>   Other fires continued to burn in the West, including near Durango,
Colo., where still more homes were evacuated Monday in the face of a
63,466-acre fire.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest of Denver, the Hayman fire--which just a week ago was
the largest fire in the country--was 69% contained at 137,000 acres.
About three-fourths of the 8,900 evacuated people have been allowed
to return home.</TE>

<HD>Trial Linked to Hezbollah Casts Shadow</HD>
<DH>Law: Gloom pervades nascent Arab American community in
Charlotte, N.C., after the conviction of a Lebanese man for aiding a
terrorist group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>With Al Jazeera blaring on TV, trays of baklava sweating on the
countertops and pictures of Beirut beckoning from the walls,
Cedarland Deli is Charlotte's little window on the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   But lately, the view has been kind of gloomy.</LD>
<LD>   "Wrong, wrong, wrong," seethed waiter Khaled Jhish as he scooped
up a bowl of hummus Monday. "What's happening around here, with all
these investigations and questions and Arabs going to jail, is wrong.
It makes everybody look bad."</LD>
<TE>   Last week, two Lebanese-born brothers were found guilty of running
a cigarette smuggling ring here. One of them, Mohamad Hammoud, also
was convicted of funneling cash to Hezbollah, a Lebanese group that
the State Department says is a terrorist front.</TE>
<TE>   Hammoud is the first person to be convicted under a controversial
law prohibiting "material support" to an outlawed group, and his fate
has frightened many Arab Americans, who often send money to charities
back home.</TE>
<TE>   It's also touched nearly everyone in Charlotte's nascent Lebanese
community. In an investigation that took nearly two years and netted
18 suspects, FBI agents cornered families in butcheries, searched
many homes and tried to play friends and business partners off one
another. For many Arab Americans here, it was yet another humiliating
moment in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't even go to the trial to show our support," said Sam
Hariri, a Lebanese American. "We were terrified."</TE>
<TE>   Hammoud, a 28-year-old who was born in Lebanon and came to the
United States 10 years ago, said he was sending money to a charity.
The government said he was helping terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, at least a dozen people face the same charge,
including American Talib John Walker Lindh and Zacarias Moussaoui,
accused of plotting as the "20th hijacker" in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The law was enacted in 1996. But some experts say it's especially
tricky applying it now--and one judge just threw it out.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of Sept. 11, we have to be very vigilant, " said Eric
Davis, a Middle East scholar at Rutgers University. "But how far will
we take this? Are we going to say people can't give money to victims
of the Iranian earthquake because that country has been labeled an
axis of evil?"</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, a federal judge dismissed a case Friday against
seven people accused of raising money for an Iranian opposition
group. The judge ruled that the State Department's procedure for
designating the group as a terrorist organization is
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how that decision will affect Hammoud's chances of
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The status of Hezbollah, which the State Department branded a
terrorist organization in 1997, is particularly ambiguous.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Irish Republican Army, Hezbollah--or Party of God--is
part political group, part guerrilla army.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah leaders hold seats in Lebanon's Parliament and run
hospitals and schools. But its fighters, backed by Syria and Iran,
helped drive Israel out of southern Lebanon and were thought to be
behind the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut that
killed 241 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Hammoud grew up middle class, left Beirut in 1992 and arrived in
the United States seeking asylum. While his papers were being
processed, he took a job at a Domino's pizzeria in Charlotte, where
he met his wife. She made pizzas. He delivered them.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband always appreciated this country," his wife, Angela
Tsioumas, said in an interview Monday. "He didn't want to harm it."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Hammoud started buying cigarettes from North
Carolina wholesalers, where the tax is 5 cents a pack, and trucking
them to Michigan, where the tax is 75 cents. He got rich off the
profits from the illegal trade, the government said, and even opened
a $1.2-million service station.</TE>
<TE>   Government agents said Hammoud also provided money and equipment
such as night-vision goggles to Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested in July 2000 with 17 others, including his older
brother, Chawki. Many of them cooperated with authorities, including
one former business partner who agreed to testify that Mohamad
Hammoud gave him $3,500 to take to Hezbollah officials.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the trial against the Hammoud brothers opened in an
intensely guarded federal courthouse in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors steadily built a case about the illicit cigarette
sales and immigration violations, establishing that Mohamad Hammoud
was married to three women at the same time in a doomed bid for U.S.
citizenship. He didn't dispute this.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers focused on the Hezbollah charge against Mohamad.
They argued that by banning donations to Hezbollah, the government
was depriving him of his 1st Amendment rights to freedom of speech
and religion.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the trial, Mohamad Hammoud took the stand, saying he
loved America.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors quickly convicted him and his brother of the cigarette and
immigration violations. They convicted Mohamad of aiding a terrorist
group Friday. He could face life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Most people at Cedarland Deli followed the twists and turns even
if they didn't feel comfortable in a courtroom full of FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe those guys were breaking the law," said Hariri, a de facto
leader within the 500-member Lebanese American community here. "But
the whole thing kind of makes you feel conspicuous."</TE>

<HD>Justices to Rule on Family Leaves</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: Nevada claims the states have a 'sovereign
immunity' from a 1993 federal law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court took up another states' rights challenge to a
Clinton-era law Monday, saying it would decide whether the nation's 5
million state employees can sue if they are denied emergency family
leave.</LD>
<LD>   In 1993, Congress--then under Democrats' control--adopted a
Clinton administration proposal requiring employers to grant workers
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a sick child or an elderly
parent.</LD>
<LD>   Business groups criticized the new federal mandate. Although they
noted that most employers granted such requests, they questioned
whether it should be written into law.</LD>
<TE>   In Nevada, state officials challenged the law on quite different
grounds. They said that under the 11th Amendment to the Constitution,
which limits lawsuits against states, the state has a "sovereign
immunity" that shields it from these federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the court's conservative majority has struck down
part or all of several Clinton administration laws on states' rights
grounds, including the Brady Act on handgun registration, the
Violence Against Women Act and the Gun-Free School Zones Act.</TE>
<TE>   The same 5-4 majority also shielded state agencies from being sued
by workers over claims of discrimination based on their age or
disability.</TE>
<TE>   The latest case began in 1997 when William Hibbs, an employee of
the Nevada Department of Human Resources, requested leave to care for
his ailing wife.</TE>
<TE>   After using his 12 weeks, he asked for more time under a program
that allowed for "catastrophic leave." In November, four months after
he began the leave, Hibbs was told to return to work or be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   He did not return on time and was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Hibbs filed a grievance and then brought a lawsuit challenging his
dismissal as a violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben, siding with the state, ruled
that the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields states from lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers defended the law, and the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld it as a type of civil rights measure.
In passing the law, Congress said it wanted to break down the gender
stereotype that caring for the family is women's work. The
Constitution's 14th Amendment says Congress has the power to enforce
civil rights laws against states.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court voted to take up Nevada's appeal to decide
the broad question of whether the Family and Medical Leave Act
applies to state employers. The case of Nevada vs. Hibbs, 01-1368,
will be heard in the fall.</TE>

<HD>Retrial Opens in Louima Abuse Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: A former NYPD officer is accused of holding the
victim during the attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Reprising a notorious case of police brutality, a prosecutor charged
Monday that former officer Charles Schwarz violated Abner Louima's
civil rights by holding the Haitian immigrant down in a Brooklyn
station house while another patrolman tortured him with a broomstick.</LD>
<LD>   "Charles Schwarz took Mr. Louima to the bathroom of the station
house," Assistant U.S. Atty. Lauren Resnick told the jury during
opening statements at Schwarz's second trial on accusations of
violating Louima's civil rights.</LD>
<LD>   "You will find beyond a reasonable doubt that Charles Schwarz
participated in the brutal assault and lied to cover over this
unspeakable act," the prosecutor said.</LD>
<TE>   But a defense lawyer presented a different picture, alleging that
Thomas Wiese helped Justin Volpe sodomize Louima in August 1997.
Wiese was Volpe's partner.</TE>
<TE>   Volpe pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The case shocked the city and shook the faith of many New Yorkers
in the Police Department. The attack by the white officers on Louima,
who is black, sparked street demonstrations and allegations that it
was part of a pattern of excessive force against minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "There was such a rush to judgment in this case, not a proper
investigation," said Ronald Fischetti, the chief lawyer representing
Schwarz, before the jury. "He had no reason to lie about being in
that bathroom. He just wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Fischetti said investigators never showed Louima a picture of
Wiese.</TE>
<TE>   Louima was the first prosecution witness at the trial in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn. Although five years had passed and he had
testified three times before, Louima's account riveted the jury.</TE>
<TE>   He said Volpe told him in the bathroom "he was going to do
something to me and if I make any noise, he'll kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Louima said both officers punched and kicked him and he screamed
in pain before Volpe attacked him with the broken broomstick. Louima
said that Volpe later warned him: "If I ever talked to anyone, he'd
kill me and everyone in my family."</TE>
<TE>   Louima, a former security guard, identified the driver of the
police car that took him to the station house after a scuffle outside
a Brooklyn nightclub as the person who placed his foot over his mouth
while Volpe attacked him.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the driver is Schwarz, who was found guilty in
1998 on civil rights charges.</TE>
<TE>   In February, a federal appeals court ordered a new trial, ruling
that the 36-year-old former policeman was not adequately represented
by counsel, and that the jury at his first trial was influenced by
news reports. Schwarz, who had begun serving a 15-year sentence in an
Oklahoma prison, was freed on $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court ruling also dismissed all charges against Wiese,
who had been convicted along with Schwarz of conspiring to suppress
information and impede the investigation. The decision prevents him
from being retried, prosecutors said. Wiese had been free on bond
pending appeal of his five-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   During her opening argument, Resnick told the jury that the person
"who held Abner Louima down while he cried out in pain is sitting
right here in this room--the defendant, Charles Schwarz."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said the central theme of the case was not about
police officers making life-and-death decisions on the street or
about the "thousands of good cops who risk their lives every day."</TE>
<TE>   "This trial is about a tremendous act of brutality, the torture of
a human being," Resnick said. "Charles Schwarz is charged with
participating in this horrendous act and lying under oath."</TE>
<TE>   Arguing for the defense, Fischetti said Louima had resisted arrest
outside the nightclub and that it took four officers to handcuff him.
He labeled the bathroom attack "a terribly brutal act."</TE>
<TE>   "But being a victim of such a horrendous act does not give you the
right to lie and implicate an innocent man," Fischetti said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer told the jury that Louima previously described
the second person in the bathroom as 5 feet, 7 inches tall.</TE>
<TE>   "My client is 6-1," Fischetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Louima spent two months in hospitals for his injuries. After
charges against him were dropped, he filed a civil lawsuit against
the city and received an $8.7-million settlement. He lives in Miami
with his wife and three children.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz could face 20 years in prison if he is convicted.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A handyman who worked at the home of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart has
been arrested for a parole violation and is at the top of the list of
potential suspects in her disappearance, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Albert Ricci, who has a 29-year criminal record, was
questioned by police the day after the girl's apparent abduction and
was among those re-interviewed because he did painting and yard work
at the home.</LD>
<LD>   Ricci's alibi "became more suspicious" when he was questioned
again, Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse said Monday. The chief
wouldn't elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   "At this point in time, he is not a charged suspect, but he is
very interesting," Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said Ricci has denied involvement in the disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci was arrested on an unrelated parole violation June 14, nine
days after Elizabeth was reported taken at gunpoint from her bedroom
in an affluent Salt Lake City neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having had Ricci in custody for 11 days, police haven't
been able to pin down his whereabouts on the morning of the
abduction, Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci, 48, had been living in a trailer park in the suburb of
Kearns. His criminal history in Utah dates to 1973, and he was
convicted 10 years later of attempted homicide for shooting a police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Thomas, a family spokesman, said Ricci worked at the Smarts'
home a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's house and car have been searched and he has voluntarily
talked to police, Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not shown Ricci's photograph to the sole witness of
the apparent abduction, Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, Mary Katherine
Smart.</TE>

<HD>Bush Promotes Homeland Security Plan at N.J. Port</HD>
<DH>Defense: He tells Coast Guardsmen and others reorganization
would make their jobs easier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>NEWARK, N.J. -- President Bush toured the largest marine cargo
terminal on the East Coast on Monday as he sought support for his
plan to create a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security--the
centerpiece of a reorganization effort that he said would make the
federal government more effective in protecting Americans against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "It'll make your jobs easier for those of you involved with the
agencies I'm talking about," Bush told hundreds of Coast Guardsmen
and workers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
lost scores of employees in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade
Center. Earlier, Bush met with many of their loved ones.</LD>
<LD>   The president spoke on a sweltering morning in the shadows of
towering cargo loaders here before attending a fund-raiser for Rep.
Mike Ferguson (R-N.J.), a first-term congressman locked in a tough
reelection campaign. Then Bush returned to Washington, where he
announced his peace plan for the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   The president's proposal to create the department enjoys strong
support on Capitol Hill, but impending turf battles could complicate
the plan's passage; Bush said Monday that more than 100 existing
agencies are involved with homeland security. At the same time, many
lawmakers question whether the proposed reorganization would truly
bring about better collaboration among the array of agencies charged
with gathering intelligence, including the FBI, CIA and National
Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   But the president sought to dispel such skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "...If cultures need to be changed within agencies, we'll change
the cultures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing homeland security under one authority, Bush added, will
create "accountability and responsibility in Washington, D.C."</TE>
<TE>   Such an agency, he told the Coast Guard personnel and port
authority workers, would "make your jobs easier."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also took note of a panoply of improvements at ports of entry
to ensure that only safe cargo is allowed in. But Gordon Johndroe, a
spokesman for Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, conceded that,
even now, only 2% of the 3,500 containers arriving daily at New
York-area ports are screened, due to insufficient resources.</TE>
<TE>   However, Johndroe added, "That percentage is slowly but surely
increasing."</TE>

<HD>Death Sentences Ruled Up to Juries</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: It is unconstitutional for judges to decide
the key facts that send a person to death row, the justices say. The
scope of the ruling is uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Calling into doubt nearly 800 death sentences, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday that it is unconstitutional for judges, rather than
jurors, to decide the key facts that call for sending a guilty person
to death row.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-2 decision, the second in a week to limit the death penalty,
affects nine states, including Arizona, where judges decide who
deserves to die.</LD>
<LD>   It is not clear whether many inmates will be spared by Monday's
ruling, however, because the justices did not say it extends to old
cases.</LD>
<TE>   The latest decision, combined with last week's ruling affecting
the mentally retarded, does not represent a major retreat by the
Supreme Court from the principle that states can impose death
sentences. However, the two rulings will give hundreds of inmates a
new chance to contest  their death sentences and keep state officials
tied up in litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama, more than a quarter of the inmates condemned to die
were sentenced by judges after juries had recommended they should be
spared. Monday's ruling suggests many of those death sentences will
be reversed. However, the court did not say the ruling applies
automatically to old cases.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, opponents of capital punishment were cheered by
Supreme Court rulings for the first time in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most favorable term in a quarter of a century in
terms of death penalty jurisprudence," said Stephen W. Hawkins,
executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Others were more muted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to tell whether this is a case about the death penalty
or the right to a jury trial," said Columbia University law professor
James Liebman, an expert on capital punishment. Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas, strong supporters of the death penalty,
joined Monday's ruling, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   "But combined with [the ruling on mental retardation], it suggests
the court has heard the public raising questions about the death
penalty, and it is prepared, like the rest of us, to rethink the
issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   California should be unaffected by the latest ruling. The state's
law, like that in 28 others that allow capital punishment, requires
juries to decide whether the defendant is guilty of a capital crime
and whether he or she deserves to die for it.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Supreme Court has upheld the judge-sentencing
system too. A 1990 ruling affirmed Arizona's system, but the justices
took the unusual step of reversing that ruling Monday.</TE>
<TE>   They did so based on a new concern about the role of juries in the
criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the 6th Amendment would
be senselessly diminished," wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if a
judge alone can decide whether a participant in a robbery plot is, in
fact, a murderer who should be executed.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in the case of Timothy Ring.</TE>
<TE>   A jury in Phoenix convicted him for his role in the robbery of a
Wells Fargo armored van that resulted in the death of the driver.</TE>
<TE>   During their investigation, police received a tip and tapped the
phones of several men, including Ring. The callers were overheard
talking about the $562,000 in cash that was stolen. Police later
searched Ring's garage and found a duffel bag with $271,000 in cash.</TE>
<TE>   After convicting him, the jury was sent home. In a separate
sentencing hearing before a judge, prosecutors presented testimony
from an accomplice who said Ring had masterminded the plot and shot
the driver. The judge pronounced Ring the murderer and sentenced him
to die.</TE>
<TE>   By a lopsided margin in Ring vs. Arizona, 01-488, the Supreme
Court reversed Ring's sentence because the jury did not find him
guilty of the ultimate crime that put him on death row.</TE>
<TE>   His conviction in the robbery-murder plot stands, and Arizona
prosecutors remain free to seek a new death sentence for him from a
jury. But they must convince jurors unanimously and beyond a
reasonable doubt that Ring was the triggerman.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the court has said new procedural rulings do not
upset old convictions. But rulings that announce a fundamental
constitutional principle do apply to all cases. Last week's ruling
was one such example. Because it is cruel and unusual punishment to
execute a mentally retarded  person, that rule extends to all cases,
the justices said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they will have to decide, through rulings in future
cases, whether fact-finding by jurors is a procedural rule or
fundamental principle. Until then, state prosecutors and defense
lawyers will be fighting to clarify just who will benefit from
Monday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Four other states--Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Nebraska--have
judge-sentencing systems similar to Arizona's. Another four--Alabama,
Delaware, Florida and Indiana--have what Ginsburg referred to as
"hybrid systems." The jurors hear testimony on the sentence and make
a recommendation, but the judge ultimately decides whether a guilty
defendant receives a prison term or a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In all the affected states, prosecutors have three options. They
can agree to new sentencing hearings. They can step back and offer
inmates a life prison term instead of a death sentence. Or they can
argue in court that the Ring decision does not apply to certain
inmates, either because the jury had recommended a death sentence or
because the inmate's appeals have run out.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's surprising decision is a triumph of sorts for Justice
John Paul Stevens. For more than 20 years, he has criticized the
reliance on judges to decide who receives the death penalty, and he
dissented in the past when the court upheld such systems.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the liberal Stevens formed an odd-couple alliance
with Scalia, a staunch conservative. Both had written admiringly of
the English common-law principle that jurors should be entrusted with
deciding all questions of guilt and innocence.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, the high court handed down a 5-4 ruling in a case
called Apprendi vs. New Jersey that stunned many lawyers and judges.
It overturned a judge's decision to add two years to the prison term
given a New Jersey man for a handgun crime because, the judge said,
he believed the defendant acted out of racial bias against an African
American neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Without debating the merits of that conclusion, Stevens said the
jury should have decided whether the defendant was guilty of a hate
crime. "Any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury," Stevens wrote. He was
joined by liberal Justices Ginsburg and David H. Souter and
conservatives Scalia and Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In a strong dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called that
opinion a "watershed" that would upset the death sentencing systems
in several states, including her home state of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, her rueful prediction proved to be accurate. She and
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a fellow Arizonan, were the only
dissenters.</TE>
<TE>   In a concurring opinion, Scalia acknowledged being torn. He has
faulted the court for repeatedly second-guessing the state's handling
of death penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, "our people's traditional belief in the right
to trial by jury is in perilous decline," he said, if the court says
it "is perfectly OK" for a judge to decide who is truly guilty. In
the end, Scalia decided it was important to uphold the vital role of
the jury, even if it meant upsetting scores of state cases. Thomas
joined his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer, who dissented
in the Apprendi case two years ago, joined Ginsburg's majority ruling
this time.</TE>
<TE>   In a second sentencing decision handed down Monday, the high court
said again that the Apprendi rule is triggered only when the judge's
extra sentence goes above the maximum in law.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a North Carolina judge sentenced a convicted drug
dealer to seven years in prison, but only after he concluded the
defendant had "brandished" a gun. The law called for a seven-year
term for someone who "brandishes" a gun during a drug crime.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal in Harris vs. U.S., the inmate said he deserved a
lesser prison term because the judge alone decided he brandished the
gun.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court upheld his sentence on a 5-4 vote, since his
total prison time was within the maximum, not above it.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, in the Arizona death penalty case, the maximum
penalty for Ring's conviction for his role in the robbery-murder plot
was life in prison. He received a death sentence only because the
judge ruled he was the triggerman.</TE>

<HD>Japan Now Backs Eskimo Whaling</HD>
<DH>Hunting: Reversal likely will clear way for U.S., Russian
natives to go after the bowhead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Japan has reversed its opposition to bowhead whaling by Russian and
Alaskan Eskimos, likely clearing the way for native communities all
over America's Arctic coast to continue subsistence hunting.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting of the International Whaling Commission last month,
Japan had blocked the renewal of an aboriginal exemption to the
16-year-old worldwide hunting moratorium.</LD>
<LD>   The move came after the United States refused to support Japan's
request that its coastal villages be allowed to hunt 50 minke whales
each year--in addition to the hundreds that nation already takes for
purported scientific purposes.</LD>
<TE>   "We decided to rephrase our position," Noboyuki Yagi, a spokesman
for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Japan will back an Alaska whaling quota if the U.S. can schedule
an interim commission vote this year, Yagi said. But, he cautioned,
"if the U.S. casts a no vote for Japan in April or May [2003], then
we may have to talk about it again."</TE>
<TE>   Rolland Schmitten, head of the U.S. delegation, called Japan's
change of heart a "very encouraging sign.... Obviously, our goal will
be to support the native hunters, both Russian and Alaskan, and to
support keeping this quota under the IWC framework."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials were considering how best to conduct a new
commission vote; the options include a vote by mail or a special
inter-sessional gathering.</TE>
<TE>   It may also be possible to bring the matter up during an October
meeting of whaling commissioners already scheduled on another issue,
Schmitten said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the aboriginal whaling exemption, Alaskan natives have been
allowed in recent years to hunt 67 bowhead whales annually.</TE>
<TE>   While the species has been considered endangered around the world,
scientific studies have shown that the bowhead population is healthy
in the Alaskan Arctic--reproducing at a rate of 3.2% a year.</TE>
<TE>   Alaskan whalers on Monday greeted Japan's new expression of
support with caution. "I'm somewhat relieved, but still skeptical,"
said Edward Itta, vice chairman of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling
Commission. "There are some caveats there."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Tillman, another member of the U.S. delegation to the
IWC, was scheduled to meet with the whalers Monday night in Barrow,
Alaska, to brief them on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has opposed Japan's request to hunt the minke whales
because of the commercial nature of the hunts.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese villagers would be allowed to operate from commercial
vessels using whale cannons; Alaskan natives use small sealskin boats
and hand-held harpoons for their initial strikes, then follow up
withtraditional guns and motorized skiffs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some of the Japanese whale meat would be sold
commercially, while the Alaskans use their take strictly for their
own subsistence.</TE>
<TE>   Yagi said Japan has filed its application as a limited resumption
of commercial whaling but considers it a traditional hunt in villages
with long, cultural histories of coastal minke whaling.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, the coastal minke whaling has been conducted in a very
limited number of places ... in many cases remote places from a
city," Yagi said.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 2, the local economy has been heavily dependent on coastal
whaling.</TE>
<TE>   "Three, there is a certain, nonmonetary transaction of the whale
meat in that particular coastal whaling, which is very different from
huge-scale, industrial whaling.</TE>
<TE>   "The first catch of the season is usually devoted to shrines, and
[given] to local authorities to distribute to local people."</TE>

<LD>Eric Chavez and Greg Myers homered and streaking Oakland routed
Seattle ace Freddy Garcia for 10 runs as the Athletics won their
eighth consecutive game, 13-2, over the Mariners on Monday night at
Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Tejada hit a three-run double and John Mabry had a two-run
double as the A's scored seven runs in the third inning. Oakland won
for the 16th time in 17 games to move into second place and close
within two games of the Mariners in the AL West.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia (10-5) had won six consecutive starts since May 19 but
struggled mightily against the A's. Last year's AL earned-run average
champion gave up a career high in runs, nine hits and five walks in
three innings, raising his ERA from 3.02 to 3.73.</LD>
<TE>   The big third inning staked Cory Lidle (2-6) to a 10-0 lead after
three innings. Lidle gave up two runs and eight hits in seven innings
to win for the first time since April 26.</TE>
<TE>   After Oakland knocked out Garcia, Chavez hit his 19th homer and
Myers had a two-run shot in the fourth inning off Ryan Franklin to
make it 13-1.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland scored three runs in the first on RBI singles by David
Justice and Chavez, and a bases-loaded walk to Terrence Long.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, Mabry got things started for the A's with his
two-run double, which was followed by an RBI single by Long. Tejada
added the bases-loaded double and Justice followed with a double to
score Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki went two for two with a pair of doubles before
leaving after four innings. Suzuki leads the majors with a .369
average.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Chicago 4--Jacque Jones drove in the go-ahead run in
the eighth inning after Torii Hunter tied it with a two-run homer an
inning earlier, giving the Twins a victory over the White Sox at
Minneapolis in the first meeting of the season between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rivas walked with two out against Bobby Howry (0-1), took
second on a wild pitch and scored on a line drive to deep center by
Jones, who was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple to
end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   LaTroy Hawkins (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
Eddie Guardado pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his league-leading 22nd save
in 24 chances.</TE>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Angel right-hander Brendan Donnelly finished up the first game of
Monday's doubleheader against the Texas Rangers, giving up one hit
and one run over the final 2 2/3 innings.</LD>
<LD>   That also finished his latest stint as an Angel. Donnelly was
optioned to the Salt Lake Stingers, the team's triple-A affiliate,
before the second game to make room for right-hander John Lackey, who
was brought up to start the nightcap.</LD>
<LD>   This is nothing new for Donnelly. He's used to spending as much
time on airplanes as he does on the mound. A major league rookie at
30, Donnelly has spent 10 seasons in the minors with nine
organizations.</LD>
<TE>   He has had two tours of duty with the Angels this season,
compiling a 6.14 earned-run average in six appearances with no
decisions. In 7 1/3 innings, he has struck out five and walked three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The doubleheader also forced the Rangers to do some roster
maneuvering. In order to make room for first-game starter Joaquin
Benoit, who was brought up from the Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific
Coast League, the Rangers put outfielder Gabe Kapler, suffering from
tendinitis in his left wrist, on the 15-day disabled list. An MRI
Monday revealed the inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Kapler, who attended Taft High in Woodland Hills, Cal State
Fullerton and Moorpark College, was batting .263 with 14 runs batted
in in 59 games.</TE>
<TE>   For the second game, Benoit, despite the victory, was sent back to
Oklahoma to continue his development. The Rangers brought up
right-hander Aaron Myette to take his spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Lackey started the second game, the Angels became the last of
the American League teams to use a sixth starter this season. In the
National League, the New York Mets are the only club to have stayed
with five starters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel third baseman Troy Glaus, bothered by a nerve ailment
between two toes on his right foot, has borrowed a pair of shoes from
teammate Brad Fullmer because they have soft cleats, which ease the
irritation.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Rangers had Schoeneweis' number heading into this
season. He was 0-3 against them in nine appearances with a 7.68 ERA.
The Angel starter has turned those numbers around in 2002.
Schoeneweis is 2-1 against Texas with a 1.50 ERA. Valdes, who spent
parts of seven seasons with the Dodgers in two tours of duty and all
of last season with the Angels, has done well against Anaheim. He is
1-1 with a 1.76 ERA in two starts against the Angels this season, 2-1
with a 1.98 ERA in four starts against them.</TE>

<HD>Phillies' Bottalico Is Out for the Season</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia right-hander Ricky Bottalico has a torn labrum in his
right shoulder and will probably sit out the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Bottalico hurt his shoulder Saturday and was put on the disabled
list Sunday. A decision regarding surgery has yet to be made, the
Phillies said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bottalico is 0-3 with a 4.61 earned-run average in 30 games.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston Red Sox pitcher Frank Castillo was suspended for five games
and fined an undisclosed amount for making contact with an umpire in
a game last week.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander was ejected in the seventh inning of Boston's 3-2
loss in San Diego Wednesday for arguing a balk call made by three of
the four umpires.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the call, which led to the go-ahead run scoring,
Castillo yelled at third base umpire Bill Welke and was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo rushed Welke and made contact, and Welke jumped back.
Castillo had to be restrained and then pushed away by teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a start-and-stop," Welke said after the game. "He was
arguing the fact I called the balk. He came toward me. He was angry,
saying that was my run, and I ejected him for arguing the balk.</TE>
<TE>   "His foot stepped on my foot. He actually spiked me pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bret Boone will be out of the Seattle Mariner lineup for at least
the first two games of an important series with Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners' starting second baseman underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging test before Monday night's game with the Athletics
that showed inflammation behind his left kneecap.</TE>
<TE>   He left Sunday's victory at Houston after running to first base in
the first inning. He hit the bag awkwardly and aggravated an injury.</TE>
<TE>   Boone walked without a limp in the Mariners' clubhouse before
being examined by Dr. Larry Pedegana, the team's medical director.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta ace Greg Maddux will not make his scheduled start tonight
because of a lingering calf problem, and instead will pitch Friday
night at Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux had to leave his last two starts because of a sore left
calf muscle. He did some light jogging before Monday night's game,
but Manager Bobby Cox decided to hold him back for a few more days.</TE>
<TE>   Albie Lopez will pitch in Maddux's place against the New York
Mets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met right-hander Kane Davis will have surgery Monday on
his right elbow and is not expected to pitch again this season.</TE>
<TE>   He was 1-1 with a 7.07 ERA in 16 games. Davis was put on the
disabled list May 13, but rest and rehabilitation did not help.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't get any better," he said.</TE>

<HD>Change to Give Bats a New Feel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The NCAA's Baseball Research Panel has approved a change that is
expected to make aluminum and composite bats react more like those
made of wood.</LD>
<LD>   The new scale will allow bats that have proven less powerful in
tests to be used in college games, the NCAA said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The previous standard, which was approved in 2000, was based on
how a 34-inch, 31-ounce bat performed. All bats were expected to meet
that standard, in effect reacting the same way.</LD>
<TE>   The change, which the panel approved last week during the College
World Series in Omaha, takes effect next season.</TE>
<TE>   Since setting a standard that is based on scientific data, the
rate of home runs in college games has dropped from 1.06 in 1998 to
0.80 at the midway point last season.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<TE>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10.</TE>
<TE>   An interview British broadcaster David Frost taped with Muhammad
Ali in April is the featured segment in this edition of "Real
Sports." The interview is compelling for a number of reasons, but
mostly because Ali is so lucid.</TE>
<TE>   "He can still knock you out with his words," Frost says, although
the sharp edge is long gone, destroyed by Parkinson's disease. But
the subtitles HBO uses to add clarity to Ali's words are barely
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The piece opens with clips from a 1974 interview Frost did with
Ali. Frost notes that "Ali was not known for his modesty" back then,
which is an understatement. Ali is shown saying such things as, "I
have wrestled with an alligator and tussled with a whale; I
handcuffed lightning and threw thunder in jail."</TE>
<TE>   There also are clips of an interview Frost did with Ali in 1968,
when Ali told Frost "all whites are devils." Frosts asks Ali about
that in this interview, and Ali says, "That's not true. Anybody can
be a devil. Anybody can be evil. It's the mentality, not the color."</TE>
<TE>   Ali talks about his Muslim religion and about Sept. 11. He says
it's right to stop terror, but aptly dodges questions about who is to
blame and if the U.S. should attack Iraq. As Frost notes, "The former
Louisville Lip is now watching his every word, concerned by what
might offend someone."</TE>
<TE>   Says Ali, "I'm not as dumb as I look."</TE>
<TE>   At one point Ali appears to doze off. "Teasing," Ali says as he
snaps out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "You had me fooled," Frost says.</TE>
<TE>   "You are as dumb as you look," Ali says.</TE>
<TE>   Ali does not blame boxing for his disease--"There are a million
people who are not boxers [who have Parkinson's]," he tells
Frost--and he says God has blessed him because he could be in worse
shape. He says his mind is better than ever.</TE>

<LD>Indonesia's top soccer official has some advice for clubs taking part
in the upcoming finals of his country's premier league championship:
If you lose, don't whine like the Italians did at the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "On the international level, [the Italians] were not prepared to
lose," said Agum Gumelar, head of the Indonesian soccer association.</LD>
<LD>   He was speaking to reporters ahead of next week's semifinals of
the Indonesian league championship, which will be played in Jakarta
on July 3. The two winners meet in the finals on July 7 at the
capital's massive Bung Karno Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Gumelar said Indonesian clubs should not emulate "the bad example"
set by Italy and blame their defeats on referees or alleged
conspiracies.</TE>

<HD>Players Are No-Shows at President's Banquet</HD>

<LD>President Olusegun Obasanjo played host to a banquet Monday to honor
Nigeria's World Cup team, but after a disappointing first-round exit
for the Super Eagles, none of the players showed up.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the dinner said players had been forced to decline
invitations because of other club commitments. However, Nigerian
media reported that some of the players had planned to boycott the
event because the government had not paid bonuses to team members.</LD>
<LD>   Obasanjo praised the squad for "preparing well," and said bad luck
was behind Nigeria's first-round exit.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not been disgraced. Next time we believe all the
ingredients will be in our favor: hard work, prayers and luck," the
president said.</TE>
<TE>   Obasanjo insisted the team stick with Nigerian-born coaches,
despite calls to hire a foreigner after the failure of team trainer
Festus Onigbinde.</TE>
<TE>   "Hiring a foreign coach for the national team is unacceptable to
me," Obasanjo said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Onigbinde accused Taribo West and other star members of
the Super Eagles of disobeying orders during the team's short-lived
World Cup campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered that my instructions were being flouted after some
senior players told the other players to disregard them," Onigbinde
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   West was a "bad influence" on the young players, Onigbinde said,
referring to comments by the player describing some of his Nigerian
teammates as "junk."</TE>
<TE>   "We are confounded because the so-called junk players held England
to a draw," Onigbinde said.</TE>

<LD>Turkey's prime minister granted civil servants a half-day off so they
can watch their national soccer team compete in its first World Cup
semifinal match.</LD>
<LD>   "I know everyone in our country is waiting for Wednesday in
excitement and hope," Bulent Ecevit, who is recovering from a series
of illnesses at home, said in a prepared statement.</LD>
<LD>   Turkey faces Brazil in the semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   Turkey's parliament will work in the evening so legislators too
can watch the match, the Anatolia news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is making its first appearance in the World Cup since 1954
and this soccer-crazy country is reveling in the team's success. Tens
of thousands of people poured into the streets on Saturday after
Turkey defeated Senegal, 1-0, in overtime to advance to the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmaker Yasar Topcu, who represents the Black Sea city of Sinop
in parliament, proposed giving players $200,000 each and a medal of
honor for making it to the semifinals. He said that amount should be
increased to $400,000 if Turkey wins the cup.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Mulholland's Not Happy With Himself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As his teammates shook hands on the field after Sunday's win over
Boston, Dodger reliever Terry Mulholland, who pitched the final
inning, made a beeline for the clubhouse. Once there, the reliever
sat and stared into his locker for a good 45 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers had swept a three-game series from the Red Sox to move
into first place in the National League West, but Mulholland,
normally one of the Dodgers' most approachable players, was so
distraught he declined to speak to a reporter.</LD>
<LD>   After the clubhouse emptied around him, Mulholland stepped into
Manager Jim Tracy's office for a closed-door meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a frustrating year so far, and it kind of reached a
boiling point [Sunday]," Mulholland said Monday. "When you don't know
when you're going to get back out there, every little imperfection
kind of compounds the situation."</TE>
<TE>   With Mulholland struggling with a 9.68 earned-run average in 12
appearances, right-hander Guillermo Mota emerging as a stopper in
middle relief, and starters averaging more than six innings a game,
Mulholland's role has been reduced to mopping up in lopsided games.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he hasn't lost confidence in the veteran
left-hander--"I don't quit on my players," the manager said--but
since coming off the disabled list in early June, Mulholland hasn't
appeared in a game in which the Dodgers and their opponent were
separated by fewer than three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland entered Sunday's game with a 9-5 lead, issued a
one-out, four-pitch walk to Rickey Henderson, gave up a single to
Trot Nixon and a sacrifice fly to Nomar Garciaparra before retiring
Carlos Baerga for the final out. Mulholland, 39, has given up earned
runs in four of his five appearances this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just [ticked off] at the way I'm pitching," Mulholland said.
"The walk to Henderson upset me. I feel like I've struggled all year
long to get in a groove, but no matter how much you throw on the
side, no matter how much batting practice you throw, it's still not a
game situation."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland did not vent anger toward Tracy, though. Mulholland,
who is making $3 million, gave up 12 runs and 12 hits, including five
homers, in his first two appearances of the season and spent almost
all of May on the disabled list because of back spasms, and he simply
hasn't been very effective.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally aware of the situation, and I accept my role,"
Mulholland said. "The last thing I'm going to do is put myself in
front of the team. We're in first place.... I know I haven't
contributed the way I can, and that's the most frustrating part of
it. I've always thrived on work, but the opportunities to get things
right haven't presented themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland got another opportunity during Monday's 4-1 loss to
Colorado, pitching a perfect ninth inning to lower his ERA to 9.16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Brown, who underwent surgery for a herniated disk in
his lower back on June 11, will begin part one of a five-step
rehabilitation program today.... Pitcher Darren Dreifort will face
hitters for the first time since last summer's elbow reconstruction
surgery when he throws batting practice before tonight's game. The
next step for Dreifort, after a few batting-practice sessions, would
be to throw a few simulated games, then go on a minor league
rehabilitation assignment. Neither Tracy nor Dreifort will set a date
for a return, but the Dodgers do expect Dreifort to pitch this
season, probably in relief.</TE>

<HD>Agent Has Questions Over Kile's Death</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Axelrod says he wishes he had pressed for more
open discussion of pitcher's health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darryl Kile and Barry Axelrod were united by more than their business
relationship as baseball player and agent. Their fathers died of
heart disease before Kile and Axelrod reached the pinnacle of
success.</LD>
<LD>   Axelrod remembers sharing his excitement with Kile last year after
undergoing a daylong "executive's physical" at Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla that revealed his arteries were clear.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, it doesn't matter how successful you are, your thinking
toward your health can be ridiculous, just stupid, and mine was,"
Axelrod said. "Because my dad had died of coronary disease, I kept
putting off an examination. My thinking was, 'I don't want to know.'
"</LD>
<TE>   Axelrod couldn't recount how Kile reacted to the good health news.
Kile frequently dismissed his own ailments to Axelrod with comments
like, "Everyone has flu-like symptoms sometime during the year. It's
my job to set the example and step up and do my job no matter how I
feel."</TE>
<TE>   Axelrod said Monday he wished he had pressed for a more extensive
discussion of health with Kile, the St. Louis Cardinal pitcher who
was found dead in his Chicago hotel room Saturday at age 33.</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Donoghue, the Cook County, Ill., medical examiner, said
Kile probably died because of 80% to 90% blockage in his coronary
arteries. Kile's brother, Daniel, told Donoghue that Darryl
complained of shoulder pain and weakness Friday night during dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "In the times I negotiated a multiyear guaranteed contract for
Darryl, with the Rockies and Cardinals, there was standard language
that allowed for the clubs to do a more extensive physical for
insurance purposes within 30 days of the signing," Axelrod said. "If
either of those teams did one, I never made a point of finding out or
seeing a copy of the results.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern has always been: Did he pass? Because if he did, we
got the contract. Maybe now I'm going to get more in my players' face
about these things. Maybe now I'm going to get copies of all their
reports and try to find out if there are any red flags."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal spokeswoman Melody Yount said Monday that head trainer
Barry Weinberg refused to comment on numerous media requests about
Kile's medical treatment. "That's doctor-patient confidentiality,"
Yount said.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Kile, a three-time All-Star who was born in Garden
Grove and attended Norco High and Chaffey College in Rancho
Cucamonga, has raised questions about whether there were any red
flags in the pitcher's medical file.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unusual event, but we see this more than we need to,"
said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a cardiologist and an associate professor of
medicine at UCLA. "The important message is for individuals with a
family history of heart problems to see a physician, and to
understand that a standard physical is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors agree the most obvious issue in Kile's medical history was
the 1993 death of his 44-year-old father, David, after a heart
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a huge assumption to say we know the Cardinals knew that
family history," said Dr. Michael Mellman, a Dodger team doctor.
"Doctors can be viewed as an agent of the team. Sometimes, players
don't tell us everything."</TE>
<TE>   Mellman said doctors' treatment of players varies in the major
leagues from team to team. "Doctors discuss what they do with other
doctors, trying to make sure that the collective knowledge benefits
the players," Mellman said.</TE>
<TE>   All teams put their players through a spring training physical,
conducting tests that require urine and blood samples.</TE>
<TE>   Mellman said teams test players' blood-sugar level, blood pressure
and cholesterol level. High cholesterol can contribute to the
condition Kile had, called atherosclerosis or hardening of the
arteries.</TE>
<TE>   "The cholesterol risk would not be identified by only a blood
test," Fonarow said. "A better test is a fasting lipid panel, where
specific cholesterol types are looked at."</TE>
<TE>   Thorough health tests of players who sign big contracts are
commonly requested by insurance companies, two player agents said.</TE>
<TE>   Said one player agent: "The extra test could be an EKG, or
whatever else the insurance company can find out about the player's
history. There are no set rules."</TE>
<TE>   Reports said Kile, whose $8 million-a-year contract with the
Cardinals ran through the 2003 season, underwent an electrocardiogram
during spring training.</TE>
<TE>   But Mellman said an EKG will not reveal coronary blockage in all
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "If any of those tests--blood, urine, cholesterol, EKG--reveal
abnormal numbers, it is our job to use the clues to define the
problem and intervene," Mellman said.</TE>
<TE>   Fonarow said if Kile revealed the family history of heart trouble
to a team doctor, a stress test (hooking an EKG to a patient who runs
on a treadmill) or a noninvasive heart scan should have been
required.</TE>
<TE>   Had Kile taken and failed either of those tests, he would have
been subject to angioplasty--a process that unclogs arteries.</TE>
<TE>   More than a million angioplasties are performed on Americans
annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very common misconception that the so-called 'complete
physical' of a chest X-ray, listening to the heart and lungs and an
EKG will detect blockage," Fonarow said. "It won't."</TE>
<TE>   Said Donoghue: "It sneaks up on you, this silent killer. We see it
in this office all the time, people dead who never knew they had
this."</TE>
<TE>   Although Pat Camden, the deputy director of news affairs for
Chicago police, confirmed the medical examiner's finding of a small
amount of marijuana in Kile's hotel room bathroom Saturday, Fonarow
said, "There's no way marijuana use caused those blockages nor would
it precipitate a fatal arrhythmia."</TE>
<TE>   Mellman said Donoghue's final autopsy report, due in four to six
weeks with toxicology results, could note Kile's enlarged
heart--estimated to be nearly 25% bigger than normal--as a factor in
his death.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals announced that Kile's memorial will be at 10:30 a.m.
PDT on Wednesday at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. The Cardinals will
also have a 20-minute pregame tribute to Kile before tonight's home
game against the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of goaltender Dominik Hasek said Monday night that her
husband is retiring, although Detroit Red Wing General Manager Ken
Holland would not confirm it after meeting with him.</LD>
<LD>   Alena Hasek told television station WDIV that her husband was
leaving the Red Wings to return to the Czech Republic, something
Hasek would not confirm.</LD>
<LD>   Neither would Holland, although the Red Wings tentatively
scheduled a news conference for this morning at Joe Louis Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Holland met with the 37-year-old goaltender and agent Rich Winter
on Monday night at a restaurant. Afterward, Holland would not say
what transpired.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure Dom is absolutely sure of his decision,"
Holland told The Detroit News on Monday. "If he's staying, I want to
make sure he's under no obligation to his teammates or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure it's his decision. If he's retiring, I want
to make sure he's sure of that."</TE>
<TE>   Holland has said Hasek likely would say this week whether he would
retire or return for next season. The Buffalo News reported Sunday
that Hasek was leaning toward retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Holland has said that he knew Hasek was leaning one way, but he
would not say which way that was.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit needs to know Hasek's decision before next Monday, when
the free-agent signing period starts.</TE>
<TE>   College Sports</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Shane Costa and pitchers Wes Littleton and Chad Cordero

<LD>Jack Nicklaus, whose back problems forced him out of the Masters,
withdrew Monday from this week's U.S. Senior Open.</LD>
<LD>   Nicklaus, 62, a two-time U.S. Senior Open champion, has played in
only two official events since lingering back problems prompted him
to pull out of the Ford Senior Players Championship last July after
one round. Nicklaus was 69th at the Countrywide Tradition in April
and withdrew after rounds of 71-78 at the Senior PGA Championship two
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I am better, but not good enough to play golf," Nicklaus said in
a statement released by the United States Golf Assn. "I have had
great improvement, but not enough to play in a four-day tournament."</LD>
<TE>   J.C. Snead, who won the Senior Tour's Greater Baltimore Classic on
Sunday, has also withdrawn from the Open because of fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.4-million U.S. Senior Open begins Thursday at Caves Valley
Golf Club in Baltimore.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Homers Twice, Wins It in Ninth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds tied the score with a three-run homer in the top of the
seventh, then won the game in the ninth with a solo shot against
closer Trevor Hoffman as the San Francisco Giants defeated the San
Diego Padres, 7-6, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds has 24 homers this season and 591 in his career. He's fourth
on the all-time list, 69 behind his godfather, Willie Mays. It was
the 60th multihomer game of his career.</LD>
<LD>   With one out in the ninth, Bonds drove the first pitch he saw from
Hoffman (1-1) down the right-field line, curling it just inside the
foul pole. It went an estimated 378 feet.</LD>
<TE>   With one out and runners on first and second in the seventh, Bonds
fell behind 0-and-2 against reliever Jeremy Fikac, who then missed on
three consecutive pitches. Bonds hit a full-count fastball over the
fence in left-center to score Marvin Benard, aboard on a pinch-hit
leadoff single, and Reggie Sanders, aboard on a walk.</TE>
<TE>   In his last game in San Diego, Bonds hit a grand slam off the base
of the scoreboard that sits 29 rows beyond the right-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has 68 career homers against the Padres, his most against
any team, and 36 in San Diego, his most in any road ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   They were Bonds' first homers since June 12, a span of eight
games. Bonds walked twice Monday, the first intentionally. He leads
the majors with 91 walks, well ahead of the pace to break the record
of 177 he set last year, when he also set the season home run record
with 73.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Worrell (4-0) pitched a perfect eighth for the victory. Robb
Nen pitched the ninth for his 19th save in 22 chances.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's David Bell had a two-run homer and a run-scoring
single in the second.</TE>
<TE>   The normally power-poor Padres had taken a 6-3 lead on two homers
by Ray Lankford and one by Tom Lampkin.</TE>
<TE>   Coming into the game, Padres regulars had only 23 homers, and it
was only the third game this season the Padres had more than two
homers. They continue to be without their Nos. 3 and 4 hitters. Ryan
Klesko sat out his fourth consecutive start because of a strained
right wrist and forearm, and Phil Nevin is out with a broken left arm
until at least July 12.</TE>
<TE>   Lankford, who had struck out 10 times in his previous 12 at-bats,
hit a two-run homer with two out in the fourth to give the Padres a
2-1 lead, and a solo homer with two out in the sixth to make it 5-3.
Lampkin followed with a solo homer in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time this season the Padres hit consecutive
homers and the first since Nevin and Klesko did it May 8 at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, New York 2--Pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart lined a leadoff
home run in the ninth inning against Scott Strickland (6-4) at New
York and the Braves defeated the Mets for their sixth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves improved to 17-4 in June behind a solid effort from
starter Kevin Millwood and the majors' best bullpen. Julio Franco
also homered for Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gryboski (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth and John Smoltz
pitched the ninth for his 24th save in 27 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 15, Florida 4--Ricky Ledee had a career-high four
hits, raising his average from .140 to .190, and Vicente Padilla
pitched five innings for his 10th victory as the Phillies won at
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell and Mike Lieberthal each homered and drove in four
runs. Bobby Abreu also homered.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla (10-4) was taken out as a precaution after bruising his
right arm when hit by a pitch. The right-hander won his fourth
consecutive decision, giving up two hits and one run.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Cincinnati 4--Delino DeShields hit a two-run homer in
the seventh inning at Chicago as the Cub bats broke through late in
the game to hand the Reds their eighth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 2-1, in the seventh, the Cubs took control of the game
with a run-scoring double by Roosevelt Brown against Scott Williamson
(2-2) and DeShields' third homer.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth, giving up a sacrifice fly to
Reggie Taylor that just missed being a score-tying home run.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vladislav "Bogie" Bogicevic, Shannon Higgins-Cirovski and Adolph
Bachmeier were selected Monday for induction into the National Soccer
Hall of Fame in Oneonta, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   The three, all midfielders, represent different eras in U.S.
soccer history.</LD>
<LD>   Bogicevic, a Yugoslav international who is coaching that country's
national team, was a star with the Cosmos of the North American
Soccer League in the 1970s and 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   Higgins-Cirovski, the women's coach at the University of Maryland,
was a standout midfielder for the U.S. women's team in the 1980s and
early 1990s. She was the playmaker for the U.S. team that won the
world championship in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Bachmeier captained the U.S. team during the difficult building
period of the 1960s and 1970s, playing in 22 matches. He also played
for professional teams in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Induction ceremonies are Oct. 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentine forward Ariel Ortega signed a four-year contract to play
for Fenerbahce, a club team in Istanbul, Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   There was no information on the 28-year-old's transfer fee, but
his former club, Argentina's River Plate, has said it had sold him
for $5 million. River was to receive only $2 million, because part of
Ortega's transfer rights are owned by his former club, Parma of
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "With all my heart, I want to stay here for four years and be
successful," said Ortega, who was part of Argentina's World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Fenerbahce finished second last season behind rival Galatasaray
and will compete in the Champions League next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran French forward Christophe Dugarry says he will no longer
play for France's national team and instead will concentrate on his
club career.</TE>
<TE>   Dugarry, capped 55 times and a member of the team that won the
1998 World Cup, told the French sports newspaper L'Equipe that he was
tired of his continuing unpopularity with French soccer fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had to battle. I've always had to confront great
pressure from the media, as well as from the public," he said in the
interview published Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Bordeaux captain said he expects to play another
three years.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Mercury (2001)--3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--After 10 games last year the Sparks were 9-1 and looking
like the best team in the WNBA. Not much has changed. They have the
same record after 10 games this season and are looking like the team
to beat for the title. One difference: Guard Mwadi Mabika is emerging
as the force on offense that the Sparks have always felt she could
be. Mabika is averaging a career-best 13.7 points, second on the team
behind Lisa Leslie, and has added the ability to drive to the basket
to her textbook jump shot. Phoenix is in fourth place in the West,
but the Mercury has beaten Eastern powers Washington and Charlotte
and is off to its best start since 2000 when it won eight of its
first 11. The Mercury is getting steady play from guard Gordana
Grubin (11.8 points), who played for the Sparks in 1999, and Adrain
Williams, a former USC standout who ranks 10th in the league in
rebounds at 7.4.</TE>

<HD>Ahn Will Remain With Italian Club</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian league club Perugia--which had threatened to fire the South
Korean forward whose golden goal sent Italy packing from the World
Cup--said Monday that Ahn Jung-Hwan will stay with the team next
season.</LD>
<LD>   Perugia, which until now had Ahn on loan from his K-League club in
Busan, has exercised its option and bought the player, said club
spokesman Paolo Giovagnoni. The option was to expire at the end of
the month.</LD>
<LD>   Ahn has been with the Italian team the last two seasons, spending
most of his time on the bench.</LD>
<TE>   His header lifted South Korea to a shocking 2-1 victory over Italy
last week--delivering the three-time champions a humiliating
elimination in the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Perugia owner Luciano Gaucci responded by telling Ahn he was not
welcome back.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to pay the salary of a guy who has been the ruin
of Italian soccer," he was quoted as saying by the Italian daily La
Gazzetta dello Sport Wednesday, a day after Italy's knockout.</TE>
<TE>   Gaucci's words drew criticism across the world and prompted the
reaction of the Asian Football Confederation, which threatened to
tell all Asian players to stay away from Perugia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an emotional reaction, a provocation," Giovagnoni said of
Gaucci's words, adding the team's decision was made independently of
the World Cup game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Hall, the only U.S. referee at the World Cup, was selected
as the fourth official for Wednesday's semifinal between Brazil and
Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, a referee in Major League Soccer, was the referee for two
group stage matches: Italy-Ecuador on June 3, and England-Nigeria on
June 12. He also served as the fourth official for the
England-Argentina game June 7.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo ran, passed and shot on goal and said he felt no pain in
his leg as Brazil prepared for the semifinal match against Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt fine, normal," Ronaldo said after a scrimmage at Saitama
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctor Jose Luis Runco said the striker did everything but
sprint during practice and felt none of the muscle pain that led to
his substitution in Brazil's 2-1 victory over England on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Swiss investigation of FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter
continues despite the withdrawal of a criminal complaint against him
by members of the executive committee of world soccer's governing
body, a prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation will be pursued until we decided to terminate
it or file charges," said District Attorney Urs Hubmann.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven of FIFA's 24-man executive committee filed the complaint in
a Zurich court last month on the basis of a document from FIFA
General Secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen alleging corruption and
financial mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Danish international Stig Toefting, who was on the national
World Cup squad this year, was charged with assaulting two restaurant
employees in downtown Copenhagen last weekend, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old midfielder had been dining with several members of
the Danish soccer squad Saturday evening at the Cafe Ketchup, when a
dispute broke out with the staff, apparently over singing in the
restaurant, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Toefting butted heads with an employee and was asked to leave the
restaurant. Outside, he chased and punched another employee before
being detained by the police and charged with assault.</TE>

<TE>   The United States' 1-0 loss to Germany in the World Cup
quarterfinals was ESPN's most-watched soccer telecast, despite a 4:30
a.m. PDT start. Friday's game drew an average of 3.77 million homes,
the network said.</TE>
<TE>   The previous high was 2.88 million households for the 1999 Women's
World Cup semifinal between the United States and Brazil, which
started at 1:30 p.m. PDT on the Fourth of July. The previous best for
a men's game was 2.71 million homes for the United States' 2-1 upset
of Colombia during the 1994 World Cup, a game that started at 4:30
p.m. PDT.</TE>

<HD>Kournikova Shows Her Ugly Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The real world came to Wimbledon on Monday, unedited, unvarnished and
unrelenting. It was a public-relations nightmare for Anna Kournikova.
This time, it was the BBC, not MTV. There was no second take, no way
to put the words in a cute promotional package.</LD>
<LD>   The august network took the unusual step of airing Kournikova's
entire postmatch interview with Gary Richardson after her first-round
loss to Tatiana Panova of Russia. Panova had defeated Kournikova,
6-1, 4-6, 6-4.</LD>
<LD>   In her earlier mandatory postmatch news conference with mostly
print journalists, Kournikova had been smiling and obliging, talking
about lessons learned and becoming her own person.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have a career off-court," she'd said. "There's no two
Annas, there's one Anna."</TE>
<TE>   Well ...</TE>
<TE>   One Anna, two faces?</TE>
<TE>   The affable Kournikova turned into an affronted Kournikova in the
contentious interview with Richardson. She stood up at one point and
appeared close to walking out.</TE>
<TE>   You might suspect the interviewer angered her by asking about
Sergei Fedorov, Pavel Bure, Enrique Iglesias or Penthouse magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't.</TE>
<TE>   His line of questions was not much different from the previous
ones in the earlier conference. Kournikova, however, seemed irritated
from the start, snapping at him, "I don't think you know my
confidence is low or not.... I don't think you should phrase the
question that way."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was put on the defensive but kept trying to move
forward, albeit nervously. He had asked, at one point, if she'd ever
thought about dropping down to satellite events, the way Andre Agassi
did several years ago to get some victories and rebuild her
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we just try this again?" she asked later. "I mean, am I
talking about this match or about the other things?"</TE>
<TE>   Someone in the background, a WTA public relations official, was
heard suggesting that the focus remain on the match that day. She has
not won a match in a Grand Slam event this year.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the interview continued and it was arguably more dramatic
than her match. Was she going to call him the weakest link, or what?</TE>
<TE>   Agony mercifully completed, the BBC cut back to the studio to
three appalled former players, host Sue Barker and analysts John
Lloyd and Pam Shriver. The words "pathetic," "horrible" and
"inexcusable" were used regarding Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd suggested, "Come on, she's got to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   Shriver pointed out that Kournikova is often like that off camera.</TE>
<TE>   "But, to be honest, if you ask people behind the scenes, in the
locker room, that was the real Anna Kournikova," she said. With this
being a relatively straightforward opening day--and apparently no
breaking David Beckham news--this was a present gift-wrapped for the
tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   After Agassi had ruined one potentially good story, debunking a
dubious report that he and wife Steffi Graf were to become parents
for the second time, several tabloid reporters made their way to the
broadcast building in search of video footage and sound bites, and
photos of the video being replayed for assembled reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd was the ideal person to address the issue. Long before the
Internet age, he was hounded by the British press because of his
stature as a leading player here and his marriage to Chris Evert.
Lloyd recalled the days of being followed onto airplanes by flashing
cameras. He always retained his class and dignity under difficult
situations.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, one tabloid reporter instructed him to pass along his
thoughts in the strongest way possible. Nobody needed any urging on
this issue. Richardson declined comment, although he thanked Lloyd
for the support. Apparently there was no reservoir of good will to
save Kournikova on the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she was thinking maybe it would be like a movie and say,
'Cut,' " Lloyd said. "And she knew it was live."</TE>
<TE>   The BBC approach was refreshing, frankly, in this day of fake
openness. This time, the cameras told the whole story, not the
edited, prepackaged one. There was no fawning attempt to
ingratiate--"Anna, you're great"--that seems to be the TV norm.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd suggested that she might have been given a break if she had
been inexperienced in the ways of TV, or if this had been her first
time at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had more TV cameras in her face than I've had hot dinners,"
he said. "And she should be able to handle that."</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova's struggles are a legitimate story. She reached the
semifinals at Wimbledon in her debut, in 1997. Once, she was listed
in the same peer group as Venus Williams and Martina Hingis, and
nearly beat Williams in Miami in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, the 21-year-old has taken positive steps to move forward,
hiring respected coach Harold Solomon and lessening the influence of
her parents.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was a decided setback, in every sense. Panova is hardly a
grass-court threat, having lost to 45-year-old Martina Navratilova
last week in Eastbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Even John McEnroe weighed in.</TE>
<TE>   "She actually was a legitimate player," he said. "But her nerves
are shot; she's got no confidence. She's heading in the wrong
direction very quickly."</TE>

<HD>They Get Comfortable at Wimbledon</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Sampras, Krajicek, Philippoussis reflect on recent
hurdles after their rejuvenating first-round victories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The tournament started to feel like a therapy session, or even a talk
show, a few hours into Wimbledon 2002, what with all the
inspirational stories about overcoming injuries and producing chances
for reinvention.</LD>
<LD>   You could take your pick Monday. There were a former Wimbledon
champion Richard Krajicek, an almost champion Mark Philippoussis, and
a struggling seven-time champion Pete Sampras.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, seeded No. 6, spoke about his recent travails after a
6-3, 7-6 (1), 6-3 first-round victory over lightly regarded British
left-hander Martin Lee. Sampras saved two set points in the second.
He faced 19 break points--saving 18--the most he has confronted at
Wimbledon.</LD>
<TE>   His recently injured back--he hurt it Saturday getting off a
massage table--held up adequately, and he said it was "not going to
be an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to give his back another day's rest, Sampras had requested
a Tuesday start, but officials were unable to grant it. Still, he was
assisted by being put on third on Centre Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to play today on Centre Court," he said. "It felt
good. It has been a pretty difficult year. Stepping out there, it was
like coming home again."</TE>
<TE>   The injury and Sampras' recent on-court struggles raised the issue
of his vulnerability. The 30-year-old cracked a couple of jokes at
his own expense.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was moving pretty well for an older guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when asked whether he was taking anything for his back
pain: "I'm always on medication, can't you tell?"</TE>
<TE>   He paused and then said, smiling, "Rogaine."</TE>
<TE>   His injury problems are nothing, though, compared to those of
Krajicek and Philippoussis. Krajicek, of the Netherlands, beat Franco
Squillari of Argentina, 6-2, 7-5, 7-6 (5), in what was only his
second singles match since November of 2000 after being sidelined
because of right elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   About six weeks ago, he could play only half an hour or so before
the pain recurred.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the moment I started talking to my coach, 'OK, we have
to set the D-day now,' " Krajicek said. " 'When are we going to make
a decision, not only for Wimbledon but also for my career?' "</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Philippoussis, who missed last year's Wimbledon
because of an injury, has had three operations on his left knee. He
joined Krajicek and Sampras in the second round, by defeating Julien
Boutter of France, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   "A few years ago, I would have taken a lot of things in my life
for granted," he said. "Now I look at life in a totally different
perspective. When I was on the court, I was young. I never thought
anything was going to go wrong. I was having fun. I thought, 'There's
a lot of years ahead of me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another youngster was in reassessment mode too. Taylor Dent
defeated hard-serving Max Mirnyi, seeded No. 21, of Belarus, 4-6,
6-4, 7-6 (3), 6-4, scoring his first victory since an indoor event in
Memphis last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Dent has a new coach, Australian Paul Kilderry and a new haircut.</TE>
<TE>   "I put in a bad mental effort at Queen's [a pre-Wimbledon
tournament], and [Kilderry] said, 'Either cut your wrists or cut your
hair. Pick!' " Dent said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Sampras and Dent, six other American men advanced, among
them No. 3 Andre Agassi, who played the first match on Centre Court.
Because defending champion Goran Ivanisevic is not playing, Sampras
had been scheduled to open, but his back injury changed things.
Apparently, Ivanisevic, who had recent shoulder surgery, was told by
his doctor not to travel, and his father was on hand to represent him
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were going to have a moment of silence for him,"
Agassi said, joking, of last year's champion.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Andy Roddick and James Blake had short days. Both of their
opponents defaulted in the second sets because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   On the women's side, No. 2 Serena Williams dropped only two games
against Evie Dominikovic of Australia, winning, 6-1, 6-1, and No. 3
Jennifer Capriati beat Janette Husarova of Slovakia, 6-1, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the bigger surprises, Saori Obata of Japan defeated No.
24 Alexandra Stevenson, 6-1, 6-3. Stevenson was a semifinalist here
three years ago, and Saori was only 1-6 in 2002 before Wimbledon.</TE>

<HD>Team, Award Officials Cost Bird Opportunity</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the catalyst for the national champion Connecticut Huskies, who
bulldozed through women's college basketball last season 39-0, Sue
Bird collected every postseason award she was eligible to win.</LD>
<LD>   Except one.</LD>
<LD>   Bird was a finalist for the Honda-Broderick Cup, which goes to the
women's collegiate athlete of the year. But her WNBA team, the
Seattle Storm, would not let her fly to Dallas for the awards dinner
June 17, insisting that she stay for a practice to prepare for last
Tuesday's game against the Sparks.</LD>
<TE>   The award was presented to USC sprinter Angela Williams, who this
season became the only athlete, male or female, to win four
consecutive NCAA titles in the 100 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is very deserving of the honor.</TE>
<TE>   Bird also is deserving. She should have had a chance to win. But,
because she was not allowed to attend the awards dinner, her name was
removed from final consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Storm spokeswoman Valerie O'Neil said team officials did not want
to slight Bird or the award officials, but they felt having the award
dinner the night before a game was not in the Seattle team's best
interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The [award] schedule was a challenge," O'Neil said. "It was a
tight schedule for the team and Sue. We try to accommodate what we
can during the season, but our policy is the priority has to be the
team. And players cannot miss practice or games. She needed to be
here."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil went on to say the Storm did discuss having a satellite
hookup and other types of options with the award officials, but an
agreement could not be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Holland, consultant to the awards program, said she
personally did not talk with the Seattle Storm. But she was certain
that the Honda officials would not have agreed to that or any other
stipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a long-standing policy that you have to be [at the
award ceremony] to receive the Honda-Broderick Cup," Holland said.
"And every other nominee was there that night."</TE>
<TE>   Holland added that Bird did win the award for women's college
basketball player of the year, and a video of her was shown.</TE>
<TE>   With respect to both the Storm and the Honda Award, there needs to
be some flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   A flight to Dallas would have been about four hours. Bird could
have caught a red-eye after the awards dinner or a Tuesday morning
flight and been back in Seattle in time for the game. It's not as if
the Sparks' game would make or break the Storm's playoff hopes; it's
the ninth game of the season, and Seattle plays the Sparks two more
times.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, this is the 26th year of the award, a long
time. The awards board has to know the WNBA season is underway, and
if geography is going to be a problem for a nominee, then using a
satellite hookup or other technology needs to become a plausible
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Bird was the key figure in what many consider the best women's
college basketball team of all time. She is the poster child for the
next generation of WNBA players. Yes, she has won plenty of awards.
But the chance for the Honda-Broderick Cup was taken away through no
fault of her own.</TE>
<TE>   Bird would not comment on the situation, other than to say "my
responsibility is to the Storm." Others close to the team will tell
you she wanted to attend but did not make it an issue.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the sure-handed Bird did not drop the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else around her did.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Houston Comet guard Sonja Henning was surprised by the public
backlash after her remarks that the players "would be comfortable"
with a strike in the face of slow negotiations with the league for a
new basic agreement, she shouldn't be.</TE>
<TE>   The remarks by the players' association president, no matter how
well intentioned, were ill-timed.</TE>
<TE>   Henning, who is a lawyer, should know the first rule about taking
that kind of position--</TE>
<TE>   have some leverage first.</TE>
<TE>   And the players don't have much.</TE>
<TE>   NBA owners are underwriting the league's operating costs to give
the WNBA, now in its sixth year, a chance to take root and grow. They
won't think twice about closing shop if the players want to walk.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the players have a legitimate gripe about money,
considering the travel and schedule demands put on them. They also
have a short window of time in which to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Before the WNBA turns into baseball and threatens to destroy
itself by continually poisoning the negotiating process,
representatives from the league and the union need to get out of the
public arena, and quietly outline an agreement that is practical for
the players and owners.</TE>
<TE>   Free agency is a moot point because the 16 teams do not operate
independently, and most WNBA owners don't--for now--want the headache
of signing players. The union knows it has a good housing and medical
package, and doesn't want to change that.</TE>
<TE>   That brings the issue back to money.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't it always?</TE>
<TE>   That's why both sides need to start talking to each other instead
of threatening each other.</TE>
<TE>   That's the smart thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   What are the odds of that happening?</TE>

<HD>Turkey Is Gaining a Foothold</HD>
<DH>Semifinals: Advancing to play Brazil has helped legitimize
the former laughingstock of European soccer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAITAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>It's not as if the Turks didn't warn us. For years, fans of Turkey's
national soccer team have announced their arrival at stadiums across
Europe by loudly stamping their feet and raising their voices:</LD>
<LD>   "Europe! Europe!</LD>
<LD>   "Hear our voice!</LD>
<TE>   "This is the sound of Turkish feet!"</TE>
<TE>   At this World Cup, the sound of Turkish feet has been deafening.
Already, the Turks have given the boot to co-host Japan and
everyone's second-favorite team here, Senegal, during their defiant
journey to the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   And in Turkey's tournament opener, those feet ran Brazil ragged in
a less-than-convincing 2-1 Brazilian victory aided by a controversial
penalty and the ejection of two Turkish players.</TE>
<TE>   The teams meet again Wednesday at Saitama Stadium with a berth in
the World Cup final at stake. For Brazil, the World Cup final four is
home, sweet home--Brazil has won the tournament an unequaled four
times, most recently in 1994, and played in the final game four years
ago at Paris.</TE>
<TE>   But Turkey, which last appeared in the World Cup 48 years ago, has
outstripped even the most optimistic ambitions of its players and
coaches by landing in the semifinals. Before the tournament, Coach
Senol Gunes, a former goalkeeper for Turkey's national team, set the
quarterfinals as the target for his squad.</TE>
<TE>   "No one, [including] our coach and our team, expected that we
could come this far," midfielder Umit Davala said after Turkey's 1-0
overtime victory over Senegal at Osaka, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "But now, I would like to tell the world to see what we are going
to achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Once, Turkey was the laughingstock of European soccer. The Turks
not only failed to qualify for the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups,
they failed to win even one qualification match, going 0-15-1. Their
lowest ebb was an 8-0 defeat by England in a 1987 European
Championships qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the late 1990s that the mass migration of Turks to
Germany in the 1960s and '70s began to show on the soccer field.
Coaches trained in the German tradition returned to Turkey to pass
along the knowledge to a new generation of Turkish players. Several
current Turkish players, among them Davala and Yildiray Basturk, were
born and trained in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Turkish club Fenerbahce defeated one of Europe's top
teams, Manchester United, at Manchester, England.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Fenerbahce's Istanbul rival, Galatasaray, upset
Arsenal, another English club, in winning the UEFA Cup championship.</TE>
<TE>   Those were signal flares to the rest of the sport, as bright as
those that light up the stands inside Istanbul's Ali Sami Yen
Stadium, where visiting teams are regularly greeted by rabid fans
hoisting banners reading, "Welcome to Hell."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, few in the sport acknowledged the warning signs until it was
too late. By then, Japan and Senegal were out of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We have shown the strength of our football," Gunes said after his
team's elimination of Senegal in the quarterfinals. "We don't fear
anyone, and at this World Cup, our players have proved they deserve
recognition."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been pretty to watch. Turkey has advanced this far
without a single goal from its struggling star forward, Hakan Suker,
forcing Gunes to find other ways to squeeze out results. Against
Senegal, for instance, he overloaded his defense in front of
goalkeeper Rustu Recber, who has been one of the best shot stoppers
in this World Cup, and waited for a counterattack goal, which took 94
minutes, substitute Ilhan Mansiz finally breaking through .</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's progression through the tournament has been so grim, the
Turkish media has responded in kind, hammering Gunes and his players,
especially during the early rounds.</TE>
<TE>   After the victory over Senegal, Turkish players took to their
individual Web sites--everyone on the roster seems to have one--to
lash back.</TE>
<TE>   "The camps, the training, the changing weather, the news of
criticism from Turkey ... all these caused us problems, but we are a
team for hard times," wrote defender Alpay Ozalan.</TE>
<TE>   "My wish from you is that you do not pay attention to [the media].
The quality and strength of everyone on this team is there to see."</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, Mansiz told fans, "If we had stated our aims
openly when coming here, they would have called us charlatans. Those
who would have called us charlatans then will now slam us if we
return home without the cup."</TE>
<TE>   And on his site, Davala noted the irony of this semifinal matchup
with Brazil, a team long admired from afar by Turkey's players.</TE>
<TE>   "In previous World Cups, we used to pray that the teams we felt
closest to, teams from America, Africa, even Asia, would take our
revenge on the European sides that had knocked us out of
qualification," Davala wrote. "Most of the time, we backed Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at how fate works. The samba players we supported for years
in the World Cup are now our biggest rival on the road to our goal."</TE>
<TE>   Having barely weathered 90 minutes of Turkish fury in their
opener, the samba players now brace warily for the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the semifinal will be more difficult to get through than
the final," Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos said. "The first game
against Turkey was the toughest battle we have had here and we know
we will have to be very, very careful if we are to get past them
again. The room for error will be minimal, if not nonexistent."</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo acknowledged that "Turkey is capable of beating us." He
said it is "obvious that this match will be difficult but we will be
ready.... We will be doing everything we can to reach the final."</TE>

<TE>*--*
Wednesday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Saitama, Japan
TV: ESPN, Channel 34
How they got here: First-place finisher in Group C, Brazil defeated
Belgium, 2-0, in the second round and rallied on goals by Rivaldo and
Ronaldinho to beat England in the quarterfinals, 2-1. Turkey,
runner-up to Brazil in Group C, eliminated Japan, 1-0, in the second
round and Senegal, 1-0, in the quarterfinals on a 94th-minute golden
goal by Ilhan Mansiz
About Brazil: Ronaldinho was the most impressive player on the field
in the quarterfinal against England. He assisted on Rivaldo's
equalizing goal after dribbling through the middle of the defense.
His long, curling cross so badly deceived goalkeeper David Seaman
that it wound up in the back of the net for the game-winner. But he
will sit out the semifinal because of a second-half red card he
received for elbowing defender Danny Mills in the face. Potentially
faced with a two-game suspension, Ronaldinho had his ban limited to
Wednesday's game in a decision by FIFA's disciplinary committee.
Forward Ronaldo limped off with a thigh injury sustained in the
quarterfinal, initially putting him in doubt for the Turkey match.
But Monday, Ronaldo told Brazilian reporters he expected to play
About Turkey: Coach Senol Gunes faces a dilemma as he plans for the
biggest match in Turkey's history: Does he bench his struggling star
and captain, Hakan Suker, and start instead Mansiz, who replaced
Suker in the quarterfinal against Senegal and scored the only goal?
Suker, 31, has scored 35 goals in his international career, but none
in this tournament and none since April. "Hakan is our team captain
and one of the most important players for us," Gunes said. "He was
trying hard but he was really unlucky in some situations." Suker
hasn't helped his cause by criticizing teammates for freezing him out
and not passing him the ball. "It is true I was not able to create
any goal opportunities," he said. "But look at that team. All the
players in the midfield think only about themselves. They play to
show up and draw attention to themselves. How am I supposed to
receive passes under such conditions?"
Outlook: Brazil was fortunate to have beaten Turkey, 2-1, in group
play, benefiting from a disputed penalty and the ejection of two
players. But Brazil shored up its defense, played 90 impressive
minutes against England, appears to be peaking at precisely the right
time and, well, Brazil is Brazil. For the third time in as many World
Cups, samba will be heard in the stands at the final</TE>
