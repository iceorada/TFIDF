<HD>Hello, Would You Like to Play for the Queen?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mere days before a mammoth pop concert on the lawn of Buckingham
Palace, the man in charge of music, composer Michael Kamen, stood in
a London studio anchored to his cell phone, corralling legendary
musicians for the event.</LD>
<LD>   He's organized quite a lineup for Monday's Party at the Palace,
part of the queen's Jubilee celebration of Elizabeth II's 50 years on
the throne. The "house band," he said, will feature Eric Clapton on
guitar, Phil Collins on drums and percussionist Ray Cooper. Kamen had
tapped Joe Cocker to sing "With a Little Help From My Friends,"
Clapton to sing a duet with Brian Wilson, and join Paul McCartney on
George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." It was getting
late, but Kamen still had to speak with Bryan Adams.</LD>
<LD>   It was Friday evening, and Kamen had just returned to the studio
after a three-hour rehearsal with the Royal Academy of Music.
Orchestra players were moved to tears, Kamen said, while rehearsing
Annie Lennox's song "Why," which the singer will perform at the
concert. He was playing a newly finished recording of the concert's
anthem written by Tim Rice titled (what else?) "Jubilee" and seemed
to be impressed. "I've just listened to a far-out thing!" he said.</LD>
<TE>   Kamen, known for his film scores and his work as keyboardist for
Pink Floyd, was chosen as the event's musical director by George
Martin. The native New Yorker said he's still buzzing with the honor.
"I'm still clutching my head saying: 'Oh my God! This is really
happening!'"</TE>
<TE>   Cristina Bornstein and Anthony Gill stood by the Nordstrom makeup
counter at the Grove, one of many stops on their West Coast tour.
Theirs was not the frivolous ambition of longer lashes, but rather a
New Age search for a better life through color.</TE>
<TE>   Their book, "Tony &amp; Tina Color Energy: How Color Can Transform
Your Life," (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002) offers a palette of advice as
the authors outline the colors that correspond to the seven
chakras--"energy centers" of the body.</TE>
<TE>   The book comes with a standard disclaimer, "The authors make no
medical claims regarding the effectiveness of the exercises set forth
within this book," and confidently suggests a range of color
exercises, such as imagining yourself doused in a purple shower, to
combat everything from colds to depression.</TE>
<TE>   For depression, they suggest wearing yellow and orange, colors
that "help you get in touch with joy and laughter."</TE>
<TE>   As they explain on their Web site, their color work is "a
conceptual art project with the intention of expanding the use and
understanding of vibrational remedies. That is to say, the way the
electromagnetic vibrations of color, aroma and sound affect the human
energy system."</TE>
<TE>   In other words? "I talk a lot about green," Bornstein said. "It
helps you relax." And red, Bornstein explained, signifies "being part
of the tribe." It was no coincidence, she said, that designers, post
Sept. 11, went for red in their collections. In terms of fashion,
black "is a social mask. It doesn't say anything about you," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Colors can heal, Gill said. "You don't need years of therapy....
When there's a dysfunction, deal with the energy."</TE>
<TE>   "The rainbow is so accessible," Bornstein added.</TE>
<TE>   Their self-help book nearly didn't make it to bookstores. As their
agent was closing the deal with the publisher, the couple's chakras
were clashing. Eventually, they broke up but managed to keep intact
their business partnership, which, in addition to the book includes
the Tony &amp; Tina makeup line. Not only is there hope in a bottle,
there's therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Women and some men buy cosmetics to look better. But, the two say,
what customers are really looking for is to feel better. "We want to
give something beyond the cosmetic," Bornstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "Makeup artists are healers," Gill said. "They do therapy. This,"
he said, "is real retail therapy."</TE>

<TE>   "Many of you are probably wondering," Ted Koppel told students at
Brandeis University last week, "'Is that his real hair?' Well,
believe me, with the money they pay me at ABC, I could afford a lot
better-looking rug than this," he said, according to the Daily News
Tribune of suburban Boston.</TE>

<DH>An immigrant teen's art project depicts border crossings in
game form</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rene doesn't remember anything about crossing the border. He was just
3 when his parents bundled him and his 2-year-old brother up and,
with the help of a hired coyote, left certain poverty for the
uncertainty of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   But Rene, now 14, has memorialized his family's 1,400-mile trek
from Mexico City into San Diego with a game called Crossing the
Border. He created the game for an annual contest celebrating folk
art for middle and high school students in the Los Angeles Unified
School District.</LD>
<LD>   Rene, who fears deportation for himself and his family if he gives
his last name, says it was easy coming up with an idea for this
year's contest theme, "Games of Life."</LD>
<TE>   "You just roll the die," he says of his entry that landed him
first place last week in the middle school category. "It's like
playing with your life. You either stay or you go."</TE>
<TE>   In Rene's game, each player rolls a die and then moves that many
spaces. The object is to get to the other side of the board, or the
border, outrunning the INS agent to the finish line--the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   But even though that's the end of his game, it's just the
beginning for immigrants, he says. Even Rene--now a college hopeful
with a B average who dreams someday of attending art school--knows
that at any time an immigration agent can tap on his shoulder and
send him back to start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it a lot," he says. "And my mom does too." Rene,
whose parents are vendors, hopes to be sponsored for legal residency
by an older brother who was born in the U.S., making him an American
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "Folk art helps [students] ... look with a keener eye at their own
life," said Thomas Coston, president of Light Bringer Project, a
Pasadena-based nonprofit that, along with the Neutrogena Corp., has
for the last four years organized the art contest--called FACES, for
Folk Art as Community Expressions. "It allows students ... to use
things in their own life to tell about who they are."</TE>
<TE>   Judges of the contest, including representatives from the UCLA
Fowler Museum of Cultural History, the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art
Museum and the Archives of American Art Smithsonian Institute, were
drawn to Rene's piece for its social and political commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the artistry of his story that intrigued us," said Coston,
who was also a judge. "He really used courage and boldness to tell
his story."</TE>
<TE>   For his game, Rene used tiny whisky bottles as game pieces. Each
bottle has a photocopied black-and-white picture of immigrants of
various nationalities rolled up inside. And each bottle is outfitted
with necessities for a journey across the border: tiny sandals for
"the long difficult steps the immigrants took" and a tiny colorful
Mexican serape--a blanket wrapped around the bottle like a shawl--for
warmth at night.</TE>
<TE>   The border patrol agent, an action figure Rene found in a toy box
at home, is spray-painted a dull gray and is peched atop a cobalt
blue inkwell. The Darth Vader-like figure wears a mean grimace and a
black, wide-brimmed hat.</TE>
<TE>   With each turn, the immigrants move along fluorescent orange tiles
through barbed wire, over raging rivers, where many real immigrants
have lost their lives, and through rocky terrain--all of which Rene
has skillfully painted on a wooden playing board--until they arrive
at the Los Angeles skyline.</TE>
<TE>   Rene--who has no formal training in art--took about four weeks to
complete his work, often sketching out designs in class and then
taking the piece home to work on in his family's tiny apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like it wasn't made on a penny," said Patricia Hurley,
also with the Light Bringer Project, "and that's the essence of folk
art."</TE>
<TE>   Rene's game is one of 70 submitted by middle and high school
students throughout the LAUSD for the contest. Entries ranged from
Monopoly-like board games with themes of trying to graduate from high
school to finding a date to the Consequences of Drinking and the Road
to Hell (in that case, the first to the finish line loses).</TE>
<TE>   All of the student work submitted for the contest will be on
display June 12 through July 7 at the Craft and Folk Art Museum at
5814 Wilshire Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Each winner will receive a cash award. First-place finisher Rene,
who attends Berendo Middle School, and his high school counterpart
will also travel this summer with a family member, their art teacher
and representatives of the FACES program to the Museum of
International Folk Art in Santa Fe, N.M., where their work will be on
display.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been outside of Los Angeles [since moving here]," said
Rene. "It's going to be really cool."</TE>

<HD>Packing Up a Freshman on College Avenue</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As a father, I'm accustomed to being surrounded by contrarians and
people of dubious opinions, half-thoughts and spontaneous outbursts.
Kids, most of them. Many of them my own.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, babe, what's up?" my daughter says as she answers her cell
phone.</LD>
<LD>   "This is your father," I say on the other end.</LD>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your dad," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, babe, what's up?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh from her freshman year, she speaks into her cell phone like
someone booking Vegas lounge acts or arranging a bail bond, in
clipped rat-a-tat-tat sentences full of semicolons and exclamation
points. At 18, she speaks in punctuation that hasn't yet been
invented.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to take you home," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "Like, when? she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me check ... maybe, sure ... who's this again?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your dad," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Down on College Avenue, they are loading up for summer. Some of
America's most promising children, bellies soft as Krispy Kremes,
carry their dorm gear down to their parents' cars, some of them
sweating for perhaps the very first time--the kids, that is, not the
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll carry that," a mother says.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'll get that," responds a whiskered dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me get that," says a kid.</TE>
<TE>   The quad in front of the dorm is littered with college debris.
It's what Earth would look like if it were hit by an asteroid
sponsored by Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond--full of pillows, blankets and
stuffed animals.</TE>
<TE>   There are beanbag chairs. Comforters. Dell computers torn apart as
if for an autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so heavy," my daughter says.</TE>
<TE>   "On the way home, everything's heavier," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   She is carrying her pet frog, in a small plastic pet-frog
container. The frog appears hung over.</TE>
<TE>   I am carrying a small TV. A computer keyboard. A pillow that
smells like mouthwash. A lamp. A mouse pad. Two cans of Dr. Pepper. A
jar of pennies. A suitcase with a broken strap. A ceramic baseball.
And half a stapler.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice packing job, honey," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Daddy," she says proudly.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to the car, we pass young lovers saying goodbye for the
summer. Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. A guy who looks like Flounder
from "Animal House." That blond from "American Pie."</TE>
<TE>   They are all the couples, past and present, who have had to say
goodbye for a summer back home with Mom and Dad. I sense a bitterness
about them. A resentment they cannot hide.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a room, will ya?" I mutter.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad," scolds my daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The young lovers act as if they are invisible, when in fact they
are the most visible people of all.</TE>
<TE>   They stand on the quad hugging and crying, then try to crawl
inside each other's clothes. Remember when you were in love like
this? Me neither. Kills your brain cells, this much love. Emotional
whisky.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we should get a luggage cart," my daughter says after my
left ventricle collapses.</TE>
<TE>   "Luggage cart?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   So we wait in the dorm lobby for a cart. Apparently, the parents'
club sprang for luggage carts, to help moms and dads lug stuff from
the dorms to the cars. Might be two or three of them.</TE>
<TE>   "How much longer?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably half an hour," the kid at the front desk says.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you, like, call my room when one is ready?" my daughter
pleads.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you have to wait here," the kid says a little too gruffly.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I think you could probably call us," I say, forgetting for a
moment that I'm not in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, we'll just wait," my daughter says, tugging me by the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   I feel like a character in an Updike novel, a middle-aged guy off
to retrieve a daughter at college, while flashing back to my youth, a
thousand years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Even a thousand years ago, college was much like this. You spent
the year collecting mishaps. You wore jeans that didn't fit, and a
smile too big for your face.</TE>
<TE>   You slept till noon and ate your big meal of the day at 1 in the
morning, in unscrubbed places named Pancho's or Harry's, which served
several kinds of ethnic food, none of them related: tacos, egg rolls,
fried shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   You never drank milk.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, anything could happen and usually didn't. On
Sundays, you studied and called your mom because you missed her
cooking and clean clothes that smelled like snow.</TE>
<TE>   That was college then. That is college now.</TE>
<TE>   "What time did you go to bed?" my daughter asks a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Three," her friend says. "You?"</TE>
<TE>   "Four," my daughter says.</TE>
<TE>   Four? Vampires get to bed before 4, even teenage ones. But I guess
that's freshmen for you. At night is when they come alive.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a plastic wading pool in your bathroom," I tell my
daughter when we return to her dorm room.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me put it this way," I say. "Why is there a plastic wading
pool in your bathroom?"</TE>
<TE>   "One girl, she can't shave her legs in the shower," my daughter
explains.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes sense," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It does?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   And down on College Avenue, freshman year packs up for home.</TE>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Monica bike path really needs a number. Like 205 or 143. Or
make it the 310 for easy recall. The digits don't matter so much as
the symbolism. That bike path is a freeway and whatever legislative
body is in charge of such things--Caltrans? The Department of
Recreation?--needs to recognize it as such.</LD>
<LD>   This was never clearer than on Memorial Day. While the 10 Freeway
sang empty and wide from downtown to PCH, there was bike-path
gridlock from Washington practically to Pico. Like any summertime
crush, there were vehicles of all sorts and operators who vacillated
widely in their degrees of expertise. The vacillation at times was
quite literal, and as wild as it was wide.</LD>
<LD>   Here were the novice roller-bladers, the slouching streams of
skateboarders and, of course, the rental brigade--many of whose last
two-wheeled adventure involved a banana seat and handlebar streamers.
Among them zipped the streamlined professionals with their painted-on
bike shorts and Ts, changing gears with every breath and cursing each
grain of sand trekked across the cement by unthinking beachgoers.</LD>
<TE>   There were bikes for two and three and four, bikes with baby seats
and baby trailers, grown-up bikes with kid bikes attached and way too
many tykes on trikes and training wheels. (For those parents new to
the bike path on a summer weekend or holiday, this is not a place for
kids to learn how to ride. The 10 might actually be safer, but
really, this is why God invented sidewalks and empty parking lots.)</TE>
<TE>   Me, I was one of the baby seaters, with my husband and our friend,
stopping way too often (but always pulling over first) to adjust
straps and hand out crackers. When I was young and had identifiable
quads, I knew every crack and dip in this path from Manhattan Beach
to the pier. Now I live inland, but it all came rushing back to me as
a stream of cooler-toting teens stepped right in front of me on their
way to the surf--how the only time you could make any time on the
path is very early in the morning and late in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Just like driving the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   And just like driving the freeway, the bike path arouses its own
set of prejudices. There are no SUVs here to loathe, but there are
roller-bladers and it is hard to beat the hatred cyclists feel for
roller-bladers on the bike path (and probably vice versa). They take
up so much room, with their wide-flung legs and their tendency to
flail. The really good ones are just breathtaking to watch, the ones
skating in a line especially, but so many of the rest travel in
stuttering clots. They also have a higher proportion of cell-phone
use than bicyclists, and like people who smoke while participating in
a quasi-athletic activity, this just looks wrong.</TE>
<TE>   On the bike path, you can overhear conversations only imagined on
the freeway. There go the couple debating whether to visit Spain in
August or October, here come two guys discussing interest rates,
followed by two women brooding over someone's divorce. Their words
fly by in wind-swept tatters--"We already know he's going to need
braces," "If you like her, call her"--just enough to remind you that
behind the sunglasses, like behind the windshields, are people just
like you.</TE>
<TE>   And like on the freeway, just when the traffic is so bad you're
going to bail, suddenly the road opens up and it's just you and the
sun and the wind and the speed of your own creation. The bike path
may just be a road by another name, but it's still the only good
reason to live on the Westside.</TE>

<LD>Fetching princesses threw fake cash in the air and Gothic Avengers
waved plastic swords at miniskirted "booth babes" with purple hair.
This neon-lighted boombox was Las Vegas with video games instead of
slots, pulsating with sound and light.</LD>
<LD>   The enormously noisy, glitzy display of Electronic Entertainment
Expo (E3), held last week at the L.A. Convention Center, was designed
to overload the senses of both chain-store buyers and gamers looking
for a new, totally immersive world to play in. And there were plenty
of worlds at this installment of the annual high-stakes showcase for
sellers, publishers and developers of video games: hobbit houses next
to castles bordering graffiti-scrawled alleys that led to futuristic
laser-lighted rocket ships.</LD>
<LD>   With global consumers spending a billion dollars more on video
games (the PlayStation/XBOX/GameCube versions--"console games"--as
well as those played on PCs) than on movies, the $9.4-billion
industry this year declared itself "A World of Its Own." That was the
conference theme, as well as an accurate description of the mental
space of the hard-core gamer at play. The question is: Just what kind
of world is it? John Kreng, a stunt coordinator and former video-game
producer, along with a handful of game developers, offered a glimpse
into its changing dimensions, a world where the key battle seems to
be between impulse and imagination.</LD>
<TE>   Kreng, in his 30s, has been playing video games since the industry
was in its early stages--that's more than 20 years in front of the
box. He looked around, hoping to be impressed. "Nothing's really
grabbed me," Kreng said. "I mean, none of this stuff makes you gasp
or think or teaches you anything. A few years ago, the emphasis was
on role-playing games and clever puzzles you had to solve. And those
games are still around, but the tide's going against them. Now, it's
all fast twitch. I mean, console games have always been like that,
but now it's true for most PC games too."</TE>
<TE>   Kreng quickly tapped his thumbs against his forefingers as an
example of fast twitch. "That's the way it's been going these last
few years--from storytelling to twitch games."</TE>
<TE>   Classic "simulation games" like Sim City or Civilization--in which
players build communities or countries--and "adventure games" that
involve role-playing and puzzle-solving, like Myst, have strong
narrative elements and little or no competitive game-play.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Kreng, role-playing games and "God games [in which the
player builds a virtual environment] take time, and most people don't
have time anymore. It's a microwave mentality. Most people don't want
to know the story. They get home from work or school, they're tired,
they just want to kill enemies. Blam, blam, blam."</TE>
<TE>   That's the opposite of what's happening in other media. Sports
coverage, for example, depends on narrative. During the Olympics, we
get touching film clips about what hardships an athlete has had to
overcome on the way to the medal stand. And take a look at
professional wrestling. You'll see story lines drawn straight out of
soap operas: jealousy, rage, betrayal, envy. This looks like a
carefully orchestrated attempt to bring in a female audience, and it
seems to be working. But in the video-game industry, though there is
a female audience for the products--perhaps 15% of the E3 crowd
consisted of young women--the target market is young males, who
apparently prefer twitch games with pure adrenaline-churning
game-play and minimal story.</TE>
<TE>   The writing on the wall was clear to DreamCatcher, a medium-sized
company (with 75 employees) based in Toronto. In 1996, it started
publishing visually evocative, narrative-rich adventure games in
which the player could solve intricate puzzles and explore fantasy
worlds full of everything from Arthurian knights to futuristic space
travel.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting about the customers that play our adventure
games is that the age range really covers the entire spectrum," said
Richard Wah Kan, the company's president and chief executive. "There
are middle-aged and elderly; there are people in their 20s and 30s;
there are males and females, about a 50-50 split." But the core
gamers--the ones with the time and money to fuel the industry--are
male, and young, from 12 to 25. They're the fast-twitch crowd. So at
E3, DreamCatcher rolled out what its press kit called a "new look."
It relegated its adventure games to a newly formed division called,
appropriately, the Adventure Company; and the DreamCatcher label now
publishes games--including console games--aimed at the core gamers.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the crowds, DreamCatcher's most popular new game at
E3 was Gore. (No, it's not about the 2000 election, though the body
count rivals that of the Florida ballot wars.) Gore is a multi-player
shooter game set in a gritty futuristic urban landscape. Each player
sees what's in front of him, from his own perspective, while trying
to gun down the others. As the title promises, there's a lot of
blood.</TE>
<TE>   E3 is supposed to be for the video-game industry, but every year
thousands of gamers find their way inside, and lines of these
adolescent and post-adolescent males waited to play Gore. They paid
little attention to the subtle charms of adventure games like
Pharaoh's Curse, which was displayed on a video screen nearby. "A
shooter game like Gore appeals to a young, predominantly male
audience," said Kan. "The video-game market is growing 12% to 15% per
year, and we need to keep on growing with the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Does he think the adventure game--with its elaborate
storytelling-- will eventually disappear?</TE>
<TE>   "The genre is evolving toward more game-play," said Kan, "but I
don't see that the adventure game is going to go away. For us, we're
going to keep on going with both."</TE>
<TE>   As Kan spoke, lines three- and four-deep waited to get a chance at
Gore's shoot-'em-up thrills, early validation of his strategy.
DreamCatcher is like a small publishing house that specializes in
poetry but adds romance novels to keep up with the demands of the
market. The romance here is in the "twitch."</TE>
<TE>   At the farthest corner of the Convention Center's South Hall, what
seemed to be a good story was taking shape. A game demo showed
monsters creeping across a surreal landscape. Nearby were two
men--Roman Kremlicka, 20, and Markus Fuhrmann, 22. They said they had
come a few days ago from Vienna and that their third partner,
Benjamin Prucha, 21, "a real genius at programming," was home in
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months ago, Kremlicka, Fuhrmann and Prucha decided to
build their dream: a "massively multi-player online game." The idea
would be to develop a game that could be played by up to 10,000
people at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "Benjamin is a little shy, a typical genius," said Fuhrmann, "so
Roman and I went around trying to get money from everybody we knew,
our families and friends."</TE>
<TE>   What did they show their potential investors? "We showed them us,"
said Fuhrmann. "And we told them, 'Look, we've analyzed the market of
online games. We've watched them and played them, and we know what's
working, what people like. And we can do our own that is better, with
wonderful graphics, better than the others, and a story that's
different from anything else out there." Kremlicka said, "And what
they told us was: 'We don't have a clue about video games or what you
guys are doing, but we believe in you.'"</TE>
<TE>   With their friends and family seed money, they set up five
computers in a one-room apartment shared by Kremlicka and Prucha, and
then worked day and night to build a prototype.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think of it, it's pretty crazy," said Kremlicka. "Twenty
years old, no money, no proof that we could do this. But we were so
determined. We were in a tiny apartment; we did nothing but program
day and night--computer screens running all the time. We had no life,
we did nothing but work." Once the demo was well on its way, they
contacted Doug Mealy, who does marketing and public relations for
many online games. Mealy took them on as clients. Since Mealy had
already contracted for display space at E3, there was room for
Kremlicka and Furhmann to put up a "relatively cheap" 10-by-10-foot
booth.</TE>
<TE>   The young Austrians will try to infuse their game--slated to be
ready in late 2003--with game play. "There will be battles involving
large numbers of players and duels against a single nemesis," said
Kremlicka. But for these fledgling game designers, the strong twitch
factor is woven into a "mix of scientific fact and fiction," as
Kremlicka puts it. The story's not the thing, as it is in an
adventure game, yet even nonstop action seems to need some sort of
plot.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an artificial planet called Iritor," said excitedly. "It
was constructed by an omnipotent race called the Creators, who are
guardians of the universe. The Creators get a prophecy that there is
one race that can help them fight against the evil that comes from
another dimension and is trying to destroy the universe. So the
Creators gather all the known races of the universe, and they put
them all on Iritor so they can determine which is the race that can
help them fight evil. One of those races is the human race from
planet Earth. This is the back story, and it provides for a lot of
conflicts. The human race has conflicts among themselves, conflicts
with other races, and all of them have conflicts with the Creators."</TE>
<TE>   Players don't have to invent characters, nor follow their own
story lines, but the action rests against a plot line that, perhaps
inevitably, parallels the young men's life story. Here were two men
far away from home. They had been plunked down on an alien,
artificial planet (E3?). Nearby, omnipotent Creators (Sony?
Microsoft?) were carrying on a quest to find out which of these other
races (smaller companies that develop new software?) could keep the
Creators from falling prey to evil (changes in public taste? economic
collapse?).</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon, the two Austrians dismantled their booth,
reflecting on the story so far. "Six months ago, we were in Vienna,
trying to put a demo together," said Fuhrmann. "Six weeks ago, we
didn't even know we were going to be at E3. And now we're here. It's
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the rush to satisfy the twitch factor, it's still hard to
quiet the imagination, a tendency that can't help but color the
games. As DreamCatcher's Richard Kan had said earlier: "Some stories
are better than others, but it's always the story. The interesting
thing about humans is that they love good stories."</TE>

<LD>The Surprise Chandelier</LD>
<LD>   Art objects are often designed to do more than one thing. This
185-year-old chandelier is a perfect example of a work of art that
was designed to serve a variety of functions. Obviously, it served to
light up a room. It was also a form of decoration made of lavish
materials, making the room look more elegant. Lastly, it had a
surprise use! You'll never guess. Even the experts might have missed
it, but an old document describing the chandelier was discovered and
revealed something unexpected. Here is what it said:</LD>
<LD>   "Fish chandelier: In the middle of a blue enameled globe scattered
with stars is a circle with the signs of the zodiac and six griffins
carrying candles.... Below the circle on which the candles are placed
are slender branches decorated with scrolls from which a glass bowl
is suspended.... [The glass bowl] is furnished with ... a plug
intended for the removal of the water which one places in the bowl
with small goldfish whose continuous movement will give agreeable
recreation to the eye."</LD>
<TE>   Can you imagine a combination chandelier-aquarium? You can see it
(minus the fish, of course) at the Getty Museum on Saturday and also
take part in its free Family Festival from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Create
your own work of art, see live performers dance and sing, and listen
to storytelling. The festival complements the museum's new exhibition
"Railroad Vision." For more information call (310) 440-7300 or visit
www.getty.edu. (Parking reservations are not needed on Saturday or
Sunday or after 4 p.m. on weekdays.)</TE>

<HD>Frum Takes Issue With 'Axis' Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donna Perlmutter's story about me ("Writer Still Has 'Axis' to
Grind," May 17) insinuates that I was fired from the Bush
administration because a private e-mail of my wife's discussing my
role in the 2002 State of the Union address was intercepted and
published.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, as reported in the Washington Post and confirmed by the
administration, I resigned in writing two weeks before the e-mail was
intercepted. My departure from the administration was entirely
voluntary and amicable.</LD>
<LD>   Perlmutter puts words of her own inside quotation marks in such a
way as to deceive the reader into thinking them mine. I did not, for
example, tell her that I believe "might makes right" in international
relations. I repeatedly and unavailingly stressed that I believe
exactly the opposite.</LD>
<TE>   At other times Perlmutter breaks up and reassembles quotes to
alter their meaning in offensive ways. Thus, I did not say that the
politics of my "Left, Right and Center" co-host Bob Scheer resemble
those of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Instead, when Perlmutter posed a question
that insultingly linked Le Pen's views to mine, I replied in a joking
tone that the Frenchman's anti-globalization economics resemble
Scheer's: an important difference.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it is somewhere between amazing and appalling that
Perlmutter would imply that "the axis of evil" speech bears
responsibility for the arrest of an Iranian dissident on treason
charges. The Iranian government has been arresting, torturing and
executing dissidents in the thousands for more than two decades. The
odium for these acts belongs to those who commit them--not to those
who attempt to draw the world's attention to them.</TE>

<TE>   So from the perspective of the Westside it can claim superiority
because it has more A-list actors ("Passing Fame in the Valley," May
20)? Not scientists, doctors, intellectuals or other great minds, but
actors!? My friends who visit from New York City just laugh and shake
their heads at the Valley/Westside rivalry because from their
perspective they don't see much of a difference at all. The

<TE>   If I were to be faced with the challenge of homesteading on the
frontier, I want to be part of the Clune family ("Attack on the
Clunes," May 21). Gordon Clune did a masterful job of providing for
his family and would have done even better had not some nonsensical
rules been in place. Real homesteaders would not have been prevented
from killing game, and fishing would not have been off-limits
anywhere. He was inventive in brewing "tonic" for profit, and I'm
sure there was more than one still among real homesteaders. I liked
Gordon's rope beds, and it's absurd to think they "smuggled" in a box
spring. How would that have been possible? I believe the Clunes when
they say they found the spring in an abandoned cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the Clunes would have survived the winter. The marriage
was strong, and the family was united. We liked it that they were
"romantic." Had the homesteaders been told that dry hay was not
nourishing enough to sustain the animals, I'm sure the Clunes would
have harvested sooner and stockpiled green hay. So they didn't have
enough wood cut. I'm betting Gordon would have taken some of the
profits from the sale of his "tonic" and found a hired man. I do
wonder, however, why everyone didn't immediately start making
underground shelters for their families after that snowstorm gave
them a foretaste of winter.</TE>

<TE>   What's Really at the Root of Meanness</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I take issue with the idea that mean-spiritedness has anything to
do with age (Letters, May 15). I'd agree that it is culturally based,
though. Part of the problem is that children in our culture are
institutionalized from ages 5 through 18 and segregated into large
groups based on their ages. Those groups receive very little
interaction with people of other ages. Coupled with our culture's
obsession with looks, achievements, and material possessions,
competitiveness develops, which leads to a whole lot of insecurity.
Insecure people develop meanness as a protective strategy and a way
of coping.</TE>
<TE>   There are those few, however, who choose to spend more time as a
family. Perhaps letter writer Margaret Sagarese could do a study on
kids ages 10 to 15 who have grown up in families that practice
home-schooling. We have found that no such age-based meanness exists.</TE>

<HD>A Poet's Progress</HD>
<DH>Nearly 50 years after she was first discovered, Marie
Ponsot is again the object of literary attention</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN M. JALON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right after making history by publishing Allen Ginsberg's "Howl and
Other Poems" in 1956, Lawrence Ferlinghetti introduced the first book
of another young poet. Her name was Marie Ponsot, and she was so
different from Ginsberg that they seemed like opposites.</LD>
<LD>   He was male, gay, Jewish (and increasingly Buddhist). She examined
marital love and her Catholic faith. His chanting, long-lined rhythms
and jazzed images hurtled across the page. She made short, lyrical
poems, often in rhyme--songs more than howls. He beatified
anti-conformity. Her title, "True Minds," came from a Shakespearean
sonnet about ideal commitment. He treasured Walt Whitman; she, Emily
Dickinson. He became the poet-prophet of the Beats. She raised seven
children and didn't publish again for 25 years.</LD>
<TE>   She kept on writing, however, seemingly indifferent to whether
anyone but the muse noticed. At 81, she's enjoying a second arrival
that has erupted with all the fanfare the first one lacked. It
started with the National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry in
1998. A few weeks ago, the Poetry Society of America made her
co-winner of its Shelley Memorial Award, honoring a whole career. She
arrives at Beyond Baroque in Venice on Saturday to read from her
fifth volume, "Springing" (Knopf), which the New York Times Book
Review--featuring a large picture of her on its cover, rare for a
poet--recently called "a great book." It offers a selection of new
poems, previously published ones and uncollected early work that
illuminates the buried progress of her writing life.</TE>
<TE>   One outcome of her blossoming status is that she's taken on a
somewhat Ginsberg-like role as a public poet. She's been sought after
as one of New York's senior poets after the attacks of Sept. 11. On
Sept. 22, writer-broadcaster Kurt Andersen invited her to his
nationally distributed "Studio 360" program to discuss the cultural
impact of what had happened 11 days before. "What is good will endure
with all the treacheries of what is dreadful," Ponsot assured
listeners in the still-reeling city, her crackling voice both tough
and refined. She spoke of "the subset of strength that we all have in
us." Giving echoes of Winston Churchill's resolve a pacifist twist,
she added that "violence begets violence begets violence. It will
take us perhaps another million years to get past this. But I believe
we will."</TE>
<TE>   Then, she somberly read a poem called "Oceans," which starts:</TE>
<TE>   Death is breath-taking. We all die</TE>
<TE>   young,</TE>
<TE>   our lives defined by failure of the</TE>
<TE>   heart,</TE>
<TE>   our fire drowned in failure of the</TE>
<TE>   lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Still planning on pouring the best</TE>
<TE>   ripe part</TE>
<TE>   of wines our need or grasp has</TE>
<TE>   sucked or wrung</TE>
<TE>   from fruit &amp; sun, we're stopped</TE>
<TE>   before we start.</TE>
<TE>   Ponsot is a petite bird of a woman whose gray-white hair was wound
into a bun on a recent day as she stood in the kitchen of her small,
bright apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side and prepared lunch
for a visitor. She has a daughter and six sons, one of whom started
to renovate her kitchen but hasn't finished. Drawers function but
lack final facings. A blank wall waits for cabinets. "He's busy and
had to stop, but I'm sure he'll get around to it when he can," Ponsot
says, sounding certain.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a scene in a Ponsot poem. She might compare the
kitchen ceiling to the sky, contrast internal light with sunlight,
refer to Dante's "Paradiso," tie it to an illuminated manuscript in a
museum (maybe about Dante's war-plagued era), summon a phrase or two
from Latin and end with a bit of dialogue between her and her son
or--since she tends to see men over women's shoulders--her son's
wife.</TE>
<TE>   All this would occur in the 14 lines of a sonnet or another of the
many traditional forms she's mastered ("Oceans" is a sonnet), plus
two utterly untraditional lines just because she felt like it.</TE>
<TE>   When this imitation Ponsot is suggested to her, she laughs,
something her witty poems make others do quite often. She says the
make-believe poem reflects the focus she puts on the importance of "a
governing intention to live a perfect life in an imperfect world."</TE>
<TE>   Even when she describes a New York wildlife sanctuary or a small
rooftop garden (she's the enthusiastic keeper of one) her work poses
the contrast between an ethical tenderness and the brutal ways human
beings betray their "tremendous interconnectedness" with each other
and nature.</TE>
<TE>   Invited the other day to speak to honor graduates at Queens
College, where she taught for many years, she read "Jamaica Wildlife
Center, Queens, New York," about a beautiful but endangered corner of
the borough where she was born.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the "sea air off the flats and inlets of Jamaica Bay,"
she never makes an explicit case against developers and politicians,
but it's clear what she's talking about. She notes how even a poet
exploits these details, turning them into "bite-sized images" that
"intelligence eats &amp; eats eagerly."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't change the major rule that death is the price of life,"
Ponsot says, chewing on a grape. "But there is a particularly human
capacity to make choices about how to use that life. You can keep
making water filthy until the water dies, or you can decide not to."</TE>
<TE>   She was born Marie Birmingham, to a family that derived its
relative affluence from a business supplying imported gourmet food
and fine wines on a private basis to very wealthy New Yorkers. Her
late stature disguises an early bloomer. She says she can't remember
not writing, and found her mature poetic voice quite young. "I didn't
know you were supposed to find a voice. I just wrote the poems and
let them do that."</TE>
<TE>   She discovered James Joyce's short story, "Ivy Day in the
Committee Room," at 13, and became devoted to Joyce's work. She
excelled at Latin and French by the time she graduated from public
school in Queens at 15, entering a small Catholic college there
called St. Joseph's. Joyce taught her to trust the power of a single
creative moment to embody the whole of human consciousness. Dante's
"Divine Comedy" thrilled her when she read it as an assignment as a
college freshman--the last part, the "Paradiso," most of all.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, she had experienced an exultant pleasure in the most
basic sensation of being alive but couldn't quite find images and
words to describe the all-encompassing sensation. As she read Dante's
long poem, "it was clear that the 'Inferno' was intolerable if it
wasn't going somewhere pretty quickly. And it was. Beatrice leads him
to the ultimate vision, and then she disappears. And, in the text, he
disappears, too. And there is just this visionary moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sky vision," says this poet whose work brims with skies
that suggest both internal and universal infinities. "It's an
out-of-your-own-body, out-of-your-own-mind, out-of-your-own-sky
vision. And when you see that somebody has found a story that leads
to it, a kind of showing forth of that in words.... "</TE>
<TE>   She stops talking, and her clear blue eyes roll upward with an
awestruck savoring of the experience. "It is the great sense of the
great value of everything," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, at 19, she got a master's in 17th century poetry at
Columbia. The war years, during which she worked in Manhattan
bookstores, seeped into her. She found a way to think about them in
the Catholic Worker, the Pacifist newspaper co-founded by the
activist Dorothy Day. Around the war's end, a relationship with a
Navy man who suffered deafness and depression from shellshock gave
her insight into men who'd returned from the war.</TE>
<TE>   On "Studio 360," she read a poem about a young, World War II flier
she knew who had "burned, that boy, my age, Lt. Little,/prayed for in
my parish monthly thirty years...."</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Ponsot made her first trip to Europe, to Paris. On the
ship, she first met Ferlinghetti, who'd served as an officer in the
Navy. In a cafe, she met a painter named Claude Ponsot. They soon
married and returned together about a year later to the United
States. The marriage came apart in the 1960s, and she increasingly
raised their children on her own.</TE>
<TE>   Though she came from a well-off family, her marriage and
subsequent life gave way to financial difficulties. She taught
writing and translated French literature to support her family.
Though too busy to worry about getting published, "while children
slept and popovers popped," she wrote at every opportunity. "You just
do it," she says. "You do it because you've got to get your focus,
even if it is for only half an hour or 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, a poet friend urged Ponsot to submit a manuscript to
Knopf, which was planning a new series of poetry books. The result,
an unusually thick volume, just started to catch up with the years of
unseen writing.</TE>
<TE>   Her next book took eight years; the one after that, 10. She says
she's a slow, painstaking writer.</TE>
<TE>   "Springing," with 26 new poems, took only four years to
produce--an instant in Ponsot time.</TE>
<TE>   Ferlinghetti, speaking from San Francisco recently, says he's not
surprised at her growing impact, that he'd never met anyone with her
"very acute sensibility, before or since." Ginsberg, he says,
"transformed the poetry world of his time, but she is not a poet of
her time. That is not one of her attributes. She is a poet out of
time, in the way that is true of the best poetry." Softly, he
speculated: "She may last longer than Ginsberg. Who knows? It just
shows how right I was to publish her all along."</TE>
<TE>   Marie Ponsot will read Saturday evening at 7:30 at Beyond Baroque
in Venice. For information, call (310) 822-3006.</TE>

<HD>When the Shopping Gene and Guilt Gene Collide in Women</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET WEBB PRESSLER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Isometimes wonder how much better off the retail industry would be if
women didn't feel so guilty about shopping. Extrapolating from all
the purchases I've abandoned at the last minute because I just hated
the way I felt, the difference would be pretty substantial.</LD>
<LD>   Do all women feel shopping guilt? I've found a few who never do,
and I've tried to learn from them. For some, the guilt is sporadic.
But I've discovered that the mildly tense to outright sick feeling I
often get when I'm shopping, which I long thought was just my own
neurosis, is very common. Many women feel guilty about shopping,
whether it's for fashion, food, flowers, furniture or face creams.</LD>
<LD>   Why else would we leave our shopping bags in the trunk until after
dark or sneak in our purchases with the dry-cleaning?</LD>
<TE>   In a totally unscientific polling of various friends,
acquaintances and co-workers, a few themes emerged. Among the most
obvious was the difference between men and women and their reactions
to shopping. Here's how my conversations generally started:</TE>
<TE>   Me: "I'm doing a column on shopping guilt."</TE>
<TE>   Friend/acquaintance, female: groan of recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Friend/acquaintance, male: "What's that?"</TE>
<TE>   The gender difference could be chalked up to the fact that women
do a bit more shopping than men. But I believe, as do most of the
women I talked to, that the guilt associated with shopping is
gender-specific.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many of my friends, I'm acutely aware of the messages from
society that say I should be more frugal, more selfless, more aware
of the environment, more careful about planning for my daughter's
education and my own retirement.</TE>
<TE>   But those messages conflict with the seductive desire to look
good, to have smooth skin, to smell nice--virtues certainly acclaimed
every bit as much in popular culture. So frequently, when a woman
does succumb to a purchase, she judges herself critically, against
the more sensible messages from her husband, her mother or her
favorite personal-finance columnist. The resulting guilt takes all
forms.</TE>
<TE>   There's time guilt: "I feel guilty for the time it takes, knowing
I'm leaving my husband with the kids," said one friend, a government
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   There's self-indulgence guilt: "I love flowers, but I feel so
guilty every time I bring flowers into the house, like I should be
spending my money on other things," said a professional with mostly
grown children.</TE>
<TE>   There's stupidity guilt: "I'll tell you where the guilt is: the
skin products," whispered another friend, a writer and artist whose
husband was in earshot. "Because the skin products are expensive, and
they probably don't work. But there's always hope."</TE>
<TE>   One woman said she feels guilty over her high grocery bill, but
her husband is a different story: "He comes home the other day with a
flat-panel computer screen and never gives it another thought."</TE>
<TE>   Another friend said her husband is "so methodical that when he
figures out something he needs, it's a far less emotional
experience."</TE>
<TE>   I asked the folks at the American Psychological Assn. if they knew
anyone who had studied shopping guilt and the apparent gender split
in attitudes about buying.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, let's see," said the nice woman in the public relations
office. "I can give you our shopping people, or I can give you our
guilt people."</TE>
<TE>   It was a "guilt" person who seemed to really nail it for me.
Lawrence Josephs, a psychology professor at Adelphi University on
Long Island, said he sees big differences in spending attitudes among
patients in his private practice. Both sexes feel guilt about
spending money, but women feel guilty about the impact on present-day
activities while men feel guilty about whether they're managing their
finances well enough to prepare for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think men don't connect the dots. They spend money without
guilt in the present, but they have a lot of neurotic worries about
having money in the future, and they don't see any connection between
those two behaviors," Josephs said. "I would see the reverse with
women. Women often don't worry as much as the men in the family about
the future, but worry about the present spending."</TE>

<LD>Soon another one of the big grasshoppers brought in the
brain-a-lizer. It was a complicated machine with many shiny parts. On
one side was a control panel covered with levers, switches and dials.
On the other was a metal hat that the head grasshopper fit down over
Ignatz's head. Silver cables snaked from the metal hat to the
brain-a-lizer.</LD>
<LD>   "With this machine," the head grasshopper said, "we can read all
thoughts in your brain."</LD>
<LD>   Ignatz showed no fear. He said nothing.</LD>
<TE>   "Very well," the head grasshopper said. He switched on the
brain-a-lizer. It began to glow and hum. Instruments spun crazily.
"Just relax," the head grasshopper said nastily.</TE>
<TE>   Small bolts of lightning played around the metal hat on Ignatz's
head. Thunder crashed. The head grasshopper pushed up the levers,
causing the lightning bolts to get bigger and the thunder to crash
louder.</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz showed no fear. He said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   After a while the head grasshopper pushed the levers back down and
shut off the machine. The lightning and thunder stopped. The head
grasshopper took a blue tube from a small hole in the control board.
"This is a record of all the information in your brain. I will now go
read it," he said and hurried from the room.</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz waited patiently.</TE>
<TE>   The head grasshopper returned a few minutes later and threw the
little blue tube at the wall. It bounced off and made a musical noise
when it hit the deck. "I don't know how you did it, but this record
tube is empty!" he yelled. "You will tell me everything you know or I
will have all the air sucked out of this room!"</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Very well," the head grasshopper cried. "Eat vacuum!"</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Ignatz give in?</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gilden's alien teddy bears inspired this story. You can find
it on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Wild Debut for 'Eminem Show'</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Piracy of the album prompts an early and
confused release in stores. It might deflate the rapper's chart
bragging rights.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Eminem Show" was supposed to arrive in stores today with a
flourish, the most eagerly awaited album of the year with the
marketing machine of the world's largest record company behind it.
Instead, the debut of "The Eminem Show" played out over an entire
weekend like a ragged fire drill, with Internet piracy and retail
chaos sounding the alarms.</LD>
<LD>   And in a testament to Eminem's drawing power, he will probably
emerge from the smoke Wednesday with a No. 1 album on the weekly U.S.
pop chart after reportedly selling 300,000 copies by the chart's
Sunday night cutoff point.</LD>
<LD>   Depending where you were, "The Eminem Show" went on sale on Friday
or Saturday or Sunday, a wildly unusual scenario in an industry that
rigidly releases new titles on Tuesday. The reason was that
Aftermath/Interscope Records had rushed the album and repeatedly
pushed up the release date to limit the damage done by widespread
online piracy. But the hurry-up was complicated by holiday weekend
shipping schedules and antsy retailers wondering whether the guy down
the street was already selling what could be the hottest disc of
2002.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult weekend and hard to keep up with the most
current and correct information about what was going on," said Scott
Levin, an executive with the Musicland store chain. "It was hard to
know what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Fans were lucky if they knew the album was out at all. "The Eminem
Show" was originally scheduled for a June 4 release, but a flurry of
bootleg copies spreading on the Internet in recent weeks prompted the
rhymer and his handlers to abruptly push that up to today.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, though, Interscope announced the album would be
available this past Sunday, in time to cash in on the holiday retail
crowds--then later Friday the label said even that plan was
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The album's premature release may have cost Eminem some pop chart
honors. The copies that sold last weekend will undermine his chances
of selling a million copies in a single chart week. The rapper's last
disc, 2000's "The Marshall Mathers LP," sold 1.76 million in its
debut week, the highest total ever by a solo artist, and some
forecasters were expecting the new disc to sell in the range of 1.2
million copies in its first week, according to Geoff Mayfield,
director of charts for Billboard.</TE>
<TE>   "If hundreds of thousands of them sold [already]," Mayfield said
Tuesday, "then obviously that endangers its ability to top 1 million
this week."</TE>
<TE>   The piracy of the album has been rampant and perhaps
unprecedented--Gracenote, a digital music service, said its surveys
show the album was the second-most played CD on computers last week,
the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. To entice fans who
may have already plucked the music for free online, the first 2
million copies of the album sold in the U.S. will include a free DVD
with Eminem special features.</TE>

<LD>In what ranks as the biggest-ever Memorial Day weekend, "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones" remained No. 1 in its second weekend
in release, grossing $60 million over the four-day holiday. The film
has now raked in $201.3 million domestically, reaching the
$200-million mark in only 12 days--the second-fastest of any film.</LD>
<LD>   "Spider-Man" grossed $35.8 million to remain in second place and
has now amassed $333.6 million in North America alone. Shattering its
third speed record, the film reached the $300-million mark in only 22
days, the fastest any film has reached that mark.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Warner Bros.' crime drama "Insomnia" starring Al Pacino
and Robin Williams grossed $26.1 million to debut in third place;
DreamWorks' animated adventure "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"
opened in fourth place with $23.2 million; and the new Columbia
Pictures' psychological drama, "Enough," starring Jennifer Lopez,
opened in fifth with $17.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations Co., said ticket sales for the weekend soared to
more than $200 million, easily eclipsing last year's $186.1 million.
"It's now a foregone conclusion that we'll have a record-breaking
summer."</TE>

<HD>Examining Brushes With Greatness</HD>
<DH>Art* A new joint exhibit of Matisse and Picasso helps shed
light on their complex relationship and how these friends/rivals
influenced one another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH GARDINER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A wealth of paintings and sculptures by Henri Matisse and Pablo
Picasso, two of the 20th century's artistic giants, are being
displayed together in an exhibition that probes a complicated,
decades-long friendship that enriched the work of both men.</LD>
<LD>   The show at the Tate Modern opened May 11 to ecstatic reviews and
has been drawing large crowds to the cavernous former power plant on
the River Thames.</LD>
<LD>   Curator Elizabeth Cowling says the idea for the joint exhibit
came, in a way, from Picasso himself.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got to be able to picture, side by side, everything
Matisse and I were doing at that time," he once said of the latter
years of their careers, when their friendship was closest. "No one
has ever looked at Matisse's paintings more carefully than I. And no
one has looked at mine more carefully than he."</TE>
<TE>   The side-by-side displays at the Matisse-Picasso show include 131
works covering more than 50 years and include some of the artists'
best-known masterpieces.</TE>
<TE>   Art historians have long known about the ties between the
contemporaries, who were friends and rivals from the time they met in
Paris, where they are thought to have been introduced to each other
by writer Gertrude Stein and her husband, Leo, in 1906.</TE>
<TE>   Both helped define modern art, but they are often seen as its
opposite poles--Matisse the meticulous master of bold colors and
striking surfaces, painting calm, lovely images, while the more
turbulent Picasso turned reality on its head to make pictures
seething with emotion, much of it dark.</TE>
<TE>   Cowling said seeing their art together would show viewers that
neither artist fits neatly in his assigned category.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to find Matisse a far tougher, more outrageous,
more daring artist than they thought, which is very good, because he
was that," she explained. Seeing his paintings next to Picasso's, she
said, will highlight their "scratchings, repainting, a sense of
extraordinary energy ... that will give the lie to these notions that
Matisse did it all easily."</TE>
<TE>   Picasso, she continued, emerges despite his frequent stylistic
shifts as more careful and thorough than is generally recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "You think this bohemian with an outrageous private life, and you
think he's just working almost thoughtlessly, out of genius," she
said. "This is somebody who worked ... hard, who finished things
carefully ... a very reflective artist, a thoughtful artist."</TE>
<TE>   Exhibition organizers also hope to show that the Matisse-Picasso
relationship was more complicated, and more fruitful, than previously
realized.</TE>
<TE>   Competitiveness spurred both artists and particularly needled
Matisse when the fame of the younger Picasso began to surpass his
own. He was even said to have been jealous when press reviews of a
joint 1946 show in London portrayed the Spaniard as a rebel pushing
the bounds of artistic acceptability.</TE>
<TE>   And although their styles were different, they often inspired each
other to experiment with new ideas. Matisse's bold use of color
pushed Picasso to move away from monochromatic images, and Picasso's
Cubism encouraged Matisse to rethink his portrayal of shape and
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what often happens when artists are part of a group; what
the other does is a stimulus and a challenge," Cowling said. "It
gives you courage."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition groups the artists' works by theme, beginning with
side-by-side self-portraits painted in 1906 and moving through
landscapes, still-lifes and nudes, among other subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings--often quite different at first glance but sharing
common elements on a closer look--seem to deepen each other's power,
and their arrangement traces the way in which the two men influenced
and fed off one another.</TE>
<TE>   The 1906 self-portraits, painted when Matisse was already
recognized as a leader of the French avant-garde movement and Picasso
was a young upstart, highlight the differences between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Picasso's "Self-Portrait With Palette" is done in a somber mix of
grays, browns and white. It shows the artist with his dark eyes cast
downward, looking haunted and mournful. Matisse's piece is filled
with color--he wears a bright, striped shirt; his face is shadowed
with green; and dabs of blue hang behind his head.</TE>
<TE>   Later works echo one another more directly as the men take on
similar subjects, borrowing and then reinterpreting ideas and
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Matisse's "The Studio, Quai Saint-Michel," of 1916-17, shows a
model reclining on a red chaise as an easel rests nearby in front of
an empty chair, its occupant seeming to have stepped briefly away.</TE>
<TE>   It hangs next to Picasso's 1928 "Painter and Model," a far more
abstract representation whose subjects' bodies are depicted in spare
lines and shapes. The scene is an unusual one for Picasso, who rarely
painted from live models.</TE>
<TE>   The artists' commonalities grew even clearer toward the end of
Matisse's life.</TE>
<TE>   The influence of his famous 1950s paper cutouts--blue silhouettes
mounted on a white background--are clearly visible in the flat
sheet-metal sculptures Picasso did a decade later, after his friend's
1954 death.</TE>
<TE>   The show has so far won rave reviews. The Guardian newspaper
called it "momentous, tremendous," and the Observer pronounces it "a
rare and tremendous achievement."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Matisse Picasso" is on view at the Tate Modern through Aug. 18.
It will be at the Grand Palais in Paris from Sept. 25 to Jan. 6,
2003, and at New York's Museum of Modern Art from Feb. 13 to May 19,
2003.</TE>

<DH>The Hives come from Sweden to show America that real rock
can be fun, tearing through a set that makes time fly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When was the last time you saw a rock band so exhilarating that you
wished the concert could go on all night?</LD>
<LD>   The lucky ones can answer: Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Hives, a sensational young quintet from Sweden, put on a
performance at the Roxy that was remindful of the joy a rock band can
produce--among many other things, even inspiring smiles.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the between-song cheers of the crowd early in the show, lead
singer Howlin' Pelle Almqvist--whose moves and cheekbones call to
mind a young Mick Jagger--gazed down at the audience and said, "Yes,
America, you love us. We've come to take over your country and change
everything. History starts today."</TE>
<TE>   The mock arrogance was a marvelous slap at the stodginess and
anti-entertainment stance that has tended to squeeze the fun out of
rock in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, far too many of the new best-selling U.S. rock bands
have felt that the key to their artistry (and to their place in the
Top 10) is to be even darker and angrier than Nirvana and the other
grunge bands of the '90s. The resulting music is often tedious in its
repetition and cartoonish in its exaggerated angst.</TE>
<TE>   There are excellent young bands today, including the White Stripes
and Trail of Dead, that deal with intense emotions in imaginative and
inspiring ways, but the Hives assault the whole notion that rock has
to be humorless to be real.</TE>
<TE>   The group's compilation album is boldly called "Your New Favourite
Band," and its song titles range from "a.k.a. I-D-I-O-T" to "The
Hives Are Law, You Are Crime."</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen," Almqvist proclaimed during Monday's show,
"people have called me smug. But we just believe in giving credit
where credit is due."</TE>
<TE>   Even their clothing stands apart. Rather than the jeans or baggy
shorts that have been the fashion statement of choice for bands in
recent years, the Hives salute the mod era in British rock by wearing
matching black shirts and pants, set off by white shoes and white
ties.</TE>
<TE>   And Howlin' Pelle isn't the only colorful nickname in the band.
There's also Nicholaus Arson (Howlin' Pelle's older brother) and
Vigilante Carlstroem on guitar, Dr. Matt Destruction on bass and
Chris Dangerous on drums.</TE>
<TE>   You've got to be careful when reciting the group's history because
the word from England, where the band has already become a hot item,
is that the band isn't beyond occasional fabrication--just to keep
things interesting offstage as well as on.</TE>
<TE>   The band claims it's been together for eight years and that they
are mostly 23 (though some members look older), and that their songs
are all written by a mysterious figure named Randy Fitzsimmons (who
may or may not be real).</TE>
<TE>   What is most certainly true is that the Hives fell in love with
the punk and garage-rock sounds they first heard from fellow Swedish
bands and then traced to the British and American outfits that
pioneered the approach. Those influences range from the early Rolling
Stones and Mitch Ryder to the Stooges and the Dead Kennedys.</TE>
<TE>   On their first two albums, 1997's "Barely Legal" and 2000's "Veni
Vidi Vicious," the Hives convincingly captured the impatience and
exuberance of youth in crisp, dynamic, two-minute songs that
celebrate the majesty of guitar power chords.</TE>
<TE>   "Do what I wanna 'cause I can," Howlin' Pelle boasts in "Hate to
Say I Told You So," which is propelled by a guitar riff that reflects
the vitality of the Kinks' classic "All Day and All of the Night." In
"Main Offender" he declares, "I'm on my way, can't settle down."</TE>
<TE>   But the ultimate tribute to the power of rock as a liberating
force is "Untutored Youth," a song from the "Favourite Band" album
that is available in this country on import via Poptones Records (a
company started by Alan McGee, whose earlier labels were home to
Oasis and the Jesus and Mary Chain).</TE>
<TE>   In the song, Howlin' Pelle declares, "If I really wanted to learn
something, I'd listen to more records and I do."</TE>
<TE>   The Hives--whose "Veni Vidi Vicious" album is released by Sire/
Burning Heart/Epitaph in the U.S.--played those three songs and a
dozen more Monday in a set that was so fast-paced that the musicians
seemed to be hyperventilating to keep up. The show was the band's
L.A. headline debut, part of a 17-city North American tour.</TE>
<TE>   Howlin' Pelle was all over the stage, including the sound
monitors, sometimes prancing like Jagger, at other times doing the
scissor-kicks of Pete Townshend, and generally just hamming it up
like David Johansen during the New York Dolls days.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that the Hives' albums run only about 28 minutes, it
wasn't surprising that the set lasted just 55. But the time went by
so quickly, you would have sworn it was only 20. Howlin' Pelle is
right: This might just be a band we can all love.</TE>

<HD>Brokaw to Step Aside in 2004</HD>
<DH>Television* The NBC anchor will be replaced by Brian
Williams after the presidential election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Tom Brokaw's reign as anchor of "The NBC Nightly News" will come to
an end after the next presidential election in 2004, with NBC News
announcing Tuesday Brokaw's plans to step aside at that time as well
as the official anointment of Brian Williams as his replacement.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement of Brokaw's two-year contract extension and
Williams' eventual ascension puts to rest uncertainty over who would
be in the anchor chair for NBC's flagship broadcast--which has
dominated its rivals for many years--after Brokaw's current contract
expires at the end of the summer.</LD>
<LD>   It also gives Williams, 43, who anchors a nightly newscast on
sister network MSNBC, some assurances about his future after many
years as Brokaw's official substitute and presumed heir apparent. His
contract was up at the end of the year, and sources say Williams has
agreed to a new deal that runs more than five years.</LD>
<TE>   NBC becomes the first of the three major broadcast networks with
an announced succession plan for the men who have led their newscasts
for two decades. Recently, CBS News expressed interest in Williams,
but there isn't necessarily any near-term opening there, with Dan
Rather close to signing a contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News, meanwhile, is negotiating to renew Peter Jennings'
contract, which expires this summer. His broadcast has been gaining
on NBC's in the ratings, but contract talks have been reported to be
tense, with speculation that Jennings might be asked to take a pay
cut at a time when many others at ABC have been asked to do so. ABC
News President David Westin last week declined to comment on the
status of the talks and said the network might not formally announce
a new deal with Jennings even if it secures one, in line with
Jennings' own desire to keep his situation private.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw, who is 62, has been NBC's lead anchor since 1983 and had
hinted broadly for some time that he might be ready to step down. The
anchor said Tuesday that the events of Sept. 11 and the subsequent
war on terror had changed his feelings. "I am here because I couldn't
walk away from this story," he told a press conference, adding that
he had been energized "psychologically, physically, professionally."</TE>
<TE>   The 2004 date was picked, he said, because it allowed him to
report on one more election cycle but still let the network plan for
a future with Williams. "The last thing we wanted to do was lose
him," Brokaw said of his successor.</TE>
<TE>   NBC declined to comment on terms of either man's deal but said
Brokaw had not been asked to take a salary cut and that he would
remain at the network after leaving "Nightly News," reporting
prime-time specials. An avid outdoorsman whose recent books on the
World War II generation have been a publishing phenomenon, Brokaw
said he had no plans to go to the "anchorman's rest home and take
soft food."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' role at NBC will change before the anchor transition.
His nightly MSNBC newscast, which has not been a ratings success,
will leave the news and opinion channel and shift exclusively to
NBC's financial cable channel, CNBC, where it will air at 7 p.m.
Pacific time. NBC News President Neal Shapiro said the program would
be a better fit with CNBC, which currently airs reruns of the show.
Williams will also be seen more frequently on "NBC Nightly News" and
will report more often for NBC from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw dismissed recent speculation that the network evening
newscasts, despite drawing a combined 30 million viewers a night, are
becoming increasingly irrelevant thanks to competition from several
all-news cable networks. Viewers turned to the networks after Sept.
11 as well as during the confusion that surrounded the results of the
2000 presidential election, he said, and the nightly newscast is
still the engine driving daily news-gathering at the networks.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has made no secret of wanting the job for many
years, noted that the success of Brokaw's "Greatest Generation" books
demonstrates that the three network anchors have "become more than
what they do at 6:30 in the evening. It's a big position still in
this country."</TE>

<HD>Uncounted Viewers Are Hiding in Public--for Now</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in a Westwood bar a few weeks ago, I couldn't help but notice
an evenly divided group of eight males and females who were
presumably college students. What caught my eye was that they were
paying no attention to one another, instead silently watching the
WB's "Smallville" as they munched on salads and curly fries.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond being reminded that youth is wasted on the young, I began
to consider some of my own recent out-of-home TV viewing experiences,
among them catching a Lakers playoff game in a Santa Monica bar (hey,
at least I vary locations) amid a throng of loud, out-of-shape men,
many wearing imitation Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant jerseys.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from perhaps a tacit cry for help, why bring this up?
Because none of those viewers was counted by Nielsen Media Research,
the ratings service whose estimates govern the sale of billions of
dollars in advertising time.</LD>
<TE>   The late spring and summer have long been a time for vacations,
barbecues, baseball and NBA playoff games, but those activities also
coincide with TV viewing that isn't captured by traditional ratings
methodology.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters have griped for years about this blind spot in
Nielsen's system, and the service does commission occasional
out-of-home studies to help mollify its biggest clients. Advertisers,
not surprisingly, have been less enthusiastic about examining such
oversights, in essence telling the networks, "Sure, we know people
are watching outside the home, but just throw them in as an extra."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one suspects that the complaints will take on a greater
sense of urgency as network ratings steadily dwindle--the latest
evidence coming when the official television season ended last week,
with Nielsen data showing declines for every major network except
NBC, which received an extraordinary boost from the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Even NBC pleads its case on this score almost daily, with every
press release noting that Nielsen figures are based on "measurable
in-home viewing." In other words, the ratings overlook women watching
"Days of Our Lives" at work on their lunch breaks, fans of "Late
Night With Conan O'Brien" and "The Daily Show" in college dorms, and
groups who gather in a friend's living room to obsess over
"Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this issue hardly just concerns the major networks.
Think of all the time people spend watching CNN and Fox News Channel
in hotel rooms, CNBC in offices and fitness centers (a treadmill is
the perfect place to be while seeing one's stock plummet) and ESPN in
pubs and clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that the TV industry, or at least its slide-rule
contingent, is quietly salivating about a test being conducted by
Arbitron, the radio ratings service, of a "portable people meter"--a
pager-sized device that subjects carry with them wherever they might
go to record their viewing and listening habits.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 1,500 people in Philadelphia are walking around with one
of these gizmos, which detect an inaudible code that is embedded in
radio and TV station signals. Each day, test subjects simply plug the
monitors into "base stations" that recharge them while simultaneously
downloading the data and transmitting it in for tabulation.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitron plans to release more detailed results next month, but
preliminary findings from the test, which is being conducted with
Nielsen's cooperation, have charted substantial increases in TV
viewing and slightly lesser gains for radio use. Keep in mind that
Nielsen estimates the average household, taking all the residents
into account, has a TV on more than seven hours a day, so the
portable meters depressingly suggest that America might be even more
densely populated with couch-hugging slugs than was previously
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most significant, the portable meter is a passive means of
gauging media consumption, whereas radio and local television each
rely to varying degrees on diaries, asking people to remember and
honestly report their media tastes. And really, do you want anyone to
know how much time you devote to "Jerry Springer" or radio's
"smack"-talking Jim Rome instead of "Masterpiece Theatre" or classic
novels on tape?</TE>
<TE>   Where this technology leads is anybody's guess, but it could
benefit the networks, which seems only fair given the impact that
past advancements have had on them. After all, programmers have
endured a series of innovations--the remote control, VCR, home
entertainment system, personal computer and now personal video
recorder such as TiVo--that contribute to people camping out in front
of their TV without necessarily watching their programs, or in the
last case facilitate skipping the commercials that help pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the portable people meter might not go far enough to
suit broadcasters, since participants need to have the device on
their person for it to work. The next logical step might require
tagging people's ears with mini-receivers, the same way they tracked
the movement of wildebeest on "Wild Kingdom." After all, there is
seemingly no shortage of dolts willing to do ridiculous things to be
on television; you have to assume some would be equally rabid (take
note, disgruntled "Once and Again" fans) to register their opinions
about it.</TE>
<TE>   All this is worth remembering as we dive into the summer, when
people scatter to vacation homes, take trips or sit in bars cheering
on Shaq and Kobe as they endeavor to give Angelenos reason to keep
thousands of annoying car window banners flying.</TE>
<TE>   It's a common refrain, of course, that there's nothing good to
watch on television, especially over the next few months, when hit
series slip into rerun mode. Depending on how the research goes,
however, we might discover that the public--including college kids
who really should find something better to do--are watching a whole
lot more of nothing than we thought.</TE>

<HD>Can DVDs Help Music Sales?</HD>
<DH>Video* The recording industry, with sales lagging, looks
toward the movie format's popular extras as a way to give CD buyers
something more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 10 consecutive years of annual growth, profits contracted last
year in the record industry by about 3%. CD burning, free downloading
of music from the Internet and the enormous rise in popularity of
movies on DVD were contributing factors in this decline.</LD>
<LD>   Now, more and more record companies and recording artists are
diving headfirst into producing music-oriented DVDs in an attempt to
boost flagging sales and to take advantage of this booming and
multifaceted entertainment format.</LD>
<LD>   "The music industry is coming to terms with downloading, burning
and the devaluation of the CD in the marketplace," says Ty DeGooyer,
general manager of Palm Pictures, a multimedia company that includes
record, film and DVD divisions. "The DVD is the next step for us. It
has the potential to be an enormously compelling [musical and visual]
experience."</LD>
<TE>   In an effort to make music DVDs as alluring as possible, record
labels and artists are looking to sweeten their video compilations
and concert films with bonus material and an array of fan-friendly
features. While ancillary materials are commonplace with feature
films on DVD, the music industry has been slower to react to this
trend.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're recording an album, you're not necessarily thinking
in terms of creating projects for DVD," DeGooyer says. "This may be a
reason why music DVDs have been lagging behind feature-film DVDs
[when it comes to bonus material]. But today consumers expect to get
those extras."</TE>
<TE>   Ty Braswell, vice president of new media at Virgin Records, says
his label is placing film crews in the recording studio with the
notion that footage of artists at work and in-studio interviews could
eventually be used as DVD bonus material. For the same reason,
Braswell says that Virgin now insists on owning any footage of its
artists featured on Webcasts.</TE>
<TE>   This week, two music DVDs are being released that reflect the
increased creativity and energy being devoted to many music DVDs:
Palm Pictures' compilation of work by rap video director Hype
Williams, and Universal Music Enterprises' two-disc DVD featuring
Depeche Mode in concert.</TE>
<TE>   DeGooyer says Williams' "The Videos" collection represents the
first time a videotape or DVD has been devoted to a music video
director's work. The compilation contains 10 videos handpicked by
Williams, featuring such hip-hop artists as the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z
and LL Cool J. "The Videos" also includes commentary by Williams and
behind-the-scenes footage.</TE>
<TE>   The Depeche Mode DVD set, "One Night in Paris: A Live DVD by Anton
Corbijn, the Exciter Tour 2001," features the band in concert on one
disc, then another offering interviews with director Corbijn, band
members and key people in the Depeche Mode touring camp. There also
is behind-the-scenes footage and one track from the concert that can
be viewed from multiple angles.</TE>
<TE>   "The cool thing about this title is that we're releasing it as a
front-line single CD, which will cost $24.98," notes Jeff Fura, DVD
production coordinator for Universal Music Enterprises. "The band
wanted to consider the second disc as a bonus disc. It's not like
you're paying for two discs."</TE>
<TE>   U2 also has a two-disc concert DVD available called "Elevation
2001: Live From Boston." The concert and a documentary on the filming
of the show make up the first disc. The second disc includes an
option that allows the viewer to experience the concert from several
perspectives. A brief road movie, additional tracks, trailers and Web
links are also included.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD format has led some music artists to think in very
creative ways.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals became the first
group to simultaneously release a CD and DVD. The DVD contains a
commissioned film for all 18 tracks on the CD. Young filmmakers were
asked to use their own imagination in making a short film based on a
song from the "Rings Around the World" CD.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of the filmmakers who participated had made
music videos before," says Gruff Rhys, the lead vocalist and
guitarist for the Super Furry Animals, a popular band in Great
Britain. That was preferable because "we didn't want anything
run-of-the-mill. We just wanted a personal interpretation of the
song. It was quite exciting receiving them in the post and checking
them out. Some were really good, and some were very bad. We scrapped
some of them. We reedited some of them ourselves. It was a very
exciting thing to be part of and to work with so many different
people."</TE>
<TE>   "The Smashing Pumpkins 1991-2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection"
is another DVD that is likely to impress most ardent fans of the
deceased band. Each track contains generally engaging commentary by
band members and/or the video's director. Beyond that, there are
never-before-seen outtakes, behind-the-scenes documentaries and a
15-minute film by Jonas Akerlund, titled "Try," the poignant story of
two young homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Arny Schorr, senior vice president at Rhino Records, says his
label is starting to include more interactive features on its music
DVDs that he terms "Easter eggs."</TE>
<TE>   "You might look at a DVD menu and you will see a picture of
somebody's kitchen," Schorr explains. "There's no explanation, but if
you click on the salt shaker, it takes you to a special feature
that's not listed as being available. It's like an Easter egg hunt.
It might be outtake footage. It could be another song. It could be
somebody from the group telling a dirty joke. But it's something you
have to look for.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when the fans start talking amongst themselves, which is
what you want. It's like, 'I bought this Alice Cooper DVD and there's
this really cool game on it, but I also found an Easter egg.' And
somebody else will say, 'I found a different one.'"</TE>
<TE>   The majority of new music DVDs employ 5.1 surround sound
capability, a quality not available through the CD format. With
surround sound systems available now for as low as $300, it is a
feature that is likely to help galvanize sales of music DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   "With a 5.1 system, you are going to hear elements of a concert
that you wouldn't hear in two-channel," Universal Music Enterprises'
Fura says.</TE>
<TE>   "With this Depeche Mode concert, you're watching the concert and
the sound is coming out of your front speakers and your subwoofer.
Then you have the back speakers and you hear the crowd behind you
separately. You hear a very faint sound of the concert going in the
back, which gives you the sense that you're in the concert hall. It's
absolutely amazing. Hearing it gave me goose bumps."</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Two Cities Offers Pointed Fun</HD>
<DH>A briskly paced documentary comparing San Diego and Tijuana
does a number on conventional wisdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honey, let's sell the house, let's chuck this sterile, soulless,
gated-community life of ours, let's leave the metaphysical angst and
the manicured lawns behind and move to Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Yeah, TJ, metropolis of striped donkeys and perpetual dust, of
drunken sailors and feral spring-breakers, of coyotes and narcos and
maquiladoras.</LD>
<LD>   Forgive the frivolity.</LD>
<TE>   But L.A. filmmaker Phillip Rodriguez's half-hour documentary about
two neighboring cities--San Diego and Tijuana--is a lot of
transnational fun, with a point. It airs at 8:30 p.m. tonight on
KCET.</TE>
<TE>   The film, "Mixed Feelings: San Diego/Tijuana," does a number on
conventional wisdom, i.e., the notion that San Diego, with its broad
swaths of green, its white-sand beaches and its ever-swelling columns
of tile-roofed expanses, is somehow a superior place to live than its
southern doppelganger. ("America's Finest City," they used to boast,
prompting a rejoinder: "America's Smuggest City.")</TE>
<TE>   Let's be frank: The film traffics in an ingrained gringo-bashing
ethic, a politically correct preference for chaos over order, for the
spontaneous over the master-planned. Our principal interlocutors are
a couple of terzo mondo-loving architects who can't seem to forgive
themselves for actually living in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Alan Rosenblum argues that San Diego has become a kind
of artificial "Truman Show," with shopping its most exalted rite.
Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we're firmly in the realm of the stereotype, even
condescension. San Diego has its barrios, and Tijuana its upscale
reaches. Most anyone living in a landslide-threatened hillside
colonia without running water or a proper loo would gladly take the
San Diego condo and the pool, never mind the sterility, thank you.</TE>
<TE>   But, if you can read alienation, even desperation, into those
ever-multiplying suburban boxes, you might also see relief in the
embrace of messy urban-ness--even beyond the borderlands. Tijuana,
like Los Angeles, is largely an agglomeration of struggling migrants,
whose efforts at improving their lot radiate a certain nobility,
however cluttered their physical and emotional surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, ambiguity creeps in. Toward the end, we see a planned
community, San Diego-style--except it's going up in Tijuana. An
aghast tercer mundista expert likens it to a mausoleum, but then
asks: Can he blame folks for wanting the comfort of the sort he
enjoys on the affluent side of the jagged fence?</TE>
<TE>   The film features lots of talking heads, but it never drags one
down in the torturous manner, say, of those lugubrious docs from the
brothers Burns. The quick cutting, unconventional camera angles, hip
nortec score and aerial shots impart an MTV edge that can be
distracting, but it all keeps the pace brisk.</TE>
<TE>   Check it out. You may not want to pick up stakes for the nearest
colonia or favela, but you might re-think facile assumptions about
life in differing environments. The human condition, alas, is fraught
with a certain inherent disarray, despite our efforts to impose
order.</TE>

<LD>   So Much for the Search: Durst Misses Borland</LD>
<LD>   After a much-publicized national tour to find a replacement for
guitarist Wes Borland, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst is nostalgic
for the old days. So much so that, on Friday, he posted Borland's
e-mail address on the group's Web site, asking fans to plead with the
face-painted musician to "come back to the family."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Durst reported that "Borland has received your e-mails
and has responded negatively." But that's no reason to give up, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Borland replied by saying that 75% of all his e-mails were
telling him to never be with Limp Bizkit," Durst said. "I'm glad some
of you feel that way, but we don't--and we're not fair-weather
friends. We love Wes and have done so through our good and bad
times."</TE>
<TE>   Borland, considered key to the band's sound and creative output,
left Limp Bizkit in October after seven years and three albums. The
rap-rock group is continuing on its follow-up to "Chocolate Starfish
and the Hot Dog Flavored Water" released in 2000. It has narrowed its
search for a replacement to four finalists.</TE>

<TE>   Russell Crowe Tops Poll of Biography Readers</TE>
<TE>   During precarious political times when heroism is at a premium,
readers of Biography magazine have voted the tough, pull-no-punches
Russell Crowe --star of such films as "A Beautiful Mind," "Gladiator"
and "The Insider"--as their favorite Oscar-winning actor of all time.</TE>
<TE>   As reported in the June issue of the publication, the 37-year-old
New Zealand native rose above 73 years worth of formidable
competition, including Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, to whom he
has been compared. Nearly 4,000 readers weighed in online and through
mail.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe was followed, in order, by Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hanks, John
Wayne, James Stewart, Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino, Nicolas Cage, De Niro
and Paul Newman.</TE>

<TE>   Berlin Opera House a Danger, Conductor Says</TE>
<TE>   Four days after the collapse of an aged hydraulic stage lift
during a performance of Mozart's "Don Giovanni," conductor Daniel
Barenboim complained that the crumbling condition of Berlin's
venerable Staatsoper opera house increasingly poses a danger to
performers and the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is an illness that no one wants to notice,"
Barenboim, the opera's artistic director since 1992, said at a news
conference. "It could be too late by the time the doctor is called."</TE>
<TE>   Though no one was injured in the accident, parts of the theater
decor came down and the performance was delayed for 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Barenboim called for the urgent release of funds to restore the
opera house, an 18th century building that was reopened by East
German authorities in 1955 after being gutted at the end of World War
II. It was last renovated in 1986. The opera management reportedly
estimates that $91.7 million is needed to carry out repairs that
would fulfill modern safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds Passing Up Turner for McCartney</TE>
<TE>   At Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery, 74 canvases by Paul McCartney
hang next door to an exhibit of works by Joseph Mallord William
Turner (1775-1851). A 1993 oil "Frisbee on the Beach" and other
pieces by the former Beatle are far outdrawing Turner's watercolors,
engravings and paintings.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, only one young woman took the time to inspect
the Turners, as near pandemonium reigned nearby as camera crews and
crowds awaited the arrival of McCartney. One British radio reporter
explained the imbalance this way: "Unfortunately, Turner's dead and
he didn't make any records."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney said he and John Lennon hung around the galleries in the
1960s, "probably sagging off" school. "If I had said to John then,
'I'm going to have an exhibition here one day,' I think I know what
he'd have said."</TE>
<TE>   His work didn't impress Bryan Biggs, director of Liverpool's
Bluecoat Arts Centre. He told the Guardian newspaper: "If a student
came to the Walker gallery with this show, he or she would be shown
the door."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Director Chris Columbus will not take over the reins of "Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the third installment in the
series, Variety reports. Top contender for the job is said to be
Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien" and " A Little Princess")....
Sylvester Stallone's wife, Jennifer Flavin Stallone, gave birth to
the couple's third child, Scarlet Rose, on Saturday.... For its first
acquisition, Vivendi Universal's new specialty label Focus has bought
U.S. and certain international distribution rights to Roman
Polanski's "The Pianist"--winner of this year's Palme d'Or at the
Cannes Film Festival, Variety reports....Singer Nate Dogg was
sentenced to one year of probation in Kingman, Ariz., after pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession....Meg Ryan
will play boxing manager Jackie Kallen in "Against the Ropes," which
will co-star "ER's" Omar Epps and be directed by Charles
Dutton....After 12 years and three studio albums, Courtney Love and
guitarist Eric Erlandson have announced the demise of Hole, the band
they founded together.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cornershop mixed up an East-meets-West sonic cocktail on Monday
during its El Rey Theatre performance, shaking soul, Indian pop, glam
rock, R&amp;B, dub reggae, electronica and funk into exuberant,
envelope-pushing music that was as multihued as the audience of
international bright young things.</LD>
<LD>   Led by singer-songwriter-guitarist Tjinder Singh and guitarist Ben
Ayres, the London sextet crafted a laid-back, propulsive groove with
bass, percussion, sitar and drums, drawing selections from its
acclaimed new album "Handcream for a Generation" and earlier
collections. Sung mostly in English, but occasionally in Punjabi, the
tunes percolated with an introverted intensity that gradually licked
tendrils from the stage, enveloping the crowd by the closing notes of
the epic psychedelic antiwar number "Spectral Mornings."</LD>
<LD>   Singh was poker-faced, almost dour, for much of the 80-minute set,
but he may have just been concentrating on keeping up with all the
recorded parts. It was a bit absurd that apparently not one of his
bandmates could handle such challenging backing vocals as "oooh,
oooh, yeah, yeah," but the taped bits ultimately didn't undermine the
show.</LD>
<TE>   A Punjabi rendition of the Beatles' "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has
Flown)" wryly underscored the band's debt to the old school. But
Cornershop hardly came off as some 21st century Fabs update, nor even
the next-generation Oasis. Stirring in a social conscience and
endless sly pop-culture references, Singh and company variously
evoked Booker T., the Velvet Underground, T. Rex and countless other
acts, yet proved aggressively original. Not to mention tons o' fun.</TE>

<HD>Director Focuses on Tenor of Opera Acting</HD>
<DH>Music* Baz Luhrmann brings his energetic style to a master
class for singers, urging them to think believability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM SMITH</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>TAKOMA PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>"Think of the moment," the director says to his young cast.
"And--action!"</LD>
<LD>   But this isn't a sound stage, and there are no big cameras
rolling. The action unfolds instead in a large, mostly bare rehearsal
room at the Washington Opera Studio here.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Vilar/Domingo Young Artists Program are being put
through their paces by Baz Luhrmann, the Australian director whose
films include "Strictly Ballroom" and a nominee for the 2001 best
picture Oscar, "Moulin Rouge."</LD>
<TE>   This master class on acting is the kind of starry venture you
might expect in the inaugural season of the Opera Studio, funded by a
$5-million grant from mega-philanthropist Alberto Vilar. Washington
Opera artistic director and superstar tenor Placido Domingo selected
11 singers and two pianist/coaches. Those here today get to sample
the energetic, amiable Luhrmann's combination of old sayings ("The
future is in your hands") and almost maniacal analysis of words and
gestures.</TE>
<TE>   Looking like one of the Bee Gees in his casual-chic black suit and
unruly mop of blond/gray hair, Luhrmann forces the singers to think
about each move in scenes from Puccini's "La Boheme," an opera
particularly associated with him.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, he staged a remarkably appealing production of it for the
Australian Opera, with the action updated to 1957; a film of it was
broadcast on TV in this country. Come December, Luhrmann's "Boheme"
is due to hit Broadway, where it will be presented like a traditional
musical in daily performances.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't not be deeply affected by 'Boheme,'" Luhrmann, 39, says
before plunging into the master class. "Living for the moment,
falling in love at an impossible pace--we've all done it."</TE>
<TE>   Touching an audience, especially those who "have a fear of the
grand temples of opera," is the goal of Luhrmann's art--and this
class.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience I love above all is where true life and true drama
were on stage, united with the music, and you could hear a pin drop,"
he says. "Imagine if we could do that every day. I think we owe folks
that. You cannot get casual about this mission. If you deliver that
magic, they'll follow you forever."</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann then tried to unleash some of that magic within the
confines of the rehearsal studio. He had one advantage going into the
class: Today's opera world may not boast voices of golden-age
caliber, but most vocalists now--including the Washington Opera
Studio members who got a chance to work with Luhrmann--could act
rings around the stand-and-sing types of old. Still, Luhrmann wants a
lot more from them.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Wolff, a 22-year-old tenor from Virginia, and baritone
Hung Yun, 32, from Korea, go through the opening duet of Act 4, as
the director watches intently through nearly squinted eyes. Then he
pounces.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you saying?" he asks both men. Haltingly, they translate
their lines into English. Luhrmann still isn't satisfied. He asks Yun
to switch to his native tongue and speak the whole scene. Suddenly,
the baritone is communicating more deeply, as if he means every word.</TE>
<TE>   "When it is in Italian, it has to be the same," Luhrmann says.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the opening scene of Act 3, the director works on one of
Yun's gestures--pointing out to a shivering Mimi the painting that
the baritone's character, Marcello, has done. Yun keeps walking away
from Mimi (soprano Eugenia Garza, 26, from Mexico) and spreading his
arm wide, a stereotypical operatic motion Luhrmann won't abide.</TE>
<TE>   He urges Yun to tone things down, to keep his focus on Mimi, and
not play to the balcony.</TE>
<TE>   "If you believe what you're saying, don't add things on top of
it," the director says.</TE>
<TE>   Each time a singer follows his advice, the thrice-familiar
snippets of "Boheme" come to life in surprisingly effective ways.</TE>
<TE>   The last singer up is Valeriano Lanchas, a 25-year-old bass from
Colombia, who has clearly been absorbing the class. As he sings the
Act 4 "Coat Aria," he keeps his movements to a minimum, internalizing
the music.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a moment there when I believed it," Luhrmann says,
before continuing the process of digging for still more nuance, more
truth.</TE>

<HD>Dave Attell Livens Up Whee! Hours</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After midnight, Dave Attell lets it all hang out. He drinks. He
smokes. He debauches in every conceivable way. And just to keep
things interesting, he does it in a different city every week.</LD>
<LD>   So it is that "Insomniac With Dave Attell" has traveled the U.S.
for two seasons, offering what its theme song calls "a late-night
freak-show jubilee" Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. Quite
simply, it's foulmouthed, sophomoric, tawdry--and incredibly fun,
combining the elements of travelogue (think a lowbrow Michael Palin),
documentary (think Studs Terkel's "Working") and boys' or girls'
night out (think Saturdays in your 20s).</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's show, shot in Kansas City and one of 10 first-season
episodes being repeated, is a prime example of how so many things
that are just plain wrong can feel so right. Attell, a balding,
paunchy comic whose voice is hoarsened by booze, cigarettes and lack
of sleep, starts each half-hour show by ending his stand-up routine
at a club.</LD>
<TE>   By 11:29 p.m. K.C. time, Attell has taken us to the Isle of Capri
riverboat casino for some one-armed banditry. At 12:10 a.m., we're in
a limo driven by a gentleman named Wayne, soon to be joined by two
strippers from Bazooka's Showgirls. Lap dances and terribly
politically incorrect jokes ensue.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, we're out of the limo, doing what Attell does best: cruising
the bars, wandering the streets, interviewing the flotsam and jetsam
that's out at 1:27 a.m. (a phallic-themed bridal party).</TE>
<TE>   The random encounters with those at play give way to Attell's
exploration of those at work: the bounty hunters at Ace in the Hole
Bail Bonds, a convenience store clerk, and the guys in the Kansas
City Star pressroom.</TE>
<TE>   The show goes on until the sun rises. And the best part of it all?
The arrestingly drunk and disorderly conduct doesn't leave you with a
hangover.</TE>

<HD>A Mystery Revisited</HD>
<DH>A building that figured in the unsolved death of actress
Thelma Todd is for sale</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They found actress Thelma Todd's lifeless body on the morning of Dec.
16, 1935, slumped over in the front seat of her chocolate-colored
1934 Lincoln Phaeton convertible, her car parked in a two-car garage
near her married lover's brooding cliff-side mansion in Pacific
Palisades.</LD>
<LD>   She was dressed in a mauve and silver evening gown, expensive mink
wrap and adorned with a small fortune in jewelry, after attending a
party in her honor into the wee hours of the morning with her
Hollywood friends at the famed Trocadero nightclub on Sunset
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The death of the blond, wisecracking comedian dubbed "Hot Toddy"
who had appeared in more than 40 films, including "Horse Feathers"
and "Monkey Business" opposite the Marx Brothers, would unleash a
media frenzy rivaling the O.J. Simpson case six decades later and
spawn endless theories over what led to the 30-year-old starlet's
untimely demise.</LD>
<TE>   Now, a piece of this Raymond Chandler-like mystery is up for sale,
and, from the looks of it, the public's appetite for the
long-simmering Hollywood scandal has not abated.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the hill from the death scene in the Castellammare
section of Pacific Palisades, a sprawling, three-tiered Spanish-style
building that housed Todd's swank ocean-view apartment in the 1930s
went on the market this month for the first time in decades. The
asking price: $4.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The salesman handling the property said he has been deluged with
phone calls from prospective buyers, many of them local residents,
who are entranced as much by Todd lore as they are by the rare
opportunity of buying a prime piece of commercially zoned real estate
on Pacific Coast Highway that goes for $300 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day my sign went up, I had 75 phone calls within six
hours," recalled Rene Soto of Les Small &amp; Co., a real estate
consulting firm in Century City. "I'm averaging about 50 calls a
day."</TE>
<TE>   Soto noted that prospective buyers are not just asking him about
the building, they want to hear the Thelma Todd saga. Like other
scandals from Hollywood's early days, from "Fatty" Arbuckle to
William Desmond Taylor, the strange death of Todd was a tale filled
with glamour, intrigue and enough colorful characters to populate a
novel.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, authors, film buffs and local residents vigorously
debate what happened that fateful night as they try to fill in the
blanks around this dark chapter in Hollywood history. At the time,
her death was a nationwide sensation. "Body of Thelma Todd Found in
Death Riddle," read the front-page headline in the Los Angeles Times.
Her mysterious death has been a cause for speculation ever since:</TE>
<TE>   * Was she murdered by her business partner and sometime lover, a
fading screen director and producer named Roland West?</TE>
<TE>   * Was she followed home from the Trocadero that night by her
abusive ex-husband, Pat De Cicco?</TE>
<TE>   * Did gangland boss Charles "Lucky" Luciano order his boys to rub
her out after she allegedly balked at allowing casino gambling above
her restaurant?</TE>
<TE>   Or, was it all just a tragic accident?</TE>
<TE>   The three-story, 15,000-square-foot building in which Todd once
lived is only a pedestrian bridge away from the beach at 17575
Pacific Coast Highway--a familiar sight to thousands of motorists who
zip along daily between Santa Monica and Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Using the actress' fame as a draw, West and Todd opened a popular
restaurant on the ground floor of the building called Thelma Todd's
Sidewalk Cafe. One floor up was their private nightclub named Joya's,
which played host to Hollywood's rich and famous. Given its flashy
history, then, it is no small irony that today the building is owned
by a religiously oriented motion picture and television production
company called Paulist Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in the 1960s by a much-beloved Catholic priest, the late
Father Ellwood E. "Bud" Kieser, Paulist Productions came to
prominence in Hollywood for its award-winning television series
"Insight."</TE>
<TE>   How the production company acquired the property has a Todd
connection. The owner, Lola Lane of the singing Lane sisters, had
married Roland West and inherited the building after his death in
1952. She remarried and, after converting to Catholicism, she and her
husband met Kieser and were so impressed that they invited him to set
up shop on the ground floor of their large residence. The property
was later deeded to Paulist Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Today, officials at Paulist Productions say it just doesn't make
sense for the production company not to utilize the money that can be
realized from selling the property. "This is an asset," said Father
Frank Desiderio, a Catholic priest who heads Paulist Productions,
"and we've been sitting on it rather than putting it to work."</TE>
<TE>   Just touring the building is nostalgic. Desiderio points to a
frayed menu from Todd's eatery that is framed and mounted on his
office wall. Among the menu offerings: Gin Fizz--35 cents, Thelma
Todd Knockout--$1, Thelma Todd Milk Punch (gin base)--45 cents, and a
Thelma Todd Rickey--45 cents. "A hot weather suggestion."</TE>
<TE>   The current lobby of Paulist Productions is reached by ascending a
grand staircase, and up a small, winding stairway is a
hexagon-shaped, third-floor ballroom that in Todd's heyday had a
dance floor and bandstand but now serves as living quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Because the building has such a rich history, Father Desiderio has
become well-versed in the Todd mystery, although he does not hold
himself out as an expert on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a magnet," he said. "She would bring people in. She was a
huge star. But because she also liked to go out, there were some
nights she wasn't here, which would drive Roland West up the wall. He
would say, 'You're my moneymaker, and if you're not here, I'm not
making money.'"</TE>
<TE>   Desiderio then leads a visitor along a dirt path behind the
property to the old West mansion, still as stately and
ominous-looking as ever. The garage in which Todd died is still here
too. On the night before her death, Todd had gone to the Trocadero,
where a party in her honor was thrown by British actor Stanley
Lupino, the father of then-ingenue Ida Lupino, who was one of Todd's
close friends. Along with the Lupinos, other guests that night
included theater mogul Sid Grauman, movie choreographer Arthur Prince
and theatrical agent Al Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   Todd left the Trocadero about 3 a.m. in a car driven by a
chauffeur, arriving at the cafe about 3:45 a.m. Police theorized that
after the chauffeur left, she discovered the door to the cafe locked
and walked up a long flight of steps to West's house. But some of
those familiar with the case challenge the notion that Todd, who had
recently been diagnosed with a heart ailment, would have walked up
the steep flight of steps to West's garage.</TE>
<TE>   She could have gone into the garage, located at 17531 Posetano
Road, climbed into her car, and turned on the ignition to warm
herself from the cold wind that blew over the Palisades that night,
authorities speculated. But critics of the police version note that
she was a bright, former schoolteacher and would have been well aware
of the dangers of carbon monoxide.</TE>
<TE>   Her maid, Mae Whitehead, discovered the body. Todd's skin was
crimson, a telltale sign of carbon monoxide poisoning. The coroner
believed that coagulated blood found around her face, on her dress
and inside the car had been caused when her head struck the steering
wheel. There was no sign of a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Young, a local historian who interviewed Castellammare
residents who were around in the mid-'30s, said he believes the
actress was murdered by her sometime lover, West, who then covered up
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the gentleman who was a service station operator and
jack-of-all-trades in the Palisades," Young said. "He was the first
one on the scene before the police came. He saw she was hit in the
head. He said there was a lot of blood on her. She had not fallen on
the steering wheel and hit her head. She was in the passenger seat
and was kind of leaning over."</TE>
<TE>   Film historian Marc Wanamaker, who knew the late Hollywood
producer Hal Roach, a close friend of Todd's in the early days of
Hollywood, posits the theory that Todd wasn't murdered, but that West
was responsible for her death.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe, and Roach confirmed, that she went out to this party
on Saturday night," Wanamaker said. "Upon leaving the house to go to
the party, there was an argument between her and Roland West [that
she be back by 2 a.m.]. ... When she came back around 4 in the
morning, he wouldn't let her into the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe West ran after her down there, she turned on the
ignition, and he shut the door to the garage so she wouldn't leave,"
Wanamaker added. "I don't believe he knew what carbon monoxide was.
It wasn't suicide or murder. It was manslaughter on his part."</TE>
<TE>   No arrests were ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tantalizing story behind the building, locals don't
want to see the stylish building on Pacific Coast Highway where Todd
lived and played fall victim to the bulldozer once it is sold.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody buys it and wants to tear it down, we would fight and
have it 'landmarked,'" said Lorraine Oshins, president of the Pacific
Palisades Historical Society. As for the Todd case, the mystery shows
no sign of evaporating.</TE>
<TE>   Young noted that mystery writer Raymond Chandler had lived in the
Palisades and knew the Todd story and the terrain well. "He took a
lot of what was out here," Young said, "and wrote them into his
novels."</TE>

<LD>One never hears of cherry gluts. Apples, yes. Citrus, also. There can
even be too many pears. But cherries? Smack dab in the middle of
cherry season, bang in cherry country, there are never more cherries
than takers. Cherry trees are such finicky plants, the fruit are so
tricky to pick and, once plucked, so very perishable, that cherry
season is like no other--more fleeting than summer, as compelling as
a perfectly sunny day.</LD>
<LD>   Sweet cherry season, that is. It is best, here, to draw a veil
over the sour cherry industry of Michigan, in which the entire crop
is strangely brutalized by processors before sweetening and dying
beyond recognition. If those cherries are sour, they have good
reason. But this is about the only true cherries sold in the United
States, fresh sweet cherries, and, whee, almost all of these come
from the West Coast, where the season starts in California.</LD>
<LD>   It unfolds in three distinct stages, the first being jealous
disapproval. Teeth start grinding in mid-May when the first cherries
from the Central Valley are packed up and sent to the Far East. As
the critics have it, these cherries are picked too early and lack
flavor. The B-side of that particular gripe is that our best fruit
goes abroad.</LD>
<TE>   But by the last week of May, local cherries are more than a rumor.
They're in the farmers markets. At worst, they're good. At best,
they're superb.</TE>
<TE>   The early ones will be a touch tart. These are an acquired taste,
argues Fresno area cherry farmer John Hurley. They're a relatively
new, early harvest variety called Brooks: heart-shaped as a
Valentine, crisp on the tongue, with good sweetness but a distinct
acidic fillip. Ripe enough, they can turn a deep red, but most are
lighter, more garnet-colored. "I tell people they're not just sweet,
that they have character," says Hurley.</TE>
<TE>   At markets around Los Angeles last week, Hurley was also selling
blushing yellow and pink Rainiers, which he hopes to keep in his
Summer Harvest stalls at farmers markets in Santa Monica, Calabasas,
Studio City and Beverly Hills through much of June. These are also
tart and firm, what cherry farmers call "crunchy." By mid-June, the
cherry supply will swell suddenly as other growers bring the main
season cherry, the big red Bing.</TE>
<TE>   There are hundreds of cherry varieties, including Garnets,
Tartarians, Chinooks, Burlats, Lamberts, Vans, Black Republicans and
so on. But Bing is the most popular sweet cherry in the United States
for two reasons: It's an intense mahogany red, and it's explosively
sweet. Make that one reason: It's delicious.</TE>
<TE>   Effete horticulturalists will always attempt to best the Bing with
some exotic cherry that only they have tasted, served by nymphs, with
harps playing. But for commoners, the Bing offers its own rapture, as
sweet and perfectly tart as jam, and, here's the trick, zingily
fresh. Cruelly, Bings disappear from farmers markets at the end of
June, but there is a reprieve. California is revived by a third
season, in supermarkets, when Bings from Oregon and Washington
replace exhausted local stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the longest season in the country, Californians
could always eat more cherries. UC Davis farm advisor Steve Southwick
explains why supply never exceeds demand. Cherries are extremely
tricky to grow. "If it's not been cold enough in the winter, the
trees don't make flowers properly," he says. "Wind can be a big
problem. It can scar the fruit and mark the fruit. Then, during
bloom, if it rains and it's cold, that's no good. Most cherries
require cross pollination. The honey bees might not fly."</TE>
<TE>   Even with clear flying conditions, the pollinating trees, which
must be a different variety from the fruit-making ones, have a
troublesome habit of flowering at the wrong time. Then there are
viruses, fungi and, heaven forfend, sudden heat waves that can ripen
the crop too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   But the most persistent threat during harvest is rain. Last week
in the Central Valley, cherry farmers hired helicopters to fly low
over their orchards in an attempt to blow rain off trees soaked by a
wave of late spring storms. The worry was that the cherries would
absorb the water through their skin, and then burst on the bough.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes about four to five hours of a good steady rain, then
kaboom. You can hear them popping on the trees," says John Fellman, a
post-harvest physiologist at Washington State University. "Everybody
hates that sound."</TE>
<TE>   Every five years, crops are wiped out, he says. This year,
California squeaked by without many losses. Moreover, a cool year has
produced "gorgeous cherries," according to Jim Culbertson, manager of
the California Cherry Advisory Board. Cool equals slow ripening, he
says, the best conditions for good fruit size and intense flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Having saved all those gorgeous cherries, farmers now have to pick
them. The term "cherry picking" did not come to connote extravagant
care by accident. Sweet cherries bruise and cannot be mechanically
harvested. Ripe cherries bruise the most easily, but this is the only
time to pick them, says Elizabeth Mitcham, a post-harvest
physiologist from UC Davis. "With cherries the best quality is going
to be there at the time of harvest," she says. "They don't continue
sweetening after harvest."</TE>
<TE>   So farmers go out with ladders and pails, much the way they have
for thousands of years, and hand-pick their cherries. During World
War II, when labor was scarce, cherry farmers opened their ranches to
the pick-your-own trade. In Southern California, this has become
tradition at Mile High Ranch in Beaumont, so the farmers keep the
trees pruned low, about 14 feet high, says Magdalena Humphrey.
Insurance company rules mean only professional pickers get to go up
ladders. All the better for eating while you work. Mile High Ranch
charges $10 to fill a 5-pound pail--a bargain says Humphrey,
"considering they can munch on cherries all the while."</TE>
<TE>   Those planning a family outing should not be surprised by the
sounds of cannons firing in cherry country. These will be
bird-scaring devices, along with balloons shaped like eyes and
plastic snakes in trees. They don't fool smart birds, says John
Fellman. "One of my most vivid memories is of watching a magpie eat
cherries while sitting on top of a cannon that was reporting every
five minutes," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If birds and pickers get the freshest cherries, Mitcham offers
this advice for shoppers in towns: Look for shiny skin and dark
color. The glossiness is natural she says, and a good sign. In
Rainiers, the pale background should be yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Rancher Hurley warns shoppers at farmers markets to watch out for
stalls selling an overabundance of cherries with "spurs," a flaw
where a second seed protrudes near the stem, or "doubles," which are
Siamese twin-type cherries with two fruit for one stem. This is
natural--every crop will have some; it happens when a bud is
heat-shocked. But if you encounter all spurs, the chances are good
that the "farmer" is really a peddler and selling packing house
culls, the rejects set aside by packers. "What's allowed at farmers
markets is a 'field run' of fruit, so you get the good and the bad
and we're able to sell everything," says Hurley.</TE>
<TE>   Once you get cherries home, if you get them home without devouring
them, Mitcham recommends getting them straight into a sealed bag in
the refrigerator on a cold shelf as close to 32 degrees as possible.
By all means wash and dry them, but don't soak them. The cherries'
permeable skin not only lets in water, it lets out precious acids
responsible for their tantalizing tartness.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there is a certain type of acid," warns Fellman, "the
cherry becomes the famous dog's nose. It's cold and wet but not much
else."</TE>
<TE>   The whole point of cherries is that intense burst of sour sweet
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Olson's family has been growing cherries in the Santa
Clara Valley in Northern California since 1899. The most passionate
cherry aficionados will tell you that the ocean cool that seeps in
from the San Francisco Bay and envelops orchards at night make it the
best cherry growing territory in the country. Olson's family sells
cherries from a stall, local fruit in season, South American imports
in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   She's seen customers feed their children their first cherries and
she's sold cherries to hospice nurses in search of a final pleasure
for the lips of a dying patient. One of her fondest childhood
memories was accompanying her father to the train station to send
"fancy packs" of cherries on trains to New York, where her family's
cherries, she says, always got the best prices. "There's no other
fruit like a cherry," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Given the persistent rarity of cherries, the poignancy of the
memories they evoke, the longing that they inspire and the prices
they fetch ($4 to $5 a pound), it is hardly surprising that we do not
cook them much. The late English fruit connoisseur Edward Bunyard
said of his favorite cherry, the Duke, "to cook it were a vandalism."
Even French pastry chefs set aside their dough scrapers and list
"bowl of cherries" on their dessert menus every summer. Olson hopes
that the same tradition will catch on here.</TE>
<TE>   But she takes exception to the idea that "pie cherries," the
Michigan sour cherries processed into canned fillings, are superior
to her sweet cherry pies. And a person who finds themselves with a
large sack of sweet cherries, enough to spare for the kitchen, is in
for a treat, she reckons. "I've always made Bing cherry pie. Always.
When I was growing up, I didn't realize that there were such things
as tart cherries. I think the pie I make is sensational," she says.
"I'll put my pie up against any tart cherry pie any day."</TE>

<TE>   Jeremy Lee is the head chef at the Blue Print Cafe in London and a
contributing editor to Saveur magazine. He loves summer fruit. In
this recipe, a heap of cherries is shown the pan just long enough to
become a sort of instant jam. This is then ladled over intensely
buttery pastry, topped with sour cream and almonds, sealed, baked and
called "smetannik" or Russian sour cream pie. Lee got the idea from
Darra Goldstein's book "Taste of Russia: A Cookbook of Russian
Hospitality." It is aromatic rather than sweet, a perfect summer
dessert to serve with a chilled Brouilly.</TE>
<TE>   PASTRY</TE>
<TE>   1 1/3 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   Combine the flour, salt and lemon zest in a bowl. Add the butter
and blend in using a pastry blender or 2 knives, working the
ingredients to a coarse meal. Add the egg yolks, kneading in the bowl
until the dough holds together and becomes smooth. (The dough can
also be made in a food processor.) Cut the pastry in half, wrap both
halves in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   1 pound cherries</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 cup blanched whole almonds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sour cream</TE>
<TE>   1 egg yolk</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   Flour, for rolling</TE>
<TE>   Pit the cherries, catching the juice.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the cherries, the juice and 1/4 cup of sugar in a
saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring, then reduce the heat
to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until the cherries have
softened and a syrup has formed, about 10 minutes. Do not let burn.
Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly chop the almonds and place them in a large bowl. Add the
sour cream, egg yolk, cinnamon and almond extract, then fold in the
cherries.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out one pastry half on a lightly floured surface to fit a
9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Spoon in the cherry mixture,
then cover it with the sour cream and nut mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out the remaining pastry slightly larger than the tart pan,
so it overlaps about an inch, and cover the pie. Trim the pastry
edges and pinch to seal. Sprinkle the remaining teaspoon of sugar
over the top. Cut 3 or 4 slits in the top of the pie.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the pie until the top is golden, 45 minutes. Serve warm.</TE>

<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   *Edon Waycott makes the preserves for Campanile restaurant using
local fruit. Last year her strawberry jam made the Food section's 10
best recipes' list. At $5 a pound, the best cherries can be too
expensive to put into the jam pot, she says. She offers this recipe
in which the cherries remain teasing and fresh "just sitting on top
of that chocolate."</TE>
<TE>   CRUST</TE>
<TE>   Butter, for preparing pan</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup whole unpeeled almonds</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons milk</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan
with a removable bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Finely grind the almonds in a food processor. Place the almonds on
a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned, 10
minutes. Remove and cool. Return the nuts to the food processor and
add the flour, salt and sugar. Pulse to combine. Cut the butter into
small pieces and add to the flour mixture, processing until the
ingredients resemble a coarse meal. Add the milk and almond extract
and pulse until the dough comes together.</TE>
<TE>   Turn the dough into the pan and press evenly over the bottom and
sides of the pan with floured fingers or a piece of plastic wrap.
Leave the oven at the same temperature and bake until the entire
crust is lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes. (This will be all the
cooking the crust gets, so err on the side of done-ness.) If the
crust puffs up during baking, gently press it down with the back of a
fork. Cool slightly. (The crust can be made a day head and held at
room temperature, or tightly wrapped and frozen for two weeks.)</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   6 ounces fine semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>

<TE>   De Pomiane's Country Tart</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No voice from the kitchen was more trusted or beloved in 1960s
Europe than that of Edouard de Pomiane. Radio broadcasts from Paris
found their way into English kitchens in the delightful 1961 book
"Cooking with Pomiane." In the book, cherry pies were a recurring
theme, every recipe offered with the instruction that the cherries be
pitted with "a new metal hairpin." But the tart that de Pomiane
evoked most richly was a country tart, handed down from the 1860s.
This dish was probably conceived with sour cherries, Montmorency
types or Morellos in mind, but it bakes fine with sweet ones, and the
flowing juices demand a large dollop of vanilla ice cream or fresh
cream. (Very sweet cherries will require less sugar, tart ones a bit
more.) De Pomiane describes having discovered the recipe from a lady
who made tarts whenever she baked bread and who made the crust by
cutting bread dough with lard. He recommended getting a half-pound of
fresh dough from a local baker and kneading in 3 ounces of butter. We
asked Edon Waycott to supply this recipe for a leavened pie shell fit
to absorb the flowing cherry juices.</TE>
<TE>   PASTRY</TE>
<TE>   1 (1/4-ounce) packet active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup warm water</TE>
<TE>   2 cups flour, plus more for rolling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into
tablespoon-sized pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   Stir the yeast and the sugar into the warm water. Let sit until
bubbly, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, combine the 2 cups of flour and the salt in a food
processor; cut in the butter until the mixture resembles a coarse
meal. Add the yeast mixture and the yolks. Process just until the
mixture forms a ball. Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Knead
the dough until supple and an indention with a finger springs back, 3
to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the dough with flour. Let rest for 10 minutes.
Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Transfer the dough to
the plate and flute the edges.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 pounds cherries</TE>
<TE>   1/4 to 3/4 cup sugar (depending on sweetness of cherries), plus
more for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Pit the cherries, reserving the juice. Place half of the cherries
in the shell and sprinkle them with half of the sugar and add the
cherry juice. Add the rest of the cherries and top with the remaining
sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the pie until the cherries darken, the juice is bubbling and
the crust is browned, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve hot. The juices will
run from the pie and hot cherries will "burst" when you serve it. De
Pomiane advises sprinkling more sugar to taste on top.</TE>

<HD>The Best Devices for Getting Rid of the Pits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTY HEDGES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only thing you can gripe about with a cherry is the pit. You've
got to get rid of that thing. Fortunately, someone invented the
cherry pitter. Unfortunately, there are at least eight different
models. So we set out to discover which one is best.</LD>
<LD>   After three days, five pies and 12 pounds of cherries, we had a
clear winner--and it was one of the least-expensive models we tried.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, all cherry pitters use the same simple mechanism: The
cherry is positioned in a cradle, then pierced by a rod that pushes
out the pit. The best pitters maintain the integrity of the cherry:
The pit is removed cleanly and the cherry stays whole.</LD>
<TE>   Six of the pitters we tried were hand-held gadgets that press out
the pits one at a time. Two were box models that sit on the
countertop and let you feed in handfuls of cherries, then push them
through a funnel and press out the pit with a pump action.</TE>
<TE>   The box models seemed appealing at first--they were quicker and
neater, since the pits dropped right into a container. But one of
them--the Westmark ($39.65, at Surfas)--was so unstable that the top
would not stay in place as it was used. The other model--the Leifheit
Cherrymat ($39.95, at Sur La Table)--worked much better. It was the
fastest way to pit cherries, but it did tend to mangle them in the
process. (Split or torn cherries are no problem with something like
jam, but would ruin a tart or open-faced pie.) There were other
problems too: some pits dropped into the bowl along with the pitted
cherries. Worse, when we served our pies, we discovered many cherries
had slipped through the funnel unpitted.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the test kitchen agreed that hand-held pitters were
the way to go--you could be certain every cherry is pitted, and they
didn't take much longer to use than the box models.</TE>
<TE>   But not all hand-helds are created equal. We quickly eliminated
four of them. One didn't have a spring mechanism in the grip, which
made it difficult to manage and time-consuming. The handle on another
was so wide that you couldn't use it without feeling as if you were
using a grip strengthener. Some were made with flimsy materials and
destined to a short life, others left the fruit looking broken and
battered.</TE>
<TE>   The Deluxe Cherry Pitter by Norpro ($10.25, at Surfas) had a
comfortable grip and worked well. Its one drawback: The pit didn't
always drop through the opening in the cradle, and pulling it out
slowed us down.</TE>
<TE>   The Leifheit Chrome Cherry Pitter had none of these problems. It
is a sturdy little pitter, with a comfortable handle and a thumb
indentation that lets you get a firm grip. It reliably removed the
pit every time, and left every cherry whole, without any part of the
fruit wasted or torn. It was easy to clean, convenient to store in
the gadget drawer and inexpensive ($11.95 at Crate and Barrel, $12.50
at Sur La Table and Williams Sonoma).</TE>
<TE>   In the end, we had nothing to gripe about at all.</TE>

<HD>Rice-Impaired? Try This Foolproof Pilaf</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When students of mine grumble that they can't make a good pot of
rice, I suggest they try pilaf. Simple and practically foolproof,
pilaf is a popular side dish because it has a lot more flavor than
steamed or boiled rice.</LD>
<LD>   To prepare pilaf, you briefly saute the rice in oil or butter to
give the grains a toasted flavor and to help keep them separate. Next
you pour in hot broth or seasoned water--two cups for every cup of
rice--and stir once. The rice cooks in a covered pan until it is
tender but not mushy. By then, it has absorbed all the liquid. You
don't need special rice; you can produce excellent pilaf with common
long-grain white rice, and brown rice works well too.</LD>
<LD>   "Do not disturb" is the rule to remember. Resist the temptation to
lift the lid as the rice simmers. Avoid stirring, as that would cause
the grains to stick together. Handle the cooked rice with a light
touch. Use a fork to fluff it and to gently incorporate any last
minute flavorings. Mixing other ingredients in vigorously, especially
with a spoon, would crush the grains to a paste.</LD>
<TE>   To flavor my pilaf, I opt for eastern Mediterranean
accents--garlic, tomatoes, herbs such as thyme, oregano or dill or
spices such as cumin, turmeric, allspice or red pepper. When I want
to prepare a one-pot pilaf entree, I gently add diced cooked meat,
poultry, seafood or legumes. For a Parisian pilaf I include
butter-sauteed mushrooms, and occasionally diced vegetables like
carrots, asparagus or peppers for extra color, taste and nutrition. I
love to garnish my pilaf with plump raisins and toasted almonds to
lend it a festive finish in the grand tradition of the Ottoman
Empire.</TE>

<TE>   Rice Pilaf With Mushrooms and Garlic</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes</TE>
<TE>   If using brown rice, follow the recipe, simmering the rice for 40
minutes. You can refrigerate pilaf for 2 days in a covered container.
It keeps hot for about 30 minutes and reheats well. Warm it uncovered
in a lightly buttered shallow baking dish in a 300-degree oven or
heat it in the microwave.</TE>
<TE>   3 to 4 tablespoons butter, vegetable oil or olive oil</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 ounces mushrooms, halved and cut in thick slices</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black or white pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 to 1 medium onion, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   4 large cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups long-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   3 cups very hot chicken or vegetable broth or water</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 large sprig thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 teaspoons chopped chives or garlic chives or 1 tablespoon
chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   Thyme sprigs, whole chives or garlic chives, for garnish, optional</TE>
<TE>   Melt 1 or 2 tablespoons of butter in a large, deep skillet over
medium heat. Add the mushrooms, sprinkle them lightly with salt and
pepper. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and
keep them warm.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan over
medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until
it is soft but not brown, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and rice
and cook, stirring, until the grains turn milky white and are coated,
about 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the broth, bay leaf, thyme and pepper to taste. Add salt to
taste; if using water or unsalted broth, add 1 teaspoon at this
point. Stir once and cover. Cook over low heat without stirring until
the rice is just tender, about 18 minutes; taste a few grains to
check. Let the rice stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Discard the bay
leaf and thyme sprig. With a fork, fluff the rice lightly and stir in
the mushrooms and chopped chives gently. Taste and adjust the
seasoning. Serve garnished with thyme sprigs or whole chives, if
desired.</TE>

<HD>India Learns to Lighten Up</HD>
<DH>Spa cuisine comes at last to the land of gulab jamun</DH>

<AU>AJAY SINGH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago a BBC radio program in England re-created the meal
that Robert Clive, a trader and part-time British soldier, might have
eaten following his victorious battle against the king of Bengal in
1757. According to an Indian restaurateur, Clive almost surely
feasted like an Indian king, consuming dishes such as biryani (chunks
of goat meat mixed with saffron-streaked rice), chicken do-piyaza
(marinated chicken cooked with a surfeit of onions) and malai chingri
(prawns in coconut cream sauce).</LD>
<LD>   It's also likely, although the restaurateur didn't say so, that
Clive savored the shahi gilaawat ka kebab, an exquisite dumpling once
made only for Indian nobles from no less than 160 ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   Such rich, royal food is common in India today and widely
available around the world. The trouble is that few lovers of Indian
food are blessed with the constitution of a typical 18th century
soldier. Those who eat heartily at the average restaurant serving
Mughlai cuisine in Bombay, London, Tokyo or Los Angeles are likely to
find that they cannot properly digest their meals without a long nap,
especially during the hot summer months.</LD>
<TE>   But not all Indian food is oily, rich and spicy. India has
numerous regional cuisines, and there are huge differences in their
approach to cooking. At the same time, because of the country's
relatively undeveloped restaurant culture, nutritious, low-fat
cooking is generally not practiced outside Indian homes. Not
surprisingly, many Westerners wish Indian cuisine were lighter.</TE>
<TE>   There's good news for those who share that lament. Low-fat cooking
is catching on in Indian restaurants. Led by a handful of Indian
epicures, restaurants catering largely to the upper-middle class are
offering food that's wholesome and light. Even a look at the Internet
confirms this trend. Numerous Indian food Web sites are devoted to
"fat-free" cooking--and even vegan food. One Web site offers recipes
under the headings "The Looking Good Diet" and "The Forever Young
Diet"--topics that nobody would have associated with Indian food just
a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The first Indian restaurant to cater to the modern demand for
low-fat cooking is the Kandahar, named after the ancient Afghan city
that has been much in the news lately. Located in the posh Oberoi
Hotel in Bombay, India's premier city for restaurants, the Kandahar
lends a unique subtlety to the typically coarse cuisine of the
so-called North-Western Frontier Province.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant serves gravies--or "curries," as the British like
to call them--that are lighter, thinner and gentler than the
traditional sort, thanks to a judicious use of double cream and
pastes of cashew and almond. In business circles, the Kandahar is
reputed to be one of the few restaurants in the country where
executives can have lunch and actually get back to work.</TE>
<TE>   The man behind Kandahar's success is Jiggs Kalra, a noted Indian
gastronome, columnist and food consultant. Kalra likes to call
himself a "creator" of dishes rather than a cook, which means that he
never wears an apron or wields a ladle--not even at international
food festivals, where to be seen in chef's attire is an honor.</TE>
<TE>   Kalra is widely believed to have reinvented traditional northern
Indian cuisine. He has brought an authenticity to restaurant fare
that was widely lacking, while also creating menus that satisfy
modern sensibilities. For instance, he is one of the first Indians to
introduce sequential dining--the Western practice of serving a meal
in courses. Indian restaurateurs once considered sequential dining
impossible to achieve for the simple reason that Indian cuisine, with
its emphasis on a medley of curries, does not lend itself naturally
to courses. Kalra got around the problem partly by fusing rustic
Punjabi dishes with sophisticated Western ones.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, not long after the Kandahar unleashed India's low-fat
cooking revolution, the Mandarin Oriental group opened a 100-acre
luxury spa in the Himalayas. Ananda--the name means "bliss" in
Hindi--is the first spa of its kind in India. It has a single
restaurant that specializes in sattvic food, a traditional style of
Indian cooking that is entirely vegetarian, relies on fresh
ingredients only and is balanced in its use of oil and spices.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-day stay at the spa last year, I got a glimpse of
how Indian restaurants are slowly but surely changing the country's
eating habits. One afternoon a teenager walked into the restaurant
and demanded French fries. A few minutes later, to my utter surprise,
the chef walked over to the boy's table and refused to entertain his
order. French fries weren't on the menu--but that wasn't the chef's
reason for denying the guest's request. Any kind of junk food is
strictly taboo at the spa, the chef, Anup Gupta, told me.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he added, "I'm looking forward to the time when I'll be
able to ban gulab jamun," one of India's sweetest, heaviest and most
popular desserts.</TE>

<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons thinly sliced ginger root</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the lentils thoroughly and soak them in 1 1/3 cups of water,
covered, for about 1 hour. (They will probably absorb all the water.)
Transfer the lentils and any remaining water to a heavy-bottomed pot.
Add 11/2 cups of water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce
the heat and simmer until the lentils are soft but not mashed, 20 to
25 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover the pot.</TE>
<TE>   While the lentils cook, heat the oil in another heavy-bottomed pan
over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the onion
and cook until it turns light brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato
and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Drain the lentils and add them along
with the spinach and chile. Add the salt. Stir and cook for 2 minutes
on medium-high heat. Serve hot, garnished with the ginger.</TE>

about 2 to 21/2 hours, stirring thoroughly every 10 minutes or so.
Add the soy sauce and simmer for about 15 more minutes. Turn off the

several hours or overnight. (If the sauce is cooked early in the
morning, it will develop a rich flavor by evening.)</TE>

water, cover the pot and simmer until the peas are soft, about 15
minutes. Add the tofu, sugar and salt and simmer for about 10
minutes. Serve hot.</TE>

<LD>Rich mayonnaise or oily vinaigrettes often make coleslaws heavy. But
this light Japanese-style coleslaw, made with the aromatic shiso
leaf, needs only one teaspoon of oil.</LD>
<LD>   Nappa cabbage, green onions and rice vinegar boost the slaw's
flavor too. And if you pour the dressing over the vegetables just
before serving, the slaw stays crisp.</LD>

Japanese and Asian markets. Cover the leaves with plastic wrap and

<HD>A Small but Lively Scene Takes Root in Chinatown</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Chinatown farmers market, though small in size, draws a
lively crowd even before the official opening bell. Last week, it was
filled with shoppers from local retirees to Silver Lake hipsters to
chefs looking for fresh produce. The market doesn't specialize in
Asian vegetables, but you can find a few like Chinese celery, bitter
melon and Japanese cucumbers.</LD>
<LD>   Tara Thomas, chef and owner of Traxx in nearby Union Station,
stopped at Yang Thao's stand on Thursday to buy fragrant Italian,
purple and lemon basil, which she said she would combine with parsley
and garlic to make a paste for roulades of king salmon. She bought
juicy Gaviota strawberries from Luis Guevara Jr. of Santa Maria to
make strawberry shortcakes with lemon verbena cream.</LD>
<LD>   Harry Nicholas, who has farmed in Orange Cove since 1945, had
irresistibly large, purple-black Garnet cherries with distinctive
short stems and an intense winy flavor. Bings and Rainiers from the
Stockton area are also reaching the market this week.</LD>
<TE>   The market has not offered peaches yet, but this gap should be
filled at Thursday's market when Summer Harvest Farms starts bringing
its excellent organic fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Van Melle-Seaton, a beekeeper, sold wonderfully creamy,
aromatic honey gathered from deerweed, a native plant, in the Angeles
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   In somewhat of a mismatch, Emily Thompson, newly returned to
selling at markets, had few takers of her superb artisanal goat
cheeses. She had labeled all of them in Chinese--including a creamy
fromage blanc, roundels rolled in herbes de Provence and little
buttons with smoked salmon. But cheese, after all, is not traditional
in Chinese culture.</TE>
<TE>   By 6 p.m., the market had noticeably quieted down.</TE>
<TE>   Launched two weeks ago by the local business improvement district,
the market expects to offer more vendors selling Asian produce. By
its official grand opening, June 20, it should feature prepared foods
as well.</TE>

cooking water and the 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan to make a rich
sauce. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. The sauce
should coat the pasta and look silky, but not be soupy. Taste and
season with salt and pepper if needed. Pass additional grated cheese.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I cut out a recipe for trout chowder several years ago but
have misplaced it. It called for steaming the trout so that the bones
and skin could be easily removed. I used this recipe several times
with excellent results.</LD>
<LD>   BRUCE D. MILROY</LD>
<LD>   Cerritos</LD>
<TE>   DEAR BRUCE: This recipe, which came from reader Jenny Erickson,
was published in 1987 in the old My Best Recipe column. She said her
husband loved to catch trout but didn't like to eat them, so she
devised this recipe.</TE>

<TE>   Mammoth Lakes Chowder</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2 cups peeled and cubed baking potatoes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   4 medium trout</TE>
<TE>   2 slices bacon, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   1/2 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 green bell pepper, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 stalk celery, chopped</TE>
<TE>   4 cups scalded milk</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, 5 minutes.
Drain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, steam the trout until the fish turns opaque and the
skin and bones are easy to remove, about 6 minutes. Pull the skin off
from the head to the tail. Remove the center spine and break the meat
into chunks. Place the meat in the bottom of a 2 1/2- to 3-quart
saucepan. Add the potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the bacon slices in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, 2
minutes. Drain on paper towels. Crumble and reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Reheat the bacon drippings over low heat and cook the onion, green
pepper and celery until just tender, but not browned, 10 minutes.
Pour the vegetables over the potatoes and fish. Top with the scalded
milk. Season to taste with salt, 2 pinches of cayenne and black
pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the chowder on low heat just until heated through. Do not
boil. Sprinkle the reserved bacon bits on top.</TE>

<LD>Long Life Foods, a tofu shop in the Galleria market in Koreatown,
makes fresh tofu daily and uses it in a salad that is as soft, silky
and smooth as panna cotta. Slices of tofu are sprinkled with seaweed,
sliced almonds and sesame seeds and accompanied by ponzu sauce and a
spoonful of shredded carrot and cucumber. The shop also makes a soft
tofu soup that comes with a seasoning mixture of soy sauce, sesame
oil, green onion and sesame seeds.</LD>
<LD>   You'll recognize the shop by a sign that says "tofu" in English
and by its logo, an open pod containing a few fat soybeans. English
translations accompany photographs of the dishes.</LD>

<HD>How the Hollywood Bowl Musicians Picnic</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can't decide what to pack for a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl? Just
buy a copy of "The Hollywood Bowl Cookbook: Picnics Under the Stars"
and be ready for the concert season, which starts June 28. The book
contains recipes for appetizers that transport easily, cold soups
that work well for outdoor dinners and main dishes that can be served
hot or cold.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic Affiliates of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Assn. published the book. Along with their own
contributions, members sought recipes from chefs, musicians and Bowl
entertainers. These include Esa-Pekka Salonen's gravlax with mustard
sauce, Itzhak Perlman's chopped chicken livers, Marilyn Horne's
picadillo and Michael Tilson Thomas' Chinese chicken salad.</LD>
<LD>   The late Peggy Lee contributed a picnic extravaganza menu with six
recipes, including smoked turkey, wild rice and three-pepper salads.
Bowl orchestra principal conductor John Mauceri and his wife, Betty,
provided a summer supper menu that includes stuffed chicken breasts
and curried rice salad. And flutist John Galway sent in a summer
picnic menu with cold salmon trout as the main dish.</LD>
<TE>   Three of the 160 recipes are for a Bowl picnic
classic--chicken-in-a-basket. The chicken is baked in a scooped-out
loaf of bread, then wrapped to keep warm until the picnic starts. The
hardcover book ends with a checklist of picnic equipment and
procedures for keeping foods at safe temperatures. Photographs of
program covers from the past introduce the chapters. The cover photo
shows the amphitheater in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bowl-oriented, the book will be useful to anyone looking
for cool foods for summer and dishes appropriate for patio parties
and potlucks. We tried Horne's picadillo and thought it would be nice
for the Bowl either hot or at room temperature, but would be just as
good for an easy company meal.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from sales go to a fund for children's music education.</TE>
<TE>   Priced at $19.95, the book can be ordered online at www.laphil.com
and www.hollywoodbowl.com or purchased at the Bowl gift shop, 2301 N.
Highland Ave., Los Angeles, open daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. To order
by mail, send a check for $28.09, which includes tax, postage and
handling, to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Affiliates, P.O. Box 1951,
Hollywood, CA 90078. Make checks payable to the affiliates.</TE>

<HD>Straight Out of Lompoc</HD>
<DH>Parker raves, and a tiny winery is propelled to fame</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It all started with a single sentence. Robert M. Parker Jr., the
world's most influential wine critic, was looking back on a year's
worth of tastings, and highlighted the Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs
made by a tiny winery in an obscure region near Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   "The Brewer-Clifton offerings were the single greatest revelation
of my 2001 tastings," he wrote in his monthly newsletter, the Wine
Advocate.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the actual reviews and ratings of those wines
won't be released until later next month. Parker had tipped his hand
in a way that he rarely has before, and it touched off a fever among
wine lovers around the world.</LD>
<TE>   Brewer-Clifton, a two-man winery operating out of an industrial
park near Lompoc, was suddenly one of the hottest labels in the
business, being mentioned in the same breath as the greatest wines of
Bordeaux and Burgundy, not to mention Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Brewer, partner in the enterprise with fellow winemaker Steve
Clifton, was overwhelmed. The winery is so small that Brewer's cell
phone number was the one listed for contacts. "That's when we
discovered his cell phone only holds 60 messages," Clifton says. "We
were getting 75 to 100 requests a day." The winery's mailing list
went from 250 to 1,050 in one month. Wine shops from Los Angeles to
New York were begging for more wine, and collectors were speculating
that a new cult wine had been born.</TE>
<TE>   "It got pretty gnarly," says Brewer. "Answering the phone, I was
talking to people who said they would do anything just to get on the
waiting list to get on the mailing list."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Smith of Woodland Hills Wine Co., a longtime retailer and
champion of California wines, was floored by the response. "It was
unheard of," he says. "We'd already sold through one shipment of
these wines before Parker came out. After that, we sold through
another one and people were still looking for it. They were really
shaking the trees."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most of these desperate people have never actually
tasted the wine, so powerful is Parker's recommendation they were
following blindly. And chances are, they won't taste it anytime soon.
Brewer-Clifton made only about 1,400 cases of the 2000 vintage that
Parker raved about, and most of that had already been shipped to
clients on the mailing list and a few high-end restaurant and retail
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, stocks are limited to a few scattered bottles in a very
few fine wine stores, and on some restaurant wine lists, such as
Spago's in Los Angeles and Jean-Georges' in New York. There hasn't
been time for the wine to filter down to the auction market, but
Smith says that's inevitable. "This is really a cult wine in the
making."</TE>
<TE>   It's little wonder then that Brewer, 32, and Clifton, 37, seem
dazed by the whole experience. After all, they started their winery
only six years ago. And it was only a couple of years before that
that the laid-back pair of Southern Californians were at the bottom
rung of the wine professional's career ladder--hustling for
minimum-wage tasting-room jobs and waiting tables, in an area that
has always been regarded as promising if never quite delivering.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're in the eye of a hurricane, a storm that arrived quite
suddenly after Parker dropped his bombshell.</TE>
<TE>   "Their single-vineyard Burgundian-styled Chardonnays and
extraordinary Pinot Noirs from the cool micro-climates of Santa
Barbara, particularly those from a new appellation called Santa Rita
Hills, are astounding," he wrote last December. "These two gifted
winemakers have an incredible future. Quantities are extremely
limited, so it is incumbent on you to get some now."</TE>
<TE>   "I was, like, wow," Clifton says. "It was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Equally amazing was the opposite response. Before more than a
handful of people had tasted the wine, the backlash had already
started. One notably sarcastic critic wrote: "I haven't tasted
Brewer-Clifton. But the good thing about Parker is that, when he
really likes a wine, you know exactly what it will taste like."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of attention may be typical in the Napa Valley, but
certainly not in Santa Ynez. Though wines have been made here for a
couple of decades--and some good ones too: Santa Rita Hills neighbors
Babcock Vineyards and Sanford Winery are much admired nationally--it
has never seemed to reach the critical mass necessary for widespread
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The new Santa Rita Hills appellation may change that. It lies
along one of the few east-west breaks in the wall of mountains that
line the California coast, allowing the cool coastal temperatures to
penetrate inland. Stretching from just east of Lompoc to just west of
Buellton, the area is 10 to 15 degrees cooler than the rest of the
Santa Ynez Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's cooler, we get a lot more hang time out of our
grapes," says Clifton. "That means they take longer to get ripe, but
that the flavors are much more developed."</TE>
<TE>   Once known mainly for growing cabbage and broccoli, the area is
experiencing a vineyard boom, something that is almost certain to
accelerate now that it has its own appellation and all the attention
drawn by its new heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer-Clifton owns no land itself. Instead, it buys small
quantities of high-quality grapes--usually an acre or less--from
carefully selected vineyards with which it has long-standing
relationships. This sense of place is at the heart of what the winery
is all about.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I like about Santa Rita is that it's like a nice,
little neighborhood feeling," Brewer says. "It's just a few of us,
and we're really tight."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to modern winemaking fashion, which emphasizes winemaker
"signature" over the old-fashioned values of regional and varietal
flavor, Brewer and Clifton try to be as uninvolved in the making of
their wines as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obsessed with sushi chefs," says Brewer. "That's what we try
to be like. You know: serving that great piece of fish that was
caught this morning off this particular reef that had spent its whole
life eating only this one thing. You're not going to make it better,
you're just trying to keep from screwing it up.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this trippy pedestal people put winemakers on. But when
you're working with fruit that's this good, it's just assembly."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being made from the same types of grapes, all grown within
six miles of each other, and vinified in exactly the same way, there
is no mistaking one Brewer-Clifton wine for another. This Chardonnay
has a pronounced herbal character, that one has a texture like syrup.
One Pinot Noir has a scent of wild strawberries, another the
high-toned perfume of raspberry liqueur.</TE>
<TE>   The one characteristic they all share is that they are huge wines
that still have pronounced, clearly articulated flavors. They are
monsters, but they are so well-knit and harmonious that you almost
don't notice their size. They're like Shaquille O'Neal in the pivot:
7-foot-1 and more than 300 pounds, but somehow still nimble and
graceful.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the plan is for Brewer-Clifton to make six Pinot Noirs
and six Chardonnays--all from the same set of vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   The pair have been friends for eight years, partners for six. They
met while they were scrambling for a start in the wine business,
trying to live in Santa Barbara while working minimum-wage jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer was raised in the Pacific Palisades and taught French at UC
Santa Barbara before being bitten by the wine bug. Clifton grew up
primarily in Orange County. He was a musician, then ran a
nightclub/restaurant/art gallery in Laguna Beach. That's where he
started to learn about wine.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on a couple of different committees together for the
Santa Barbara County Winegrowers Assn.," says Brewer. "We found that
we had a lot in common .... There weren't that many people our age or
with our interest in wine, so we ended up hanging out all the time.
We kind of bonded."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the plan for Brewer-Clifton was hatched. But it took them a
full year to save the $12,000 they needed to start the winery.
"Living in Santa Barbara, working as assistant winemakers for $6.50
an hour, waiting tables, there's not a lot left over," says Clifton.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, the winery is definitely bare-bones. Far from a grand
chateau, it's a 2,500-square-foot cement-floored warehouse in an
industrial park just outside of Lompoc. The appearance is more like
that of a struggling hot tub dealer than glamorous winemaker.</TE>
<TE>   That's not something that's likely to change any time soon.
Despite their success (even before the Parker mention, they were
selling out of all their wines within a week of release), there's
only so much money to be made selling such small amounts of wine,
even at $40 to $50 a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   To support his wife and two children, Brewer works full time as
winemaker at the much larger, much grander Melville Vineyards and
Winery down the street, owned by the family of financier Ron
Melville. Clifton, who is single, runs a line of Italian varietals,
called Palmina, on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Not even Robert Parker is likely to change that. "Honestly,
financially, it's not going to make us rich," says Brewer. "We
grossed $250,000 for the 1999 vintage, we'll probably do $350,000
this year because we're making more wine. Next year we'll probably be
around $400,000."</TE>
<TE>   That's not much, particularly when the pair pay so much for their
grapes. They bought the Chardonnay that went into their Mount Carmel
bottling for $2,750 a ton, among the highest prices paid in the
county. A ton of grapes will make about 60 cases of wine, meaning
they've already spent about $45 a case before the grapes even reach
the winery.</TE>
<TE>   The main financial benefit of the Parker review has been to raise
the percentage of wines sold to the mailing list from 10% to 15% to
what they hope will be about 50%. This is important because wineries
get paid the full retail price from mailing-list sales, as opposed to
the roughly half they get from wine stores and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sweet," says Brewer. "It lets us buy cell phones and
travel some and pay our taxes out of the company instead of out of
our own pockets the way we've done before."</TE>
<TE>   But there's not much more money available. Selling anything more
than 50% of their production to the mailing list would mean cutting
out some of the restaurants and retailers who have supported them
through the thin years and whose exposure is key to maintaining a
high-end brand.</TE>
<TE>   Raising prices is one obvious alternative--particularly when wines
from Napa are going for hundreds of dollars a bottle. But the pair
vow to keep their prices reasonable. "That whole California cult
Cabernet thing just feels so wrong," says Clifton.</TE>
<TE>   And so Brewer and Clifton wait for next month's review, knowing
that in some ways it has already changed their lives, but in others
it will be hardly noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of weird, we're not on pins and needles waiting for
this to come out, but we're still totally stoked," Brewer says. "I'm
just really concentrating on enjoying the whole thing right now
because I don't know if it will ever happen again. I mean, how can
it?"</TE>

<DH>1998 Remirez de Ganuza Rioja Reserva, Rioja, Spain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another stunning beauty from a Rioja estate that released its first
wine in 1994. This reserva, from old (mostly Tempranillo) vines, is
inky plum in color, with great concentration and a taste of earth,
sweet dark berries and cedar, reminiscent of a great Bordeaux. Lush
with bright fruit, it's fresher than some traditional Riojas, and the
tannins are beautifully integrated. It has the stuff to age and will
surely improve with time, but it's hard to resist drinking it
now--preferably with a steak or leg of lamb.</LD>
<LD>   About $46. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,

<HD>Remaking the Grade</HD>
<DH>A new fund from Porsche will help repair original path to
Big Bear Lake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A volunteer effort to repair Clark's Grade, a 142-year-old dirt track
that once was the only way up to Big Bear Lake, is the first
beneficiary of a grant from Porsche Cars of North America under its
new Cayenne Crossing program.</LD>
<LD>   Porsche created the program to promote its entry this year into
the sport utility vehicle market with the Cayenne and will donate
funds to the restoration of historic roads and off-road trails across
the country during the next few years.</LD>
<LD>   A second donation in California, to be announced this year, will
assist a Route 66 support group's effort to restore portions of the
historic highway in the Mojave Desert and to install directional
signs and historic markers along that portion of the route.</LD>
<TE>   Porsche executives will not say how much they have dedicated to
Cayenne Crossing, but it is expected to be a multimillion- dollar
program.</TE>
<TE>   The initial grant, announced Tuesday in ceremonies at the foot of
Clark's Grade, will fund a three-year effort by volunteers with the
nonprofit San Bernardino National Forest Assn. to repair the steep
six-mile dirt track that began as a trail for pack mules in 1860.
These days it is used by off-road driving enthusiasts but has been
severely compromised by erosion.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it a challenging four-wheel-drive trail," said Kris
Assel, executive director of the forest preservation group.</TE>
<TE>   Clark's Grade was opened in 1860 by rancher Hiram Clark as a way
to get supplies from the Redlands area to miners working in Holcomb
Canyon in the San Bernardino Mountains. The canyon, site of Southern
California's largest gold rush, is just north of modern-day Big Bear
Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Clark's mule trail followed a steep series of switchbacks
originally tramped out as a footpath in 1845 by explorer Benjamin
Wilson, who climbed up from the Santa Ana River at the foot of the
mountains behind Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson found a deep valley when he crested the mountains and,
after spotting many grizzlies, called it Bear Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The valley then had only one natural lake, at its east end (now
called Baldwin Lake), and remained unpopulated for decades. It was
ignored even during the gold rush, when by 1866 there were 1,500
miners living in nearby Holcomb Canyon, said valley historian Tom
Core.</TE>
<TE>   And though busy, Clark's Grade "was just a crude mule trail that
remained a trail until the 1890s, after the dam was built," Core
said, and the valley floor was flooded to create what now is called
Big Bear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Valley was dammed in 1884 by Redlands land speculators who
had found that oranges grew quite well in the area. They wanted to
create a mountain reservoir to supply water so they could sell the
otherwise-arid land for commercial groves.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting lake initially was called Bear Valley Reservoir,
then Pine Lake and Bear Lake. It finally became Big Bear Lake in the
late 1890s because developers farther down the mountain had created a
smaller lake they called Little Bear, which later became Lake
Arrowhead.</TE>
<TE>   After the reservoir formed and fish began breeding in it, the area
was discovered by lowlanders and became a popular, though
hard-to-get-to, retreat for visitors from Redlands, San Bernardino
and even as far away as Upland and the eastern edges of Los Angeles,
Core said.</TE>
<TE>   The first automobile road into the area came up from Running
Springs to Fawnskin in 1885. The valley got its first hotel in 1894,
Core said, "and has been a resort area ever since."</TE>
<TE>   To help boost tourism, a group of speculators formed the Bear
Valley Wagon Road Co. in the early 1890s, he said, and turned the
Clark's Grade mule track into a one-lane dirt road that could be
traversed by automobile to pro- vide a second route into the val-
ley.</TE>
<TE>   Because the road was only one lane and quite steep, traffic up and
down the grade alternated.</TE>
<TE>   A group would form at the bottom of the grade and the road would
be opened to let them drive up, while a group of travelers leaving
the valley would form and wait at the head of the trail, Core said.
The last car in the upward group was given a flag, and when the
driver arrived in the valley, he would hand the flag to the driver of
the last car waiting in line to go down and the direction of travel
would reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to do it that way because there were almost no places to
pass, and it was so steep you didn't want to get caught heading in
the wrong direction and have to back up," Core said.</TE>
<TE>   Although an asphalt road from San Bernardino into the valley was
built in 1924, Clark's Grade remained a popular secondary route until
the 1930s, and it has never been abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's in terrible shape today," Core said. "I lead tours up
here and used to take groups down the grade, but the last time I did
it, about three years ago, one car burned up its brakes and I decided
it had deteriorated too much to do group travel anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Assel said her foundation's volunteers spend hundreds of hours a
year keeping fast-growing brush cut back along the edges of Clark's
Grade but have not had the money for other maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   With the Cayenne Crossing grant, the forest association will be
able to provide funds to the U.S. Forest Service for grading and
other repairs on the road, Assel said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the funding also will be used to prepare and install
directional and informational signs along the route.</TE>
<TE>   "The support from Porsche will enable us to do a lot of postponed
maintenance," she said. "It will remain a four-wheel-drive route, but
we'll be filling in eroded ruts, shoring up crumbling shoulders and
making sure this historic route can remain open for the public to
enjoy."</TE>

<HD>Orange County Billionaire With Space to Spare</HD>
<DH>Don Bren's gift of open land lays a foundation for the
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Open space is freedom."</LD>
<LD>   Who said this?</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Club founder John Muir? Or billionaire California land
developer Donald Bren?</LD>
<TE>   The answer is probably both. I cannot swear that Muir put it
exactly that way, even though there is no doubt that's how the old
boy felt. I know for a fact that the words were uttered recently by
Bren, the Orange County land tycoon.</TE>
<TE>   I'm standing on the proof.</TE>
<TE>   Below me and to the west is the great hazy human grid of Southern
California, with the Pacific mirror-like in the distance. Behind me
the rumpled Santa Ana mountains. And rising beyond, the shimmering
heat waves of the inland desert. Underfoot is treasure. This region's
gold. All the more precious for how little of it remains: raw land.
Real estate. View property. Bobcat country.</TE>
<TE>   Bren has just given this land to me. And to you, and to the
future.</TE>
<TE>   He has set aside 11,000 acres for open space and put in motion the
process that will transfer deed to the public. The tracts are puzzle
pieces that fill in two of the region's biggest park and wilderness
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else can take a guess at the market value of this gift.
Posterity will record it as priceless.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks are owed, and I'm happy to deliver mine. Beyond that, I'm
curious. Just how does a land developer, a man whose father was also
a developer, come to express the idea that quality of life is
measured not just by what is built up but by what is not? How did
Bren, the "other Donald" of America's development big leagues, arrive
at such an expansive thought?</TE>
<TE>   I asked him.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe open legroom means different things to different
people," he said in a two-page reflection sent by e-mail from his
office. "Not only does it mean freedom for those who want to use it,
gain access to it, but I believe it also provides a sense of comfort
and security as a defined boundary that won't be developed, as a
buffer, as elbowroom."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom. Elbowroom. Comfort and security.</TE>
<TE>   Some years back, my friends in the conservation movement began to
drift away from this notion of open space as a human need--at least
in public policy debates. Unexploited property was increasingly, and
then almost exclusively, described as wildlife habitat. Then more
specifically, as habitat for endangered species. This became the
rallying cry for environmentalists: biodiversity, the preservation of
species by allotting them land.</TE>
<TE>   It has been an effective political tactic to forestall
development, if always at the whim of scientists and bureaucrats who
manage the Endangered Species Act. However, it has also narrowed the
terms of our civic discussions, implying perpetual conflict between
the interests of animals and humans.</TE>
<TE>   Bren has refreshed the tired argument. Ironically perhaps, the
developer makes a broader and more durable case for wild lands.</TE>
<TE>   Preserving open space for nature in our ever more crowded nation
adds to human livability as well as habitat for other creatures. In
urban reaches, an appreciation for nature close by maintains our
connection to all of nature's workings, including the place of
humans.</TE>
<TE>   To view nature as an abstraction or a distant phenomenon is itself
unnatural, and vice versa. "It's part of our being," Bren said.</TE>
<TE>   As owner of the privately held Irvine Ranch, Bren can now boast
that more than half of the 93,000 acres of this pre-statehood land
grant are in trust as open space--the 11,000 acres adding to 39,000
previously set aside. And boast he should. Back in the 1970s, the
master plan envisioned only 11% of ranch property remaining green.
Times change, and not always for the worse.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there will be development fights ahead as Bren's Irvine Co.
proceeds with its 20-year plan to build on other still-undeveloped
acres scattered through six Orange County cities. But much of the
disputed wild in the area known as Fremont and Baker canyons at the
north end of Irvine Ranch holdings and the last chunk of wild Laguna
Canyon near the ocean to the south will forever be places where a
future Donald Bren can strike out on a hike and say, "I loved the
sheer joy, the sense of freedom, even escape, that I had in the
outdoors as a child."</TE>
<TE>   Today, I'm traveling through this new preserve with an ecologist
from the Nature Conservancy. She has been studying this property for
a decade now, hoping that some of it would be set aside.</TE>
<TE>   We stand on a promontory and take in the view. In one direction,
beyond the Irvine Ranch, an adjacent range of hills has been topped
and terraced, built over and paved. And the same with the next ridge.
Turn around and there are four ridgelines of rock, chaparral, sage,
prickly pear and freedom. We hear the flute-call of a canyon wren.</TE>
<TE>   I ask her how she felt at the moment when Bren said this acreage
would be given to the public untouched. She pauses. She doesn't
answer. Silence.</TE>
<TE>   Then I see that she is crying.</TE>

<HD>War Is Likely if Musharraf Stays</HD>
<DH>A regime change is necessary to head off nuclear
brinkmanship with India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENAZIR BHUTTO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The smell of war is in the air. Like helpless actors, India and
Pakistan are inexorably moving in the direction of a deadly conflict.
Once again, the United States and the international community are
involved in firefighting a potential nuclear conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The chance of such a war was predicted by the American CIA chief
in March. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
George Tenet said: "If India were to conduct large-scale offensive
operations into Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan might
retaliate with strikes of its own in the belief that its nuclear
deterrent would limit the scope of an Indian counterattack."</LD>
<LD>   The international community has high stakes in the region.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan is now a key ally of the U.S.-led forces in neighboring
Afghanistan. The last situation the U.S. wants to see develop is the
war against terror deflected by war between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   But if the militants wanted to deflect attention away from allied
forces fighting against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas bordering
Afghanistan and Pakistan, they succeeded. The fight that began in
Kabul last year, triggered by militants flying planes into the World
Trade Center, has every possibility of turning into a fight for
Kashmir, triggered by militants determined to provoke an
Indo-Pakistani clash.</TE>
<TE>   The international community made a critical error when it
concluded that a military dictator could defuse tension between India
and Pakistan or prevent the tidal wave of extremism that is now
engulfing the region.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the great white
hope in the fight against terrorism, is sinking in a quicksand of his
own making. His tenure has been marked by the rise of extremism,
militancy, terrorism and regional tension.</TE>
<TE>   He missed an opportunity  in 2000 to sign a confidence-building
treaty with New Delhi. He carries the baggage of being the architect
of the last major battle along the Line of Control near Kargil, which
nearly led to an Indo-Pakistani war in 1999. His "lone ranger"
politics pit him against domestic political forces polarizing the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Given this history, it's unlikely that dialogue proposals can halt
the inexorable march to war now taking place.</TE>
<TE>   There is one way that war can be prevented, and that is a change
of regime.</TE>
<TE>   Regime change in Islamabad offers the possibility of halting
hostilities to permit a new government to make a fresh start. The
voices of the international community, as well as the Pakistani armed
forces, are critical determinants as to the calculations made. They
will determine whether Musharraf resigns to defuse the crisis or
clings to power in a show of nuclear brinkmanship.</TE>
<TE>   The view of Pakistan's powerful ally, the U.S., is pivotal too.
The White House was vocal in its support for Musharraf. President
Bush has called him "my friend." Now the U.S. will have to choose
between a man who is considered a friend and risking a limited war
that could get out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi will reflect before starting a military action that
lacks the support of Washington. But it enjoys far greater freedom of
action than Islamabad did during the Kargil fighting. Then, President
Clinton could dictate to debt-laden Islamabad, held hostage by the
International Monetary Fund. President Bush might find it difficult
to dictate to New Delhi because its economy is largely independent.</TE>
<TE>   Bush does have one weapon that can deter New Delhi. That is the
threat of international mediation for the Kashmir cause. New Delhi is
opposed to such intervention.</TE>
<TE>   A military setback would mean trouble for Musharraf. Far better
for him and the region that he agree to a regime change to prevent
the start of armed hostilities that could trigger a nuclear
nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   And far better for New Delhi to accept such a regime change as
face-saving than allow a limited war that could spill out of control.
New Delhi should consider that Islamabad could do well in a war that
is limited in area and time. Pakistan's military is well equipped.</TE>
<TE>   During his testimony before the Senate committee in March, the CIA
director said the decision to turn Islamabad into an ally in the wake
of the Sept. 11 attacks "was a fundamental political shift with
inherent risks.''</TE>
<TE>   Those risks are now evident as the South Asian region teeters on
the brink of a violent tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Mustn't Be the Trigger for Death Squads</HD>
<DH>Colombia's new president should be told to quash the urge
for vigilantism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrorism is extraordinarily effective. With every attack, it propels
its most implacable enemies to power. Just as Islamic Jihad, Hamas
and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade elected Ariel Sharon in Israel,
leftist guerrillas in Colombia have managed to bring to power a man
who had vowed to do whatever it took to crush that country's
insurgency.</LD>
<LD>   The voters have spoken in a clear voice, leaving no room for
ambiguity: The independent rightist candidate Alvaro Uribe won.
Uribe's victory means that American tax dollars will flow south,
arming government forces as they machete their way through Colombia's
jungles in search of guerrillas. U.S. taxpayer dollars will flow as
well to defense contractors in the United States, buying more weapons
for Colombia's soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   But will American dollars play a key role in energizing the
battalions of paramilitary death squads that "help" the government's
war against guerrillas by terrorizing Colombian villagers? Will U.S.
tax dollars help fund the proposed million-man army of vigilantes of
Colombia's new government?</LD>
<TE>   Uribe benefited from the embarrassing failure of his predecessor's
peace efforts. After three years of concessions to the largest
leftist militia--the 17,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC--President Andres Pastrana ended all talks, saying
FARC had never been serious about peace.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe never believed peace was possible. His own father died in a
botched kidnapping attempt by FARC operatives. His plan now is to
double the size of the army and build a citizens brigade with as many
as 1million civilians, perhaps armed only with radios, working on the
government's side.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands now, U.S. law allows money only for anti-narcotics
operations, and it requires that the Colombian army show it is not
engaged in human rights violations, particularly by supporting the
work of paramilitary groups. But those laws, especially the one
limiting aid to the war on drugs, came from a long-ago era, before
Sept. 11, before terrorism was all that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   The wishes of Colombia's voters are clear. They have no interest
in supporting a violent leftist insurgency dressed up in populist
idealism. With a tiny population of wealthy people and an enormous
population of the very poor, Colombia has plenty of reasons to worry
about social and economic problems. But the poor in Colombia have no
faith in the power of armed guerrillas to help. With four armies--two
leftist militias, one right-wing paramilitary and the
government--fighting, the war has become about winning, not about
reforming the economy or society. American money has armed all sides
in the conflict; drug users in the U.S., as well as the rest of the
world, pour millions that go into arming the leftist guerrillas and
the right-wing militias.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Colombia know what they want, and they know there will
be a price to pay. They know the war will now get worse, but they
hope this will help bring an end to this four-decade-long conflict.
Uribe, however, may yet surprise those who expect only more
bloodshed. He already has suggested international mediation to help
solve the conflict, though his talk has mostly focused on tough
action. In the end, he will probably prevail in changing the balance
of power so that peace talks can later be successful.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also has a voice in this conflict. As a major source of
funds for the government, it must insist that rights be respected and
that the government target not only the guerrillas but also the
paramilitaries that supported Uribe's candidacy. The latest U.S.
certification of Colombia as making progress on human rights was a
sham, denounced by respected human rights organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The incoming president will fight terror with determination, as
Washington likes. If the U.S. wants respect for its values, it should
do all it can to keep the new Colombian government from turning the
country into a land of revenge and vigilantism. Otherwise, terrorism
will indeed have won.</TE>

<HD>Gruesome Killing of Animals Isn't Entertainment</HD>
<DH>TV viewers should boycott shows that try to make them
squirm by abusing creatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMMI KAPPENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After my weeks in Australia, as a vegetarian and a contestant on CBS'
2001 series "Survivor: the Australian Outback," I have begun to think
of "reality television" as more than just entertainment or exciting
adventure.</LD>
<LD>   I realize now that some of the participants aren't volunteers: The
animals do not choose to be actors in these games and stunts. They
are used.</LD>
<LD>   Too often, TV producers have harmed animals in the name of
ratings. This must be stopped, by legislation ultimately, but also by
audience boycott. We shouldn't watch programs in which animals are
abused and killed.</LD>
<TE>   In the first two "Survivor" series, rats, rays, eels and a chicken
were killed and eaten. One contestant viciously stabbed a pig,
leading to an international outcry and the introduction of stronger
animal protection legislation in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, on PBS' "Frontier House," in which three families
pretended they were living in 1883 Montana, participants chopped the
heads off chickens and shot a pig that had become a family pet.</TE>
<TE>   None of these killings were necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The people who appeared on the shows were pretending to be
dependent on the animals to survive. But they and we know that modern
cuisine and medical care were just a phone call away.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a life in a gruesome and cruel way for entertainment and
not for survival seems simply prehistoric.</TE>
<TE>   The eating of the animals is more of a way to get contestants and
viewers to squirm than to serve a real purpose. In NBC's "Fear
Factor," contestants ate sheep eyes in a barn amid live sheep. Most
people were repulsed by the cruelty of this challenge.</TE>
<TE>   It's about time those who run these so-called reality shows
develop consciences.</TE>
<TE>   The film industry already is moving away from exploitation.
Wolfgang Petersen, the director of the movie "The Perfect Storm,"
banned real animals from his set. With a script that called for the
capture and gutting of numerous swordfish and even a shark, the film
could have been bloody. But Petersen used modern-day movie magic to
create a cruelty-free movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an animal rights person, and I didn't want to have one real
fish killed for this movie," Petersen said.</TE>
<TE>   With a little creativity, good programming can be achieved without
animals suffering. Animatronic animals, including bats, snakes and
dogs, have been used on shows as diverse as "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," "ER" and "The Drew Carey Show."</TE>
<TE>   Programs that continue to abuse animals should know that
compassionate viewers won't keep watching.</TE>

<HD>Huge Campaign Loophole</HD>
<DH>State panel's ruling that the voter-approved contribution
limit does not apply to committees is a violation of the public
trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The law should mean what it says. But that's not the case with
Proposition 34, the campaign fund-raising "reform" approved by state
voters in November 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Californians were promised that the measure, written by Democratic
leaders, would impose a $3,000 limit on individual contributions to
legislative campaigns. But The Times' Virginia Ellis and Carl Ingram
have disclosed that the state Fair Political Practices Commission
tore a gaping loophole in the law last September. Since then,
Democratic leaders have been driving cash-laden trucks through that
gap--Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) to the tune of $1.6
million and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco),
$532,000.</LD>
<LD>   As it implemented Proposition 34, the commission held that the new
contribution limits did not apply to campaign committees formed
before the law became effective Jan. 1, 2001. Commission Chairwoman
Karen Getman said, "While it's wonderful to talk about the philosophy
of contribution limits, we've got to make the law work."</LD>
<TE>   That is the commission's job. But its responsibility should be to
make the law work the way the voters intended, not how legislators
might want, although both Wesson and Burton said they did not seek
the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Getman should explain why the new law applies to contributors and
candidates in most cases but not to committees. It's one thing to
exempt money a committee already has raised, but it's quite another
to allow committees to keep raking in unlimited cash under the old
rules. The commission did establish dates for the committees to
comply, but some of those deadlines are more than two years away. The
cutoff of unlimited amounts of cash should be immediate. What the
commission is allowing now is nothing short of a violation of the
public trust.</TE>
<TE>   It's ironic that loopholes continue to riddle state campaign
finance laws, including allowing the use of large "soft money"
contributions, just when Congress has finally passed a strong
campaign law.</TE>
<TE>   The 1974 state Political Reform Act, which created the Fair
Political Practices Commission, required a broad interpretation of
its provisions to carry out voters' intent, but now the commission
imposes a narrow ruling that helps the pols. So a member of Congress
can collect only $1,000 from a single contributor but a committee of
the state Assembly speaker or Senate president can collect unlimited
amounts. The commission should close this loophole, and if it will
not, the Legislature must.</TE>

<HD>Clean Needles' Big Payoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a junkie gets desperate for a fix, fear of a dirty needle tends
to evaporate along with the last remaining trace of responsible
behavior. As a result, potentially deadly viruses--particularly HIV
and hepatitis C--infect thousands of Californians yearly, costing
lives and millions in taxpayer dollars spent on hospitalizations and
medications.</LD>
<LD>   Some politicians say that providing clean needles would only
encourage criminal drug use and the multitude of ancillary ills that
accompany it. They are willing to write off those deaths and dollars
as the price of addiction. But that behavior too strikes us as
irresponsible. So we're glad a bare majority in the state Senate
brushed aside that position and passed a controversial bill by Sen.
John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) that would let adults purchase and
possess up to 30 sterile syringes a year without a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   SB 1785 now heads to the Assembly, where some conservative
Democrats and Republicans have vowed to oppose it.</LD>
<TE>   In an ideal world, simply prohibiting everyone from abusing drugs
would end drug abuse. The reckless spread of disease would no longer
be a problem. In reality as it now stands, however, needles are
relatively rare and valuable, so addicts share them and carry them
around in pockets, where they lie in wait for a paramedic or police
officer's probing hand. At least here in California.</TE>
<TE>   In the 44 states where over-the-counter sales of syringes are
legal, the spread of HIV, hepatitis C and other infectious diseases
has been markedly reduced. That's why a number of medical groups,
including the California Medical Assn. and the California Nurses
Assn., support the bill.</TE>
<TE>   We're with them. As Vasconcellos says, his bill, far from
encouraging addiction, merely "recognizes that addicts are going to
shoot up." That is the sad fate of most junkies. But with help from
responsible members of society, death by infectious disease need not
be.</TE>

<LD>The presence of 1 million stalemated troops along the border between
India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed foes who have fought three wars
in the last half-century, has set off alarm bells across the world.
Aside from a desire to see war averted, Washington has another
interest: Pakistan says it will move troops from its west, where they
should be hunting for the Al Qaeda forces that fled Afghanistan, to
the east, to face Indian soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   The leaders of India and Pakistan should take advantage of Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin's suggestion that they hold an informal
side meeting next week at an Asian regional conference in Kazakhstan.</LD>
<LD>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is happy to see Putin,
President Bush and leaders of NATO countries pressuring Pakistan to
stop terrorists crossing into Kashmir. But he also should be willing
to talk with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf without demanding
that Pakistan first stop abetting terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf did crack down on Islamic militants in January, after
supporters of Kashmir secession from India attacked the Indian
Parliament in New Delhi. But he later freed most of those rounded up,
and this month separatists attacked an army housing complex in
Kashmir, killing more than 30 people.</TE>
<TE>   As with the Palestinian Authority, there is some question of the
willingness or ability of Pakistani authorities to stop terrorism.
Islamic radicals have killed Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl, 11 French contract defense workers and four worshipers at a
Protestant church favored by foreigners. All of these attacks were
designed to humiliate Musharraf for helping the United States against
Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999, does have power
over the military. He should have delayed the recent tests of three
Pakistani missiles capable of carrying a nuclear payload.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani leader should now order his generals to crack down
on cross-border terrorism. India might then pull troops back from the
border and de- escalate its own nuclear chest-thumping. It is easy to
miscalculate in war, to let momentum rather than good sense rule;
India sent its soldiers into the high, cold Himalayas 40 years ago
wearing shorts and sneakers to battle China. They were badly beaten.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is true, as some analysts contend, that the parity of
nuclear arms is keeping India and Pakistan out of war. But it is not
a theory that bears testing. Other nations should follow Putin's lead
and apply all the muscle they can to get the two countries to sit
down in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and talk.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ex-Klansman Convicted of 1963 Church Bombing," May 23:</LD>
<LD>   Oh, how I wish more people could have been there. I was in
Birmingham, Ala., last week, visiting my Los Angeles-born daughter,
who moved to the South a few months ago. While there, I went to the
Jefferson County Courthouse and sat in the back of the courtroom
where a jury convicted Bobby Frank Cherry for his part in the bombing
murder of four black girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church nearly
40 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   I had already visited the historic church; seen its basement wall
containing a tattered memorial of photos and articles. I had also
been to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute just across the street,
where the brutality of the bombing and other atrocities of that
infamous era were chronicled in agonizingly vivid detail.</LD>
<TE>   But there was nothing like seeing Cherry, one of the original
perpetrators of such hate, in person, unrepentant and, to the end,
still denying any involvement in that horrendous event.</TE>
<TE>   I imagined what he must have once looked like hiding under his
white sheet instead of in the simple gray suit he wore to court. It
seemed to me, as I kept staring at him from the back of the
courtroom, that he looked incredulous at the prospect that the
Birmingham he once ruled from behind a trilogy of Ks had turned so
completely against him.</TE>
<TE>   And with nine whites and three blacks, this was no O.J. Simpson
jury. People down here are quick to remind outsiders like me how much
things have changed in the new South, and perhaps they're right. It's
certainly time.</TE>

<LD>Re "Traveling Under the Shadow of Anti-Americanism," Commentary, May
23:</LD>
<LD>   I wish to take exception to the isolationist drivel masquerading
as commentary by Norah Vincent. What anti-Americanism? What I found
in the two months my family and I spent last year in Britain and
France was that Americans are envied, enjoyed and imitated. What was
also clear in conversations and opinion pieces in newspapers was
European outrage at the arrogance of George W. Bush with his blithe,
and apparently ignorant, disregard of any form of international
cooperation. And for her to see something "ugly brewing in Europe"
sounds pretty silly on the day after the guilty verdict in
Birmingham, Ala., which took us almost 40 years to achieve.</LD>

<LD>Re "10 Chinese Nabbed After Coming Ashore in O.C.," May 24:</LD>
<LD>   To refer to the ships used by Asian smugglers and stowaways as
"modern-day slave ships," to quote Immigration and Naturalization
Service spokesman Bill Strassberger, is not only inaccurate, it is
insulting. There is a vast difference between individuals willingly
undertaking a perilous journey by sea "looking for a better economic
future" and the Africans who were captured in their homeland, packed
into steerage and delivered into bondage in the Americas.</LD>
<LD>   Lest we forget, there was also little possibility for these
captives to slip into the contemporary garb of the day and fade into
a heterogeneous landscape (eagle-eyed Orange County teens
notwithstanding).</LD>
<TE>   From the first wave of Scots-Irish through the influx of Southeast
Asian and Central American immigrants, North America has been a
beacon of economic freedom. Remember that the bulk of African
Americans came comparatively late to the much-vaunted American dream;
for more than 200 years they were extremely busy crafting it for
others through back-breaking labor.</TE>

<LD>Re "Powerful Team Joins Hahn Bid to Stop Valley Secession," May 24: I
have my share of disagreements with the current mayor, his
predecessor and the other former candidates, but it is nice to see
them all come together to push for one L.A. The diversity is what
makes L.A. Much of this will be lost if the San Fernando Valley
separates.</LD>
<LD>   If the Valley thinks it can become another West Hollywood or
Beverly Hills, it is mistaken. It will likely become a poor version
of Los Angeles, losing much of what makes the San Fernando Valley
such a great place.</LD>
<LD>   Selby Jessup</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles city leaders' argument against Valley secession
doesn't hold up. Allowing people the opportunity to determine their
own community enhances representative government and citizen
involvement. Whether it has 88 cities or 89 cities, Los Angeles
County remains Los Angeles County, and our 10million citizens will
still be Angelenos. The San Fernando Valley is currently composed of
eight cities (Glendale, Burbank, San Fernando, Agoura Hills, Westlake
Village, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and the city of Los Angeles). Having
a ninth city will continue the Valley's opportunity for
self-government.</TE>

<TE>   Alice in Wonderland is back! I am confused by what I read in the
papers about a possible Valley breakaway. First, I read that if the
divorce succeeds, the Valley must pay alimony to L.A. because it will
miss us and it needs the money. English translation: L.A. says we
have been robbing and shortchanging you for many years, Valley.
Therefore, you must pay alimony to us, as we can no longer rob you
in-house, so to speak. Also, all the civic installations and
improvements in your area that you have already paid for, Valley, you
will have to pay for again. We need the money. And you don't mind, do
you?</TE>
<TE>   Hal Landy</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession is a bad idea. Bigger is better. It's better to
have one city that's the second-biggest city in the United States
than two cities that are third and sixth. Not only that, but if L.A.
stays together, it could eventually become the biggest city in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Rivetz</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If we want to be sensible about secession and a proposed borough
system, we should start with the county. Los Angeles County should be
divided into six to 12 cities of about 1million to 1.5million people
each. The cities might be: San Fernando, San Gabriel, Central,
Eastside, Westside, North Coast, South Coast, etc. The cities would
be somewhat natural geographic, economic and cultural units.</TE>
<TE>   These cities would then be broken into boroughs such as:
Hollywood, San Pedro, Santa Monica, Covina, Pasadena, Canoga Park,
Beverly Hills, Long Beach, Compton, Torrance ... you get the idea.
Much money would be saved by getting rid of duplicating fire, police,
street, library and other departments. And we would get better,
more-coordinated services.</TE>

<LD>The signature ink is not dry on the farcical nuclear reduction treaty
just signed by the U.S. and Russian leaders and the praise is
thundering (May 25). If it is a treaty, as I understand it, the
Senate must consent, and we should demand that the senators do not.
Claiming a significant reduction in nuclear warheads, the treaty does
not require either party to destroy a single one. They can be stored
to be used at any future time. Nor does this treaty deal with "Star
Wars," that expensive, technically infeasible weapon, the most
destabilizing ever conceived. I suggest we advise that our senators
tell the administration what to do with this treaty.</LD>

<LD>Re "Blast at Israeli Mall Kills 2," May 28: That Israel continues to
blame Yasser Arafat for the latest suicide bombing near Tel Aviv
indicates the level of narrow-mindedness and lack of vision possessed
by its leadership. Much the same as our own leaders, who believe that
a show of superior military might is the final solution to acts of
terrorism, Ariel Sharon and company are completely clueless about the
tenacity and determination of certain religious and social fanatics
who operate according to their own agenda and do not respond to
political rhetoric or armed incursions. They are as likely to obey
Arafat as they are President Bush when it comes to cessation of their
heinous activities.</LD>
<LD>   We would all be better served if this "war" against terrorism took
into account the fundamentalist mind-set of the terrorists
themselves, as well as the destruction of buildings and
infrastructure. The attitudes of the civilians who feel the impact of
such actions most heavily are ignored at our peril.</LD>

<TE>   Re Shibley Telhami and Steve Kull's "Public, Leaders a Poll
Apart," Opinion, May 26: The fact is that most average Americans with
knowledge of the Middle East support Israel. Perhaps I can illustrate
with my own poll questions.</TE>
<TE>   Which country in the Middle East: Has been our loyal ally since
its formation and single-handedly defeated the Russians in the Middle
East during the Cold War? Saved thousands of American lives during
the Gulf War by destroying Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant in 1981 at
Osirak? Is the only country in the Middle East that is a democracy;
the only country where Arabs have the right to vote, enjoy due
process of law and freedom of speech and the press? Is the only
country in the Middle East to offer Bush total support during the war
on terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans know that the answer to these questions is Israel,
just as they realize that Israel is on the front lines along with the
U.S. in fighting terrorism. And so do most of America's leaders.</TE>

<TE>   In response to Steven Feiles' May 22 letter, I should like to
state emphatically that not all Christians and political
right-wingers support the state of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   My background is Jewish, and I have been an evangelical,
born-again believer most of my life, not to mention 15 straight years
as a conservative activist. I reject the notion that Christians must
condone the repression of the Palestinians because somehow God
commands it. It's not in my Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Equally false is the idea that the Zionist creation of modern
Israel is part of prophecy or a divine miracle, when it's nothing
more than a band of thugs occupying somebody else's land. The
regathering of the 12 lost tribes will come in a future dispensation,
as per God's promise.</TE>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In "Israeli Ruling Puts a Freeze on Family Ties" (May 24), an
Israeli Arab woman married to a Palestinian and complaining about her
husband not being able to visit her in Israel answers the question of
why she doesn't move to the West Bank, saying, "It's really difficult
for someone who lives in heaven to come and live in hell."</TE>
<TE>   This "heaven" that the Arabs are trying their best to destroy was
a desert full of malaria 50 years ago and only became this jewel of
democracy through the hard work of Jewish settlers. Since the Oslo
agreement, Palestinians have had equal opportunities to start
building the West Bank and Gaza into a heaven, but instead of
learning from their neighbors they have chosen terror, destruction
and murder.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Job Has Become Too Big for Ashcroft," Commentary, May 28: I
am no big fan of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft. However, to suggest that
Ashcroft's faith biased his view of Islamic terrorists is at best
disingenuous and at worst downright bigoted. Next time Robert Scheer
feels like calling someone an extremist, I would suggest he look in
the mirror.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This time I agree with Scheer--Ashcroft is as fanatical as the
Taliban. Imagine paying thousands of dollars to have a blue curtain
cover the semi-nude figure artwork in his building.</TE>
<TE>   The old Republicans didn't know what they were doing when they
sucked in those Dixiecrats after President Lyndon Johnson signed the
civil rights bill. Teddy Roosevelt must be turning over in his grave.</TE>

<HD>'Arafat' Chips a Hit in Egypt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Cheese-flavored Yasser Arafat potato chips--5 cents a bag.</LD>
<LD>   Vendors in Egypt report brisk sales of the new product. The maker
of the chips says it donates 25 piasters, or 5 cents, to the
"Palestinian cause" for every 50 packages sold.</LD>
<LD>   The chips are bagged in Palestinian colors--green, red, black and
white--and carry the likeness of a rotund and wide-eyed Arafat,
saluting with one hand and holding a Palestinian flag in the other.
The Palestinian leader is dressed in his trademark military fatigues
and black-and-white checked head scarf.</LD>
<TE>   Shopkeepers say the Arafat chips, named Abu Ammar--the Palestinian
Authority president's nom de guerre--are considerably outselling
another new brand, the Hero, which hit store shelves this month.</TE>
<TE>   The packaging for that brand pictures a schoolboy holding a stone
in his right hand and books in the other as he confronts an Israeli
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one who doesn't love Abu Ammar," said Iman Mohammed
Darwish, a 12-year-old girl. "I like the taste, and I want to help
the Palestinians."</TE>

<LD>   Nepalese security forces put down a rebel assault on an army camp,
killing 152 Maoist fighters, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The battle began hours after Nepal's king renewed a state of
emergency Monday, which gave the army sweeping powers to tackle the
revolt by Communist rebels seeking to overthrow the constitutional
monarchy.</LD>
<TE>   Nepal TV said thousands of Maoists had attacked the camp, about
350 miles west of the capital, Katmandu. Five soldiers were killed
and 22 wounded, the army said.</TE>

<LD>EUROPE</LD>
<LD>   The European Commission proposed drastic cuts to the European
Union's fishing fleet in an attempt to save fish stocks that are near
extinction--but at the cost of sacrificing thousands of jobs on the
trawlers.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of internal wrangling, the commission meeting in
Brussels unveiled bitterly disputed plans to cut by 30% to 60% the
total time EU trawlers spend at sea, depending on the fish species
and region.</LD>
<TE>   That means a reduction of about 8,600 vessels, 8.5% of the boats
operating from EU ports. Tens of thousands of the bloc's 260,000
workers face an uncertain future.</TE>

attempted murder and illegal possession of weapons in an alleged plot
to bomb a girls school in East Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   The Jerusalem District Court charge sheet said Yarden Morag,
Shlomo Dvir and Ofer Gamliel had stockpiled explosives and made
reconnaissance runs since February in the At Tur neighborhood to
prepare for a "large-scale attack."</LD>
<TE>   Before dawn April 29, authorities said, the suspects rigged a
mini-trailer with TNT blast charges, two barrels of gasoline, two
cooking-gas canisters and shrapnel. The bomb was left outside the
school, set to explode as its 1,300 girls arrived for classes.</TE>

<HD>Bush Voices Concerns to Pope About U.S. Catholic Church</HD>
<DH>Religion: The president, in a 'gentlemanly' way, raises the
issue of the institution's standing in the aftermath of a pedophilia
scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>President Bush expressed concern Tuesday to Pope John Paul II about
the standing of the U.S. Roman Catholic Church, which has been
battered by a pedophilia scandal, a White House spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Although Press Secretary Ari Fleischer did not elaborate, White
House officials emphasized that the president spoke about the
church's situation in America but did not necessarily address in
specific the question of priests and sexual abuse of children.</LD>
<LD>   Still, by acknowledging his concerns in public and discussing the
matter with the pontiff, however gingerly, Bush interjected himself
into the most difficult issue the church is facing.</LD>
<TE>   It was an unusual step for a U.S. official to take, in a political
culture in which leaders are wary of entering a religious fray.
However, it reflected both the importance of Catholic voters to Bush
and the anger the scandal has raised among them.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bush left Washington, White House officials had strongly
suggested that he would not address the scandal unless John Paul
brought it up, which they considered unlikely. They had said only
that the president would talk about whatever the pontiff wanted to
address.</TE>
<TE>   The president and the pope met privately for about 20 minutes,
with neither aides nor translators, in the pope's private library,
decorated with a painting of the Virgin Mary on a throne.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer would not elaborate on Bush's remarks about the church's
standing. But he said the president and the pope also spoke in
English about U.S.-Russian relations, the Catholic Church in Russia
and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In a veiled but clear reference to the scandal, Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in a statement on the meeting: "His
holiness ... wanted to express, despite the difficulties of the
moment, his trust in the spiritual resources of American Catholics
committed to bearing witness to the values of the Gospel in society."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was the second in a year between the two leaders.
Immediately after the meeting, Bush headed back to Washington, ending
a weeklong trip to Germany, Russia, France and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Asked during the morning whether he would raise the sexual abuse
issues with the pontiff, Bush said he would "listen carefully to what
the pope has to say. He's a man of enormous dignity and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added: "I will tell him that I am concerned about the
Catholic Church in America; I'm concerned about its standing."</TE>
<TE>   The president said he would make such comments to the pope while
recognizing that the church "is an incredibly important institution
in our country."</TE>
<TE>   He said he also would tell the pope that he appreciated his
"leadership in trying to strengthen the Catholic Church in America."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the few times Bush has addressed the scandal in
public. At a news conference March 13, the president said that he
knows many within the church leadership and that they are "men of
integrity and decency. They're honorable people.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident the church will clean up its business and do the
right thing.... I trust the leadership," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Has Aggressively Courted Catholic Voters</TE>
<TE>   The scandal in the Catholic Church has put Bush in a difficult
position. As president, he is expected to demonstrate leadership in
whatever moral issues cross the U.S. political landscape. But the
American respect for keeping religion and government at a healthy
distance from each other makes it particularly sensitive for him to
enter into such a controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The issue carries additional sensitivities because the president,
a Methodist, has aggressively courted the Catholic vote. The first
dinner he attended in Washington outside the White House was at the
home of Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, the Washington archbishop,
and Bush frequently meets with church leaders and speaks to Catholic
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the pope sees his role as exercising moral
leadership around the world and has at times spoken out forcefully on
the American approach to such issues as abortion and the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   On his first visit to the Vatican, last July, the president heard
John Paul lecture him on the dignity of human life, in what was
interpreted as a direct effort to persuade Bush not to open up the
field of stem cell research in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, John Paul told Bush--who was about to address what
was then the most complex political issue he was facing--that the use
of human embryos for medical research was an "evil" akin to abortion
and infanticide.</TE>
<TE>   Within three weeks, Bush announced that he would allow the federal
government to fund medical research using stem cells taken from a
limited number of embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Vatican staunchly opposes using the cells taken from
embryos, which are destroyed in the process, Bush's decision was seen
as a compromise because it permitted only the use of already
available stem cells and blocked expansion of federally funded
research to include collecting cells from additional embryos.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush's readiness to raise the abuse scandal was
seen as a matter of domestic politics rather than Washington-Vatican
foreign policy--and a reflection of the presence on the trip of Karl
Rove, Bush's top political advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "can't go to the Vatican without raising the issue in the
most gentlemanly, diplomatic fashion," said a veteran of senior posts
in several Republican administrations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   He said the sensitive way for Bush to approach the matter was to
express concern about what the scandal was doing to the church--and
not express concern about sexual abuse itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It plays well with those in the Catholic Church in the United
States who are concerned. Bush is burnishing his moral standing. This
is all dictated by politics," giving the president an opportunity to
appeal to the Catholic laity grown angry over the church's response
to the scandal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's relations with Catholics have been a sensitive matter since
his visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina during the 2000
presidential campaign. The school had a history of discriminating
against Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of their private session Tuesday, the pope and the
president posed for pictures.</TE>
<TE>   As photographers' lights flashed, John Paul shielded his eyes.
Bush said, "They'll make you look good, your Holy Father."</TE>
<TE>   After the 20-minute private audience, they were joined by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice, White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., Rove
and others.</TE>
<TE>   The president gave the pope a silver oval medallion with a
hand-painted image of the Virgin Mary; the pope gave Bush a statue of
Mary.</TE>
<TE>   When the Americans got up to leave, the pope said, in English,
"God bless America."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Drills in Philippines May Be Model for Future</HD>
<DH>Asia: Leaders in Malaysia and Indonesia are watching the
joint military exercises in light of their own battles against
terror.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISABELA, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Two Marines stand guard for every Navy Seabee working to clear an old
airstrip on the island home of Abu Sayyaf guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans and a handful of Filipinos work inside a ring of
Philippine soldiers, where stray livestock can trigger trip wires
that send up flares and set Marine snipers on alert. On the other
side of Isabela, where the concrete of Basilan island's only city
ends abruptly and a dirt track hugs a palm-strewn shoreline, an
American Green Beret captain supervises marksmanship training for
Philippine army rangers, who two months earlier were firing on rebels
a few miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Four months into this U.S.-Philippine military operation, defense
officials are struggling for terms to describe it. The Pentagon calls
it an advisory mission. Col. Danilo Servando, a Philippine army
spokesman, somewhat apologetically describes it as "a training
exercise. That is the legal terminology that we are using."</LD>
<TE>   Yet the six-month regimen that began in January is unlike anything
either military has experienced before. A training exercise usually
means two to four weeks at an isolated site, carefully orchestrated
to avoid contact with civilians. In decades of mutual military
cooperation, neither country has trained on this scale on a
battleground.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic extremists of the Abu Sayyaf movement here in southern
Mindanao province are believed to be holding two Americans and a
local nurse hostage as they wage a guerrilla war against the
Philippine government. The United States is offering a $5-million
reward for the capture of the Abu Sayyaf leaders, the U.S. Embassy in
Manila announced today.</TE>
<TE>   This experimental military exercise could well be repeated in
other trouble spots in the American-led war on terrorism, where
support for a U.S. military presence is often ambiguous at best.
Leaders in Malaysia and Indonesia are watching the venture for
possible applications to their own struggles with terrorists, said
U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Donald Wurster, the top commander of U.S.
soldiers in the region.</TE>
<TE>   It is an exercise in which protecting the troops consumes much of
the mission and Green Berets stretch to devise creative military
strategies--and vague language--to abide by the Philippine
Constitution, which bans foreign troops from operating here except in
certain military exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it is called an exercise, "in Basilan, you have a live,
moving, running enemy, and you have a real mission: recovery of the
Americans and the capture of Abu Sayyaf," said Rudolfo Biazon, a
Philippine opposition senator and a retired four-star general.
"Basilan is a combat zone."</TE>
<TE>   A chart labeled "Combat Scorecard" on the wall of the Manila
headquarters of the Philippine armed forces records the official
tally of war dead: 41 government soldiers and 161 alleged Abu Sayyaf
separatists in recent years. An additional 194 government fighters
and 11 militants are listed as wounded in action. Dozens of Mindanao
residents have been killed in terrorist bombings and slayings linked
to the rebel effort to carve out a Muslim state.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the casualties have occurred on Basilan, which is now the
heart of the U.S.-Philippine exercise. Philippine commanders believe
that in the dense central jungle of this tropical island the size of
Oahu, near the southern tip of the Philippine archipelago, 80 to 100
rebels are holding American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham
and Philippine nurse Deborah Yap.</TE>
<TE>   On Basilan and at the regional military headquarters, located a
ferry ride away in Zamboanga, the 660 U.S. troops are working to
improve the Filipinos' marksmanship, teamwork, map- and
compass-reading skills, medical emergency response capability and
nighttime operating abilities. The Green Berets, meanwhile, are
picking up survival techniques and jungle warfare training
unavailable anywhere in the United States, including how to catch and
skin a lizard. Navy SEALs run Filipino SEALs through water drills.</TE>
<TE>   The limits imposed on the Americans can be finessed.</TE>
<TE>   Rules of engagement delicately negotiated by the two countries bar
the Americans from direct combat and allow them to fire only in
self-defense. That often leaves Col. David Fridovich, commander of
the soldiers from the Army's 1st Special Forces Group in the
Philippines, asking, "How creative can I get?"</TE>
<TE>   Green Berets have traveled to a command post deep in the jungle
where the Abu Sayyaf is believed to be hiding with its hostages.
Philippine army officials report that some Americans have
participated in actions that fall just short of military patrols. If
the Filipinos want advice on a problem, they can often get it.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I going on operations? No," Fridovich said in an interview.
"But I'm certainly advising and assisting to a specific need."</TE>
<TE>   "It looks a lot like combat, but it's counter-terrorism activity,"
said Wurster, who declined to say in detail everything his men are
doing, in order to preserve advantages against the rebels. "Just know
that if you get near them, they'll kill you."</TE>
<TE>   The American soldiers on the island say operating amid a live
threat sharpens their attention.</TE>
<TE>   Still, except for marksmanship training, "as far as I know, the
Americans haven't fired a single shot," said Biazon. Nor have any
been shot.</TE>
<TE>   Fridovich calls the training "absolutely real." In a sniper pit
protecting airstrip construction workers, Marine Pfc. Anthony
Forrester has to distinguish possible rebels from civilians who have
long used the strip as a road.</TE>
<TE>   The men don't sleep well, and they're not supposed to, said
Wurster.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll undo the flap on this pistol when I go to bed tonight," said
Wurster, patting his M-9 sidearm.</TE>
<TE>   One Philippine colonel said the Americans feel "cloistered." But
few American soldiers interviewed expressed impatience with the
unusual mission.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting awhile," Green Beret Capt. Douglas Kim said as
he supervised a dozen Philippine rangers at a Basilan firing range
last week. "We just do what we're told. If they tell us to go out
there, we'll go do it."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf once owned the night because the Philippine military
had no night-flying capability. The Americans have helped equip and
train them to operate around the clock. An army that used to practice
marksmanship only during the day now conducts missions in darkness,
although only one Philippine company has night-vision goggles, said
Col. Paterno Renato Padua, commander of the Philippine army's Scout
Ranger Battalion.</TE>
<TE>   Now, said a smiling Padua, "the night is our friend."</TE>
<TE>   American medical training has saved lives, Philippine commanders
say. Seven Philippine soldiers were wounded in a March 21 firefight
with Abu Sayyaf. The medics who gave them first aid were trained by
the Americans, and U.S. Chinook helicopters pulled the casualties
from Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   Other Americans on Basilan are pursuing a kind of
construction-for-peace plan. Seabees are refurbishing the 1946
airstrip for the Philippine military to use. There are Navy and
Marine teams building wells, piers and bridges on 11 projects that
have the added virtue of pumping $4 million into the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   That contribution does not include the money made by local
entrepreneurs who sell everything from refreshments to telephone
cards at makeshift stands wherever the Americans go.</TE>
<TE>   After the construction chief, Marine Lt. Col. Brian Hearnsberger,
hired 10 local people to chop wood, dozens more arrived looking for
work. Children rush the road to wave at convoys of Humvees, yelling,
"Hey, Joe!"--as in GI Joe.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lt. Col. Roger Griffin: "It's the closest thing to being a
rock star."</TE>

<HD>India and Pakistan Step Up War Rhetoric</HD>
<DH>Asia: New Delhi balks at peace talks and says Al Qaeda is
operating in disputed Kashmir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>India on Tuesday sharply criticized a speech by Pakistan's military
leader as "disappointing and dangerous" and said Al Qaeda terrorists
are now operating in the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   The nuclear-armed South Asian rivals also cranked up their war
rhetoric after Pakistan test-fired another missile capable of
carrying nuclear warheads, the third one since Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite international pressure, India said Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee probably would not hold peace talks soon with
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.</LD>
<TE>   "You cannot put a pistol of terrorism to my temple with the finger
on the trigger and say, 'Dialogue with me, or I will release this
trigger of terrorism,'" Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin offered to bring Vajpayee and
Musharraf together in Kazakhstan next week. Pakistan has accepted.
Singh, however, reiterated that India would not resume talks until
Pakistan stopped attacks in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir
by Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   India's defense minister said fighters from Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda network and from Afghanistan's former ruling Taliban are in the
Pakistani portion of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "We have information that the number of terrorists who are on the
other side of the border.... [are] people who have fled from
Afghanistan, Al Qaeda men and Talibanis," Defense Minister George
Fernandes told Star News Television.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said the presence of U.S. troops in the region is not a
deterrent to a possible strike on Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, meanwhile, kept up diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "President Musharraf is under no doubt about expectations of the
international community to take action, as well as the action he
already has taken, to crack down on cross-border terrorism," British
Foreign Minister Jack Straw said after meeting with Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   Straw planned to see Vajpayee in New Delhi today.</TE>

<HD>Wiretaps May Have Foretold Terror Attacks</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Suspected Al Qaeda operatives taped in Italy
in 2000 discussed airplanes, airports and strikes 'that will never be
forgotten.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Suspected Al Qaeda operatives wiretapped by Italian police in the 13
months preceding Sept. 11 made apparent references to plans for major
attacks involving airports, airplanes and the United States,
according to transcripts obtained by The Times on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials said they would
study the transcripts because the conversations, although open to
interpretation, could refer to the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   A report by a Milan anti-terrorism prosecutor containing the
transcripts suggests that Italian authorities realized sometime after
Sept. 11 that the conversations could be related to the attacks on
the United States.</LD>
<TE>   If that is correct, it raises tantalizing questions about whether
suspects in Italy had advance knowledge of the plot by the Sept. 11
hijackers, an elite group whose operation appears to have been
tightly compartmentalized for maximum secrecy. Moreover, the
intercepts could be another of the indications emerging globally that
authorities missed signs that attacks were in the works.</TE>
<TE>   In one conversation, a suspected Yemeni terrorist tells an
Egyptian based in Italy about a massive strike against the enemies of
Islam involving aircraft and the sky, a blow that "will be written
about in all the newspapers of the world."</TE>
<TE>   "This will be one of those strikes that will never be
forgotten.... This is a terrifying thing. This is a thing that will
spread from south to north, from east to west: The person who came up
with this program is a madman from a madhouse, a madman but a genius.
He is fixated on this program; it will leave everyone turned to ice,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   That dialogue took place Aug. 12, 2000, in a Citroen driven by
Abdelkader Mahmoud Es Sayed, then 39, an Egyptian accused of being Al
Qaeda's top operative in Italy and a man with ties to the inner
circle of Osama bin Laden. Es Sayed had just picked up the Yemeni,
Abdulsalam Ali Ali Abdulrahman, at the Bologna airport, according to
a transcript contained in a report by the Milan prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future, listen to the news and remember these words:
'Above the head' ... remember well, remember well.... The danger in
the airports.... There are clouds in the sky there in international
territory, in that country, the fire has been lit and is awaiting
only the wind," the Yemeni said.</TE>
<TE>   That taped conversation and others surfaced during recent trials
of Milan-based Al Qaeda terrorism suspects who were the object of
intense surveillance and ongoing wiretaps by Italian police in 2000
and 2001. The transcripts are among copious investigative material
that has been scrutinized anew "in the light of the tragic events of
last September," according to the prosecutor's report, dated May 15.</TE>
<TE>   Report Cites Key Figure's Links to U.S., Germany</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that there are "numerous and interesting elements
concerning the relationship of Es Sayed with cells in Germany and the
United States." The leaders of the Sept. 11 plot were based in
Hamburg, Germany, and trained along with the rest of the 19 hijackers
at U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the command structure that operated between
Mohamed Atta, the suspected chief of the hijackers, and Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Italian authorities would not comment Tuesday on the prosecution
report, except to confirm its authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Italian and U.S. anti-terrorism investigators cooperate closely,
and the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported Tuesday that
FBI experts helped Italian police analyze the intercepts, whose sound
quality was impaired by background noise.</TE>
<TE>   But FBI and Justice Department officials said Tuesday that they
planned to review the transcripts and that they were unaware of any
help U.S. officials had provided to the Italians. Several officials
said they were unfamiliar with the transcripts, but one Justice
Department official noted that a small cadre of U.S. intelligence
experts might have been privy to them.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official said that, if accurate, the
recordings would require "serious" review to determine exactly what
they meant and who had the information and when.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the men, Es Sayed, has been known to U.S. law
enforcement for some time. He was named in an April 19 order by the
Treasury Department blocking the assets of suspected terrorists. Es
Sayed was convicted in Egypt in connection with the 1997 massacre of
58 foreign tourists at Luxor, and he was wanted in Italy on charges
of conspiring to traffic in arms, explosives, chemical weapons and
identity papers and aiding illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed fled Italy to Afghanistan in July 2001, after Italian
police rounded up his accomplices in a Tunisian-dominated network
accused of plotting against U.S. targets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being imam of a Milan mosque regarded as an Al
Qaeda operations center, he allegedly commanded a network that
specialized in providing forged documents. He allegedly had close
ties to Ayman Zawahiri, the Egyptian considered Bin Laden's second in
command, as well as extremists in Sudan and Egypt, according to the
Italian report. Es Sayed is believed to have died during the U.S.
military strikes on Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   His visitor traveled on a Yemeni diplomatic passport, according to
the Italian report. Abdulrahman allegedly has ties to Al Qaeda and
"was identified by knowledgeable foreign sources as chief of a Yemeni
political security organization, which provided logistical assistance
and intelligence to the Egyptian terrorist group Al Jihad," the
Italian report said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the two men discussed the U.S. hunt for Bin Laden,
according to the transcripts. The transcripts are less clear about to
what extent, if any, they had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   The comments about major attacks could conceivably refer to other
plots, such as a foiled one to use an airplane against world leaders
assembled for a summit in Genoa, Italy, in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there are intriguing references to secretive
preparations involving the United States and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 24, 2001, police taped a conversation in the Citroen
between Es Sayed and Ben Soltane Adel, a Tunisian later convicted of
belonging to a terrorist cell based in Milan. "Will these work for
the brothers who are going to the United States?" Adel asked,
apparently referring to fake documents.</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed responded angrily, according to the transcript: "Don't
ever say those words again, not even joking!" he said. "If it's
necessary ... whatever place we may be, come up and talk in my ear,
because these are very important things. You must know ... that this
plan is very, very secret, as if you were protecting the security of
the state."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the conversation, some of the hijackers had already
entered the United States and begun flight training, but others had
not.</TE>
<TE>   All of them, however, used their real identities, so they would
not have necessarily needed fraudulent documents provided by
associates in Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Another "very important" conversation, according to the report,
took place Feb. 12, 2001. It was a telephone call from Es Sayed to
the telephone of Abdulrahman, the Yemeni, and was answered by a man
named Abdelwahab.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard you had entered America," Es Sayed said, according to the
transcript.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, but we weren't able to get in," Abdelwahab responded.
"It's our greatest desire and our objective."</TE>
<TE>   That dialogue could be significant because a suspected accomplice
of the hijackers failed to enroll in U.S. flight schools after being
rejected for a visa. That suspect, Ramzi Binalshibh, is a Yemeni who
remained in Hamburg and allegedly helped finance the plotters from
there. But the report does not tie the Milan conversation to
Binalshibh.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the conversation, the two men also discuss a German-based
group, apparently of Islamic extremists, described as "10 men with
whom no one can make contact."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Hamburg cell--whose leaders were in the United
States by the time of the conversation--Al Qaeda also had cells in
Frankfurt and Duisburg.</TE>
<TE>   Wiretaps in Spain Also May Refer to Attacks</TE>
<TE>   The Italian case is not the first in which European investigators
say wiretaps may indicate that suspects were discussing the Sept. 11
attacks ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, a country believed to have been a significant base for
those involved in planning the attacks, authorities charged members
of a Madrid cell as accomplices in the Sept. 11 plot based largely on
wiretaps of Islamic extremists.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified suspect in London told the head of the Madrid cell
in a taped phone call last August that he "was taking courses and had
entered the field of aviation." Spanish investigators interpreted
that and other comments as references to the airborne attack plot.</TE>
<TE>   In the Milan transcripts, Abdulrahman used similar language. He
told Es Sayed: "I'm studying airplanes. I hope, God willing, that I
can bring you a window or a piece of an airplane the next time we see
each other." The transcript says that comment was followed by
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Later, according to the transcript, he said the fight against
Islam's enemies would be waged "with any means we can combat them,
using ... airplanes: They won't be able to stop us even with their
heaviest weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Rotella reported from Paris and Meyer from Washington. Times staff
writer Bob Drogin in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>3 Settlers Slain in W. Bank</HD>
<DH>Violence: Gunman picks off teens at a high school before
being killed by a security official.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A gunman sneaked onto the grounds of an Orthodox Jewish high school
in the West Bank late Tuesday and killed three teenagers, even as
Israeli troops continued their daily raids into Palestinian towns.</LD>
<LD>   The man shot and killed three Israeli students outside a high
school in the settlement of Itamar, near the Palestinian city of
Nablus, settlers and rescue service officials said. The attacker was
shot and killed by the settlement's security chief.</LD>
<LD>   Hezi Katoa, a rescue service worker, told Israel Radio that one
student was found hit by a number of bullets in the chest and that
two more were "lying behind the building with bullet wounds all over
their bodies." All three were dead at the scene, he said.</LD>
<TE>   A few hours earlier, one Israeli motorist was killed and another
wounded in a shooting attack, apparently by a Palestinian gunman,
near the Jewish settlement of Ofra, said rescue services spokesman
Yeruham Mandola.</TE>
<TE>   The violence accompanied repeated Israeli incursions into
Palestinian towns in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Israeli soldiers entered Beitunia, a suburb of the
West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinians said, and surrounded the
house of a prominent Hamas leader. However, the man, Hassan Yusef,
was not there. The Israeli military had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Israel launched the spy satellite Ofek-5,
displaying advanced missile capabilities and restoring a military eye
in the sky after its last spy satellite burned up in the atmosphere
about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Ministry spokesman Yarden Vatikay confirmed that the
satellite was sent into space from a seaside Israeli air force base.
It was launched by a Shavit missile, related to the long-range
Jericho ground-to-ground missile. Foreign experts have said the
Jericho can carry a nuclear warhead; Israeli officials have not
commented on that.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's latest sweep in the West Bank came after a Palestinian
blew himself up outside an ice cream parlor and cafe crowded with
women and children in a Tel Aviv suburb Monday, killing a woman and
her granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, linked to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility and
identified the bomber as Jihad Titi, 18, a cousin of leading Al Aqsa
militant Mahmoud Titi, who was killed in an Israeli tank attack last
week.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, troops in armored personnel carriers and jeeps drove
into the city of Jenin and a nearby refugee camp about 3 a.m. and
left by midday. They arrested eight people, including Rami Awad, the
local leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas. Soldiers also
searched an Islamic school, seizing computer disks, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   There were heavy exchanges of fire with Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem to the south, Israeli forces combed the town for the
third straight day Tuesday, blocking off the Church of the Nativity
to prevent gunmen from taking refuge there.</TE>
<TE>   During Israel's earlier offensive, several dozen gunmen ran into
the church ahead of Israeli forces, setting off a 39-day standoff
that ended with the deportation of 13 of the militants.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Israeli forces arrested four Palestinians and
discovered a bomb and some weapons in the Dahaisha refugee camp next
to Bethlehem, Palestinian security officials said.</TE>

<HD>Libya Puts $2.7-Billion Price on Flight 103</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Kadafi, seeking to end sanctions, offers $10
million per Lockerbie crash victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bold attempt to get off the U.S. terrorism list, Libya is
offering $10 million in compensation for each victim of the 1988
midair bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people, U.S.
officials and lawyers for the families say.</LD>
<LD>   The Libyan offer to pay a total of $2.7 billion in compensation is
also contingent on the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed
against the North African nation by the United States and the United
Nations, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the government of Moammar Kadafi would pay $4
million per victim when the U.N. sanctions are lifted, $4 million
with the removal of the U.S. sanctions and the final $2 million when
Libya is taken off the State Department's list of state sponsors of
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Once the sanctions are lifted and his country is removed from the
terrorism list, experts say, Kadafi could be expected to try to
resume trade with the United States in oil and other goods, win
access to much-needed American technology and even push to
reestablish diplomatic relations with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration does not plan to take a formal stand on
the settlement offer, one of the two major steps demanded by the U.S.
before Libya can even be considered for removal from the terrorism
list. "It's a matter for the families to decide," State Department
spokesman Philip T. Reeker said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is also demanding that Libya acknowledge responsibility
for the attack--a step required to remove the United Nations
sanctions as well. In the past, Kadafi has been reluctant to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the prospects for the offer are Bush
administration suspicions, contained in a recent CIA report, that
Libya is seeking weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   A well-placed U.S. official expressed concern that the offer
could, in effect, turn the victims' families into lobbyists for
Libya.</TE>
<TE>   "This phased offer could wind up putting families in the position
of advocating on behalf of Libya's emancipation from the State
Department list and economic sanctions," the official said. "It's
very clever, perhaps too clever."</TE>
<TE>   Kadafi has made monetary offers to the families in the past, and
relatives of those killed--many of whom joined in a civil suit
against Libya in 1996--greeted the latest news with a certain
caution.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still pretty numb," said Carole G. Johnson, whose 21-year-old
daughter, Beth Ann, was killed in the bombing. "Unfortunately, the
world only understands one form of punishment and it has to be money.
We need to send a message loud and clear to terrorists throughout the
world that there is a price to pay. That's the only way I could
accept the money."</TE>
<TE>   Adelaide E. Marek, whose 30-year-old sister, Elizabeth, was a
passenger on the plane, said she doubted that Kadafi would ever take
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been hearing over the years that he wants to pay us, he
wants to pay us, but the sticking point was taking responsibility,"
she said. "He wants to join the international community. Is the
international community going to accept?"</TE>
<TE>   Martin Indyk, a Mideast scholar at the Brookings Institution, said
he thought that it might.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't judge whether $10 million per victim is adequate
compensation," he said, "but the fact that [Kadafi] is now prepared
to make such an offer is in itself an indication of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kreindler, an attorney for 118 families, said in a statement
that Libya's offer represented "the first time that any of the states
designated as sponsors of terrorism have offered compensation to
families of terror victims."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. sanctions against Libya include a mix of economic and
diplomatic restrictions and bans on airline flights. The U.S.
sanctions bar most trade between American companies and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   Burdened by the tough economic penalties, Libya has been trying to
change its image over the past three years. In 1999, the Kadafi
government turned over two men indicted in the bombing by a Scottish
court, which had jurisdiction in the proceedings because the plane
went down over Lockerbie, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence agent, last year
was found guilty of murder for masterminding the planting of an
explosive device that killed 259 passengers and crew aboard the jumbo
jet and 11 people on the ground. But judges, who heard the trial at a
neutral venue in the Netherlands, acquitted Libyan Arab Airlines
employee Lamen Khalifa Fhimah on grounds that the prosecution had not
proved the case "beyond a reasonable doubt."</TE>
<TE>   In the latest U.S. annual survey of terrorism, released last week,
the State Department reported that of the seven state sponsors of
terrorism, both Libya and Sudan had taken steps "in the right
direction" and were the "closest to understanding what they must do
to get out of the terrorism business."</TE>
<TE>   The report, "Patterns of Global Terrorism 2001," declared that
Libya "appears to have curtailed its support for international
terrorism, although it may maintain residual contacts with a few
groups."</TE>
<TE>   Kadafi has repeatedly denounced terrorism since the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the report noted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the United States reached a settlement totaling $131.8
million with Iran to compensate for the deaths of 290 people when an
Iran Air jetliner was shot down by a U.S. warship in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was downed in the Persian Gulf at the end of the
eight-year Iran-Iraq War by the cruiser Vincennes, whose crew
mistakenly believed that it was being attacked by an Iranian
warplane.</TE>

<HD>Doubts Sprout About Mexico Water Pledges</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Farmers in parched Chihuahua state wonder
where President Fox will find the agua to repay the nation's debt to
U.S., as he has vowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DELICIAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Like many other Mexican farmers in the drought-ravaged border state
of Chihuahua, Enrique Berjes is wondering where President Vicente Fox
will find the water to repay the nation's enormous debt to Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly not from the dried-up reservoirs, rivers and wells that
have kept him and 90% of the area's farmers from even planting this
spring, their 10th year of drought.</LD>
<LD>   And yet Fox has promised to unveil a plan this week by which
Mexico will start paying down the enormous water deficit the U.S.
says the country owes it, water that Mexico has failed to deliver to
U.S. reservoirs per terms of a 1944 water treaty governing the Rio
Grande basin.</LD>
<TE>   The debt has caused economic hardship and mounting political
antagonism in Texas, where many farmers claim Mexico overuses and
wastes the water before it reaches the Rio Grande. Last Thursday,
about 20 Texas farmers used their tractors to block traffic at the
U.S.-Mexico border crossing in Pharr to show their desperation.</TE>
<TE>   But Berjes, 74, says the economic devastation is as bad if not
worse in this once-rich farm region of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, this area was likened to Fresno with mountains--a
rich producer of pecans, wheat, sorghum and soy. Mexicans say drought
has forced them out of compliance with the water treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the capital of agriculture until the water disappeared,
and now it's ruined for everyone," Berjes said.</TE>
<TE>   Once a verdant expanse in this town 50 miles southeast of the
state capital, also called Chihuahua, Berjes' farm is parched and
slowly blending into the surrounding desert. With each passing year,
Berjes has sold off parts of his farm to survive as he waits for the
rain to come.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the crisis has cost Chihuahua billions in crop losses
and 80,000 farm jobs. There has been a slow erosion of the social
fabric as well: The unemployed have migrated to cities such as
Chihuahua looking for work, causing crime rates to rise and taxing
city services.</TE>
<TE>   The drought has also clobbered the state's cattle industry, which
is at the heart of Chihuahua's cowboy culture. Herds statewide have
declined from 2 million head in 1992 to about 800,000 now, according
to Chihuahua state Agriculture Secretary Alejandro Ramirez. The
number of registered cattle brands is down to 50,000 from 90,000 in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't rain this year, I'll sell everything," said Manuel
Terrazas, a Chihuahua rancher who is president of the Chihuahua
Regional Cattlemen's Union. "I've got 40% fewer head of cattle and
I'm battling to keep that."</TE>
<TE>   One-third of the state's thirsty pecan orchards, once a source of
immense prosperity in the state, have been abandoned in recent years
because farmers can't afford to keep the faucets on. Berjes sold his
400-acre pecan orchard in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Berjes' situation is typical in that his irrigation water has been
rationed down to about 3% of what he once received, a ration he has
sold to a neighboring farm. The groundwater has receded so much that
Berjes now must drill wells 1,000 feet deep to reach water, compared
with 500 feet in 1990. And the expense of keeping those pumps running
and maintained has made farming uneconomical.</TE>
<TE>   So, with no small amount of wry skepticism, Berjes is curious to
hear Fox explain how he'll make the water payments. He presumes that
much of it would come from Chihuahua state, which traditionally has
supplied 56% of the water transferred to Texas reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not going to get any from Boquilla, I can tell you that,"
Berjes said, referring to the largest of the state's 10 dams. It's
only 20% full with agua muerto, or dead water, too muddy and
otherwise degraded to use for irrigation, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   It will also be difficult for Fox to squeeze savings out of the
public nonagricultural water system in cities such as Chihuahua,
where citizens already face water rationing and no longer have
24-hour access to water.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's government has said it is requesting major financial
help--as much as $500 million--from the United States to finance up
to 35 waste-water treatment and recycling projects in four Mexican
states that border the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Chihuahua is also pushing the use of hydroponics in raising
vegetable crops and cattle forage. An experimental hydroponics
project run by the state just south of Berjes' farm has 4 acres of
tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers under one roof, using one-thousandth
as much water as comparable open field crops, said Hector Leon
Gallegos, an agricultural advisor to state Gov. Patricio Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "We are preparing ourselves for the absence of rain in the future
of our state," said Leon Gallegos, who added that hydroponic crop
systems have made great strides in efficiency in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   But those projects will take time to develop. So water
savings--and increased transfers to Texas--will take time, state
officials say, even though the national water commission said last
week that it had a plan to repay the water debt within five years.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's water debt has gone from zero in 1992, when the drought
began, to 1.5 million acre-feet today. (An acre-foot refers to the
amount of water it takes to cover an acre of land to a depth of one
foot.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's our position that with the current water storage, projected
inflows and reduced irrigation, Mexico could make deliveries in
partial fulfillment of its obligations," said Sally Spener,
spokeswoman for the U.S. section of the International Boundary and
Water Commission in El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   Berjes shakes his head at the notion of squeezing more water out
of a state he says is bone dry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vulgar saying but true: Debo no niego. Pago no tengo. It
means 'I don't deny I owe, but I can't pay,'" Berjes said.</TE>

<DL>PRATICA DI MARE AIR BASE, Italy</DL>
<LD>PRATICA DI MARE AIR BASE, Italy -- NATO took a step Tuesday that was
at once extraordinary and a recognition of a new reality by formally
bringing Russia into a unique role with the alliance created 53 years
ago to defend the West against the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   Participants at an alliance summit here signed a document under
which Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will work
together to fight terrorism, control the spread of nuclear weapons,
promote arms control, cooperate on such practical matters as
search-and-rescue operations at sea, and react to unspecified
potential "new threats and challenges."</LD>
<LD>   The pact, however, does not give Russia full membership in the
alliance or the power to veto NATO policy decisions.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement reflects the changes that have occurred in the
decade since the fall of communism in Europe and the emergence of a
Russia seeking stronger economic and political ties with nations it
once viewed across a divide of angry rhetoric and devastatingly
lethal weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting held out the prospect of an informal new military
alliance girdling the Earth, stretching from "Vancouver to
Vladivostok," in the words Tuesday of NATO Secretary-General George
Robertson. He hailed the new grouping most of all as a force to
counter the "common enemy": global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and the leaders of NATO's 18 other member nations
sat at a round table in a building at this air base outside Rome,
joined by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. Each delivered brief
prepared comments addressing the new shape of the alliance and its
future role with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Two former foes are now joined as partners, overcoming 50 years
of division and a decade of uncertainty," Bush told the gathering.
The new NATO-Russia Council established by the summit "offers Russia
a path toward forming an alliance with the alliance," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come a long way ... from confrontation to cooperation,"
Putin said. "The significance of this meeting is difficult to
overestimate."</TE>
<TE>   The bitter past was treated with extraordinary good humor. Near
the end of the meeting, Putin cracked, "I think we should rename NATO
headquarters, "Hall of the Soviets.'"</TE>
<TE>   Robertson responded, lest Putin's comment be mistaken: "I declare
that to be a joke."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a joke with an edge. The council gives Russia an
unprecedented role in NATO's deliberations and will allow Moscow's
representatives to work in the alliance's secrecy-bound Brussels
headquarters. All 20 members will be equal, and the council will work
by consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have expressed concern that by ceasing to treat
Russia as a potential enemy, and by taking on more of a political
character, NATO risks losing some of its character as a military
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Russia will not have a veto, however, because any issue can be
withdrawn from council consideration, meaning that NATO's 19 members
could act on their own whenever they deem it necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Coming four days after Bush and Putin signed a treaty that calls
for reducing their arsenals of deployed nuclear warheads by
two-thirds, it is yet another reflection of lingering Cold War
realities quickly giving way to a new geopolitical climate.</TE>
<TE>   Yet aside from opposition to global terrorists and to practical
dangers such as nuclear proliferation, the summit left open the
question: What is NATO against? Or, if Russia does form a genuine
alliance with NATO, what will the new group be against?</TE>
<TE>   Such questions could cause unease in other parts of the world,
particularly China, which has a centuries-long history of troubled
relations with Russia and faces uncertainty about whether its ties
with the United States will move toward greater cooperation or
military rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Vaclav Havel, the Czech president who was jailed as a dissident
during the Communist days, warned in a speech to summit participants
that NATO and Russia must not set up an exclusive club of powerful
northerners.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be quite unfortunate if the partnership we have
established today created the impression that the more affluent
Northern Hemisphere is uniting at the expense of the Southern
Hemisphere," Havel said. "One way or another, the entire planet
should move toward unity."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's terrorist attacks on the United States were repeatedly
cited as the driving force behind the new arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11, 2001, brought death to thousands of people in one act
of terrible, criminal violence," Robertson said. "But it also brought
a message to the leaders of the democratic world: Find solutions, and
find them together."</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared that those
assembled must tell terrorists, "We are stronger, you will never be
able to beat us, so give up this madness."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing a role that Russia has already taken on--joining the
alliance created to fight terrorism--Bush said that the months since
Sept. 11 "have made clear that by working together against these
threats, we multiply our effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other topics for cooperation cited in the declaration
signed by the leaders were crisis management, mutual
confidence-building measures, theater missile-defense systems,
military contacts, defense reform and civilian emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The only significant security incident reported during the summit
came when Italian fighter jets escorted a Sudanese passenger aircraft
out of Italian airspace after the civilian jet failed to establish
required radio contact with air traffic controllers, an Italian
military official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Airbus 320 had been flying over the tiny island of Ponza on a
regular flight plan from Cairo to Paris about 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Created in 1949 as an outgrowth of global divisions in the wake of
World War II, NATO reflected--and perhaps helped promote--decades of
rivalry in Europe between the communist East and the capitalist West.
At the time, the two sides faced each other across the Iron Curtain
with nuclear weapons at the ready.</TE>
<TE>   With the fall of communism, however, Russia has been given to
ever-greater cooperation with the nations of NATO, whose most
recently accepted members were once part of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. As the alliance prepares to expand again by inviting six or
seven likely new members to attend a November summit in Prague, the
Czech capital, NATO has looked for ways to bring Russia into a new
relationship to advance common goals.</TE>
<TE>   Russia is critical of NATO's expansion plan but appears resigned
to it.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the new relationship, "Russia cannot have a veto over
who becomes a member or not," U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
told reporters Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he did not foresee any serious risk that the new
spirit of cooperation could break down, bringing a renewed Russian
threat to the West. "I don't think we're going to see a rerun of this
movie," he said. "The movie didn't play well the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience of the last 10 years is that, slowly but surely,
Russia has come to the realization that its future lies to the West,
and the West is coming to the realization that its future lies also
with Russia," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The now-routine aspect of the new relationship was reflected in
the speed with which the leaders moved through their remarks. Bush
was allotted five minutes; he used three.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be practical, moving step by step," Bush said. "And as
our trust and track record of success grows, so will the breadth and
depth of our work together."</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi, for his part, was clearly delighted to be the summit
host.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this will remain one of the most beautiful memories of my
life, which I hope will go on for more than 100 years," Berlusconi,
65, said in a welcoming address that had many participants repeatedly
smiling or laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Putin stressed that his pro-Western foreign policy doesn't mean
that he will sign on to every U.S. initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely fundamentally important to understand that this
cooperation ... must repose on the stable foundations of
international law" and various international agreements, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The comment could be interpreted as a warning that Russia would
oppose, for example, an attack on Iraq. Russia traditionally argues
that approval by the U.N. Security Council--where it holds a veto--is
required for any such use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Bush flew home after the summit, ending a weeklong trip that
included stops in Germany, Russia and France.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO-Russia Council will be chaired by the alliance's
secretary-general, and meetings among foreign ministers and among
defense ministers will each be held twice a year. Heads of state and
government will meet "as appropriate," according to Tuesday's
declaration.</TE>
<TE>   The document listed examples of goals in various fields:</TE>
<TE>   In anti-terrorism efforts, the 20 countries will cooperate to
counter threats to Russian and NATO military forces, civilian
aircraft and other potential targets. An initial step will be "a
joint assessment of the terrorist threat" to multinational
peacekeeping forces in the Balkans, the declaration said.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts will be made to explore "opportunities for intensified
practical cooperation on protection from nuclear, biological and
chemical agents."</TE>
<TE>   The declaration also foresees development of "inter-operability"
of NATO and Russian military forces "through enhanced joint training
and exercises." The new partners will also "explore the possibility
of establishing an integrated NATO-Russia military training center
for missions to address the challenges of the 21st century."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Plans to Revamp Security Services</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The Palestinian leader hopes his reorganization
of the dozen or so police forces will improve their efficiency. He
also may be trying to keep his job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>Ragtag vigilantes or symbols of national aspiration. Terror
sympathizers, staunch guardians or Keystone Cops. The Palestinian
security services have been called a lot of things, but efficient and
streamlined are generally not among them.</LD>
<LD>   Yasser Arafat hopes to change that with a proposal released this
week under which his Palestinian Authority's dozen or so security
forces would be consolidated into four, with clear lines of
authority, human rights safeguards and civic oversight.</LD>
<LD>   Few believe that the 72-year-old Palestinian leader has suddenly
become a champion of democracy or power-sharing. A more likely
explanation: By launching a preemptive strike in the face of a
growing chorus of domestic and overseas critics, he is trying to
seize the initiative, bolster his standing with the Palestinian
people--and keep his job.</LD>
<TE>   The plan, as outlined by the Palestinian Al Ayyam newspaper and a
senior Palestinian official, would create four new services: police,
internal and external security forces roughly analogous to the FBI
and CIA, and a general security arm to control the borders.</TE>
<TE>   All four would fall under the Interior Ministry. Only the police
and internal security would be allowed to make arrests, and all
civilian cases would be handled by the attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Although the structure may look good on paper, the real test will
be in implementation. Arafat retains de facto control over the
Interior Ministry, for instance, and could easily circumvent
institutional safeguards at will by packing the ranks with cronies.</TE>
<TE>   And though the plan attempts to address critics' charges related
to corruption, abuse of power and human rights violations, it does
little directly to halt attacks by militia gunmen or suicide bombers.
That is a treacherous issue politically for Arafat, given the general
Palestinian perception that these are freedom fighters, not
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also is gambling that the plan will be enough to counter
Israel's argument in Washington that the Palestinian Authority and
its security forces are so far beyond repair that only new
leadership--as well as continued Israeli military occupation and
incursions--can counter Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush plans to send CIA Director George J. Tenet to the
region as early as this week to confer on a new structure for
Palestinian security forces, and the spy chief's verdict will be key.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the Israelis haven't been impressed with the latest
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Cosmetic reforms in the security structure are not enough," said
Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "If
money and control remain in the hands of Arafat, nothing changes."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian security agencies employ between 30,000 and 40,000
people in possession of 8,000 to 40,000 weapons, depending on how
it's all counted. Each service, in turn, is divided into two parts to
serve the geographically separated West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Lines Are Blurry</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, lines of authority, function and duties blur.
Israeli roadblocks and military strikes have further undermined the
services' roles and ability to coordinate.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian aviation police, for instance, have three planes
based in Egypt, where they are less likely to be destroyed by the
Israeli military. Even if the police flew the aircraft home, there is
no place to land, given that the airport in Gaza has been shelled and
its runway dug up by Israeli army bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   The maritime police lost their only ship, a modified fishing
vessel used for training, in a recent Israeli strike. And Israel has
steadily pared the distance even small boats are allowed to sail
offshore to three nautical miles from 20.</TE>
<TE>   Maritime police based in landlocked Bethlehem spend their days
guarding a helipad that's seen one landing in 18 months. There's
little chance things will get busier: Israel destroyed the
Palestinian Authority's three helicopters earlier this year. The
unit's members are well educated, generally proud of their jobs and
hope one day to use their merchant marine training. For now, they're
35 miles inland, separated from the sea by Israeli checkpoints and
travel restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our ocean," said Sub-Lt. Mohammed Thabet, pointing to a
nearby water tank overlooking the city. "And it's empty."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping your sense of humor helps, given the months of sustained
Israeli attacks against Palestinian police stations, training
facilities, weaponry and vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In better days at the Gaza City police complex, once a proud
showcase of the Palestinian Authority, 3,000 police and cadets
worked, trained and slept. Now all but two of the 28 buildings have
been reduced to rubble. A few police officers sit guarding the
concrete chunks that once were four- and five-story buildings, the
floors now layered like sliced bread.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's dampened our spirits. It's also made us angry,"
said a senior police officer, who now works out of a tent. "But we're
still determined to try and do our job."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials say the punitive steps against Palestinian
targets are the only way to persuade Arafat to end the attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security officials counter that it's impossible to
police anything when their staffs, buildings and infrastructure are
under constant attack. Israel's intention, they argue, is to sow
disorganization and thereby justify further crackdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can't even send police out on patrol, how can I possibly
guarantee security?" said Brig. Gen. Osama Ali, chairman of Gaza's
regional security committee.</TE>
<TE>   While Israel has added to the Palestinian Authority's security
problems, the Palestinians have done plenty of damage themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Pay as low as $200 a month, paychecks that are delayed for weeks
and the Palestinian Authority's financial woes have prompted many
officers to look for extracurricular work, allegedly including
trafficking in stolen vehicles, stealing and soliciting protection
money.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also charge that the security services are organized to
serve one man--Arafat--over the interests of the state. In what some
analysts say amounts to a classic divide-and-conquer strategy, the
Palestinian leader has made himself sole arbiter as the units
squabble over budget and turf.</TE>
<TE>   Rights Abuses Alleged</TE>
<TE>   Human rights watchdogs say Palestinian military courts and jails
that function free of civil oversight, and security forces that
operate against political prisoners and rivals, have spurred abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We seek a state with a security apparatus, not a state beholden
to a security apparatus," said Jabr Wishah, director-general of the
Palestinian Center for Human Rights. "The rule of law should be
master and maestro."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials admit to problems but say the latest plan
and a promised general election will go a long way. They claim
they're perfectly capable of cleaning their own house--for the sake
of the Palestinian people--if Israel would only give them a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The duties of the security service must be clear, and there must
be no overlapping between the different services in their work in the
field for the sake of founding a Palestinian civil society that
respects pluralism and democracy," Gaza intelligence chief Maj. Gen.
Amin Hindi told Al Quds, a Palestinian newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Officers say they welcome U.S. technical aid, CIA training, new
equipment and advice, but draw the line at Washington micromanaging
reforms. Not only could this doom them to failure, it could also
undermine longer-term Israeli and U.S. interests, they argue.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the U.S. or Israel has weighed in by favoring a
particular Palestinian security official or alternative leader, for
instance, that person has tended to be discredited in the eyes of
fellow Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, argues Col. Samir Masharawi, a leader in Gaza with
Arafat's Fatah movement and a member of the Preventive Security
Service, too much Israeli and U.S. pressure on the Palestinian
Authority could spur infighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to their aims, this could lead to more suicide attacks
because no one would be even nominally in control," he said. "Israel
would also pay the price."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1995, Israeli and Palestinian security teams
conducted joint patrols in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although the
patrols ended after a Palestinian security official shot and killed
his Israeli police partner at the time the current uprising began in
the fall of 2000, those involved say that at their best, the patrols
forced the two sides to cooperate--even, at times, to depend on each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd sometimes have food together, even buy meat and grill it,"
recalled Palestinian Lt. Abu Ramai of the district coordination
office. "There was a good atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Zaidan Mustafan, Israeli deputy commander at the time, echoed
Ramai's view and said the experience, for a time, spurred hope of
Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   That all seems like ancient history now as security forces and
citizens on both sides find themselves feeling anything but secure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to imagine working together now," Ramai said.
"There's just been too much lost trust."</TE>

<HD>People's Court for Genocide</HD>
<DH>Eight years after the Rwandan slaughter, the overwhelmed
justice system turns to villagers, including survivors, to pass
judgment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KIGALI, Rwanda</DL>
<LD>Eight years ago, roving gangs of militia members killed his parents,
his wife, their four young children and 19 other close relatives
during the genocide of ethnic Tutsis. Now Lin Rusekampunzi is getting
ready to pass judgment on the accused.</LD>
<LD>   In the United States, the 43-year-old mechanic would be
automatically disqualified from sitting on a jury hearing the case.
But this is Rwanda, where Rusekampunzi--who has no legal
training--will sit as a judge weighing evidence against the people
accused of hacking his relatives to death with machetes and torching
their houses.</LD>
<LD>   This Central African country is embarking on an a novel
experiment: Accused killers will face genocide survivors in outdoor
tribunals where villagers will assemble on hillsides and city streets
to hear charges against their neighbors in orderly, but informal,
gatherings. Everyone can participate and those charged can either
defend themselves or confess and beg forgiveness.</LD>
<TE>   Acting as final arbiters will be 254,000 judges who recently won
local elections to 19-member tribunals known as gacaca--which in the
Kinyarwanda language means "justice on the grass."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the judges are peasants. Many are illiterate. Although
they will judge people accused of committing some of the gravest
crimes against humanity, almost all lack legal experience. And like
Rusekampunzi, many will be asked to decide the fate of people who
killed their friends and families.</TE>
<TE>   Gacaca (pronounced ga-chacha) will be a mix of courtroom drama,
town meeting and group therapy. In the next few months, villagers
will begin gathering to hear government prosecutors present cases
against 110,000 defendants accused of participating in Rwanda's
genocide--in which more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
slaughtered over a 100-day period.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers will be encouraged to recount their genocide experiences
and testify for or against the defendants. In the end, gacaca judges
will decide whether the accused will go free or serve sentences
ranging from community service to 25-year prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   International observers worry because defendants will not be
allowed to cross-examine their accusers or even to have the right to
an attorney. But Rwandan officials say gacaca is not geared toward
offering the same legal rights available to defendants in the classic
legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Jurists here say such systems take too long and are ill-suited for
Rwandan inmates, many of whom have been awaiting trial in overcrowded
prisons for the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, the United Nations war crimes tribunal set up in
Arusha, Tanzania, to try the architects of the Rwandan genocide has
convicted only eight people. There has been one acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period--even though nearly all of Rwanda's judges
and lawyers had been slaughtered--the country's justice system
managed to try 5,500 other defendants and found 80% guilty. At that
pace, it would take about 200 years to try the remaining defendants.</TE>
<TE>   So the country has returned to gacaca--community courts popular in
precolonial Rwanda--with the hope that mass informal trials will
expedite justice and heal rifts between Hutus and Tutsis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N.-sponsored war crimes tribunal and Rwanda's magistrate
courts will continue to try those suspected of directing the
genocide. The gacaca tribunals will try the foot soldiers--accused
killers and their accomplices, people who assaulted others without
intending to kill and those who looted and destroyed property.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, gacaca mainly dealt with civil conflicts such as
marriage problems or land disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional gacacas preferred reconciliation to retribution. They
were not intended to determine guilt as much as to restore harmony in
society and rehabilitate people responsible for the disorder. Many
feel that because of the genocide's magnitude, the country would be
better served by a justice focused on healing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no justice for crimes of mass violence," Gerald Gahima,
Rwanda's attorney general, said recently. "Where participation in
atrocities is widespread, justice can only be symbolic."</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Tensions</TE>
<TE>   Exploded in 1994</TE>
<TE>   Rwanda's ethnic rivalries, which stretch back generations, came to
a head in April 1994, when a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana, along with the president of neighboring Burundi, was
shot down over Kigali, the Rwandan capital, killing everyone aboard.
Civil war was raging at the time, as Habyarimana's Hutu government
crumbled and Tutsi rebels advanced to seize control.</TE>
<TE>   Extremists from the majority Hutu government used the attack on
the president's plane as justification to wipe out the minority
Tutsis. Hutus answered calls broadcast on the radio to kill the
unarmed Tutsi population. For 100 days, soldiers, militia members and
ordinary Hutu citizens--wielding guns, machetes and garden
implements--slaughtered more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus
who sympathized with the Tutsis or refused to kill them.</TE>
<TE>   In the frenzy, neighbors killed neighbors. Hutu husbands killed
their Tutsi wives and children. Some priests turned against their
parishes, inviting Hutu militia members to use bulldozers and crush
the churches where hundreds were hiding.</TE>
<TE>   The slaughter of 8,000 a day left Rwanda awash in blood. Piles of
corpses rotted in the African sun. Bodies choked a river that fed the
Nile. About 250,000 Rwandan women who were not killed were raped and
tortured, and about 70% of them were infected with HIV, which causes
AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   On a trip here in 1998, President Clinton acknowledged that "the
United States and the world community did not do as much as we could
have and should have done to try to limit what occurred" during the
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, the European Union and prominent international
agencies are pumping in several million dollars to help make gacaca
work, despite concerns that the tribunals will not provide defendants
with basic legal rights.</TE>
<TE>   Even Human Rights Watch, which has been critical of some human
rights abuses here, said that despite its flaws, gacaca is the only
hope for prisoners detained in inhumane conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to predict what will happen, said the group's
Rwanda specialist Alison Des Forges, "but gacaca is the only
guarantee that the judicial process in Rwanda will move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The Accused Hope for</TE>
<TE>   Leniency Under Gacaca</TE>
<TE>   Jean Baptiste Ntivuguruzwa, 38, hopes gacaca will be his ticket
out of Kigali Central Prison.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, Ntivuguruzwa said, he lived with the guilt of
killing his longtime Tutsi neighbor, a night watchman arrested at one
of numerous checkpoints set up by soldiers to snare Tutsis.</TE>
<TE>   Ntivuguruzwa said he obeyed soldiers' orders to kill the man.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't give it much thought," he said from the prison. "In
those days, everyone was killing Tutsis and some important men were
telling me to do it. So I gave him a strong blow on the head with a
heavy stick."</TE>
<TE>   Ntivuguruzwa, a father of three, recently confessed his crime to
prison authorities.</TE>
<TE>   At the Kigali Central Prison, about 1,200 of the 7,000 inmates
have confessed. Under gacaca law, those who confess and identify
their partners in crime will have their sentences significantly
reduced. Ntivuguruzwa, who faced a 25-year sentence, might serve only
a few more years before he is released.</TE>
<TE>   "If all Rwandans would say what happened, the truth will be our
savior," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another inmate, Ancilla Mukaminega, said she hopes gacaca judges
will show mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Mukaminega, 43, was among the hundreds of Rwandans
who slaughtered their relatives because they had Tutsi blood.
Mukaminega, a Hutu, poisoned her five young children because their
father was a Tutsi, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Mukaminega said she poured a potent insecticide down her
children's throats after her relatives refused to help hide them from
Hutus. She too swallowed the insecticide, but a neighbor saved her
life by pouring milk down her throat, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the gacaca people will see that living, knowing what I
did to my own flesh and blood, is enough punishment for me," she
said. "My mind is my prison, my torture chamber."</TE>
<TE>   Town Assembly Offers</TE>
<TE>   Glimpse of Future Trials</TE>
<TE>   Rwandans recently had a glimpse of how gacaca will work when
government prosecutors went to Gitarama, a small town about 30 miles
south of Kigali, to collect evidence against some detainees who lived
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have little or no evidence against about 20,000 of the
detainees, according to Penal Reform International, a London-based
group working with the government to improve conditions in local
prisons. Prosecutors are only now gathering information and
assembling files to present before gacaca tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   In Gitarama, a young prosecutor pointed to a 25-year-old woman
named Florence he had brought with him, asking a small crowd if
anyone knew her.</TE>
<TE>   "I know her!" one woman shouted out. "She is innocent."</TE>
<TE>   "How did she behave during the war?" the prosecutor asked.</TE>
<TE>   When no one responded, the prosecutor turned to Florence and
asked, "How long have you been in prison?"</TE>
<TE>   "About seven years," she responded meekly.</TE>
<TE>   "She will soon have spent seven years in prison," he said to men
in the crowd. "She has been lucky because she has been protected from
the pandemic, AIDS. Do not hesitate to take her as your bride."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor ordered Florence's release.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the prosecutor had presented a man named Sylvestre. A
young woman responded that he had killed her husband during the
genocide. Another said he had killed her two brothers, Pascal and
Frederic, and Pascal's six children.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you in agreement with all that they have said?" the
prosecutor asked. "Yes, I agree," Sylvestre said.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you tell us their names?"</TE>
<TE>   "I no longer remember their names, but I agree."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor asked the crowd to support the gacaca process.</TE>
<TE>   "Free yourselves. I have already been freed. You cannot bring the
dead back to life," the prosecutor implored the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics, Supporters</TE>
<TE>   Await Outcomes</TE>
<TE>   Many Tutsis say they are skeptical of gacaca.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the real truth will come out," said Josephine
Kalisa, whose husband and four children, ages 2 to 9, were killed in
the genocide. "Gacaca will free dangerous people who should be in
prison."</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot believe that a person who has killed and raped should be
let out," said another woman who identified herself as a gang-rape
victim. "Do you think I could live or sleep in peace if the men who
raped me come back to the village?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, most survivors support gacaca, according to Antoine
Mugesera, president of the main survivors group, Ibuka, which means
"remember."</TE>
<TE>   "Gacaca will help us know if we can live together," said Mugesera,
whose father, brother and three sisters were killed in the genocide.
"It will tell us who is innocent and who committed the crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Some Rwandans have concerns about the independence of the judges.
Tutsis worry because they say people who committed genocidal crimes
have been elected to gacaca courts, while Hutus fear that Tutsis will
not give defendants a fair hearing. "How can people judge others when
they have vengeance in their hearts?" asked a Hutu man whose three
brothers are awaiting trial for killing their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Rusekampunzi, the gacaca judge, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "In the months or even first few years after the genocide, I
wanted revenge," he said. "But with time, the fire has died down. If
the people who killed my family admit that they did wrong, I'll
forgive them."</TE>
<TE>   By many estimates, up to 20% of the 110,000 prisoners awaiting
trial are innocent. Many people were detained only on the accusation
of neighbors who coveted their cows, houses and other property.</TE>
<TE>   Experts anticipate that thousands of detainees will be sent back
to their small towns and rural villages. So far, the Rwandan
government and international donors have no plan to reintegrate them
into society or even provide counseling for victims who might relive
the horrors of the genocide once testimonies begin.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters and critics of gacaca question whether the government
can surmount enormous bureaucratic and logistical problems.</TE>
<TE>   Although gacaca will likely heal some wounds, it also could open
new ones. And testimony in gacaca courts could lead to the arrests of
thousands more, keeping the tribunals in business for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Mugesera, the president of the Ibuka survivors group, said people
should give gacaca a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about truth telling," Mugesera said. "If one-quarter
of the truth comes out in gacaca, Rwanda will be better off."</TE>

<HD>Divisions Slow U.S. Push for Mideast Peace</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Clash of approaches to final settlement,
security bogs down initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's first major peace initiative in the Middle
East appears to be foundering only weeks after it was launched.</LD>
<LD>   Plans to halt the violence and inject new energy into peace
efforts are now bogged down by sharp divisions both in Washington and
in the region. The tensions have been accentuated by the renewal of
Palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against Israeli targets,
which have triggered fears that the situation could soon careen out
of control again.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, three Israeli teenagers were killed at an Orthodox
high school in the Jewish settlement of Itamar in the occupied West
Bank by an infiltrator, who was later shot dead by the local security
chief. An Israeli motorist near the Jewish settlement of Ofra also
was killed, apparently by a Palestinian gunman.</LD>
<TE>   The attacks coincided with new Israeli incursions into the West
Bank in search of militants and with a suicide bombing at a cafe near
Tel Aviv on Monday that killed two.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians are almost back to
where they were before U.S. intervention last month led to a
temporary lull in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who returned from a weeklong European trip Tuesday
night, will hold talks with his top national security team today.
Administration officials say that issues to be discussed include
whether to introduce specific U.S. proposals on both a timetable and
the basic framework for restarting talks between the Palestinians and
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The president expressed growing concern Tuesday about the
escalating hostilities in the Middle East as he wrapped up his
European trip with a stop in Rome. "We strongly deplore and condemn
terrorist violence," he said. "There are people who don't want peace
and therefore they are willing to kill to make sure we don't have
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, his administration dispatched William Burns, the
State Department's top Mideast specialist, to the region and said CIA
Director George J. Tenet is scheduled to go at week's end.</TE>
<TE>   Burns is expected to press the Palestinians on political reforms
and to explore with both sides the terms for renewing political
negotiations. Tenet is charged with reviving talks between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority on security arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Yet U.S. officials acknowledge that plans to hold an international
conference with all the major Mideast players as early as June are
rapidly fading. The talk is now about a "summer conference."</TE>
<TE>   Within the administration, a complex situation has been made more
difficult by splits over a kind of chicken-and-egg argument, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the debate is whether to base U.S. policy on
"conflict resolution," as the Palestinians and moderate Arabs insist,
or "conflict management," the approach preferred by the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Under the conflict resolution model, the goal of resumed talks
would be to push as fast as possible to settle the half-century-old
Middle East conflict--an option the State Department now supports in
principle.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell also has accepted, albeit
without great enthusiasm, the Arab argument that Yasser Arafat is the
elected representative of the Palestinian people and thus the road to
peace must include him, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Under the conflict management model favored by Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, the emphasis of talks would be on security
issues aimed at curtailing violence. With support from Bush
administration hawks, particularly in the Pentagon, he insists that
no talks on a political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute
should begin until Israel's security is guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also believes that Arafat is not a suitable partner for
peace and that no political talks should include him.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's U.S. backers are now arguing that the Palestinian
Authority must be thoroughly reformed--a prolonged process that would
include restructuring it in a way that would take key decisions away
from Arafat--before Israel should be pressed by Washington to enter
talks, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, who has traveled several times to the Middle East on
diplomatic missions, repeatedly tried to delay his departure because
the basic aspects of this argument have not yet been sorted out, U.S.
officials say. He will be a critical part of the White House talks
today, administration sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The halting pace of U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East was
underscored by comments by Powell on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get reports back from Mr. Tenet and Ambassador Burns and
we consult with a lot of other people, we will start to integrate all
this information and see what next steps should be taken," he said at
a news conference in Italy, where he was traveling with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the administration is not prepared to put forward a plan
with specific timetables, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and Tenet are expected to return with reports before Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak visits Washington late next week.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics charge that Bush has not yet made the pivotal
commitment required to get the Israelis and Palestinians to the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see an expression of political will in the White House to
make this a top priority," said Shibley Telhami, a professor at the
University of Maryland. "It's more conflict management than conflict
resolution--a diplomatic effort to reduce the level of tension but
not to put all the effort required to get a settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Wright reported from Washington and Wilkinson from Jerusalem.</TE>

<HD>Chandra Levy Is Mourned as 'Modesto's Daughter'</HD>
<DH>Memorial: About 1,200 people attend a tribute to the slain
former intern and her family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>As investigators 3,000 miles away tried to piece together the last
moments of Chandra Ann Levy, her family and friends gathered in her
hometown Tuesday to recall a life that had nothing to do with murder
or political scandal.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,200 people at Modesto's Centre Plaza paid tribute to the
24-year-old former government intern and her parents, who withstood a
year of uncertainty about their oldest child's whereabouts while
comforting other families with missing children.</LD>
<LD>   People came from every religious and ethnic community in this San
Joaquin Valley town and every walk of life, from the wealthy to the
homeless. There were blacks, whites, Latinos, Assyrians, Hmong, men
in yarmulkes, Sikhs in turbans, seniors in wheelchairs and led by
guide dogs.</LD>
<TE>   They listened to the strains of Hebrew music by a quartet from the
local symphony and stared into the blown-up photos of young Chandra
eating cotton candy and mugging on the front porch with her
grandmother, Lee. The grandmother spoke about a trip to Paris she had
taken with Chandra a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Chandra was only 14 but already was stubbornly independent. She
insisted on taking the subway by herself from the hotel to the Louvre
museum. "I watched as Chandra vanished into the crowd," she said. "I
feel now that she has vanished into the universe."</TE>
<TE>   There was no mention of Gary Condit, the local congressman whose
relationship with Levy became last summer's tabloid fodder. There was
no mention of Rock Creek Park, where her remains were found last week
in a secluded area deep in the woods. There was no speculation as to
who killed her or why. Hundreds of TV cameras were kept at bay, not
allowed inside the memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   This was a day, rather, that kept a tight focus on the local girl
who grew up thinking she might become a sports reporter and then
dreamed of becoming an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   Chandra had finally returned home, Naranjan Samra said, if not in
body at least in his mind's eye. "She doesn't belong to one family
anymore," said the Sikh peach farmer, who has three grown daughters.
"She is Modesto's daughter now."</TE>
<TE>   Many had come to honor Chandra's mother, Susan Levy, who has spent
much of her life here reaching out to neighbors and various ethnic
communities. Patricia Howard's daughter, Tameka, 16, disappeared last
Christmas and she didn't know where to turn. Then Susan Levy stepped
in, giving her counsel and introducing her to a lawyer and experts on
missing teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt Mrs. Levy's love and respect for my family, and I'll never
forget that," Howard said. "My daughter was gone two weeks and it
felt like forever. Mrs. Levy's daughter will never come home."</TE>
<TE>   Tameka, a runaway, was sitting beside her mother at the morning
memorial, still feeling guilty for having put Howard through so much
torment. "It could have been me in the same situation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The service began with volunteers passing around huge bowls of
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Chandra's favorite. As people filed in
and signed one of five guest books, some brought red roses, sympathy
cards, poems and books with titles such as "On Children and Death."</TE>
<TE>   The Levys--Dr. Robert, Susan, and 21-year-old son Adam--were
flanked by their Washington attorney Billy Martin and one of his
assistants. The Levy men were then handed black yarmulkes, and as the
family entered the large hall, the crowd stood in unison.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Paul Gordon said this was a gathering to speak of and share
and honor "a good person taken from us too soon." He said that a year
ago, when the terrible journey began, he searched through Jewish text
for something to comfort a family whose child is missing. He said he
found none, so he wrote his own prayer to the Levys. "In the search
for answers, let hope dwell in your midst."</TE>
<TE>   Below the rabbi stood the giant photo that had looked out at the
faces of so many TV viewers during the 13 months since Chandra's May
1, 2001, vanishing. Not long after came the disclosure from her aunt
and uncle that she was having an affair with Condit. The photo showed
her with chin resting on crossed arms. She wore neither a frown nor a
smile but a twinkle.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Chandra looked like Betty Boop," her grandmother said,
smiling. "She had pink cheeks and a pout on her lips and all she
lacked was a curl in the middle of her forehead."</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie White, a friend since childhood, read a last letter she
had written to Chandra a few days ago. She recalled the quiet girl
who went off to college at San Francisco State and blossomed into a
"confident, outgoing and beautiful woman." Another friend remembered
her intoxicating laugh and how she snubbed convention, choosing to
wear her Modesto Police Explorer Scout uniform in public although she
was off duty and people might think it weird.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, Adam, said he had a strange experience not long after
Chandra disappeared. He had never before shown an interest in the
piano, his sister's instrument, and could hardly hold a tune. A few
weeks after she was gone, he started playing by ear--entire songs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a sign from her. She transformed part of her being
into me and everyone she cares about," he said. "She became another
form of energy."</TE>

<HD>Texas Executes Young Killer of U.S. Judge's Father</HD>
<DH>Justice: A global outcry against the death penalty fails to
gain a reprieve for the inmate who, at 17, murdered the man in a
bungled carjacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>Napoleon Beazley, convicted of killing the father of a federal judge
when he was 17, was executed Tuesday, the 11th inmate to be put to
death in the state since 1976 for a crime committed while a juvenile.</LD>
<LD>   Beazley was executed by injection after the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles, Gov. Rick Perry and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to
commute his death sentence to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Strapped to a gurney in the death chamber, Beazley, 25, turned his
head to look at the daughter of the man he killed. When asked if he
had any final words, Beazley paused, looked once again at the
daughter and shook his head no.</LD>
<TE>   In a written statement released after his execution, Beazley
wrote: "The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it
was senseless.... I'm sorry it was something in me that caused all of
this to happen to begin with."</TE>
<TE>   Beazley's case attracted international attention because his age
stirred debate over capital punishment for youths and because the
murder victim, a prominent East Texas oilman, was the father of a
federal judge with professional ties to U.S. Supreme Court justices.</TE>
<TE>   Beazley was a star athlete, class president and small-time drug
dealer in rural Grapeland, Texas, when he and two friends hatched a
plan to steal a car in 1994. While scouting the roads in the East
Texas city of Tyler, they spotted John Luttig and his wife, Bobbie,
who were driving home from Bible study in a Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   The trio confronted the Luttigs after they stepped out of their
car, said prosecutors. John Luttig, 63, was killed by two gunshots to
the head. His wife survived the bungled carjacking by falling to the
ground and feigning death.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous tip led police to Beazley and his accomplices, Cedric
and Donald Coleman. The Coleman brothers received life sentences in
return for testifying against Beazley.</TE>
<TE>   Beazley was sentenced to death in 1995 by a jury unswayed by
lawyers arguing that his age was a mitigating factor.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, Beazley became a rallying point for groups
opposed to capital punishment for juveniles. The European Union,
Amnesty International and the American Bar Assn. worked to save
Beazley's life, as did Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu and the Texas
judge who presided over Beazley's murder trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I am astounded that Texas and a few other states in the United
States take children from their families and execute them," wrote
Tutu in a letter opposing Beazley's execution.</TE>
<TE>   Smith County Dist. Atty. Jack Skeen Jr. stood firm in his resolve
to see the jury's sentence carried out. "This has been almost eight
years to the day since the capital murder of John Luttig in front of
his wife, and it is time for justice to be carried out in this case,"
Skeen said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Beazley faced execution last year after the U.S. Supreme Court
denied a federal reprieve. In an unusual move, three
justices--Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and Clarence
Thomas--recused themselves from the case, citing professional ties
with the victim's son, federal Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael
Luttig of Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours before his scheduled Aug. 15 execution, the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals granted a rare stay to study the case. That stay
was vacated in April.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, protesters milled outside the red-brick building that
houses the Texas death chamber, holding placards and chanting.</TE>
<TE>   As the hands on the prison watchtower moved slowly toward the 6
p.m. execution, Brenda Richard, a friend of Beazley's, sat on a curb
and wept.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sympathy for the Luttig famly," Richard said, "but it's
not going to bring them peace now that Napoleon is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Texas is one of 22 states that allow the death penalty for capital
crimes committed by those younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   Beazley is the 14th death row inmate executed this year in Texas.
Five executions are scheduled in June.</TE>

<HD>4 Bodies Found in Bridge Wreckage</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: The death toll increases to 13 in the Oklahoma
collapse, caused by a barge.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEBBERS FALLS, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Rescuers hoisted two vehicles holding four bodies out of the murky
Arkansas River on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from the collapse
of an interstate bridge to 13.</LD>
<LD>   Lightning, rain and rising waters hampered the rescuers, who
picked their way through the muddy water searching for an unknown
number of people still missing after an out-of-control barge hit the
Interstate 40 bridge and knocked out a 500-foot section of highway.</LD>
<LD>   "We're determined because we know there's family members out there
wondering if one of their own is in here," said Dennis Splawn, a
diver with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.</LD>
<TE>   The bodies of seven women and six men have been recovered from the
waters below the bridge, said highway patrol Lt. Chris West. With the
help of sonar, a crane had hoisted 10 vehicles from the mangled
concrete and twisted steel.</TE>
<TE>   A champion horse trainer and a police detective were among those
killed, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 families of supposed victims waited at the Webbers Falls
City Hall for news. About a dozen vehicles plummeted into the water
Sunday morning after the barge hit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, an investigator said towboat crew members'
accounts support the towboat company's contention that the pilot had
blacked out.</TE>
<TE>   George Black of the National Transportation Safety Board said a
crewman who visited with captain Joe Dedmon five to 10 minutes before
the accident said everything seemed normal.</TE>
<TE>   Others who were not with the captain said they heard no alarm or
change in the sound of the engine that would indicate he was trying
to avoid a crash, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Dedmon, who tested negative for drugs and alcohol, was to be
interviewed by NTSB investigators. His brother, Ray Dedmon of
Raymond, Miss., said the captain has no medical conditions that would
have caused him to pass out.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Shanahan, 49, was returning to Texas with another horse
trainer, Maggie Green, when their truck and a trailer hauling four
horses plunged off the bridge, family members said. Searchers have
pulled three horses out of the river. A former Texas Youth Rodeo
champion, Shanahan trained horses for barrel racing.</TE>
<TE>   Norman police Det. Wayne Martin and his wife, Susan, were heading
to Arkansas for a family reunion Sunday but never arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pretty well resolved to the facts," said Norman police Lt.
Glenn Dobry. "It's extremely tough."</TE>

<HD>Levy Was Slain by Unknown Means, Examiners Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Chandra Levy was slain soon after her disappearance
last year, but forensic tests on her remains could not determine
exactly how the former federal intern died, the District of
Columbia's chief medical examiner ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite reports indicating that Levy's skull was cracked and that
she might have been restrained by her own knotted clothes, chief
medical examiner Jonathan L. Arden said he could not "conclusively
ascertain the specific injury that caused her death."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Arden said, he based his conclusion of homicide on the
"circumstances of her disappearance and discovery" and on personal
effects found near the remains of the 24-year-old Modesto native.</LD>
<TE>   The items reportedly included a USC sweatshirt, leggings, a sports
bra, one running shoe and a personal stereo and headphones. Deputy
D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer said Levy's keys
have not been found.</TE>
<TE>   After a week spent analyzing Levy's remains, Arden said, he was
unable to provide a precise date of her death. But he said it was
"consistent with the time frame in which she disappeared" from her
Dupont Circle apartment sometime after May 1, 2001. Arden said he
also was unable to determine whether Levy had been assaulted before
her death.</TE>
<TE>   The paucity of medical conclusions is a clear sign of the
difficulties that police face as they attempt to detail Levy's last
hours and track her killer.</TE>
<TE>   The shabby state of her remains is the most immediate obstacle.
More than 13 months of erosion and exposure limited the usefulness of
the nearly complete skeleton that police recovered last week on a
remote slope in this city's sprawling Rock Creek Park.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of any remaining soft tissue, sources said, prevented
forensic experts and detectives from narrowing in on the exact cause
of death, a category Arden described Tuesday as "inconclusive."</TE>
<TE>   If Levy was strangled, for instance, there is nothing that
forensic specialists could use to clearly establish that manner of
death. And while Arden and other examiners inspected for evidence
that Levy may have died of deliberate "blunt force trauma," a crack
in the cranium found last week did not provide a neat answer.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is the body's deteriorated and there's nothing you can
do," one former D.C. police official said. "They've lost
opportunities. Tying someone to that scene is going to be tough."</TE>
<TE>   Without telltale evidence and no immediate suspects, the team of
detectives working the Levy case has limited options, a number of
former and current D.C. police investigators and officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming weeks, detectives likely will turn to more
laboratory work and basic police shoe leather. Police Chief Charles
H. Ramsey said Tuesday that Levy's recovered clothes and artifacts
will be sent to the FBI's crime laboratory in Quantico, Va., to see
if they have "any evidentiary value." He also said DNA tests on the
items are probable.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives also will begin canvassing people who live and work
near where the body was found and revisiting witnesses, said those
familiar with the Levy investigation. Ramsey repeated Tuesday that
Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), with whom Levy had been romantically
linked, is one candidate for more questioning, even though he is not
publicly considered a suspect. Ramsey said police also may question
Ingmar Guandique, a Washington-area man now serving 10 years in a
federal penitentiary in North Carolina for assaults on two women in
Rock Creek Park last year.</TE>
<TE>   The knowledge that Levy's death occurred soon after her
disappearance also will allow detectives to question people who live
near the park about any suspicious activities that took place last
May. Investigators also likely will look closely at habitual users of
the western edge of the park and at workers who drove into the
neighborhoods near that site 13 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Police already have rummaged through a picnic area that looms over
the site and reportedly are looking into the possibility that Levy's
body was dumped from above.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody went to extraordinary means to conceal Chandra's body,"
William R. "Billy" Martin, the Levy family attorney, said after a
memorial service in Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives "will saturate the area," one former D.C. police
official said. "Anyone who did repairs in that time frame will be
looked at. They'll look at who uses the roads that cut through
private land around there. Anyone who was around at the time is fair
game."</TE>
<TE>   Former D.C. police officials and homicide investigators themselves
are split among the likeliest scenarios. Some, such as lawyer and
former D.C. homicide detective Ted Williams, lean toward the
likelihood of a premeditated killing. Williams said Levy's reported
reluctance to visit Rock Creek Park and her last-minute computer map
search of a stone mansion in the area indicates "she went there to
meet somebody."</TE>
<TE>   But others, such as retired Deputy D.C. Police Chief Ed Spurlock,
suggest police still have to focus closely on the possibility that
Levy was killed by a stranger.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are somebody saw her and took the opportunity" when she
went to the park, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Levy was dressed in athletic clothes and carried a
stereo points to that scenario, even if she rarely used the park for
exercise, former investigators said. Others noted the difficulty of
dumping a body so deep in the woods. The recovery site is a slope 100
yards from the nearest road and reachable only through rough terrain.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get in there by car and you'd get ripped up pretty good
trying to drag someone in there," said Peter Chiles, who frequently
hikes through the park's woods. "Foot traffic makes it impossible to
get away with in the daytime. Even night's risky."</TE>
<TE>   With such sparse evidence to go on, Ramsey said Tuesday that the
Levy investigation could stretch on for years. "Whether it's a day
from now or 10 years, it doesn't matter to us," he said, adding that
"our people are capable of closing any case they have."</TE>
<TE>   Arden gloomily noted the realities. "It's possible we will never
know specifically how she died."</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused to grant bail Tuesday to an Islamic charity
director charged with lying about ties to Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate Judge Ian H. Levin said Enaam Arnaout has family
in Saudi Arabia, numerous contacts and the motive and means to flee
America.</LD>
<LD>   Arnaout, 34, head of the Benevolence International Foundation, was
returned to the government's Metropolitan Correctional Center where
he has been held since his April 30 arrest.</LD>
<TE>   His attorney, Joseph Duffy, said an appeal was likely.</TE>
<TE>   Benevolence is one of two Chicago-area Islamic charities whose
assets were frozen Dec. 14 in the terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout and officials of the foundation are accused of lying when

<HD>U.S. Justices to Hear Appeal on Cross-Burning Law</HD>
<DH>Courts: The ruling is expected to determine whether such
acts are protected as symbolic speech or are inherently intimidating
crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it would decide whether
cross-burning can be made a crime because it is an inherently
intimidating act.</LD>
<LD>   A ruling in a Virginia case, due early next year, will likely
determine whether such "hate speech" laws can stand.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years ago, the court described cross-burning as a kind of
symbolic speech, like burning the flag or wearing a black armband
during the Vietnam War as a message of protest.</LD>
<TE>   The 1st Amendment does not permit the government to "prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable," said conservative Justice Antonin Scalia,
quoting an earlier opinion by the late liberal Justice William J.
Brennan.</TE>
<TE>   But the high court did not say whether all cross-burning laws were
invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, lawyers have espoused at least three different views
on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Some say all such laws are unconstitutional because they forbid
the display of a symbol based on its message.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the laws can be upheld only when an offensive symbol is
displayed in an especially threatening way. Under this view, it would
be illegal to burn a cross on the lawn of a black family but not in
an open field far removed from other homes.</TE>
<TE>   A third view is that a burning cross or a Nazi swastika is
inherently intimidating and its display can be outlawed in public,
where others can see it.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia adopted a broad law against cross-burning in 1952 to
combat the Ku Klux Klan. Its law makes it a felony to "burn on the
property of another, a highway or other public place ... with the
intent of intimidating any other person." It says the burning of the
cross itself is "evidence of an intent to intimidate."</TE>
<TE>   California has a similar but narrower law. It forbids anyone to
burn "a cross or other religious symbol on the private property of
another ... for the purpose of terrorizing the owner or occupant."</TE>
<TE>   California's law has been upheld by the state courts, but the
Virginia law was struck down in November by its state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   That Virginia court overturned convictions in two cases. In the
first, Klan member Barry Elton Black was accused of leading a
cross-burning at a rally in an open field in rural southwestern
Virginia. In the second, two Virginia Beach men and a juvenile burned
a small makeshift cross less than 20 feet from the home of a black
family.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal, Virginia Atty. Gen. Jerry Kilgore called
cross-burning a kind of "domestic terrorism," not free speech, and he
urged the high court to revive the state's law.</TE>
<TE>   In a one-line order, the justices said they would hear the case of
Virginia vs. Black, 01-1107, during the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the court made it harder to use alleged lapses by a
trial lawyer as a reason for reversing a death sentence years later.</TE>
<TE>   By an 8-1 vote, the justices reinstated a death verdict for a
Vietnam veteran who in 1980 robbed a jewelry store in Memphis, Tenn.,
shot a policeman and two others on the street, then beat an elderly
couple to death.</TE>
<TE>   At the trial, the defense lawyer argued that his client, Gary
Cone, was insane, a result of stress from Vietnam and his drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But after the jury convicted Cone, his lawyer decided against
calling more witnesses in the sentencing portion of the trial and he
waived presenting a closing argument.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
reversed the death sentence because of the lawyer's failure to argue
for sparing Cone's life.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the lower
court erred in viewing the case through the "harsh light of
hindsight."</TE>
<TE>   Cone's lawyer made a "tactical decision" to waive his closing
argument so that the chief prosecutor would not have one final chance
to recite the horrifying facts of Cone's crimes, he said in Bell vs.
Cone, 01-400. Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.</TE>

<HD>Group Says U.S. Abusing Rights in Terrorist War</HD>
<DH>Report: The Bush administration, with thousands of
controversial detentions, is showing other nations that 'anything
goes,' Amnesty International says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States and some of its allies are misusing the war on
terrorism to deny basic human rights to thousands of detainees,
including hundreds of Al Qaeda and Taliban suspects incarcerated at a
U.S. base in Cuba, Amnesty International charged Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In its annual state of the world report, the organization said the
Bush administration has lost its moral authority to criticize human
rights abuses abroad through its own failure to guarantee the rights
of foreigners detained in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials have been "selective" in applying Geneva Convention
guarantees to prisoners, the report said, and, "in suggesting that
national security may require compromises on human rights ..., the
U.S. government risks signaling its allies that 'anything goes' in
their own human rights practices."</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials replied that tough, speedy measures are
needed to destroy Al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks like those
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and that prisoners must
be kept from communicating with outside accomplices. Many have been
held in solitary confinement.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in support of new powers of search, detention and
surveillance that Congress granted the Bush administration, Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft told a Senate subcommittee this year: "One option
is to call Sept. 11 a fluke and to live in a dream world that
requires us to do nothing different. The other option is to fight
back."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International officials singled out for criticism the
creation of U.S. military tribunals to try alleged terrorists and the
indefinite detention of some suspects without access to counsel.
Echoing the views of other civil rights advocates, the report said
these military commissions establish "a parallel system of justice
that concentrates power in the executive branch without a judicial
appeals process."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld recently sought to assure
Congress that military tribunals "will conduct trials that are fair
and impartial," with appeals to be heard by a three-member military
review panel.</TE>
<TE>   "The president recognized there had to be differences [in the
criminal justice process] to deal with the unusual situation,"
Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Khan, Amnesty's secretary-general, said the United States is
setting an example by refusing to classify suspects at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, as prisoners of war, a category that would limit the
extent of any interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   "A very dangerous message is sent when the pillars [of human
rights] are attacked," Khan said. "The edifice could crumble."</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Clarke, a Defense Department spokeswoman, insisted
Tuesday that the detainees are being treated humanely. She said they
have the right to worship as they please, and they enjoy more rights
than Al Qaeda fighters were willing to grant their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "They continue to get excellent care ... culturally appropriate
food [and] excellent medical treatment," Clarke said. "They are
battlefield combatants. They're being held as such and they're being
held appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty's U.S. branch,
told reporters that "the U.S. government fails to understand that
human rights are far from an impediment to national security--they
are the foundation."</TE>
<TE>   Schulz said President Bush has avoided pressing other nations to
eliminate human rights abuses for fear of weakening the U.S.-led
alliance against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "As it works to maintain a global coalition for its war on
terrorism, the U.S. government has instituted a self-imposed gag
order, stifling its criticism of the human rights practices of many
old and new allies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report said Britain also has detained some alleged terrorists
under laws that allow certain suspects to be held indefinitely
without charges or a trial. In addition, India, Pakistan, Malaysia
and Singapore have introduced "repressive" measures aimed at
tightening security, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "Human rights were traded away in almost all parts of the world"
in reaction to Sept. 11, Amnesty International said. "Democratic
states jumped on the bandwagon almost as rapidly as authoritarian
regimes."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty's 300-page report, which assesses human rights in 152
countries, repeats its criticism of the use of the death penalty in
the United States and elsewhere. It noted that 74 countries or
territories had abolished capital punishment by the end of last year,
while an additional 15 had eliminated it for all but exceptional
offenses such as "wartime crimes."</TE>
<TE>   A total of 3,048 people were executed in 31 countries last year,
the report said. The vast majority of executions--2,468--took place
in China.</TE>

<HD>FBI to Shift Agents to Terror War</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: The agency will redeploy 518 people and move
some offices to the nation's capital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI, under fire for its failure to link possible terrorist
threats in the weeks before Sept. 11, is planning to redeploy more
than 500 additional agents to counterterrorism activities and to
consolidate those operations in Washington, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The reorganization plan, expected to be announced today by Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, seeks to
avoid the breakdowns in coordination that plagued FBI terrorism
investigations in Phoenix and Minneapolis last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller's plan would create a new layer of supervisors, analysts
and "flying squads" in Washington responsible for overseeing and more
aggressively pursuing terrorism leads and trends around the world,
according to officials familiar with the plan.</LD>
<TE>   It would also move the FBI further from its traditional
responsibilities of fighting narcotics, white-collar crime and
violent crime by reassigning 518 agents in those areas to
counterterrorism operations, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the plan put together by Mueller and senior aides over the
last few months would increase by about 70% the number of federal,
state and local law enforcement agents detailed to the FBI's fight
against terrorism, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But even before the plan is officially announced, some
congressional critics are complaining that it doesn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Making technology and intelligence analysis priorities are
no-brainers, but a new organization chart alone won't work," Sen.
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials inside and out of the FBI have been awaiting Mueller's
reorganization plan for weeks, and their anticipation has only been
intensified by the recent barrage of questions about whether FBI
supervisors in Washington ignored terrorist suspicions of agents in
Phoenix and Minneapolis before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In a blistering letter sent to Mueller last week, Coleen Rowley,
general counsel in the bureau's Minneapolis office, accused officials
at headquarters of putting up roadblocks in August that prevented
field agents from pursuing evidence that flight school student
Zacarias Moussaoui was part of a broader terrorist plot. Moussaoui,
now suspected of being the intended 20th hijacker, is the only person
charged with any crime in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials already have a significant amount of centralized
power to oversee terrorism investigations in field offices. In her
letter, Rowley said plans to consolidate those operations in
Washington further would "simply fly in the face of an honest
appraisal of the FBI's pre-September 11th failures."</TE>
<TE>   Rowley said field offices in Minneapolis and, separately, in
Phoenix, where an agent warned last July that Middle Easterners
enrolled in flight schools could be planning an attack, performed
admirably in picking up on threats before Sept. 11. "The same cannot
be said for the FBI Headquarters' bureaucracy and you want to expand
that?!" she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's plan to create an Office of Intelligence to track
terrorist leads would rely on about 50 CIA officials to help beef up
the bureau's operation. It would also commit more resources to
technology, including an overhaul of the FBI's computer system, and
would seek to train more agents in Arabic and Farsi, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the outlook is to have everything concentrated in
Washington," said an FBI official who asked not to be identified.
"That doesn't mean the field offices, specifically New York, won't
have a significant role. They certainly will."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the Manhattan FBI and U.S. attorney's offices have
been the national hub for terrorism investigations. Their teams of
specialists played central roles in investigating the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and other high-profile cases.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has already undercut New York's influence by shifting
responsibility for the Sept. 11 prosecutions to federal authorities
in Washington and northern Virginia, and Mueller's plan would further
erode New York's preeminence, threatening to exacerbate tensions,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official who asked not to be identified said
Ashcroft, who oversees the FBI, believes it is important to
centralize counterterrorism operations in Washington, despite the
growing questions about how headquarters handled pre-Sept. 11 leads.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, agents around the country "are collecting the
intelligence out in the field, but it's never being looked at [in
Washington] comprehensively. If you're collecting this stuff in
Phoenix, it's not being put together with the stuff in Minnesota
unless there's some known connection," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The structure isn't there. [Mueller's plan] brings in expert
analysts who can better analyze that information and look at it in a
more comprehensive way," the official added.</TE>
<TE>   That effort would rely in part on what the FBI calls "flying
squads" of counterterrorism experts based in Washington. Mueller
"views them as being able to fly out to areas that are doing
important counterterrorism work and help them, and bring the
knowledge back to headquarters to supplement these cases," according
to a congressional official familiar with the closed-door briefings
that the FBI has given members of Congress in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Kessler, the author of "The Bureau: The Secret History of
the FBI," said he thinks the move is a positive step.</TE>
<TE>   The planned consolidation "will make a lot of difference.... Less
is going to fall between the cracks. Before Sept. 11, they were
inundated with leads that were just not being followed," said
Kessler, who blames many of the FBI's problems on the failure to
upgrade computer systems under former Director Louis J. Freeh.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, the FBI deployed about 6,000 of its 11,000 agents to
counterterrorism investigations in an effort to reconstruct the
events of Sept. 11 and prevent future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   That number has dwindled substantially in the last 8 1/2 months,
although officials would not say exactly how many agents are now
assigned to counterterrorism operations.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's plan would create a permanent counterterrorism work
force of at least 3,718 federal, state and local law enforcement
agents, an increase of about 70% from the 2,178 people working on
counterterrorism before Sept. 11, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress are likely to push for an even greater
deployment.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI is the lead agency for counterterrorism, and less than a
quarter of its agents, from what we've been told, are going to be
doing counterterrorism," said a congressional aide who asked not to
be identified. "We don't think it goes far enough."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Tuesday that it found no credible
evidence that any Florida residents were intentionally denied their
right to vote in the state that handed George W. Bush his margin of
victory in the 2000 election.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department, in a letter to Congress, detailed findings
in its ongoing investigation of possible voting irregularities in
three Florida counties: Orange, Miami-Dade and Osceola. The
department is considering lawsuits in those counties, saying that,
even though polling problems were unintentional, they may have
deprived some voters of their rights.</LD>
<LD>   In the letter, the department acknowledged that polling problems
may have led to small numbers of voters leaving the polls without
casting ballots.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant Atty. Gen. Ralph Boyd said the small number of people
who were unable to vote "doesn't reasonably cast any doubt on
President Bush's several hundred vote margin of victory in Florida."</TE>

<HD>Lindh's Defense Is Dealt a Setback</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge rules against face-to-face interviews with
Guantanamo detainees. But he decides to allow written questions posed
by U.S. interrogators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawyers for John Walker Lindh
cannot conduct face-to-face interviews with detainees at the U.S.
Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III did allow defense lawyers
to submit written questions for interrogators to ask the captives
from the war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The judge also indicated that he likely would allow personal
interviews with the detainees if the defense can show that they are
needed at pretrial hearings or during the trial itself, set to begin
here in August.</LD>
<TE>   Ellis also indicated that, while he agreed with the government's
security concerns about the captives in Cuba, he saw no reason why
the Lindh defense team could not go to Norfolk, Va., to interview
another detainee, Yaser Esam Hamdi.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi, who like Lindh was born in the United States, has dual
U.S.-Saudi citizenship and recently was moved from Guantanamo Bay to
a Navy brig in Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   He has a hearing in federal court there today on his request to be
allowed the right to retain an attorney, even though he has not been
charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Ellis said that the security concern over the
detainees at Guantanamo Bay "doesn't apply to this fellow."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge did agree with the government that deep national
security issues could be breached if interrogations were "disrupted"
in Cuba to allow Lindh's lawyers to personally interview 20 detainees
who were captured with Lindh in Afghanistan last winter.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has read some classified material provided by the
government, and he said that the information coming from the
detainees in Cuba "is vital to U.S. national security interests."</TE>
<TE>   Disrupting that process, he said, could have an "injurious
effect."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was a temporary setback for the defense, which had
hoped to glean additional information from the detainees, some of
whom are Lindh's fellow Taliban soldiers, that might help his case.
The defense team is to submit questions next week and will later see
videotapes of those questions being asked by U.S. interrogators.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis also cautioned the government several times that at some
point this summer the defense will most likely exert its right to
personally interview detainees who will be summoned for pretrial
hearings and the trial itself.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the judge warned, the government will have to
choose between two conflicting options: to allow disruptions in the
interrogation process of detainees at Guantanamo Bay or to "abandon
the prosecution" of Lindh, 21, who faces life in prison if convicted
of the most serious charges against him, including taking up arms
against the United States.</TE>

<HD>Ex-FBI Agent Guilty of Aiding Mobsters</HD>
<DH>Court: The decorated lawman helped Boston crime bosses
deliver bribes and avoid arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a case that has cast a heavy shadow over the Boston bureau of the
FBI, a jury on Tuesday convicted former agent John J. Connolly Jr. of
four counts of corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Connolly, 61, was found guilty of racketeering, bribery and
alerting New England mobsters to impending indictments. He sat
stone-faced in federal court here as he was acquitted on a fifth
count of obstructing justice.</LD>
<LD>   Until his retirement in 1990, Connolly's job was to cultivate mob
informants as the FBI sought to topple the New England mafia.
Prosecutors said he carried out his assignment too well, ignoring two
decades of murder, extortion and other crimes committed by notorious
mobsters James "Whitey" Bulger, Stephen "the Rifleman" Flemmi,
Francis "Cadillac Frank" Salemme and others.</LD>
<TE>   The decorated former agent grew so close to his informants,
prosecutors said, that he warned them in 1994 as federal indictments
were about to be handed down against them.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly's tip allowed Bulger to flee before authorities could
arrest him. The onetime lord of Boston's crime underworld, one of the
FBI's 10 most-wanted criminals, has remained a fugitive since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   At times the revelations in Connolly's two-week-long trial
resembled scenes from "The Sopranos." While Connolly's wife--a former
FBI secretary--sat beside him, his ex-wife told jurors that a
two-carat diamond Connolly gave her originally came from Bulger.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying in exchange for a reduced sentence, John "the Animal"
Martorano told jokes as he described killing more than 20 people as a
hit man for Bulger's Winter Hill gang--which for years kept an iron
grip on the loan-sharking and narcotics trades in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   A former Bulger lieutenant, Kevin Weeks, recalled delivering a
$5,000 bribe to Connolly from Bulger. He said Bulger liked to brag
that he had corrupted six FBI agents and more than 20 police officers
in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   As if he were handing out gratuities, Weeks said, Bulger gave law
enforcement officials envelopes full of cash. "He used to say that
Christmas was for cops and kids."</TE>
<TE>   Weeks also said Connolly came to the Winter Hill gang's
headquarters in a Boston liquor store on Dec. 23, 1994, and told him
to warn Bulger, Flemmi and Salemme that arrests were imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly's former FBI supervisor, John Morris, confirmed in court
that a gift of $1,000 and a case of wine he'd received from Connolly
actually was a bribe from Bulger. Morris was protected from
prosecution by the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly never took the stand, and his attorneys concluded their
case in one day. To bolster their client's credibility, they played
an FBI training video from 1983 featuring Connolly--with a lush
pompadour--providing advice for agency rookies.</TE>
<TE>   Cautioning new agents against trying to "out-gangster a gangster,"
Connolly said in the tape: "You can get friendly with them and you
can like them, but you can never forget who you work for and that
you're an FBI agent."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan said Tuesday that "unfortunately,
that is precisely what John Connolly did."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse
after the verdict, Sullivan blasted Connolly as "a Winter Hill gang
operative masquerading as an FBI agent."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Although the jury's verdict is just and deeply
gratifying, it is always a somber moment to prosecute a law
enforcement agent who has crossed the line."</TE>
<TE>   Connolly, who remains free on $200,000 bail, made no comment as he
left the courthouse. He could face up to 45 years in prison when he
is sentenced Aug. 7.</TE>

<HD>Tribe Offers Up Its Land to Store Nuclear Waste</HD>
<DH>Utilities: The tiny band's get-rich plan infuriates Utah
leaders, who have no regulatory control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SKULL VALLEY, Utah</DL>
<LD>They're only a few dozen adults, these Goshute Indians who call this
lonesome range land home, but they've whipped Utah into a fit with
their get-rich plan to store the nation's nuclear waste.</LD>
<LD>   The tribe, with 70 mostly poor adults, hopes to make tens of
millions of dollars by storing 40,000 tons of highly radioactive
waste from eight utility companies. The waste would be kept on their
reservation here, 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, until a
permanent depository is built, most likely at Yucca Mountain in
Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The Indians' deal with the utilities needs only the blessing of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which infuriates Utah's leaders.
They complain that the whole state would be imperiled for the
financial benefit of a tiny tribe over which they have no regulatory
control.</LD>
<TE>   The tribe argues that its reservation, where 25 members live, is
better suited for storing nuclear waste than for farming. It was once
described by Mark Twain as a rocky and repulsive wasteland.</TE>
<TE>   "We were given the land to use--and this is how we want to use
it," said Tribal Chairman Leon Bear, 46, a onetime security guard.</TE>
<TE>   The state has filed multiple lawsuits, contesting the NRC's right
to license a private storage facility and the utilities' creation of
a private company that shields them from liability should something
go wrong. It has seized control of the two-lane Skull Valley Road
leading to the reservation and banned the transportation of
radioactive waste on it. And it's supporting federal legislation that
would prevent the utilities from constructing a 30-mile-long rail
line to convey the waste to the reservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one focus these days--to stop the storage facility from
being licensed," said Gov. Mike Leavitt. "We don't produce nuclear
waste, and we refuse to store it for those who do."</TE>
<TE>   The utilities have filed their own lawsuits to defend the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute--a recurrent one in the West where Indian lands are
plentiful--derives from the special status Indian tribes were granted
by treaties they signed in the 19th century. Theoretically, they were
regarded as sovereign nations, the equal of the United States, with
absolute control over their land. That independence has been eroded
over time and they are ultimately subordinate to the federal
government, but they have maintained independence from most state and
local government regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials and environmental activists are incredulous over
how a project of this magnitude could face so little scrutiny,
especially given the level of debate over the proposal to permanently
bury 77,000 tons of nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Yucca took 20 years of study, a Department of Energy and
presidential recommendation, a governor's veto and action by
Congress," said Jason Groenewold, spokesman for Heal Utah, a
coalition of environmental organizations. "Here, we have a few
nuclear utility companies getting together with a few members of a
Native American tribe, essentially determining our nation's nuclear
waste policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, Congress never intended this."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was the federal government that gave the tribe the
money-making idea.</TE>
<TE>   Congress had ordered the Department of Energy to take nuclear
waste off utilities' hands but, in the late 1980s, it was hard
pressed to find a state to take it. Energy officials instead invited
the nation's tribal leaders to open up their reservations for
temporary storage.</TE>
<TE>   The department scuttled the idea, but the financially strapped
Goshutes pursued it on their own. The tribe needed the money to
provide health care, housing and other social programs--as well as
income--for its members. Bear won't disclose how much money the tribe
would make, but Sammy Blackbear, a tribal member who opposes the
project, said it would generate $48 million over 40 years for the
Goshutes.</TE>
<TE>   Eight utilities, including Southern California Edison, formed a
company called Private Fuel Storage and, in 1997, signed a contract
with the tribe to send spent fuel rods here for as long as 40 years.
If there is no permanent disposition by then, the utilities are
expected to take back the material.</TE>
<TE>   After five years of study, the NRC staff has concluded that the
project meets federal regulations and does not pose an environmental
risk, said NRC project manager Mark Delligatti. The Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board is hearing objections and is expected to offer its
recommendations to the NRC later this year. The NRC's five
commissioners may make the final decision by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   If the NRC approves the utility-financed $3.1-billion project, the
storage facility could open by early 2005. The utilities would then
begin delivering 40,000 casks, each containing 10 tons of uranium
fuel rods surrounded by 170 tons of concrete and steel. They would
stand on a reinforced concrete parking lot--like 19-foot-high nuclear
silos--spread across 100 acres of what is now dry brush and grass.</TE>
<TE>   The eight utilities generate 20% of the nation's nuclear power,
mostly in the South, the northern Plains and the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the utilities are running out of on-site storage space,
waiting for Yucca Mountain to be ready," said Private Fuel Storage
spokeswoman Sue Martin. "We're trying to avoid having to shut down a
reactor for lack of storage for spent fuel."</TE>
<TE>   The reservation is in Tooele County, whose commissioners agreed to
the project. In exchange for providing law enforcement and hazardous
material cleanup support to the utilities, the county could receive
as much as $400 million over 40 years. The project, Bear says, is in
keeping with the development of the region, which over the decades
has become home to other hazardous ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Near the 18,000-acre reservation, the Army tests how to battle
anthrax and other chemical, nerve and biological agents at the Dugway
Proving Ground. At another site about 20 miles away, the Army is
incinerating nearly half of the nation's stockpile of chemical
weapons. Thirty miles in a different direction, a private company has
been burying low-level nuclear waste with the state's approval for
years. The region's mining companies, alongside the Great Salt Lake,
are among the nation's biggest industrial polluters. And to the west
is one of the Air Force's largest bombing and cruise missile ranges.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Congress passed legislation effectively banning
construction of rail lines to the reservation unless the Defense
Department concludes that it would not affect its training mission.
Military officials object to the nuclear waste facility because it
would force F-16s to detour around Skull Valley en route to bombing
ranges.</TE>
<TE>   In a further effort to ban the rail line, the House of
Representatives on May 14 attached an amendment to the military
appropriations bill that declares the land as a wilderness study
area. If the amendment is approved by a House-Senate conference
committee, access to the site would be all but blocked.</TE>
<TE>   The state continues to bombard the NRC with objections, citing
concern that a military jet or errant cruise missile may crash on the
site. State officials argue that the integrity of the site is
compromised by seismic activity in the mountain ranges that frame the
valley.</TE>
<TE>   They also question whether the tribe still wants the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Goshutes claim they recalled Bear as chairman for his
refusal to share contract details with them and have sued the Bureau
of Indian Affairs for signing off on the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to protect the land, not destroy it," said dissident
tribal member Blackbear, who claims that a majority of the tribe now
opposes the project.</TE>
<TE>   Bear maintains that his recall was not valid. The BIA refuses to
intervene and still recognizes Bear as tribal leader. The utilities
contend that the contract remains enforceable.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has overshadowed any attention that Nevada had
hoped to generate in Utah in its fight to kill the Yucca Mountain
project, 90 miles from Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Because about 90% of the waste destined for Yucca Mountain is
expected to travel through Utah, Nevada launched an ad campaign on
Salt Lake TV stations earlier this month. It raised the possibility
of nuclear fuel being spilled in Utah due to accident or terrorism
and asked viewers to call Utah's senators to voice their objection.</TE>
<TE>   Local polls indicate half of Utahans support storing nuclear waste
in Nevada--even if it means traveling through Utah--but four out of
five oppose temporary waste storage on the Goshute reservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm against it going out on the reservation," said Eric Thomas,
who runs an excavation company in suburban Roy. "I think Yucca
Mountain should be opened, and that the utilities should just move
the waste once--to Nevada."</TE>
<TE>   But the utilities say they can't wait that long. And Bear said
Utah officials are applying double standards against the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "Utah says it doesn't want nuclear waste in its backyard," he
said. "But look around. We're already surrounded by toxic waste--and
none of it is [financially] benefiting the tribe. Now it's our turn
to benefit."</TE>

<HD>Osprey Flight Tests Will Resume After Fleet Was Grounded</HD>
<DH>Military: Marines say problems with the hybrid aircraft
that led to two fatal crashes have been corrected. V-22 is called
safe, operational.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>Flight tests on the V-22 Osprey will resume today for the first time
since the helicopter-airplane hybrid was grounded in 2000 after two
fatal crashes, the Marines said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Marine officials said that steps have been taken to correct
problems that led to the crashes.</LD>
<LD>   "We are returning a safe and operational aircraft to the fleet,"
said Col. Dan Schultz, the Marine Corps' V-22 program manager.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next year, the military will test seven modified V-22s at
the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River and four at Edwards Air Force
Base in the California desert.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots will take the planes through a series of maneuvers,
including fast descents, to determine whether changes in hydraulic
systems and other modifications have corrected problems that led to
the crashes.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines hope to have the V-22 in service by December 2003,
Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey is designed to lift off and land vertically like a
helicopter and cruise like an airplane. It uses two propellers that
can tilt 90 degrees. The Marine Corps hopes to replace its aging
fleet of assault helicopters with the Osprey.</TE>
<TE>   Built by Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopters Textron, the V-22s cost
$89.7 million each. Only 20 have been built so far.</TE>
<TE>   The entire fleet was grounded in 2000 after two crashes that year
during training flights. A crash in December 2000 killed four Marines
in Jacksonville, N.C., and 19 Marines died when a V-22 crashed in
Arizona in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation found several Marine officers took part in a plan
to exaggerate the readiness of the aircraft by doctoring maintenance
records. Two officers received letters of reprimand in September.</TE>
<TE>   One of the crashes was attributed to vortex ring state, a
phenomenon that can cause an aircraft to lose altitude quickly.
Schultz said changes had been made to alert pilots to conditions that
could lead to VRS.</TE>
<TE>   V-22 pilots will be trained to maneuver out of VRS situations, and
technicians have also changed the V-22's hydraulic system to prevent
failures caused by chafed hydraulic lines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The indications are that this aircraft can handle VRS better than
any airplane and any helicopter out there," Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   Flight tests will be conducted by pilots from Boeing and Bell
Helicopter at Patuxent River.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll know the first day of flying if this airplane is put
together right," said Tom McDonald, a Boeing test pilot, who will fly
the aircraft.</TE>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A man charged with shooting a priest he says molested him as a
teenager asked Roman Catholic Church officials to support probation
instead of prison if he is convicted.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer for Dontee Stokes, 26, said his client deserves
leniency because state prosecutors and the church failed to take
strong action in 1993, when Stokes first brought abuse accusations
against Father Maurice Blackwell.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal William Keeler has written that he regrets reinstating
Blackwell in 1993 and has publicly apologized to Stokes and his
family.</LD>
<TE>   In exchange for the Baltimore Archdiocese's support, Stokes would
publicly forgive Blackwell and express forgiveness toward the
Catholic Church, lawyer Warren Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In a response, Keeler said he was grateful that Stokes and Brown
were "looking for an atmosphere that fosters reconciliation and
healing."</TE>

<HD>Fall Races Set Up in Idaho, Kentucky</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats vote for candidates to face popular
incumbent governor and senators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>Idaho Democrats chose candidates Tuesday to take on a pair of popular
Republicans--Sen. Larry E. Craig and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne--while the
primary in Kentucky to pick a Democratic challenger for GOP Sen.
Mitch McConnell was too close to call.</LD>
<LD>   The Kentucky race was a battle between Lois Combs Weinberg, the
daughter of the late Gov. Bert Combs, and Tom Barlow, who served one
term in Congress after ousting an incumbent scarred by the 1990s
House banking scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Weinberg clung to a razor-thin lead against Barlow with almost all
the votes counted, but the race remained too close to call.</LD>
<TE>   With all precincts reporting, Weinberg had 231,060 votes, or
50.2%, and Barlow had 229,060 votes, or 49.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The tally by Associated Press differed from that of the Kentucky
secretary of state's office, which showed Weinberg winning by about
900 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberg claimed victory late Tuesday, saying the win showed "the
voters of Kentucky are ready for something new."</TE>
<TE>   But Barlow said the declaration was premature and did not
immediately concede.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberg raised more than $1.4 million and banked much of it in
preparation for a general election race against McConnell, a
three-term incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate primary in Idaho pitted former Wall Street investment
banker Alan Blinken against David Sneddon, an underfinanced real
estate agent. The winner faces Craig, 56, who faced no GOP opponent
in his bid for a third term.</TE>
<TE>   Blinken, 64, a millionaire who was President Clinton's ambassador
to Belgium, was painted by critics as an elite carpetbagger who
doesn't understand Idaho values. In the governor's race, newspaper
publisher Jerry Brady made his political debut against retired
construction worker Rue Stears, 81, for the Democratic nomination to
challenge Kempthorne.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, dogged by an eroding economy and intensifying fiscal
problems, had three primary challengers: Walter Bayes, Milt Erhart
and Raynelle George.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Kentucky, Republican voters in Pulaski County chose police
Det. Todd Wood as their nominee to succeed Sheriff Sam Catron, 48,
who was killed at an April campaign rally.</TE>
<TE>   A former candidate and two supporters have been charged in the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Wood will face Democrat Norris Whitaker this fall.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds State Power in S.C. Port Case</HD>
<DH>Law: Justices rule that 'sovereign immunity' shields an
agency from federal regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In another victory for states' rights, the Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday that the principle of "sovereign immunity" shields a state
agency from being called before a federal administrative hearing and
charged with violating the law.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking for the 5-4 majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said it
would be "an affront to a state's dignity" to force its officials to
appear at a federal administrative proceeding.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, in a case involving docking rights for cruise ships,
extends recent rulings that have limited the reach of federal
authority and elevated the status of the states as "sovereign
entities."</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, the same justices in Tuesday's majority ruled that
states, including public universities and state-run hospitals, are
generally immune from being sued for violating federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the court has thrown out lawsuits brought by a Florida
college professor who says he was paid less because of his age, an
Alabama hospital worker who was fired after surviving breast cancer
and a Maine probation officer who was not paid for overtime work.</TE>
<TE>   The justices also barred suits against state agencies over stolen
patents, trademarks and copyrights--all violations of federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The court's conservative majority said it was not trying to
destroy federal law, but rather maintain the structure set in the
original Constitution of 1787.</TE>
<TE>   "By guarding against encroachments by the federal government on
fundamental aspects of state sovereignty, we strive to maintain the
balance of power embodied in our Constitution," Thomas wrote.
"Sovereign immunity ... accords States the dignity that is consistent
with their status as sovereign entities," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The four liberals, in an unusually harsh dissent, accused the
conservatives of making up a principle that does not appear in the
Constitution and using it to whittle away at progressive laws enacted
during the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution says, "The laws of the United States ... shall be
the supreme law of the land."</TE>
<TE>   "Where does the majority find its constitutional prohibition" on
federal administrative proceedings? Breyer asked in his dissent,
which he read aloud. "Not in the Constitution's text, which says not
a word about it. Not in history. Not in tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Though Tuesday's decision arose from a dispute over access to a
port in South Carolina, the dissenters said the court's ruling would
hinder enforcement of federal laws that protect the environment and
assure the health and safety of workers. Often, agencies use
investigations, hearings and fines to force others, including states,
to abide by federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as this principle of [state sovereign immunity] has no
logical starting place, I fear that neither does it have any logical
stopping point," Breyer said in his dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Until reined in, "I fear [it] will be randomly destructive," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The court's conservatives have said that sovereign immunity comes
from the 11th Amendment, which reads, "The Judicial Power of the
United States shall not extend ... to any suit in law" brought
against one state by "citizens of another state or ... of any foreign
state."</TE>
<TE>   This case did not involve "judicial power," but an agency hearing,
and it concerned a complaint by a South Carolina company against the
South Carolina State Ports Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Thomas said the "sovereign immunity enjoyed by the
states extends beyond the literal text of the 11th Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, conservatives have accused liberals of inventing
doctrines that were not mentioned in the Constitution, such as the
right to privacy.</TE>
<TE>   In something of a role reversal, Breyer hammered the conservatives
for relying on a fictional doctrine, so much so that Thomas fired
back in a footnote, accusing the liberals of "engaging in a type of
ahistorical literalism."</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric aside, Tuesday's ruling concerned only a mechanism for
enforcing the law, not the substance of the law itself.</TE>
<TE>   The justices threw out a complaint brought by one cruise line
against the state-run port authority.</TE>
<TE>   A South Carolina maritime company had asked repeatedly to berth a
cruise ship, the M/V Tropic Seas, at Charleston. The ship offered
short cruises that featured casino gambling. State officials replied
that they did not want gambling ships in port.</TE>
<TE>   But the complaining company said the state's decision was unfair
and discriminatory because Carnival Cruise Lines had berthed two
ships that also offered gambling. The competing cruise line
complained to the Federal Maritime Commission, a small independent
agency based in Washington, which assigned an administrative law
judge to hold a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina officials balked, citing states' rights, and they
won a major victory before the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., the onetime capital of the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson said "the doctrine of sovereign
immunity predates the founding of our nation ... [and] is among the
Constitution's foremost principles."</TE>
<TE>   The federal agency, backed by Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson,
appealed the issue to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority said an administrative hearing "bears a
remarkably strong resemblance to civil litigation in federal
court"--and since states are shielded from lawsuits, they also should
be shielded from administrative hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "We hold that state sovereign immunity bars such an adjudicative
proceeding," Thomas said in Federal Maritime Commission vs. South
Carolina State Ports Authority, 01-46. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Breyer, the dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer for Kennedy Cousin Rests Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>The defense lawyer for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel rested his case
Tuesday after calling a medical expert who estimated Martha Moxley's
time of death at 10 p.m., a time that conforms with Skakel's alibi.</LD>
<LD>   The jury also heard testimony from a detective who said Skakel
didn't acknowledge in 1975 that he had gone to Moxley's property on
the night of the murder. He has since admitted to going to the
property late that night.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 41, is charged with beating Moxley to death with a golf
club on Oct. 30, 1975, when they were 15-year-old neighbors in
Greenwich, Conn. Skakel is a nephew of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's
widow, Ethel Kennedy.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk of Houston said he estimated the time of
death based on the degree of rigor mortis in Moxley's body, reports
of barking dogs in the area, the girl's curfew, the autopsy report
and the contents of her stomach at the time of death.</TE>
<TE>   But on cross-examination, Jachimczyk acknowledged the difficulty
in estimating time of death, and said his estimate could be off by an
hour in either direction.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel has said he was visiting a cousin's house in another part
of Greenwich at 10 that night.</TE>
<TE>   The state's own medical examiner said he could not pinpoint a time
of death, saying it could have been any time between 9:30 p.m. Oct.
30 and 5 a.m. Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel did not testify in his own defense but has steadfastly
denied any involvement in Moxley's slaying. Defense lawyer Michael
Sherman said there was no need to call him as a witness, noting that
prosecutors played a tape of Skakel describing his movements.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, jurors heard from Skakel's 43-year-old brother, John, who
stood by a statement he gave to police in 1975 that Michael Skakel
was among the family members who traveled to their cousin's house.</TE>
<TE>   But under cross-examination, he admitted he could no longer recall
who made that trip. "I'd love nothing more than to have a clearer
memory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense called former Greenwich police Det. James Lunney to
testify Tuesday about his investigation of Skakel's older brother
Thomas, an early suspect in the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   But Lunney testified on cross-examination that Michael Skakel had
never told him he left his home after returning from his cousin's
house at about 11 on the night of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely said he did not go out," Lunney said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors last week played a tape of Skakel telling an author in
1997 that after he returned home from his cousin's house, he went to
Moxley's property.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict is expected to call several rebuttal
witnesses today, including Julie Skakel, Michael Skakel's sister.</TE>

<HD>Odyssey Probe Detects Vast Ice Deposits on Red Planet</HD>
<DH>Space: A layer of water 2 feet beneath Mars' surface is
discovered, NASA scientists report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF REPORTER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Mars Odyssey space probe now circling the Red Planet has detected
extensive deposits of ice in a thick layer 2 feet beneath the
surface, helping solve the mystery of where the planet's once
extensive bodies of water may have gone, NASA scientists reported
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists are jubilant about the find because the detection of
water so close to the surface--even frozen--bodes well for the search
for traces of past or present life on Mars.</LD>
<LD>   "Where there's water, there's life," said R. Stephen Saunders, the
project scientist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Mars Odyssey
orbiter.</LD>
<TE>   The ice may have supported life in the past when the planet was
warmer and water flowed on the planet's surface. It is possible that
the ice could harbor life today. "On Earth, even in cold environments
there can be living organisms," Saunders said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest findings show a rich source of water in some areas,
accounting for up to 60% of the volume of a layer 2 feet below the
surface. They have detected trillions of gallons of ice--more than
twice the 75 trillion gallons of water that fill Lake Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   The ice deposits could prove invaluable to human exploration of
Mars, said Bill Feldman, a scientist at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory and a lead investigator for one of the Odyssey
instruments. Travel to Mars is limited by weight and space
restrictions on spacecraft. Mars explorers could extend their time on
the planet by melting ice for drinking water and by breaking the ice
into hydrogen and oxygen to use for fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results are a confirmation and extension of the
discovery of large ice fields announced in March, weeks after the
spacecraft's instruments were first turned on. Odyssey was launched
in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the time said they were "blown away" by their
results and knew they had discovered ice, but could not say how much
was there. The new study is the first to quantify the amount of ice
that may exist on Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hopeful that we could find evidence of ice, but what we
have found is much more ice than we ever expected," said William
Boynton, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona and lead
investigator for the suite of ice-detecting instruments on the
orbiter. Boynton, who had an instrument on a failed 1993 Mars
spacecraft, has been waiting more than 15 years for these results.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument, a gamma ray spectrometer, detected hydrogen by
analyzing the gamma ray and neutron emissions from chemicals in the
top 3 feet of the surface. Hydrogen has a distinct emission
signature. Given the Mars temperatures, the most likely source of the
hydrogen is frozen water, scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   The ice was detected in a layer of dust and rock about 2 feet
below the surface in the planet's mid-latitudes. Closer to the pole,
where it is colder, the ice layer was found just 1 foot below the
surface.</TE>
<TE>   The ice was found in a region surrounding the south pole. Similar
findings were not made at the north pole because the region is now
covered by a frozen cap of carbon dioxide ice that cannot be
penetrated by Odyssey's instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists expect to find a similar ice layer in the north once
the Martian spring arrives in coming months and melts the cap. "It
could be a couple more Lake Michigans at least," Saunders said.</TE>
<TE>   The massive canyons, dry lake beds and ancient shorelines on Mars
indicate that the planet was once covered with water.</TE>
<TE>   But scientists have no idea where the water could have gone. Some
of it may have been lost over time by evaporation through the
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Some could be several more feet underground--out of reach of
Odyssey's sensors.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to continue searching, perhaps much deeper underground,
for what happened to the rest of the water we think Mars once had,"
said Jim Garvin, NASA's chief Mars scientist.</TE>
<TE>   The results are being published in Friday's issue of the journal
Science.</TE>

<HD>Ship Carrying Chinese Was Hijacked, Crew Says</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Captain says he was fishing off Hawaii when
the men boarded and took the vessel to the O.C. coast. Prosecutors
have doubts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They paid $10,000 each for a chance at life in America. And for
nearly seven weeks, they risked their lives inside cramped
compartments in the cargo hull of a rusty fishing boat.</LD>
<LD>   As their boat crossed the Pacific, the 10 Chinese passengers were
forbidden from moving without permission from the captain, an
imposing figure who demanded they call him "Boss."</LD>
<LD>   The voyage ended Thursday at about 2 a.m., when the men were
ordered on deck and told to swim ashore. If the boat tried to dock,
the crew told them, they would all be caught.</LD>
<TE>   The account of the men's 7,000-mile journey is based on their
interviews with immigration officials and made public Tuesday as
federal prosecutors charged the vessel's captain and engineer with
smuggling immigrants into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the captain and the engineer gave a vastly different story
about how the 10 men came to paddle ashore north of Laguna Beach,
naked and clinging to makeshift floats.</TE>
<TE>   Handcuffed and clad in blue sweatpants, the captain, Jin Yinn
Wang, said in federal court Tuesday that he never intended to steer
near California.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship was brought here, I was kidnapped, and that's all I
know," Wang said in Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   Wang laid out a more extensive version of events shortly after he
was detained by immigration officials Thursday. According to court
documents, Wang said that he and his first mate were alone shark
fishing 600 miles off the Hawaii coast when they picked up the 10 men
as crew members.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said the new crew hijacked their boat, the Fu Ching. When the
boat arrived off Laguna Beach, Wang said he was bound and locked
inside a storage room. He told investigators that the men stole his
ring, equipment and cash before jumping overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said he managed to free himself and tried to send a mayday
broadcast for help. U.S. Coast Guard officials said they were not
aware of any mayday calls sent.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency mounted a search for the Fu Ching after police
found the boat's name on lifesaving equipment the 10 immigrants had
left behind. Coast Guard helicopters caught sight of the boat about
100 miles from San Diego. Authorities ordered the Fu Ching to stop,
but it failed to comply.</TE>
<TE>   After boarding the boat, the Coast Guard officials examined a
global positioning system aboard the vessel. The instrument showed
the Fu Ching had touched land off Laguna Beach, close to where the
men swam ashore.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks earlier, the owner of the Fu Ching had notified
Taiwanese authorities that he had lost contact with the vessel. But
Taiwanese officials say they never could determine if the crew had
been hijacked or simply stopped communicating with the owner.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on the report, the California Department of Justice
recently issued a teletype notifying law enforcement agencies that
the boat "may have been hijacked by 10 Chinese nationals," according
to court records, which were filed by INS investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it's far from the first time that boat captains
accused of smuggling immigrants have claimed they were victims of a
mutiny.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the master of the vessel reports being forced to
let the crew off near the coast of Canada, Guam or California, where
they try to enter illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Such mutinies provide sea smugglers with a convenient alibi if
caught by immigration officials, said Ko-Lin Chin, professor of
criminal justice at Rutgers University and author of "Smuggled
Chinese." He estimated that only one in every five claims of a mutiny
turns out to be legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. prosecutors are also treating the mutiny tale with
skepticism, preferring to believe the accounts offered by the 10
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with INS officials, most of the men said they paid
$10,000 in total for the trip, though who exactly received the money
remains unclear. Some of the men said they handed $2,000 over in
Taiwan. A smaller boat then took the men to the Fu Ching, where they
paid more money, ranging from $1,800 to $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   None of the men have asked for political asylum and will probably
be deported, though federal officials could decide to use some as
witnesses against the Fu Ching's crew.</TE>
<TE>   Both crew members appeared in court Tuesday, their hands shackled
to waist chains, their faces looking tired. They both face one count
each of smuggling illegal immigrants, a charge that carries a maximum
of 10 years per immigrant transported.</TE>
<TE>   Jin Long Guo, the ship's engineer and first mate, wore an
oil-stained sweatshirt and said little as U.S. Judge Arthur Nakazato
ordered him and Wang detained. They are scheduled to enter a plea
June 10.</TE>
<TE>   The two men, who are Taiwanese nationals, are being monitored by
representatives from the Taiwan government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with INS, and we are very pleased with the
treatment they are getting," said Andy Tseng, a spokesman for the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>3 Men Plead Not Guilty in Fatal Shooting of Toddler</HD>
<DH>Panorama City: Child was killed when gang members
intervened in an argument between an aunt and uncle. One suspect
remains at large.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men pleaded not guilty Tuesday to fatally shooting a 3-year-old
boy outside a Panorama City apartment complex earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police arrested the three men and a 17-year-old boy
last week in the May 9 killing of Alfredo Cardenas Jr. in the 14700
block of Blythe Street.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Diego Ayala, 18; Jose Miguel Jimenez, 20; and Luis Alejandro
Rodriguez, 18, were charged Friday with murder and using a gun. Each
was in custody in lieu of $2-million bail, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Jesus Delasancha, 21, whom authorities believe is hiding in the
Antelope Valley, also has been charged in the child's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The case of the 17-year-old, whose name was withheld because of
his age, is being handled by the Juvenile Court. Prosecutors will ask
that the minor be tried as an adult, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Jesic
said.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, each adult defendant faces 25 years to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the boy was with his father, aunt, uncle and
younger cousin when he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Gang members intervened in an argument between the boy's aunt and
uncle, police said. They beat the child's uncle, then authorities
believe Delasancha fired the shot that struck the boy in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been terrorizing this area with impunity," said Jesic,
who specializes in gang prosecutions. "No one ever wants to call
police because they are scared."</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time in 18 months that a suspected Blythe
Street gang member has missed his target and killed an innocent
bystander, Jesic said.</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena Sandoval, 32, was shot to death Nov. 26, 2000, while
walking to a convenience store in the 14600 block of Blythe Street
with her 3-year-old daughter. Her suspected killer, Raul Maldonado,
18, is awaiting trial.</TE>

<LD>A man shot himself after a four-hour standoff Tuesday at the CBS
television studios, where he aimed a gun at an employee and forced an
evacuation after bursting into the building, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 29-year-old man was taken to a hospital at 9:15 p.m. with a
single gunshot to the chest. He was listed in critical condition at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   About 800 CBS employees, including actors and crew members filming
"The Young and the Restless" soap opera, were evacuated from the
24-acre facility in the 7800 block of Beverly Boulevard in the
Fairfax district.</LD>
<TE>   "At first I thought it was a joke," said David Tom, 24, who plays
the character Billy Abbott on the soap opera. Tom was doing a scene
in which he was required to act nervous.</TE>
<TE>   He said that when the director told the cast there was a gunman on
the lot and they would have to leave, "I thought he was just trying
to rile us up a little. Then I realized he was serious."</TE>
<TE>   The man apparently crashed through the CBS Television City parking
lot security gate in a pickup truck shortly before 5 p.m. and then
strode into the mailroom.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I need help now!' and he put a gun to his head," said
Michael Grandinetti, a media coordinator who was in the mailroom.</TE>
<TE>   He said the man then pointed the gun at the mailroom supervisor
and pulled the trigger twice. "I heard a clicking sound," but the gun
didn't fire, Grandinetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the man expressed fears that Hawthorne police
wanted to hurt his family. Hawthorne police said they did not know
the man and had no idea why he might fear them.</TE>
<TE>   CBS officials said the incident should not delay the broadcast of
any shows.</TE>

<HD>Cypress OKs Seizure of Church Land</HD>
<DH>Land use: Council votes to force Cottonwood Christian
Center to sell 18 acres for a Costco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a standoff that has drawn national attention, Cypress officials
voted late Tuesday to toss Cottonwood Christian Center off property
where it plans to build a church, clearing the way for a Costco
store.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts say the situation could be a test case for a federal
law intended to protect churches from unfair zoning restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's City Council session drew emotional testimony from
church members, religious leaders and land-use experts who pleaded
with officials not to seize the 18-acre property by eminent domain in
the name of redevelopment.</LD>
<TE>   But council member Tim Keenan said after the unanimous vote,
"We've been the object of a nationwide and, frankly, a worldwide
propaganda campaign that can only be described as malicious. My
conscience is clear."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Cottonwood members came to the meeting in buses. They
filled the council chamber and spilled onto the Civic Center lawn,
where some sat or stood watching the proceedings on large TVs that
the city set up for them. Some carried signs reading, "Please don't
take Cottonwood's land" and "Thou shalt not covet God's property."</TE>
<TE>   Among those addressing the council was Brenton Hall of Cypress, a
church employee. "Cottonwood has changed my life," he said. "I oppose
you taking Cottonwood's land to put a store there."</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of the Costco project set up a small table on the
sidewalk outside the Civic Center. Bill Wostenberg of Cypress
Residents for Planned Commercial Development said, "Cottonwood just
came in and bullied the city.... Now they're saying everyone against
Cottonwood is going to burn in hell."</TE>
<TE>   His group argues that Cypress is a small city that already has 32
churches. What it needs is tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The 4,000-member church has filed a lawsuit against the city under
the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000,
which prohibits any land-use regulation that is a "substantial
burden" on the practice of religion.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of case is an extreme example of abuse that the law was
specifically adopted for," said Jon Curtis, an attorney for
Cottonwood.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they have a legal right to force a sale of the
property to stimulate the local economy and generate sales-tax
revenue. The property, now vacant, is at Walker Street and Katella
Avenue, one of Cypress' busiest intersections and an area that city
officials say they have long envisioned as a bustling town center.</TE>
<TE>   "This site is in the heart of our business park," said David
Belmer, the city's community development director. "We see it as
critical to the overall health of the project and, to a certain
extent, the whole city."</TE>
<TE>   The city says it told Cottonwood officials months before the
congregation bought the land in 1999 that it was in a redevelopment
area targeted for commercial use. Church officials deny that.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood's lawsuit is one of more than 30 filed nationwide under
the 2-year-old federal act. Dozens more are expected, legal experts
say. Many of the lawsuits involve "megachurches" like Cottonwood that
are too big for residential areas but do not generate sales-tax
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   While expressing sympathy for Cottonwood's plight, many planners
and land-use experts have said the law goes too far and may violate
constitutional separation of church and state. Vivian Khan, an
Oakland planning consultant, said earlier this month, "No one has an
absolute right to use property the way they choose." Cypress
officials are confident the courts will either strike down the
federal law or interpret it to stop short of blocking a city's right
to take land by eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the city is negotiating exclusively with Costco on the
site. Belmer said that if Costco decides not to build a "big box"
there, the city would offer it to another store.</TE>
<TE>   The city's eagerness to court the giant discount retailer
highlights how dependent many California cities have become on big
stores to generate tax revenue. Experts say the situation is an
unintended consequence of Proposition 13, the landmark ballot measure
that capped residential property-tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   A Costco can generate more than $500,000 a year in revenue for a
city. When Lancaster faced the prospect that its Costco might move
out of town, it gave the chain prime parkland for a new store.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood officials say Cypress' cash flow is the wrong reason to
force the church from its own property.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with public health or safety," said Mel
Markoff, a land planner for the church. "It is about revenue, and
that is not a good enough reason to take the church's property and
hand it over to another owner."</TE>

<HD>For These Students, U.S. History Is a Ball</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Abraham Lincoln sits in a rocking chair at one end of the
room, the war recently won and his assassination less than a week
away.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight is one for celebration. "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"
plays, and from one door comes a line of more than 100 ladies in
formal gowns and hoopskirts, dressed for the occasion. Through
another door walk returning soldiers: blue coats with a trickle of
ragged grays. The young men bow, the young women curtsy, and arm in
arm, the couples--there are more than 200 dancers--pass under an arch
to pay their respects to the 16th president.</LD>
<LD>   This might be early April 1865. But a few odd details belie the
effect. The women in dresses are, for the most part, taller than the
men in uniform. On closer inspection, a few sideburns seem to have
been drawn on in magic marker. Braces are visible when some revelers
smile.</LD>
<TE>   And under trouser cuffs and skirts, all the soldiers and belles
are wearing tennis shoes, a requirement not of any Northern general
but of an athletic director wary of what soldiers' boots might do the
floor of the boys gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   This is El Segundo in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle School Blue and Gray Ball is exactly the kind of event
that many educators predicted would fall by the wayside as California
school districts embarked on a new era of state curriculum
requirements, federal mandates and standardized testing. With so many
new duties, the argument went, schools would scale back events and
cancel fun.</TE>
<TE>   But in practice, some school districts are adding and
strengthening traditions. Superintendents and principals say that
with all the state and federal government standards, local
communities are celebrating distinctive traditions more fiercely than
ever. That is the case at the 2,900-student El Segundo district,
located just south of Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Few events are more elaborate than El Segundo's Civil War-era
ball, which is part junior high dance, part history lecture, part
reenactment. In addition to the more than 200 dancers from El Segundo
Middle School, an estimated 350 spectators attended last week's
performance, filling the bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been quite an upgrade this year. The crowds keep getting
larger," said Dan Webb, principal of El Segundo Middle School, who
dances the waltz during the ball. "It's so easy to make excuses that
you can't do these things. But you do all that routine
stuff--tardiness and professional development and testing--so that at
the end of the year, you can do something like this."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue and Gray Ball's chief appeal is that it's an academic
exercise. Started four years ago, it grew out of the state's content
standards, which outline an extensive unit on the Civil War in the
eighth grade. In El Segundo, the annual ball marks the end of the
unit for all eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   After its first year, the ball's organizer left for another
school, and it was unclear whether the idea would be renewed. Robin
Teitelbaum, a new teacher, agreed to take it on. "There was really no
way to say no," said Teitelbaum, 26, whose mother also teaches in the
El Segundo district. "It was obviously something the community would
really support--we see it as a reunification of community type of
thing--with Union soldiers and Confederate soldiers, coming together
at the end of the war to have a good time."</TE>
<TE>   A parents committee helps. Decorating the gym is an elaborate
project, with bunting and flags from each state in the Union and
Confederacy hung on the walls, as well as period artwork. The local
PTA provides $1,000 in financial support--$600 of which goes to hire
a troupe of Civil War reenactors from Santa Barbara, $200 for
decorations, and the rest for various odds and ends.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-graders begin practicing as much as three months ahead.
Students are responsible for their own uniforms and dresses. Some
rent from clothing and costume stores on a list provided by
Teitelbaum. Others make their own; one girl fashioned a hoopskirt
using a hula hoop and a hand-me-down quinceanera dress.</TE>
<TE>   The ball has a handful of critics. One parent this year questioned
the use of Confederate flags, which are paired with the Stars and
Stripes on signs made for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to glorify slavery," Teitelbaum said. "But we
don't want to do a disservice to our students by sugar-coating
history."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the eighth-grade boys grumble about the time and effort it
takes for a dress-up event.</TE>
<TE>   The ball is not mandatory, but peer pressure and the promise of a
few extra points in history class bring in more than 200 of the
approximately 215 eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the guys could care less," said eighth-grader Chris
Doukakis, 13, who made a soldier's uniform with a jacket borrowed
from his uncle, a hat his brother bought at Disneyland, and a $6
plastic sword. "It's tradition, and the girls are very into this."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way," said a camera-toting mother, Donna Tucker, as
she filmed daughter Danielle in a blue dress, "to learn history
hands-on."</TE>
<TE>   It is also a spectacle. After their bows to Lincoln, the revelers
begin to dance. They start with the Virginia Reel, filling the entire
gym floor as they sway and twirl. After a short break for pie and
lemonade, the entire room dances a delicate waltz. Twenty or so
dancers--who put in extra practice--perform an elaborate polka.</TE>
<TE>   The adult reenactors also get into the action. One, impersonating
a Confederate soldier from North Carolina, plays the banjo. Lincoln,
played by Don Ancell, a suitably tall and bearded retired Navy
electronics technician from Oxnard, moves with characteristic
awkwardness as he talks about the need for reconciliation, tells
stories about his early failures in business, and recites the
Gettysburg Address. He breaks character only in his conclusion,
advising the young dancers to "Stay away from that TV set and work
hard, man."</TE>
<TE>   Even skeptics--most of them male--were won over.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it'd be a very teacher sort of night," said Marcus
Caimi, 14, who rented the costume of a riverboat gambler for $43.
"But I had a blast."</TE>
<TE>   In the stands, Milagro Archila said she felt great emotions
watching her daughter Vivian dance in a dress they struggled to find.
Archila, a native of El Salvador who moved here in 1976, says she
never had the chance to study the American Civil War. But as Lincoln
talked about the 620,000 dead Americans, her thoughts turned to the
civil war in the country of her birth.</TE>
<TE>   She said she often talks with her children about that war, which
killed some of her friends and forced others to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to understand what happens in civil war, that
people and neighbors die," Archila said. "Fortunately, tonight is not
a real civil war. War is terrible, and this is happy."</TE>

<HD>Graduation Speakers Opting for Safe, Unoffensive Topics</HD>
<DH>College: Heavy issues are being avoided in keynote
addresses at many campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With burning issues in the news--terrorism, the Middle East and the
Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal among them--a pundit should have
plenty of material to expound upon in a university commencement
speech.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, UC Berkeley students invited freestyle skier Jonny
Moseley, an Olympic gold medalist best known for acrobatic feats such
as his "dinner roll" maneuver.</LD>
<LD>   Moseley, a college dropout, urged students at the universitywide
convocation to create their own personal definition of success, and
not let their sense of well-being depend on the approval of others.
By doing that, he said, "you will own your happiness."</LD>
<TE>   This graduation season, many commencement speakers in California
and elsewhere are slaloming away from the great social issues of the
day toward safer ground.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, many orators opt for upbeat, inspirational themes
rather than risk dampening the celebratory atmosphere with probing
news commentary.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, there is more to steer clear of.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants to have their commencement turn into a controversial,
even belligerent, activity?" asked Robert A. Corrigan, president of
San Francisco State University, which has been beset lately with
tensions between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students. "You want
students to feel good about their experience at commencement."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas F. Daly IV, editor of the twice-monthly newsletter Vital
Speeches of the Day, said that from what he has observed this month,
"You don't see commencement speakers tackling big issues.... You can
sense an uncertainty in the speakers when they talk about the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The one significant exception appears to be Sept. 11. Even when
speakers address the terrorist attacks, however, they are focusing
far less on the tragedy than on what it revealed about the importance
of public service, tolerance and the American spirit.</TE>
<TE>   This spring's speakers may be drawing a lesson from Cal State
Sacramento's midyear commencement in December, when Sacramento Bee
Publisher Janis Besler Heaphy voiced concern that the nation's war on
terrorism threatened to compromise basic American freedoms. Heaphy
was booed so badly that she gave up and sat down before finishing.</TE>
<TE>   Though a spokeswoman for Cal State Sacramento said the school
didn't make any changes because of the flap, the university last
weekend returned to its previous format of holding separate
ceremonies for each of its seven colleges, rather than one or two big
ones. The largest college, Arts and Letters, had no guest
commencement speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities Are Being Featured on the Dais</TE>
<TE>   Many other campuses are featuring celebrities on the dais.</TE>
<TE>   "I notice a lot of universities going for the [Bill] Cosbys of the
world," said Father Paul Locatelli, president of Santa Clara
University, a Jesuit school in Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Cosby, the comedian and author, has picked up honorary degrees or
spoken at an array of schools this month, including Drew University
in New Jersey, Rice University in Houston, Springfield College in
Massachusetts, Haverford College in Pennsylvania and the University
of Pittsburgh's regional campus in Johnstown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   At American University in policy wonk-rich Washington, D.C.,
actress Goldie Hawn took the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Even serious, science-minded Caltech this year will have actor
Alan Alda at its June 14 ceremony. This, however, is somewhat of a
special case: Among other things, Alda has portrayed the late Caltech
physicist and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman in a play about
Feynman's life, "QED."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see Alan Alda as a 'MASH' character. We see him as
someone of real substance," said Caltech President and Nobel laureate
David Baltimore. "There's certainly no conscious desire on our part
to downplay the major issues of the day or to provide a sort of
'comfort food' for graduation."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Alda, who also hosts a public television science
program, "Scientific American Frontiers," said he plans to talk about
Feynman and the importance of communicating science to the public.</TE>
<TE>   He said he isn't planning on tackling any issues in the news.</TE>
<TE>   Commencement "is an important event in the lives of the people
you're talking to. So then, do you get up in front of them and you
say, 'Here's what I think about the corn subsidy?' I don't know if
that's really the right place to talk about that," Alda said with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Commencement season usually draws an army of politicians, public
servants, authors and journalists to deliver addresses. Some of their
speeches make news or even, on occasion, history.</TE>
<TE>   Winston S. Churchill first warned of communism's "iron curtain"
descending on Eastern Europe during a 1946 commencement speech at
Westminster College in Fulton, Mo. The next year, Secretary of State
George C. Marshall, addressing Harvard University's graduating class,
outlined what became known as the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe.</TE>
<TE>   So far, this doesn't look like a season for the history books.</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco State, where a pro-Israeli peace rally this month
led to a tense confrontation with pro-Palestinian
counterdemonstrators, keynote speaker Nancy Pelosi, the minority whip
in the House of Representatives, didn't utter a word about the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   And although Santa Clara University has invited serious
commencement speakers to this year's ceremonies--a civil rights
attorney and the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center--the
priest who is delivering a pre-commencement homily said he won't
dwell on the negative. Father Locatelli, who has written a newspaper
column critical of the church in the sex-abuse scandal, said he would
at most allude to it, and he doesn't expect anyone else to broach the
topic.</TE>
<TE>   At Berkeley, the editorial page of the student paper ridiculed the
selection of Moseley, and "Why Moseley?" was scrawled in chalk near
the alumni association office. But Tuany Vo, president of the student
group that brought in the skier, said, "We weren't trying to run away
from issues."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Moseley, as an athlete and as someone who represented this
country in the Olympics, was the best one to speak to the students
about being dedicated and achieving your goals," Vo said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Berkeley's keynoter was former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet
Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl pointed out at the ceremony, however,
that Moseley and Reno had something in common: Both had hosted
"Saturday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   Even Journalist Steers Clear of the News</TE>
<TE>   At USC's main commencement ceremony May 10, author David
Halberstam was the keynote speaker. But even Halberstam, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist, steered clear of the news. Instead, the
one-time Vietnam correspondent emphasized the importance of listening
to "what your heart tells you to do" in pursuing a career.</TE>
<TE>   Commencement, Halberstam said afterward, is a celebration, a time
to focus on "old and abiding values," not the latest depressing
headline.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has bought into a keep-it-safe safe approach.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Wertheimer, a National Public Radio senior correspondent who
spoke at a USC satellite ceremony for graduating journalism students,
warned of the declining standards across much of American journalism.
And she lashed out at the television networks for cutting their news
staffs.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Wertheimer said universities are the perfect
forums for critical commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't say anything about anything at a university, where
can you say it?" she asked. "I would think that it's the point of the
academy."</TE>

<HD>2 Friends Found Guilty of Killing Retired Teacher</HD>
<DH>Trial: The teenagers face life in prison for the shooting
of the Compton woman in her home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two friends, a promising football star and a gang member, each face
life in prison after their convictions Tuesday for killing a retired
schoolteacher in a robbery that netted $20.</LD>
<LD>   Ollie Wayne Hawkins Jr., 16, and Joe Patrick Gaines, 17, were
found guilty of killing Kathryn Dawson in her Compton home last year.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins testified that he walked with his boyhood friend to the
victim's house, carrying the gun that Gaines used. But he denied any
further involvement.</LD>
<TE>   "Now Ollie is going to go away for the rest of his life--all
because of Patrick Gaines," Hawkins' attorney, Marvin L. Part, said
outside the courtroom. "[Gaines] not only took Kathryn Dawson's life,
but Ollie's life as well."</TE>
<TE>   Part said his client, who sat with his palms on his lap and mouth
open, struggled to keep from crying as the court clerk read the
verdict. "I feel heartsick," Part said. "I couldn't feel worse."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was disappointed when the jury quickly returned from
deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's survivors were in court in force, many of them wearing
T-shirts bearing her image and the airbrushed words, "I Love You
Moma."</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to see them sink down and feel the way we felt the
day we found out she was dead," said Dawson's daughter, Yolanda
Spooney.</TE>
<TE>   An Arkansas native, Dawson, 68, was described by friends and
relatives as a well-liked veteran of 40 years in the Los Angeles
Unified School District. The mother of six had spent most of her
teaching career in Watts. During that time she lived and raised her
children in the same Compton home.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was loved by everyone: by the neighbors, her students,
her family," daughter Debra Hinshaw had said. "She was as strong as a
rock."</TE>
<TE>   Separate juries returned the verdicts after deliberating about
five hours.</TE>
<TE>   Both teenagers face 25 years to life or life in prison without the
possibility of parole and will be sentenced in June.</TE>
<TE>   During the five-day trial, Hawkins was described as a model
student and standout athlete. Dominguez High School football coach
Keith Donaldson testified that he was surprised that Hawkins had
anything to do with a crime. Hawkins took the stand and said he
agreed to hold Gaines' loaded gun but did not know that someone would
die that day.</TE>
<TE>   He said that last July 21, the two teenagers walked down their
street to Dawson's house. Hawkins did not know the victim, but Gaines
did.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins testified that he watched his friend force the woman to
lie down with a pillow over her head and then shoot her once in the
head.</TE>
<TE>   The two juries listened to testimony together but were separated
during opening and closing statements.</TE>
<TE>   Spooney held back tears as she looked at Dawson's 7-month-old
great-granddaughter, Essence Siler, and said, "She never got to meet
her."</TE>

<HD>More Fires at Griffith Park Fuel Suspicions of Arson</HD>
<DH>Safety: Ten brush fires have burned in a month. Officials
say none are accidental but have no suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two more fires in Griffith Park on Tuesday--the ninth and 10th in
just over a month--are fueling suspicion that they're the work of an
arsonist, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's first blaze broke out about 11 a.m. and scorched about
three acres along the 2700 block of Vermont Avenue. The second, which
erupted about 3:30 p.m., blackened about 15 acres near Fern Dell
Road. Neither fire threatened any homes.</LD>
<LD>   "None of these fires are accidental," said Los Angeles Fire
Department Battalion Chief Dan McCarthy.</LD>
<TE>   The fires have been classified as "incendiary and suspicious,"
although investigators have no suspects and have not recovered any
incendiary devices.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Tuesday's fires, all of the blazes have occurred on
weekends, said Battalion Chief Bob Franco, the LAFD's community
liaison officer.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the fires, including Tuesday's and two on Memorial Day,
have been near the Griffith Observatory, which shut down in January
for a three-year renovation, Franco said. The 67-year-old landmark
has not been threatened by the blazes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the fires, including Tuesday's, have been battled with
water-dropping helicopters because they burned in areas inaccessible
by roads.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Ban Indian Mascots Is Blocked</HD>
<DH>Schools: Measure to end use of Native American icons loses
to bipartisan opposition in Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Legislation that would make California the first state to ban Native
American team mascots from public schools was defeated in the
Assembly Tuesday amid strong opposition from Republicans and some
Democrats who called it an example of excessive political
correctness.</LD>
<LD>   The measure by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) had
sailed through two policy committees with only one opposing vote,
encouraging Native American activists who have been fighting for more
than 30 years to rid schools of stereotypical Indian mascots they
find offensive.</LD>
<LD>   But AB 2115 encountered firm opposition on the Assembly floor from
most Republicans, who ridiculed the measure and wondered aloud where
government would draw the line. Some Democratic lawmakers also
questioned whether the bill was warranted, and why more of the
state's Native American tribes were not involved.</LD>
<TE>   "For too long, we have tolerated racial insensitivity" in mascots
such as the cartoon Indian of the Cleveland baseball team logo,
Goldberg told her colleagues, calling her legislation "a bill whose
time has come."</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy and sometimes passionate debate, it ultimately
gathered just 29 votes, far short of the 41 needed for passage. By
contrast, 35 legislators voted against it, and Goldberg staffers said
afterward that they were surprised by the strength of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) mobilized GOP
lawmakers against Goldberg's measure, which would have forced schools
statewide to phase out Indians, Chiefs, Redskins and all tribal names
from school marquees and uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a matter for the California Legislature," Cox said.
"This is an issue that should be left to local school boards to
decide."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg recently amended her measure, which initially could also
have led to bans on other ethnic mascots such as the Arabs and
Tartars, to Native American names. Nonetheless, some opponents
focused on those other names too, making a case that mascots were a
slippery slope for state lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "This measure should be voted down; it is political correctness
run amok," said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta).</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) used humor to make a
similar point, quipping that if the train of thought in Goldberg's
bill was followed to its conclusion, depressed people might take
offense to the color blue on team uniforms, religious people might
object to the Devils and atheists might quibble with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never admitted this before," said Ashburn, who is small of
stature, "but I don't like people known as Giants."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg was not amused. She cited the numerous civil rights
groups supporting the bill, including the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People and the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, and called it a matter of human dignity that
cannot be left to local school boards. Those boards, supporters of a
ban argue, often fail to act under pressure from alumni groups and
others who consider the mascots a part of school tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "We've compared Native Americans to ducks, and colors, instead of
human beings," she said, adding, "This is not a joke."</TE>
<TE>   With a 50-30 Democratic majority in the Assembly, Goldberg would
have been able to overcome Republican opposition with stronger
support from her own party. But many Democrats either abstained from
the vote or voted against the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada Flintridge), said she
sympathized with Goldberg's attempts to address prejudice. But as the
representative of the Arcadia High Apaches, a school that has worked
with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to develop a mascot that both
sides find not only acceptable but educational, she considered the
bill flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry that we are hurrying with this bill a one-size-fits-all
measure that does not represent the diversity of our large state,"
said Liu, who, on Arcadia High's behalf, had tried to get Goldberg to
provide for exemptions in her bill, without success.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City), who has carried a
number of measures benefiting Native American casinos and tribes in
recent years, said he had gotten to know well the 107 federally
recognized tribes in the state. Although some are concerned with the
stereotyping that often accompanies Indian mascots, he said, few
consider it a pressing issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't support this bill because when I talk to the tribal
leaders I know--and I know dozens of them--none of them are
supporting this bill" but one, Cardenas said. A ban, he added, may
have merit, but needs "more input by California Native Americans," a
suggestion that the Native American activists pushing the measure
were not representative of the state's tribes.</TE>

<HD>Wetlands Purchase by State Endorsed</HD>
<DH>Environment: Board vote removes final obstacle to public
ownership of Ormond Beach site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials on Tuesday knocked down the final obstacle to public
ownership of 265 acres at Ormond Beach as the heart of a vast
wetlands nature preserve.</LD>
<LD>   In a unanimous vote, the Public Works Board endorsed the state
Coastal Conservancy's decision Thursday to buy the site from Southern
California Edison for $9.7 million. The sale was considered
troublesome because Edison refused to clean up any possible
contamination on the site, which housed fuel tanks and a maze of
underground pipes serving a power plant.</LD>
<LD>   Had the board rejected the deal, it would have paved the way for a
competing bidder, Occidental Petroleum Corp., to acquire the land for
a $250-million energy facility.</LD>
<TE>   Conservationists expressed jubilation and relief after the
hourlong board meeting in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   They contended Occidental's proposed liquefied natural gas
terminal would have fouled a fragile environment already pocked with
industrial blight.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of letters and calls and pleas from the people of
Ventura County for the Coastal Conservancy to buy this property,"
said Peter Brand, a Coastal Conservancy official who oversees
projects in Ventura County. "I'm really excited for them that we were
able to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The decision capped more than two decades of local efforts to save
the marshy region on the fringe of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Home to a number of endangered seabirds, the Edison property is
viewed as crucial in the state's plan to preserve about 4,000 acres
of wetland stretching nine miles between Port Hueneme and Point Mugu.
Negotiations are underway for the state purchase of an adjacent 300
acres owned by the city of Oxnard and the Metropolitan Water
District.</TE>
<TE>   All land acquisitions by the state are subject to approval by the
Public Works Board, and this one, saddled with an unknown amount of
waste, was particularly vexing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was by no means a slam-dunk," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   The board was swayed, he said, by preliminary environmental
studies indicating no severe environmental damage on the property.
The conservancy has earmarked $1.5 million for a cleanup on the site,
and acquired a $300,000 insurance policy covering claims that might
arise from toxics there in the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, board members hesitated, according to Supervisor
Kathy Long, who represented Ventura County at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was unprecedented for the Public Works Board to buy
properties like this with an unknown risk," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were willing to take an extra leap of good faith."</TE>
<TE>   At a special meeting Friday, Ventura County supervisors passed a
resolution of support for the purchase. They also criticized Edison
for insisting the land be bought as-is.</TE>
<TE>   An Edison spokesman has said the company was obligated to make the
identical offer to both bidders, and that its pending deal with
Occidental included no cleanup provision.</TE>
<TE>   But Edison's critics did not accept that explanation, contending
that the company was using a legal technicality to avoid the added
expense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to call them a good corporate citizen," Assemblywoman
Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) said. "They should step up to
the plate and accept responsibility for problems they created."</TE>

<HD>Parks to Begin Raising Funds for a Council Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just weeks after city politicians denied him a second term as Los
Angeles police chief, Bernard C. Parks says he will take out papers
today to begin raising money to run for the City Council in March.</LD>
<LD>   "I see this as a chance to work on broader issues," said Parks,
who worked for the LAPD for 40 years. "I believe the whole issue of
public service is honorable.... I'm hoping to bring a fresher or
different view to politics."</LD>
<LD>   Although some political strategists said they believe Parks is
preparing to challenge the man who ended his LAPD career--Mayor James
K. Hahn--the former chief says he is not looking beyond the race for
the 8th Council District seat.</LD>
<TE>   "My focus today is to deal with the issues in the district," which
covers South and Southwest Los Angeles and is represented by Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who is leaving the council because of term limits,
Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Hahn announced that he was opposing the chief's bid
for a second five-year term because Parks had not done enough to
reform the LAPD, a claim that Parks denied.</TE>
<TE>   The position prompted criticism from the city's black activists,
who strongly supported Parks as one of the country's few African
American police chiefs. They said they felt betrayed by the mayor's
position, especially because black voters had been instrumental in
Hahn's election.</TE>
<TE>   But the Police Commission agreed with Hahn, voting 4 to 1 to deny
Parks' application to continue as head of the department. Parks, 58,
appealed the decision to the council, where he accused Hahn and the
police union of conspiring to make life better for officers at the
expense of public safety.</TE>
<TE>   But city lawmakers were unswayed by Parks' appeal. They voted
overwhelmingly to uphold the commission's decision. After Parks said
he was retiring earlier this month, the city launched a nationwide
search for his replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he wanted to take a few weeks off to consider his
options. He hired political consultants Kerman Maddox and Rick Taylor
to set up a possible council campaign.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he said he planned to file papers with the city Ethics
Commission today to begin raising money for his effort. He also said
he and his wife, Bobbie, are preparing to move from their home in an
unincorporated area of the county to nearby Baldwin Hills in the 8th
District.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas is running for an Assembly seat. If he wins, he will
leave the council in January; if he loses, he will vacate the seat in
June 2003. His successor will be chosen in the March election.</TE>
<TE>   So far, six others have filed papers to run in the 8th District:
Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), Robert Cole, Sherri L.
Franklin, Kevin Melton, Mervin L. Evans and Karen Bass.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has yet to take a position on the city's most contentious
issue: secession by the San Fernando Valley. He said he is studying
it.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran political consultant Joseph Cerrell said he believes Parks
will win handily.</TE>
<TE>   "If you call Central Casting and ask for a public official,
they'll send you Bernie Parks," Cerrell said. "He sounds good, he
looks good, he dresses well. And this guy knows politics.... He's as
close to a slam dunk as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   But some officials say privately that Parks must demonstrate that
he has more on his mind than political revenge against Hahn and his
other foes if he wants to be an effective council member.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll need to be a consensus builder," said one city official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the criticism, Maddox said he believes the former
chief is up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's going to have any problem," Maddox said. "He
comes with phenomenal experience. He has served the city for almost
four decades."</TE>

<HD>Subdivision Foes Get More Time, Signatures</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula: Opponents receive a reprieve on their ballot
measure aimed at blocking the 2,250-home mini-city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bolstered by a reprieve late last week, opponents of a proposed 2,250
home subdivision northwest of Santa Paula on Tuesday submitted 250
additional signatures for a November ballot measure aimed at stopping
the project.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Paula City Clerk Steven Salas agreed late Friday to let
slow-growth activists continue gathering signatures over the long
holiday weekend, said Josie Herrera, deputy city clerk.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources, who
submitted the additional signatures, hope that will be enough to push
them to the 1,074 needed to qualify the measure for the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, they were short by 68 signatures. They collected triple
that number over three days knowing that many of the signers' names
would be disqualified because they are not registered to vote, a SOAR
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had an overwhelmingly positive response," said Jim Procter, an
attorney heading up the opposition group. "We posted people outside
of shopping centers. I'm confident we will have enough to get this on
the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   But a consultant for the developer is already raising questions
about the fairness of Salas' decision.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Tomlin, a spokesman for Arizona-based Pinnacle Development
Group, said a separate petition for a ballot measure put together by
the developer was submitted by May 15, the initial deadline set by
Salas to turn in signatures.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what the reasoning is behind his decision to
give them an extension," Tomlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle's initiative would amend the city's growth boundaries to
include 5,413 acres in Adams Canyon, where the developer wants to
build a mini-city of upscale homes, schools, golf courses, hotels and
shopping areas.</TE>
<TE>   The competing SOAR initiative, however, would change the zoning
for the canyon acreage where Pinnacle wants to build from "urban" to
"agricultural," effectively killing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula officials contend the confusion over the
signature-gathering deadline began when county elections officials
suggested that the city forward signatures for verification by May
15.</TE>
<TE>   The city later discovered that Ventura was given until May 28 to
turn in signatures for its own ballot initiatives and asked that
Santa Paula's deadline be extended to the same date, Herrera said.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials say Santa Paula knew all along that May 28
was the final deadline, said Gene Browning, a county election
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "It was explained to them several times that if they needed more
time they could take that additional time," Browning said.</TE>

<HD>Support for Hollywood Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: LAFCO chief will urge that cityhood plan, like
Valley's, be sent to the voters in November. Harbor area will likely
have to wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles voters would decide in November whether Hollywood--as
well as the San Fernando Valley--should become independent cities,
but would not vote on breaking off the harbor area for at least two
years, under recommendations released Tuesday by the head of the
agency studying all three plans.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local Agency Formation
Commission, said he will tell the panel today that Hollywood cityhood
would be financially viable and should be placed on the Nov. 5
citywide ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "It is feasible," Calemine said. "There are sufficient reserves
for it to work."</LD>
<TE>   After a similar recommendation by Calemine, the commission voted 8
to 1 last week to call an election on the Valley breakaway bid. Its
decision on Hollywood is due next week.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine also suggested Tuesday that the famed Hollywood sign be
included within a new Hollywood city, something Los Angeles officials
oppose.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO will decide today whether to shelve the harbor-area measure,
long hampered by financial questions, to allow more analysis. Andrew
Mardesich, a leader of the harbor breakaway drive, said Tuesday that
he supports the two-year delay. He and other secessionists have
disputed the financial assumptions that Calemine used to review the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor's fate could have important implications for the Valley
and Hollywood breakup proposals. To win, each measure needs a
majority of votes within the breakaway area and a majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists believe their chances of securing citywide approval
are better if all three proposals hit the ballot at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   But some political strategists question that logic, saying that
three simultaneous proposals could provoke a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me you could create a fear of three secession
operations," said Joe Cerrell, a veteran Los Angeles political
consultant. "Joe and Jane Ordinary Citizen might say, 'They've gone
overboard. This is radical. It's not just the San Fernando Valley,
it's Hollywood and it's the whole San Pedro port area. My God, what's
going to be left?'"</TE>
<TE>   If LAFCO follows Calemine's recommendations, voters would be asked
in the fall to split the nation's second-largest city into as many as
three parts.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign already is heating up across Los Angeles. City
political leaders are amassing a multimillion-dollar fund to fight
secession, depicting it as a risky proposition that would jeopardize
municipal finances and public safety, while breakup supporters plan a
broad grass-roots effort to tap voter discontent over city services.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood area is home to about 160,000 people, and the Valley
to 1.35 million. Together, they account for 40% of Los Angeles'
population. Calemine's conclusions follow more than two years of
analysis on the three secession proposals, focusing on whether each
region could survive financially without harming the remainder of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For Hollywood, he found that the proposed city would enjoy a
budget surplus even after paying Los Angeles up to $20 million a year
to make up for tax revenue lost in the split.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a small price to pay for freedom," said Hollywood VOTE
President Gene La Pietra. "Hollywood has been neglected by the city
and it's down for the last count. This is the last chance to
revitalize Hollywood and it will only be done through local control."</TE>
<TE>   In the recommendations, Calemine said LAFCO should exclude areas
west of Fairfax Avenue and south of Melrose Avenue that include the
Beverly Center and the new Grove shopping center. The secession
proposal originally took in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents much of Hollywood,
disputed Calemine's findings and said the proposal should not go
before voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is a great city and Hollywood is a great part of Los
Angeles," LaBonge said. "This [new] city will not be able to survive.
It will cut up and balkanize areas in Los Angeles and it will be of
no benefit."</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge joined his council colleagues Tuesday in a unanimous vote
to oppose the harbor secession plan. The council is expected to adopt
a similar resolution against the Hollywood bid next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to work now," said Councilwoman Janice Hahn about
the harbor-area secession plan. "I don't think this new city is going
to work in 2004 either, because I don't think there is any way you
can cut this, slice this, dice this, that really makes this city
viable unless we forgive all of their debt and we give them all of
our assets."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine recommended on May 11 that LAFCO reject the harbor
proposal, finding that a waterfront city, population 141,000, would
not be able to pay for the same level of services the area now gets
from Los Angeles. He reconsidered that position after receiving more
information from the secession camp.</TE>
<TE>   A revised harbor plan--complicated by proposed boundary changes
and a scheme to contract with Los Angeles County rather than the city
of Los Angeles for services--requires more analysis, Mardesich said.</TE>
<TE>   "People will get an accurate study this time," he said. "No more
of this big broad-brush thing. We were always under the shadow of the
Valley [secession proposal]. Our objections and our issues weren't
addressed until recently."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, LAFCO repeatedly has raised questions about
the harbor area's financial strength. The area has a weak retail
base, with no regional mall that generates sales tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell, in a review of Calemine's
report, agreed that the area would not be fiscally viable. The
proposal was further hobbled when the State Lands Commission
recommended against including the Port of Los Angeles in the proposed
city, denying it about $18 million in yearly revenue.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a LAFCO commissioner,
said Tuesday that the harbor plan warrants further study. Diamond Bar
Councilwoman Carol Herrera, another commissioner, agreed: "The whole
story is not complete. We need to do more studies of the harbor's
fiscal viability and we're out of time."</TE>
<TE>   But county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who also sits on the LAFCO
board, said he is skeptical that the harbor proposal will ever fly.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to hear the arguments from the staff as to why they think
putting it off makes sense," said Yaroslavsky, who agreed that the
measure should not go on this year's ballot. "But I think the burden
is on the staff to make a case as to what facts they think might
change in 18 months."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley cityhood proposal is in the midst of a routine, 30-day
reconsideration period, during which anyone can ask LAFCO to change
its decision.</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, Valley neighborhood activist Harry Coleman was the
only person to file for a reconsideration.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that LAFCO gave short shrift to the city's concerns that
a split would leave Los Angeles with at least $153 million in
centralized costs that it would still have to cover. Coleman is
married to former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, a Valley Republican. Both were
once avid secession supporters but now oppose the breakup measure.</TE>

<HD>Schools Challenge Mandatory Testing</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. and San Francisco districts seek to alter
or scrap Stanford 9 and exit exams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of California's biggest school districts took preliminary steps
Tuesday toward changing or abandoning the much-criticized Stanford 9
test and California's new high school exit exam.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Board of Education decided to study alternative
assessments for gauging student academic achievement.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco school board introduced a nearly identical
measure as two of its members urged an end to the tests altogether.</LD>
<TE>   But it's unclear whether the actions will amount to anything more
than a protest because the state's 1,000 school districts are
required by federal and state laws to administer the exams or ones
like them. Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer urged the school board
not to challenge state testing rules.</TE>
<TE>   Some school leaders in the two cities argued that standardized
tests perpetuate discrimination against poor and minority children,
many of whom attend crowded schools and do not speak English
fluently.</TE>
<TE>   "Standardized tests do not necessarily measure what our kids are
learning in the classroom but [reflect] socioeconomic status and
resources in schools," said Jose Huizar, vice president of the Los
Angeles board. "A majority of our kids don't have the life experience
that these tests are testing."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal passed 4 to 1, with David Tokofsky voting against it,
saying that he fears the district would be breaking state law.
(Marlene Canter abstained and Mike Lansing was absent.) The measure
stopped short of calling for an end to the Stanford 9 and the high
school exit exam. It instructed district staff to develop alternative
ways within six months to measure academic progress. Those changes
could include supplements to the current exams.</TE>
<TE>   Both exams are key parts of Gov. Gray Davis' education reforms.
The Stanford 9 has been the primary component of the state's Academic
Performance Index, which is used to rank schools, dole out awards for
campuses that improve and punish those that falter. The high school
exit test goes into effect for the graduating class of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokeswoman defended the tests as a fair and equitable way
to ensure that schools deliver a quality education to all of the
state's 6 million public school students.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a crying shame if two of the largest school
districts in the state decided that their kids are not worth testing
and their schools aren't worth being held accountable for educating
their students," said Hilary McLean, a Davis spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and San Francisco join a growing national backlash
against standardized testing. Community groups and educators in
Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and elsewhere have voiced concerns
about high-stakes exams that determine the fate of students, schools
and entire districts.</TE>
<TE>   The critics note that African Americans and Latinos have for
decades scored lower than whites and Asian Americans on national
tests of reading, math and science.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the sharply worded measure criticized the Stanford
9 and high school exit exam for discriminating against students with
limited English skills.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also said that district schools in poor and minority
neighborhoods have fewer resources--including a shortage of
materials, college prep classes and certificated teachers. Relying on
such tests, the proposals said, unfairly penalizes students in these
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There are huge inequities that exist in this district for poor
children and immigrant children," board member Genethia Hayes, one of
the measure's sponsors, said during the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, Huizar, Julie Korenstein and Caprice Young voted for it
over the objections of the district's general counsel, Hal
Kwalwasser. He said that the measure's wording about unequal
resources in low-income communities could undermine the district's
position in a legal settlement aimed at equalizing funding across
district schools.</TE>
<TE>   Romer also insisted that the measure would send the wrong message
to students and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe that we as a district should do anything here
today to encourage parents and youngsters to believe that this is a
racist test and we shouldn't use it," Romer said. "The consequence is
that they won't be encouraged to prepare for it and pass it. The
people who will be hurt will be the students themselves."</TE>
<TE>   About 250 students, parents and teachers from a grass-roots group
called Coalition for Educational Justice rallied outside school
district headquarters as the school board debated the measure. The
protesters marched with signs and banners that said "End Racist
Tests--City Schools Deserve the Best," and chanted: "Hey, hey, ho,
ho, the Stanford 9 has got to go."</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, the protesters cheered.</TE>
<TE>   "What just happened in there was a big victory for racial
justice," Alex Caputo Pearl, an organizer, said after the board vote.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, the San Francisco school board introduced a
nearly identical measure modeled after the Los Angeles motion. The
San Francisco board is expected to vote on its version next month.</TE>
<TE>   While the San Francisco proposal also stopped short of calling for
an end to standardized tests, the board members who sponsored it said
that is their ultimate goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly don't want to be seen as not wanting
accountability," said board member Mark Sanchez, who taught
elementary school in San Francisco before joining the board.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have measures of how the kids are doing. But I
absolutely reject this testing system. It's punitive."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has already waged one fight over the Stanford 9.
After the statewide exam was introduced in 1997, the school district
refused to test its limited-English students who had less than 30
months of English instruction.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Education sued the district, which
relented in 2000 in exchange for the state loosening the rules that
let schools inform parents of their right to have their children opt
out of the exam.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Delaine Eastin, the state superintendent
of public instruction, called the Stanford 9 imperfect, but said the
state is moving away from such standardized tests in favor of those
based on California's new academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Stanford 9 is being replaced next year with a comparable
exam from the Educational Testing Service.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Eastin took issue with critics who of standardized testing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's racist to say we can't expect much of poor kids," Eastin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "A standardized test is not only justified but required under the
law."</TE>

<HD>Deal Struck to Restore Salt Ponds in S.F. Bay</HD>
<DH>Resources: Acquisition heralds the largest wetlands
restoration project in state's history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal officials today plan to announce a landmark
$135-million deal to buy and begin restoration of 16,500 acres of
salt ponds in the south San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative deal with Cargill Inc., an agricultural and
industrial company, begins the largest wetlands restoration project
in the state's history. It is designed to help nurse San Francisco
Bay back to ecological health, eventually returning the saltwater
evaporation ponds to tidal marshes for birds and fish.</LD>
<LD>   "This is more than just a purchase," Gov. Gray Davis said in a
statement. "We're taking the first step toward restoring the San
Francisco Bay."</LD>
<TE>   The multicolored evaporation ponds, which were diked for salt
production during the California Gold Rush, now ring the bay's
southern shores from Mountain View to Hayward. They can readily be
seen from planes flying into Oakland and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tidelands are expected to become part of the adjacent
Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The rest will
be part of a state-run wildlife preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Today's announcement culminates four years of negotiations with
Cargill to purchase the drained and desiccated wetlands--once offered
for sale for $300 million. The process bogged down repeatedly until
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) brought the sides together with
the help of four private, nonprofit foundations.</TE>
<TE>   As the deal is structured, Cargill will receive $100 million for
the purchase of 16,596 acres--roughly 26 square miles--and take a tax
write-off of $143 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company promises to donate the salt-making rights on an
additional 9,000 acres of evaporation ponds that are now part of the
national wildlife refuge.</TE>
<TE>   The state government will apply about $72 million from
voter-approved bond funds toward the $100-million purchase. The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service will provide $8 million, and the difference
will be made up by four Bay Area private groups: the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the
Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Richard and Rhoda Goldman
Fund. The purchase is set to be completed by Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The foundations also joined with the state and federal governments
to supply $35 million to maintain the ponds and draft plans for their
restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "Cargill will retain the responsibility of operating and cleaning
up the salt ponds," said Mary Nichols, secretary of the state
Department of Resources. "Then they will turn them over to the state
and federal agencies, and we will restore them."</TE>
<TE>   Restoration will not be easy, or cheap. Some experts believe it
may take decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to turn the
ponds into wetlands, flushed by the tides.</TE>
<TE>   After 150 years of operation, many of the ponds are contaminated
with a production byproduct 10 times as salty as the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   South San Francisco Bay cities have long relied on Cargill's
well-maintained system of dikes and levees as protections against
flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Still, restoring the wetlands has been a top priority of state
officials and an array of environmental groups focused on improving
the water quality of the bay and bringing back once-abundant fish and
shorebirds.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 100 years, people have had these salt ponds in
their backyards," said Mike Spear, the state's assistant resources
secretary for land conservation. "Now they will have the bay as their
backyard--an instant property upgrade."</TE>

<HD>Open 80 Turns In Petitions</HD>
<DH>Development: Backers of a plan to build 1,390 homes in the
hills north of Ventura prepare for a battle to get measure approved
in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After weeks of staking out grocery stores and canvassing
neighborhoods, proponents of a November ballot initiative that would
allow more hillside development turned over the results of their
petition drive to the Ventura city clerk's office.</LD>
<LD>   The group collected 15,662 signatures of local residents,
according to representatives of the Open 80 campaign. A minimum of
8,906 valid voter signatures are need to qualify the initiative for
the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "Considering that only about 15,000 people in Ventura vote in any
given election, for us to get close to 16,000 signatures is quite a
feat," said Rod Houck, the group's campaign manager. About 30
supporters, including a Little League team, turned out to help
deliver the stacks of signed petitions to City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   The city clerk's office will turn the signatures over to the
county clerk's office, which will have 30 days to verify them. Each
person who signed must be a Ventura resident and registered voter.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the electorate Nov. 5, the measure would clear the
way for construction of 1,390 homes on the hills north of downtown
and dedicate about 3,000 acres to permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   "We were elated that within five weeks we were able to gather
close to 16,000 signatures," said Margaret Merryman, spokeswoman for
the Open 80 campaign. "We expected it because we believe in it."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the proposed measure said they weren't surprised at
the number of signatures collected by the Open 80 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "When you use paid signature gatherers you can always get your
signatures," said Steve Bennett, co-founder of Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources, a slow-growth advocacy group. "It's more a
test of how good the signature gatherers are than it is a test of the
voters."</TE>
<TE>   But Bennett acknowledged it will be a challenge for opponents if
the initiative qualifies for the ballot. Their main objections are
that the development skirts the usual environmental review process
and does not provide for affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "They've dedicated perhaps maybe $1 million to their effort
compared to a grass-roots campaign with only a few thousand dollars
to spend," Bennett said. "We're going to need a lot of people to step
forward to even have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   SOAR has joined forces with another group, Ventura Citizens for
Hillside Preservation, to oppose the initiative. Representatives for
each group said they plan to work aggressively to get their message
out.</TE>
<TE>   "We will start actively trying to educate people on the pros and
cons so they can make an educated decision in November," said Martha
Zeiher of the citizens group.</TE>
<TE>   Open 80 proponents will promote their measure by talking to civic
organizations and neighborhood groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This is absolutely historic," Merryman said. "We will win."</TE>

<HD>Effort to Build Smaller Vets Home Criticized</HD>
<DH>Health: Facilities in Saticoy and Lancaster would lose
hundreds of beds in order to construct a bigger care center in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veterans in Ventura County expressed outrage Tuesday over a state
decision to build a smaller veterans home in Saticoy, while
politicians involved in the project said they were satisfied with the
compromise.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties are home to
134,000 veterans, but the new nursing home scheduled to be built on
donated land along the Santa Clara River will be large enough to
serve only 100 veterans at a time.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel like we've been shafted," said Eugene Peterson, 64, a
Korean War veteran who lives in Ojai. "I think it's outrageous that
these politicians can push something through like that. This is
really bad."</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura County home and another proposed for Lancaster were
originally supposed to house up to 400 veterans, but their sizes were
scaled down to allow for construction of a large home in West Los
Angeles, where thousands more veterans live, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), whose district
includes West Los Angeles, sponsored the bill that calls for building
the three homes. It earmarks funds from a $50-million bond approved
by California voters last year to pay for the state's portion of
construction costs. The entire project is expected to cost about $86
million.</TE>
<TE>   With about 300,000 veterans living within a 30-mile radius of
Lancaster and an additional 482,000 veterans in the rest of Los
Angeles County, the Commission on California Veterans Homes appointed
by Gov. Gray Davis preferred the West Los Angeles location for the
larger nursing home. The commission will hold its next meeting Monday
at Ventura City Hall and will tour the Saticoy site.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County veterans said they will show up in force to express
their displeasure with Wesson's bill, which is expected to be
approved by the Assembly today.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't understand the logic to it," said Chuck Bennett,
chairman of the Tri-County Veterans Home Coalition, which represents
12 veterans organizations. "It's politics of the worst kind because
it's playing with veterans and with what veterans want. This really
looks like we're being shunted off into the corner."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians who have been working to get a veterans home built in
Saticoy were more circumspect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a compromise and not the bill we wanted to see, but we could
have done worse," said Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa
Barbara). "Our veterans have been waiting and waiting for many years
to get what is significantly less than what we wanted and what we can
accommodate."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn said he was glad a home would
be built in Saticoy, no matter the size.</TE>
<TE>   "That's good, I support that," Flynn said by telephone from New
York, where he is tending to county business.</TE>
<TE>   Consultant Dawn Dyer, who represents Archstone Communities, the
Irvine firm donating the land for the home, said a smaller center is
better than none at all.</TE>
<TE>   "A hundred beds and the ability to have 50 day-care spaces is a
good starting point," said Dyer, adding that she believes that many
veterans from the San Fernando Valley will travel to Ventura County
for health-care services rather than navigate the traffic-choked
freeways of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 100 beds is not worth the effort," said 78-year-old
Willis Wolfe of Oxnard, who served in World War II, the Korean War
and Vietnam. "This L.A. stuff is all politics as far as I'm
concerned. I don't know why our voice isn't heard up there" in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of Jackson and state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis
Obispo), the Wesson package will contain a provision allowing for the
expansion of the Saticoy and Lancaster nursing homes if they fill to
capacity, a Wesson spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   But veteran Peterson said he will believe it when he sees it. He
travels 2 1/2 hours by bus every other month to the VA Medical Center
in West Los Angeles for treatment of his emphysema and the lingering
effects of two heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "What guarantee is there?" he said. "We won't get the other 300
rooms in probably another 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The 500-bed home in West Los Angeles will be built on the grounds
of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and will offer critically
needed care for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease,
Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   The homes are designed to provide more nursing care and assisted
living housing to veterans under an initiative sponsored by Congress,
which will pay two-thirds of the construction costs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   California operates veterans homes in Barstow, Chula Vista and
Yountville in Northern California. Political infighting in the
Legislature has stalled progress over where to build additional
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's plan stirred debate from the beginning because he
introduced the idea for a nursing home in West Los Angeles well after
the other projects had been proposed. The home would be financed, in
part, from savings that would result from scaling back the Lancaster
and Saticoy proposals.</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Language Classes to Be Offered</HD>
<DH>Education: Parents asked Garden Grove to consider the
courses, saying their children are not learning the tongue of their
heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Garden Grove high schools will offer foreign-language courses in
Vietnamese starting in September, joining the few public schools in
the state that teach the language as an elective.</LD>
<LD>   Students of Vietnamese heritage make up 32% of the Garden Grove
Unified School District's high school enrollment, and more than half
the student bodies of its two high schools--Bolsa Chica and La
Quinta--where the courses will be offered.</LD>
<LD>   Westminster High School, which added Vietnamese classes to its
curriculum in 1999, offers beginning to advanced level courses. The
school, in the Huntington Beach Union High School District, is
looking to offer the language in an Advanced Placement class.</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove will offer the language as a one-year pilot program,
then re-evaluate it.</TE>
<TE>   Parents in the district approached the schools a month ago about
whether officials would consider offering the classes, saying young
Vietnamese Americans are not learning the language of their heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to offer Vietnamese reflects a relatively recent
willingness by public-school educators to expand foreign-language
offerings beyond traditional Spanish, French, German and occasional
Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen an increase in the less commonly taught languages in
the last five years," said Arleen Burns, an educational programs
consultant with the state Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   But as schools look to provide instruction in Korean, Chinese and
Vietnamese, they also discover the challenge of building a curriculum
with little history on how it should be done and few textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "Vietnamese is an uncommonly taught language in K-12 schools, so
certainly it may be more difficult to find textbooks than commonly
taught languages such as Spanish, French and German," Burns said.
With no state-approved textbooks, the major source of help in the
state is the East Side Union High School District in San Jose, which
started teaching Vietnamese in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to write the textbooks and the curriculum at the time, and
we now sell them to other districts throughout the nation for
beginning to advanced courses," said Beth Reis, coordinator of
English Learner Programs for the district. The schools commissioned
Vietnamese scholars to write the textbook.</TE>
<TE>   State officials will be meeting with publishers next month to
evaluate textbooks and other materials for these newer language
courses.</TE>

<LD>Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "White Sox advance scout Bryan
Little says his brother, Red Sox Manager Grady Little, once carried a
small pistol in his golf bag and shot his brother Tommy's ball right
off the tee.</LD>
<LD>   "'Grady can get pretty loud and crazy on a golf course,' Bryan
told the Boston Globe. 'You'd think he would have learned some golf
etiquette.'"</LD>
<LD>   Etiquette? From a baseball manager?</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for assists in an NBA playoff
game?</TE>
<TE>   The ace and his aces: The late Sam Snead won a record 81 PGA Tour
events, three Masters, three PGA Championships and one British Open.</TE>
<TE>   However, Robert Harris, director of golf for the Greenbrier Resort
in West Virginia, where Snead was head pro for 38 years, told
National Public Radio, "By his own admission, his most remarkable
feat was 36 holes in one--with every club in the bag except the
putter."</TE>
<TE>   Visual junk: "What a great visual image this is," said "Celebrity
Boxing 2" host Chris Rose during 7-foot-7 Manute Bol's victory--by
unanimous decision--over former Chicago Bear William "the
Refrigerator" Perry, which aired Wednesday night on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Comment by Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Great
image? P.T. Barnum wouldn't have televised that bout."</TE>
<TE>   Fantasies: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "North Carolina has
run its NBA team out of the state so it can devote its time to
watching hockey. In a related development, Nebraska announced that it
has dropped football and applied for admission to the Ivy League."</TE>
<TE>   Ordained? Fran Blinebury of the Houston Chronicle on Robert
Horry's game-winning shot on Sunday: "The ball just seems to come to
[him] in these situations. Like metal filings to a magnet. Like moths
to a flame....</TE>
<TE>   "One of these days, Horry is going to be standing out on the
street and have a winning lottery ticket ride into his grip on the
wings of a breeze."</TE>
<TE>   Still intimidating: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"When you buy a pack of the new Tiger Woods golf balls, you get a
Tiger bobblehead doll.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's cute. If you put the Tiger doll in with a group of other
players' dolls, their putters start to bobble."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Creighton Miller, the College Hall of Fame halfback from
Notre Dame who died Saturday, scored the first touchdown against USC
at the Coliseum in 1942 on a 48-yard pass from Angelo Bertelli.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 94,519 watched the penalty-marred game, won by Notre
Dame, 13-0.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson, on May 15, 1984, and John Stockton,
on May 17, 1988, each with 24.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mike Morgan, 42-year-old Arizona Diamondback relief
pitcher, was felled by a line drive off his kneecap in Friday night's
game against the Dodgers. But he finished the inning and, remarkably,
had no swelling in his knee the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan credits his sturdy knees to his drinking habits--milk.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a milk fetish," he told the Arizona Republic. "On
our charters, I drink nine to 10 cartons of milk. It's strange but on
Friday night I drank a gallon of 1% milk and a half-gallon of 2%."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Undefeated, Untied, and Uninvited"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Kristine Setting Clark</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Griffin Publishing Group (Irvine)</TE>
<TE>   Price: $21.95</TE>
<TE>   The story of the 1951 University of San Francisco football team is
certainly worth documenting. And that's what Kristine Setting Clark,
who got a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate from
the school, has done in this 184-page hardcover book.</TE>
<TE>   The 1951 Dons had 10 future NFL players, five future Pro Bowlers
and three future members of the NFL Hall of Fame--a record for one
college team. The Hall of Famers were Ollie Matson, Bob St. Clair and
Gino Marchetti. And the team publicist was Pete Rozelle, a 1950 USF
graduate.</TE>
<TE>   This team is also noteworthy because of one of the greatest snubs
in college football history. Because the Dons had two black
players--Matson and halfback Burt Toler, who went on to become the
NFL's first black official--they were not invited to play in a bowl
game. Actually, the Orange Bowl invited the team, but only if Matson
and Toler didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1951 season, USF dropped football because the school
could no longer afford to field a team.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was inspired to compile this book three years ago after
seeing a 1991 NFL Films documentary in which NFL Films President
Steve Sabol called the Dons the "most magnificent 11 that no one had
ever heard of."</TE>
<TE>   Clark relies too heavily on reprinted newspaper clippings to tell
the story, but the book is well-researched and gets off to a good
start with forewords by Marchetti, Matson, St. Clair and Toler.
(Toler didn't play in the NFL because of a career-ending knee injury
suffered in the 1952 College All-Star game.)</TE>

<HD>TV Director Testifies in Son's Murder Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: Daniel Attias says it was a 'horrific mistake' to
buy student the car with which he killed four people in Isla Vista.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Television director Daniel Attias admitted Tuesday it was a
"horrific, horrific mistake" to buy his deeply troubled son the car
he used to kill four people in Isla Vista last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel remorse about that, yes I do," said Attias, 50, looking
grave and worn as he took the stand in his son David's murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   But the elder Attias said he reasoned that buying the turbocharged
Saab for his son might give him some leverage over David and his
increasingly explosive behavior. He was desperately trying to
persuade his son to take his medication, which the defendant had
stopped when he went off to college at UC Santa Barbara. Around
campus, David's increasingly strange behavior earned him the nickname
"Crazy Dave," according to previous testimony.</LD>
<TE>   The younger Attias had been in two other auto accidents in the
weeks before the Isla Vista neighborhood incident that took four
lives on Feb. 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was concerned about his driving, I was not alarmed," said
Daniel Attias. "Perhaps I should be faulted."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Attias is accused of second-degree murder in the auto
rampage. The defendant has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
The defense spent the opening days of the trial trying to show the
20-year-old was a deeply troubled person who couldn't make friends
and was institutionalized at 13 for trying to strangle his sister,
Rachel. A parade of therapists and psychiatrists have taken the stand
to describe the defendant as everything from a budding schizophrenic
to an obsessive-compulsive and manic-depressive whose childhood was
an emotional war zone.</TE>
<TE>   He attended a variety of special schools and took a medicine
cabinet full of drugs aimed at controlling his impulsive, rage-filled
behavior. Defense attorney Jack Earley said David Attias suffered a
psychotic break the night of the accident and has no memory of
hitting anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution, while admitting that the younger Attias suffers
from mental illness, maintains that the defendant knew what he was
doing that night. Killed in the incident were Ellie Israel, 27, and
Christopher Divis, Ruth Levy and Nicholas Bourdakis, all 20.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the trial, David Attias, who has been taking
psychotropic medication in jail, has sat mute, showing little
interest in his surroundings. As the elder Attias testified, he
seemed to avoid looking at his son, whom he characterized as "a
wonderful child" with enormous gifts but even more enormous troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Earley previously called witnesses to describe Attias'
difficulties in the outside world. With the elder Attias taking the
stand, the jurors were given a close-up view of a family that was
often in chaos in David's early years.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Attias said he was away a lot building his career as a
television director. His credits include episodes of "The Sopranos,"
"Ally McBeal" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</TE>
<TE>   "Directing episodic television is very demanding, very stressful,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he got home, he said, he often found things in an uproar. He
said his wife, Diana, loved David, but "tended to withdraw" from the
upheaval, allowing David free rein. At one time, his wife threatened
to move out, Attias said. "I love my wife," said the father. "But it
did make me very frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the family often made up "a combustible kind of
arrangement."</TE>
<TE>   The elder Attias admitted his own shortcomings, saying he had
"high expectations" for his son and was reluctant to believe his
problems in school and at home were indicators of serious developing
mental illness. If he had realized what was going on, he would have
allowed his son to withdraw from UC Santa Barbara and attend Santa
Monica City College, as he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The defense is expected to wrap up its case this week.</TE>

<HD>Not Just in It for the Honey</HD>
<DH>Insects: For those stung by the beekeeping bug, this is
more than a hobby--it's one way to defend the community against
killer bees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As passions often do, the urge to keep bees can strike without
warning. Take Ern Shockley's case.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago, Shockley, now 79, was an attorney with a busy
practice in Los Angeles. Among his clients was a 90-year-old woman
who believed there was nothing better for her arthritis than a good
bee sting. Before Shockley could say "billable hours," he was the
proud owner of 20 hives, and hundreds of thousands of bees.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California has hundreds of people like Shockley who keep
bees--mostly for fun, not profit. And lest anyone think they are in
it just for the honey and the buzz, local beekeepers say they are the
first line of defense in the effort to keep aggressive Africanized
(or killer) bees from taking over the Southland.</LD>
<TE>   The keepers' numbers are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   According to John Hurley, apiary inspector for the Los Angeles
County Agriculture Commission, residents who keep bees are supposed
to register with his office, but only 41 are on the rolls. Yet there
are about 100 members of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Assn. and
another 100 in the Orange County organization.</TE>
<TE>   Registered or not, professional or hobbyist, local beekeepers are
fascinated by bees.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Reese of Pasadena is one of those who sees local beekeepers
as a defense against Africanized bees. "We who keep good, friendly
European bees are essentially an early warning system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Reese is constantly studying his hives, he believes he
would notice if an Africanized queen moved in. Then he would
"re-queen" his hive, replacing the aggressive queen with a more
docile European queen that had been mated with European drones.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Webster of East Los Angeles is a second-generation
beekeeper. His father, Jorge, began keeping bees in Compton in the
late 1960s, at the urging of an apiarist buddy.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son now run their own bee-removal firm. They also keep
about 150 hives in a Whittier bee yard.Webster, 38, is constantly on
the lookout for Africanized bees.</TE>
<TE>   "You keep an eye on your queen," he said. "You mark her back [with
nontoxic dye], and you keep an eye on her."</TE>
<TE>   If an Africanized bee moves in and displaces a European queen, you
replace it with a mated queen guaranteed by its supplier: "You keep
the genetic line really, really docile," Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Bleitz, 49, of Burbank tends thousands of bees in a canyon at
the Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bleitz buys her queens from a reliable vendor, she has a
favorite source for free bees--Los Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo is committed to environmentally friendly pest control,
said Bleitz, who has been hired to keep an eye on its bees.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a week, Bleitz checks traps that she has set up at the zoo
to snare bees that might otherwise trouble visitors. She scrutinizes
the bees she gathers at the zoo, observing their behavior and taking
measurements to see if they are Africanized bees, which tend to be
smaller. Eric Mussen, a UC Davis Extension apiculturist, believes
amateur beekeeping is down statewide as a result of the appearance of
two different mites that harm honeybees, and the alarming invasion of
the Africanized subspecies.</TE>
<TE>   Mussen thinks the odds are poor that more widespread beekeeping
can save Los Angeles from domination by Africanized bees.</TE>
<TE>   Africanized bees cope better than the European variety with the
more lethal of the two bee mites, Varroa destructor, he said. And
once a hive is Africanized, it takes many generations of breeding
before the offspring are as tame as the most ornery European bees.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not beekeeping is effective in controlling killer bees,
Hurley said, "It's a wonderful hobby."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council postponed voting Tuesday on a plan to
redraw the district boundaries of the city's school board.</LD>
<LD>   Several council members asked for more time to evaluate the map
recommended last week by a council panel and another map proposed by
Councilman Ed Reyes. The redrawing of the Los Angeles Board of
Education's district boundaries, which occurs every 10 years to
reflect demographic shifts, has divided the board's seven members.
The favored plan, critics say, disenfranchises the San Fernando
Valley and unfairly shores up support for certain incumbent board
members. The council will reconsider the proposals Tuesday.</LD>

<HD>$1 Billion Short, Senate Rejects Its Budget Proposal</HD>
<DH>Spending: The plan fails to collect a single GOP vote.
Legislators could resume deliberations as early as Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Tuesday defeated its version of California's next
budget, which garnered considerable Republican opposition and was $1
billion out of balance.</LD>
<LD>   The spending plan went down on a vote of 25 to 14, falling two
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for approval. It failed
to garner a single Republican vote and will be taken up again at a
later date, possibly as early as Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate spending plan differs in dozens of ways from the one
proposed earlier this month by Gov. Gray Davis, including restoring
about $700 million for health services and increasing social services
spending by about $280 million. But it does not include money to
expand a health insurance program to cover poor parents--a key
priority for many Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   "There is much within this document for both Republicans and
Democrats to dislike," said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who heads
the Senate Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   When the Senate and Assembly approve their respective budget
proposals, they will convene a budget conference committee to draft a
compromise spending plan. That proposal must be approved by the
Legislature and sent to Davis to sign by the start of the new fiscal
year July 1--a frequently missed deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The measure containing the Senate's budget proposal cleared the
Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday by a vote of 9 to 4, with
Republicans voting against the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Next it moved to the full Senate, where Republicans objected to
Davis' proposed increase of the fee motorists pay to register their
cars to raise nearly $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   GOP legislators also called for a limit to be placed on government
spending, sought to save $1 billion by making state welfare
eligibility standards conform with federal guidelines, to stop
funding state agencies for vacant positions, and to rescind the
state's much-criticized $95-million Oracle computer software
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a modest start," Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks)
said. "Until you agree to that, stop blaming the taxpayers for your
own excesses."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate plan directs the conference committee, which will
consist of Democrats and Republicans from the Assembly and the
Senate, to close an additional hole of $1 billion, which state
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill contends is necessary for the
document to be balanced.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators could propose additional cuts, tax increases or
borrowing to cover the $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on its version of the
2002-03 state budget, which differs from plans floated by the Senate
and Davis in a variety of ways.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Senate nor Davis included money in their budget
proposals to expand a health insurance program for low-income
children to include their parents, for example. Assembly legislators
earmarked nearly $80 million so the expansion could begin July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly proposal also restores a $121-million cut to a
juvenile crime prevention program.</TE>

<HD>C. Rosenzweig, 71; TV Writer, Cancer Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Rosenzweig, a pioneer telethon producer, TV writer and art
collector who participated in a new cancer treatment study at UCLA,
has died. She was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenzweig, a 41-year cancer survivor who counseled and provided
hope for other cancer patients, died May 20 of ovarian cancer at her
home in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   During the 1950s, while with a Pittsburgh public relations firm,
Rosenzweig produced telethons for the March of Dimes and other
national charitable organizations. In fact, she wrote the official
March of Dimes telethon handbook, which was used by the
organization's future telethon producers.</LD>
<TE>   In 1976, Rosenzweig wrote "21 Days of America," a series of
two-minute, nationally televised salutes to the country's
bicentennial featuring President Ford, Bob Hope and other notable
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, she wrote several episodes of "Women of the
World," a syndicated series of one-hour documentary profiles of
famous and not-so-famous women.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Rosenzweig created Artists Editions Ltd., a
Beverly Hills company that produces jewelry by 10 well-known artists.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenzweig was inspired by the Bauhaus School--a 20th century
strain of art in which artists of dissimilar media worked together.</TE>
<TE>   "I've collected furniture and other works from the period when the
Bauhaus was formed in Europe," she said in 1989. "Even though the
artists were painters and sculptors, they made furniture, jewelry and
ceramics with the idea that art could be functional. That's what
inspired me."</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to have these [jewelry] pieces for herself, and she
set up a workshop with the artists, which we funded," said
Rosenzweig's husband, Saul. But other women also showed an interest
in owning the pieces, he said. And out of that grew the idea of
creating signed and numbered limited-edition jewelry pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The works created for Artists Editions Limited are in the
permanent collections of 12 major art museums, including the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</TE>
<TE>   For a half-dozen years in the 1980s, Rosenzweig headed a committee
for the Los Angeles museum's contemporary art council that
recommended monetary prizes and exhibitions at the facility for young
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Born Carol Coppersmith in New York City, Rosenzweig received a
bachelor's degree in journalism from Pennsylvania State University in
1951.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, she went to work as an account executive for Public
Relations Research Inc. in Pittsburgh, where she spent the next nine
years and eventually became vice president. Through that firm, she
produced nearly 20 telethons, mostly for the March of Dimes.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenzweig was first diagnosed with breast cancer at 29 and, after
undergoing two mastectomies in nine years, remained cancer-free for
22 years. In 1991, she was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer.
She experienced recurrences in 1994 and 1997, which required more
surgeries and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, she became the first patient at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer
Center to receive a new genetic treatment for ovarian cancer, which
helped push the cancer into remission.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very inspirational person," said Judith Gasson,
director of UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center. "She was very outspoken in
the way she encouraged people to participate in clinical trials,
because that's where all new therapies come from. And she firmly
believed she was alive for those four decades because of advances in
cancer therapy and that those are only possible because people are
willing to participate in clinical trials."</TE>
<TE>   As a long-time cancer survivor, Rosenzweig spent a good deal of
time writing and speaking about cancer. "She consulted with dozens
and dozens of cancer victims all over the world to try to encourage
them," said her husband, president of the RZ Group communications
investment company.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fortunate enough to have her speak to our volunteers on
several occasions," Gasson said.</TE>
<TE>   "She brought people to their feet. She really had a charisma that
is unusual."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Rosenzweigs donated $1 million to establish an
endowed chair in cancer therapy development at the Jonsson Cancer
Center.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, Rosenzweig is survived by her
children, Davy Rosenzweig of New York City and Laurance Rosenzweig of
Philadelphia; a grandson; and two brothers, Dr. Abraham Kupersmith of
New York City and James Coppersmith of Marblehead, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that memorial donations be made in
Rosenzweig's name to UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center Foundation, Factor
Building, 8-590 Box 951780, Los Angeles, CA 90095.</TE>

<HD>In Santa Ana Neighborhood, Traffic Barrier Is Bitter Divide</HD>
<DH>Community: The roadblocks also separate affluent homeowners
from mostly Latino renters. The experiment is due for a vote in
August.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After five years of renting an apartment in the densely populated
neighborhood just down the road from the graceful homes of French
Park, Martha Solorio wonders if someone is trying to send her family
a message.</LD>
<LD>   Neighborhood streets--the ones that she and her husband can no
longer use to drive their children to school--have been blocked in
that section of Santa Ana. And as an apartment renter, Solorio won't
be allowed to vote when residents are asked whether the barriers
should remain.</LD>
<LD>   "These changes don't work," said Sam Romero, a neighbor who also
opposes the barriers. "The only thing they do is make life miserable
for la raza [Latinos]."</LD>
<TE>   While designed to make neighborhood streets safe, the barriers
have become a source of frustration and a symbolic divide between
those who live in historic French Park and the largely Latino renters
who dominate nearby French Court.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the barricades are slowing response time for officers.
School officials said they have caused treacherous traffic problems
for students. And French Court residents said the barriers have
essentially walled them off from their more affluent neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the French Park barriers--the most controversial
of seven experiments with traffic diversion in Santa Ana--mirrors a
wider dispute over the effect of street blockades.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, such as Costa Mesa, concluded that blockades were of
little value and removed them. In South Pasadena, a wall has
separated the town from a more ethnically diverse Los Angeles
neighborhood for 27 years and remains a symbol of bigotry to some.</TE>
<TE>   French Park and French Court are contrasting neighborhoods in the
heart of Santa Ana that share streets, sidewalks and a popular grade
school. French Park is a community of historic homes while French
Court and the neighboring Logan community are dense with apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The barriers went up after homeowners voted 66 to 60 in favor of
the experiment. While the traffic plan affected both neighborhoods,
apartment renters in French Court were not allowed to vote and few
landlords in that neighborhood cast ballots. In August, property
owners will vote on whether the barriers should stay. They must be
approved by a two-thirds margin.</TE>
<TE>   The barriers, roughly 4 feet high with chain strung across the
top, were designed to reduce traffic along some main roads linking
both neighborhoods. Many French Park residents say the system has cut
down on the number of drivers who use their neighborhood as a
shortcut.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a perfect system," said Paul Giles, president
of Historic French Park, the neighborhood association. "I think it's
workable and reasonably fair. I would not change it."</TE>
<TE>   Parents in French Court and teachers at nearby Wallace R. Davis
Elementary say the barriers have diverted traffic from the main
avenues to more narrow and congested streets, raising the risk of
injury to school-bound children. In recent months, a girl was struck
by a car and a police officer was knocked off his motorcycle near the
school. Despite several requests, the school has been denied a
crossing guard, Principal Maria Gutierrez-Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of time before they kill a child," said Mike
Saldana, a custodian at the school who said he routinely sees
children running to dodge drivers, who sometimes make U-turns to
avoid the blocked streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic is similar to water; it takes the easiest, faster route,"
said Ruth Smith, the city's ranking traffic engineer.</TE>
<TE>   The dividers have delayed police response time; officers must
drive farther to reach the residents on each side of the barriers,
Lt. Tony Harrelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a life-or-death situation, seconds matter," said Stella
Bonilla, the community liaison at the elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Renters such as Solorio won't be able to vote in August when the
city prepares to decide whether the concrete blocks should become
permanent fixtures. Homeowners are entitled to a single vote. The
only renters eligible to vote are those living in duplex, triplex and
four-plex buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Some see the process, as well as the barriers, as a symbolic
division of the neighborhood along class lines. Gutierrez-Garcia, the
school principal, said it's unfair that renters don't have a voice in
their own community.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say that while most renters cannot vote, they can
lobby the city's Environmental and Transportation Advisory Committee,
which has the authority to override the homeowner vote.</TE>
<TE>   John Castillo, chairman of the committee, said it has gone to
lengths to make the process fair. He said he's irritated some see the
barriers in racial terms of bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   "There are Hispanic activists that go searching for what they
consider to be a deliberate attempt to discriminate against them,"
Castillo said. "And it's just not here in French Park in respect to
the dividers."</TE>
<TE>   French Court residents say they want to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't take us into account," said Bonilla, the school
liaison. "Why did they close our neighborhood instead of theirs? They
can't isolate us as if we were from another planet."</TE>

<HD>Fish's Status a Contentious Issue</HD>
<DH>Environment: State hopes to delay decision on endangered
label for coho salmon, which is opposed by farmers, and pushes
restoration plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rare coho salmon is causing election-year headaches for the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is quietly attempting to
delay a controversial decision on whether to grant the fish
protection under the state's Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<LD>   State officials are meeting privately with environmental and
fishermen's groups, hoping to draft a compromise delaying a listing
of the salmon, which is threatened by logging, farm irrigation and
degraded streams in Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise would lead to a plan to restore the beleaguered
salmon in the next 12 to 18 months. But it would also delay the
endangered species listing for the fish. That would please farmers
and other interest groups that are already lobbying vehemently
against such a listing.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics see the proposed compromise as a political maneuver
to shield Davis from a divisive debate akin to the one continuing on
the Upper Klamath River. There, along the California-Oregon border,
farmers have attacked the federal government and its endangered
species laws in the fiercest water fight in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an election year, and the governor doesn't want to have any
grief from the timber industry or the Farm Bureau folks," said Zeke
Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of
Fishermen's Assns.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Davis' Fish and Game Department denied there were
political motivations for moving ahead with the restoration plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with politics," said state Fish and Game
Director Robert Hight. "This has to do with how do we restore the
fish." By not listing the salmon, Hight said, various interests can
be brought to the table, avoiding litigation and creating a plan that
will provide optimal conditions for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Several environmental and fishing groups petitioned the state
nearly two years ago to add the fish to the state endangered species
list. Those groups have met several times with top Fish and Game
officials to discuss the proposal to delay listing and instead
proceed with a recovery plan.</TE>
<TE>   Hight described the plan last week as a means to improve
conditions for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   The talks come as the state agency is more than a month late in
filing a recommendation on whether to list the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Already, farmers and ranchers in California's Siskiyou County are
organizing against the proposed listing of the coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Coho salmon can be found in the Scott and Shasta rivers, which
many farmers use for irrigation. If the state grants the coho
protection as an endangered species, farmers fear they will be
enmeshed in regulatory red tape and possibly be penalized if
irrigation systems kill fish.</TE>
<TE>   A state listing would afford the coho the highest level of
protection, stiffening regulations on farmers, loggers and others who
might harm the species.</TE>
<TE>   "Say you're a farmer who's irrigated your fields for hundreds of
years with a diversion, and somehow a coho gets stranded out on a
field. [You] become a criminal," said Pamela Giacomini, of the
California Farm Bureau Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Siskiyou County Administrator Howard Moody said he believes
listing the coho would be counterproductive to the coho salmon's
welfare. Farmers and ranchers throughout the region have been adding
screens to diversion ditches and taking other steps to protect the
fish, he said. Such efforts could be stalled if landowners feared
being cited for harming fish, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The salmon debate is surfacing now because of the petition by
sportsmen and environmental groups, who say coho salmon have been
disappearing so rapidly that they warrant state protection. The fish
has been protected since 1997 under the federal Endangered Species
Act, but the state listing would extend protections.</TE>
<TE>   The state Fish and Game Commission made the fish a candidate for
listing in spring 2001, starting a clock requiring state officials to
file a full report by April.</TE>
<TE>   The talks on a conservation plan have caused unease among Yurok
and Hoopa tribal members. Leaders of the tribes, which depend heavily
on coho salmon for food, were not invited to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   They learned about the talks from a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "That surprised us all, that there was a meeting going on," said
Susan Masten, chairwoman of the Yuroks, the largest tribe in the
state and a staunch supporter of an endangered listing.</TE>
<TE>   The Yurok reservation flanks the Klamath River for 44 miles, and
the tribe has federal treaty rights to the fish. "I'm disappointed
that they didn't contact us," Masten said.</TE>

<HD>10 Chinese Hijacked Ship, Crew Claims; Officials Doubtful</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The captain says he was fishing off Hawaii
when the men came aboard and took the vessel to the O.C. coast.
Prosecutors are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They paid $10,000 each for a chance at life in America. And for
nearly seven weeks, they risked their lives inside cramped
compartments in the cargo hull of a rusty fishing boat.</LD>
<LD>   As their boat crossed the Pacific, the 10 Chinese passengers were
forbidden from moving without permission from the captain, an
imposing figure who demanded they call him "Boss."</LD>
<LD>   The voyage ended Thursday at about 2 a.m., when the men were
ordered on deck and told to swim ashore. If the boat tried to dock,
the crew told them, they would all be caught.</LD>
<TE>   The account of the men's 7,000-mile journey is based on their
interviews with immigration officials and made public Tuesday as
federal prosecutors charged the vessel's captain and engineer with
smuggling immigrants into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the captain and the engineer gave a vastly different story
about how the 10 men came to paddle ashore north of Laguna Beach,
naked and clinging to makeshift floats.</TE>
<TE>   Handcuffed and clad in blue sweatpants, the captain, Jin Yinn
Wang, said in federal court Tuesday that he never intended to steer
near California.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship was brought here, I was kidnapped, and that's all I
know," Wang said in Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   Wang laid out a more extensive version of events shortly after he
was detained by immigration officials Thursday. According to court
documents, Wang said that he and his first mate were alone shark
fishing 600 miles off the Hawaii coast when they picked up the 10 men
as crew members.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said the new crew hijacked their boat, the Fu Ching. When the
boat arrived off Laguna Beach, Wang said he was bound and locked
inside a storage room. He told investigators that the men stole his
ring, equipment and cash before jumping overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said he managed to free himself and tried to send a mayday
broadcast for help. U.S. Coast Guard officials said they were not
aware of any mayday calls sent.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency mounted a search for the Fu Ching after police
found the boat's name on lifesaving equipment the 10 immigrants had
left behind. Coast Guard helicopters caught sight of the boat about
100 miles from San Diego. Authorities ordered the Fu Ching to stop,
but it failed to comply.</TE>
<TE>   After boarding the boat, the Coast Guard officials examined a
global positioning system aboard the vessel. The instrument showed
the Fu Ching had touched land off Laguna Beach, close to where the
men swam ashore.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks earlier, the owner of the Fu Ching had notified
Taiwanese authorities that he had lost contact with the vessel. But
Taiwanese officials say they never could determine if the crew had
been hijacked or simply stopped communicating with the owner.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it's far from the first time that boat captains
accused of smuggling immigrants have claimed they were victims of a
mutiny.</TE>

<HD>G. Kawakami, 90; Turned Small Firm Into Yamaha</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genichi Kawakami, the man who made Yamaha a household name around the
world through an odd mix of musical instruments and motorbikes, died
Saturday in Hamamatsu, Japan, the industrial city where his two
companies were located. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   The entrepreneur sometimes dubbed "the emperor" had been
hospitalized for several months and died of causes related to old
age.</LD>
<LD>   Kawakami, who shunned publicity despite his business success, took
over his father's 19th century musical instrument company, Nippon
Gakki Co., in 1950. At the time, piano and organ production had
barely resumed in a small corrugated steel building, which replaced
factories reduced to rubble by American bombing in 1945.</LD>
<TE>   Within three decades, Kawakami had expanded the operation from a
piano company employing 700 and unknown outside Japan to a worldwide
conglomerate with 14,000 employees and a reputation for quality and
value.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to America and Europe in 1953 convinced Kawakami that the
recreational market would rebound from the wartime devastation and
would have a bright future in Japan. He countered the waning interest
in musical instruments by opening a chain of franchised music schools
for Japan's nascent middle class. The Yamaha Music School now has
7,500 branches in 40 countries.</TE>
<TE>   As he worked to increase the quality of pianos to attract foreign
buyers, Kawakami also became a master of diversification. He added
wind and stringed instruments and also developed Japan's first
electric organ, the Electone.</TE>
<TE>   The incongruous leap to motorbike production sprang from Yamaha's
manufacturing of wood and metal airplane propellers in World War II.
The equipment fell idle after the war, but, under Kawakami's
leadership, the company adapted the machinery to produce Yamaha's
first motorbike, the YA-1, nicknamed aka tombo, or red dragonfly.</TE>
<TE>   Spun off as Yamaha Motor Co. in 1955, the motorbike manufacturing
firm entered an overcrowded Japanese market from two single-story
wooden factory buildings with a capacity to turn out 200 motorcycles
a month. Subsequent success in international motorbike races brought
recognition to the Yamaha bike brand. It is now the world's
second-largest manufacturer of motorbikes, after Honda.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaha Motor also manufactures boats, outboard motors, snowmobiles
and golf carts, as well as industrial machinery.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Kawakami was developing and expanding the motor
company, he also diversified the former Nippon Gakki--often guided by
his own tastes. He liked archery, so he manufactured bows and arrows.
Woodworking skills acquired in making pianos were channeled into
making furniture.</TE>
<TE>   His continuing interest in music led him not only to write several
books on the subject, but also to adapt wood and metallurgy
manufacturing to include flutes and other woodwind instruments, horns
endorsed by the Vienna Philharmonic and stereo equipment, and to
virtually create the electronic musical instrument business.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is the most wonderful of art forms," Kawakami told Music
Trades magazines in 1991. "It cuts across all barriers of race and
nationality and humanizes us. I have made many mistakes and had many
disappointments, but knowing that my labors have been in the service
of music gives me a great deal of pride and contentment."</TE>
<TE>   The trade publication credited Kawakami with making Yamaha the
largest musical instrument manufacturer in the world and the only
company successful in sales of the full range of musical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of a trade school, Kawakami joined his father's company
in 1937, served as president from 1950 to 1976 and again from 1980 to
1983, and was chairman from 1977 until his retirement in 1992. He
remained a key advisor to the two related companies, Yamaha Corp. and
Yamaha Motor Co., until his death.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Tamiko; a son; and a daughter. A
private family funeral is planned in Kawakami's hometown of Hamakita
near Hamamatsu, about 145 miles west of Tokyo.</TE>

<HD>Labors of Love at 'The Hospital'</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: An outbreak of domoic acid poisoning has sent
many sea lions and seals to the healing staff at the Marine Mammal
Care Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a gray day at "the hospital" and the peculiar groans of the sick
and injured are billowing into the sky.</LD>
<LD>   They're as forlorn a bunch of patients as you can imagine.</LD>
<LD>   The really young ones, most suffering from pneumonia, stare with
large, mournful eyes. The older, much larger ones battle a more
severe malady caused by a toxin in the fish they ate.</LD>
<TE>   Theirs is a life-or-death struggle and you need only watch them
tremble to realize it. You wish you could ease their pain.</TE>
<TE>   But there is some brightness amid the gloom of an overcast day at
the Marine Mammal Care Center at Ft. MacArthur, where eight northern
elephant seal pups and nine California sea lions are being treated in
hopes that they can be released back into the wild.</TE>
<TE>   There are dedicated people at the center who can help--who can
ease the pain. And to watch them work sets spirits soaring.</TE>
<TE>   They are Jackie Jaakola, Jennifer Sullivan and Jeanine Mauch--and
their many volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Three Js," as they're affectionately called, are the only
paid employees at the small San Pedro facility, which this year is
celebrating its 10th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine doing anything else," said Jaakola, 35, the
director, who has worked at the center for nine years. "This is a
lifestyle. This isn't a job. You have to love it. I'm very passionate
about it, I'm proud of it. This is my family."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, 26, started as a volunteer and eventually filled
Jaakola's previous role as operations manager. Both have backgrounds
in marine biology and animal care. They are paid about what an
entry-level teacher earns through a trust fund set up by the owners
of nearby Marineland after that facility closed in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Mauch, 54, the only marine science instructor the center has had,
is paid by the Los Angeles Unified School District, on whose property
the facility sits. As for the dozens of volunteers, most of them
women, they are the heart and soul of the center.</TE>
<TE>   But the family Jaakola refers to, to some extent, also includes
the marine mammals, mostly seals and sea lions, that come in with
various sicknesses and injuries. They have been delivered with broken
jaws, lacerations caused by discarded fishing line, shark bites and
even bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   Jaakola points to a picture on a desk showing her beside a tiny
sea lion, wearing a leash, that came in with a serious bone infection
in its flippers. The pup's physical therapy involved regular walks
through the halls and swimming lessons by a staff that has learned to
improvise.</TE>
<TE>   "We put her in a little tiny seat belt and would hang her in the
water like a seal on a string; otherwise she would have drowned,"
Jaakola recalls with a smile. "That was a happy release. She swam off
fatter than could be."</TE>
<TE>   Happy releases, though they don't always happen, are what the
facility is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, an adult female sea lion came in suffering from domoic
acid poisoning, the same ailment that affects the nine sea lions now
in-house. She weighed only 189 pounds--she could have weighed twice
as much--and for nine days experienced violent seizures. She didn't
respond to medicine and drifted into semiconsciousness.</TE>
<TE>   But then Jaakola and Sullivan decided to violate a "rule of thumb"
that says you wait until an animal is awake before you feed it, lest
the animal suffocate if it vomits.</TE>
<TE>   They worked a tube down her throat to deliver a blend of food and
a new medicine. The next day the sea lion was alert and sitting up. A
week later she was eating on her own. A month after her arrival, she
was set free on a beach and went porpoising off into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to take risks," Jaakola said.</TE>
<TE>   Different circumstances surrounded a northern fur seal pup that
came to be called "Her Highness." She was picked up by animal control
workers in October while trying to cross Pacific Coast Highway in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The malnourished little fur ball, which somehow had swum more than
60 miles from its birthplace on remote San Miguel Island, became the
star patient. She lounged by her pool and ate smelt, sardines and
herring for more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, she was given a boat ride back to San Miguel Island. But
she apparently loved L.A. Only days after her release, she returned
to the same beach and ended up back at the care center.</TE>
<TE>   She has since been delivered to a similar facility in Sausalito,
where she is suffering from a loss of "guard hairs" necessary to keep
her warm in cold water. She will probably end up in a zoo.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, keeping warm is no problem for the elephant seal
pups, which have just been fed a breakfast of either whole fish or
"gruel," a blended mix of milk powder, electrolytes and sardines.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan and her volunteers arrived at sunup for meal preparation,
which involves skinning the fish, lopping off heads and tails and, of
course, the blending.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is a busy time at the center. Elephant seals are born in
December or January. Some are abandoned by their mothers. Others
simply become separated.</TE>
<TE>   Sea lions are born in late May or early June. The sick and injured
pups will be arriving sporadically in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On this day fourth-graders visiting from Windsor Hills Elementary
School in Los Angeles get a lesson in the ways of nature they won't
soon forget.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid poisoning, Mauch tells them, is a natural event caused
by toxic algae blooms that occur to some extent seasonally off
California. The algae are ingested by fish, which in turn are snapped
up by dolphins, seals and sea lions. The fish appear unharmed but the
mammals grow disoriented and the poisoning often proves fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, Jaakola and three volunteers are in one pen, wearing
thick gloves and coveralls, and using sheets of plywood to herd the
sea lions, one after another, into a "squeeze cage," where they're
immobilized and fed through tubes.</TE>
<TE>   In another cage, one of the fresh arrivals twitches from seizures.
The kids, immediately beyond the pen's chain-link fence, step back
and gasp.</TE>
<TE>   They're witnessing one of the first waves of sea lions that will
eventually fill the concrete floors of the center's pens, during one
of the most severe domoic acid outbreaks in recent history.</TE>
<TE>   Jaakola sighs, saying this season is already reminiscent of the
violent El Nino winter of 1997-98, when nearly constant storm surf
literally pounded thousands of seals and sea lions into submission.
This center, one of six statewide, housed up to 82 animals at a time
and treated 440 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "This is busy. That was war," she recalls.</TE>

<HD>Man Receives 6 Years in Identity Theft Case</HD>

<LD>A Santa Paula man has been sentenced to six years in state prison
after pleading guilty to numerous fraud and forgery counts in
connection with an identity theft ring involving nearly two dozen
victims.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Murphy, 31, was arrested in Moorpark in July after being
stopped for driving an unregistered car. When a Ventura County
sheriff's deputy questioned him, Murphy gave the officer a false
name, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Howard A. Wise.</LD>
<LD>   A search of the vehicle uncovered evidence of an identity fraud
operation, including a computer, police scanner, counterfeit checks,
phony California driver's licenses and stolen mail, Wise said.</LD>
<TE>   An investigator with the district attorney's office examined the
seized computer and found additional evidence linking Murphy to the
manufacture of false checks and identifications, Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Murphy pleaded guilty to 21 criminal counts, including
felony identity fraud, forgery, falsification of a driver's license
and possession of a blank counterfeit check.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his prison sentence, he was ordered to forfeit his
computer.</TE>

<LD>Honk if you're an L.A. driver. Chances are you don't need much
encouragement. In a survey by the Steel Alliance, a group of steel
producers, 39% of L.A. drivers said they blasted their horn in the
previous month, compared with 26% for the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Why all the noise? They were in a hurry. Seventy-two percent said
they drove 10 mph or more over the speed limit during that period,
12% over the national average. But, of course, their hands weren't
always on the horn. Fifty-five percent of L.A. drivers said they
spoke on a cell phone without a headset, compared with 36%
nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, in the rudeness category, L.A. drivers received a B,
not as polite as Seattle's, which received an A, but far above
Miami's and Boston's, which got Fs.</LD>
<TE>   I tell you, if drivers in Miami and Boston are that much worse
than L.A.'s, I'm not visiting those cities until their drivers agree
to repeat their driver's education courses.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. got high marks because a comparatively small number of
Angeleno motorists--35%--admitted committing four or more aggressive
acts on the road in the previous month. Honking obviously doesn't
fall into that category.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it does seem like it's been a while since I've seen one
of those bumper stickers that say, "Keep Honking; I'm Reloading."</TE>

<LD>Michael J. Clemens, 81, a former attorney and special California
prosecutor who investigated the San Diego County assessor's office in
the 1950s, died Friday of natural causes in Virginia Beach, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens was named deputy attorney general for Los Angeles in 1953
by Atty. Gen. (later Gov.) Pat Brown shortly after completing Loyola
Law School. Three years later, Clemens was appointed special
prosecutor to investigate the San Diego County agency.</LD>
<LD>   Although he practiced privately for four decades, Clemens often
was tapped for special court-related cases. For example, he was
attorney for the special master appointed to handle Los Angeles
litigation concerning the Worldwide Church of God.</LD>
<TE>   Born in New York, Clemens attended Bluefield Junior College in
Virginia on a football scholarship and the U.S. Naval Academy, where
he played football and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   As an ensign and lieutenant during World War II, he taught officer
candidates at Dartmouth College and served as a gunnery officer
aboard two destroyers. Wounded during both his tours of sea duty, he
earned a citation of the Navy and a Marine Corps medal before his
discharge.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens served as president of the Loyola Law School Alumni Assn.,
a trustee of the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Assn. and president and a
board member of the Bel-Air Country Club.</TE>

<HD>John de Lancie, 80; Virtuoso Oboist, Head of Curtis
Institute of Music</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John de Lancie, 80, a virtuoso oboist with the Philadelphia Orchestra
from 1946 to 1977 and later director of the Curtis Institute of
Music, died May 17 of leukemia at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Berkeley, De Lancie studied at Curtis in Philadelphia
and began his career as an oboist with the Pittsburgh Symphony, then
directed by Fritz Reiner.</LD>
<LD>   During World War II, he played in the U.S. Army Band and, after
meeting the elderly Richard Strauss while serving in defeated
Germany, urged Strauss to write what became his only concerto for
oboe and orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   De Lancie was promoted to principal oboist of the Philadelphia
Orchestra in 1954, when his Curtis instructor and mentor Marcel
Tabuteau retired. A soloist on many of the orchestra's recordings
under the baton of Eugene Ormandy, De Lancie also played with the
Philadelphia Woodwind Quintet and other small groups. He premiered
Francaix's "L'Horloge de Flore" for oboe and orchestra, which he had
commissioned the French composer to create in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The oboist became director of the Curtis Institute in 1977, but
aroused so much controversy, including the costly hiring of eccentric
Romanian conductor Sergiu Celebidache to lead the Curtis orchestra at
Carnegie Hall in 1984, that he was forced to resign in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   De Lancie later became the founding music dean of Miami's New
World School of the Arts and taught at the San Francisco Conservatory
of Music.</TE>

<HD>Religious Bias Fueled Firing, Jury Decides</HD>
<DH>Suit: Riverside County is ordered to pay nurse who refused
to dispense 'morning-after' pills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside County public health clinic wrongly discriminated against
a born-again Christian nurse who was fired after she refused to
dispense "morning-after" contraceptive pills, a federal jury has
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The eight-member jury, made up of five women and three men,
awarded $19,000 in back pay and more than $28,000 in damages for
emotional distress to 28-year-old Michelle Diaz, who said that giving
the pills to patients would violate her religious beliefs. The jury
found that the firing violated her constitutional rights of free
speech and freedom of religion.</LD>
<LD>   The jury's decision, rendered Friday and announced Tuesday,
alarmed supporters of abortion rights and some health-care workers,
who believe anti-abortion groups are trying to move the debate from
surgical procedures to alternative ways of preventing birth.</LD>
<TE>   The verdict follows a tense debate in neighboring San Bernardino
County, where a conservative bloc of officials last year attempted to
ban the distribution of morning-after pills before they were told
that the move would violate state and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the more controversial RU-486 pill, which induces a
miscarriage, the morning-after pills contain a heavy dose of hormones
used in standard birth-control pills. They are designed to prevent
implantation of a fertilized egg.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors consider the pills an important method of reducing
unplanned pregnancies and thereby avoiding surgical abortions. The
pills prevent more than 1.5 million pregnancies a year, and hundreds
of thousands of abortions, according to its advocates.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Clinton administration made morning-after pills
widely available. The president of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists has asked doctors to provide them
through routine gynecological visits. But many anti-abortion groups
view the morning-after pill as a form of abortion because it acts to
prevent a fertilized egg from growing and have sought to limit its
use.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Diaz said her religious beliefs--she was
raised Catholic but became a born-again Christian more than three
years ago--prohibit her from dispensing the pills.</TE>
<TE>   "When that sperm and that egg meet, that was my child's life, and
my life and your life," said Diaz, a mother of three. "And that is
how every other life is going to begin. When that life starts, I
cannot infringe on that. I won't be a part of ending that."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Manion, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, the Virginia-based conservative group that supplied the
money for the Diaz suit, said he believes the verdict will "send a
message to other people like Michelle, that maybe there is something
they can do--that they do not have to choose between what they think
is right and feeding their family."</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County officials say they will ask District Judge
Virginia A. Phillips to set aside the jury verdict. Diaz was still a
probationary employee in June 1999 when clinic officials learned she
was telling other nurses who worked at the Riverside Neighborhood
Health Center that they would be required to perform abortions,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was fired because it was believed that the misinformation she
was giving to these temporary nurses was done in an attempt to
subvert the mission of the clinic, which was to provide those types
of services to all patients who had requested it," said Bruce E.
Disenhouse, an attorney who represented Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz has denied that.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic, the busiest of the 10 public health clinics in
Riverside County, is in danger of being unable to operate because of
a shortage of nurses, Disenhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that she has the right not to want to perform those
types of services," he said. "But she needs to understand that we
must have people in these positions who will--because, by law, we are
required to provide these services."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Kneer, president and chief executive of Sacramento-based
Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said the case could set
a bad precedent if the rights of a nurse are placed before the rights
of a patient.</TE>
<TE>   "She works in a clinic that provided family planning services.
What's going to happen to those patients? Why do they have to give up
their rights, particularly in a publicly funded institution?"</TE>

<LD>Residents here will lose one of five emergency rooms Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old Bakersfield Heart Hospital can't survive without
cutting its emergency room, which is losing as much as $500,000 a
month, Chief Executive Randy Rolfe said.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital, which receives about 25 to 30 patients daily, blames
the losses on the failure of insurance company PacifiCare to pay
patient claims. The hospital has filed suit against PacifiCare, which
denies it is the problem. Trial is scheduled for June 3.</LD>

<HD>4-Part Harmony and 1 Part Friendship</HD>
<DH>Music: A shared love of old-time barbershop quartet singing
forms a bond between a South Bay student, 18, and a former lawman,
59.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One is a 59-year-old former sheriff's sergeant who now runs two
businesses. His buddy is an 18-year-old high school senior, the son
of Mexican immigrants who dreams of becoming a chef.</LD>
<LD>   The glue for their friendship is a shared love of singing
barbershop, that all-male, unaccompanied, four-part-harmony stuff
evocative of 1920s--and earlier--America.</LD>
<LD>   It is barbershop that has led Ron Sipes to leave his Torrance real
estate office just about every Wednesday evening for the past two
years and drive up Hawthorne Boulevard to pick up Jose Vasquez. They
head to rehearsals for the South Bay Coastliners, a chapter of the
Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet
Singing in America.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the Coastliners' roster of about 80 is largely
made up of white, older men who enjoy harmonizing hits of a bygone
era: "The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi," "Sweet Adeline," "Down by the Old
Mill Stream."</TE>
<TE>   But they are eager to share their hobby with others, especially
the young, and it was on an outreach visit to Hawthorne High School
that Sipes met Vasquez, a bass-baritone in the school's choral
program.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez recently recalled his surprise at walking into the music
room that day and learning "these four old guys were going to sing
for us."</TE>
<TE>   But then he heard those tingling harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Oh, my gosh, I gotta go'" to the Coastliners' regular
rehearsals in Redondo Beach, Vasquez recounted. "I loved the
harmony."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez and a schoolmate joined the Coastliners' chorus, traveling
to competitions and participating in shows and other events. Vasquez
and his family--mother, stepfather and two brothers--live in a
one-bedroom apartment in Lennox and do not own a car, so chorus
members give him rides to rehearsals and performances.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastliners sponsor an annual a capella contest for young
singers and award music scholarships; their Web site is
www.coastliners.org. They also sent the high school students to a
summer music camp and chipped in to cover their dues and other costs.</TE>
<TE>   Although his schoolmate dropped out of the chorus after leaving
for college and a job, Vasquez plans to stay with the group.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like these guys," he said. "They treat me like one of
them, not like a kid, and I like the singing and the kidding around.
It's all pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   On the ride to rehearsals, Sipes and Vasquez keep up a steady
patter--sometimes in Spanish, so Sipes can keep up the language he
learned patrolling the streets of East Los Angeles years ago. They
talk casually about Vasquez's grades, his hopes of attending culinary
school this fall, and a music award he will receive at his June 20
graduation.</TE>
<TE>   They tease each other about their costumes--about how Sipes' pants
are too tight and how Vasquez will cut an incongruous figure in the
1920s-style bathing suit he will wear in an upcoming show.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between their ages often seems to disappear, though
reminders occasionally pop up, as when Vasquez nimbly ran through a
dance routine that required some singers to drop to their knees.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part of this," joked one older singer, "is getting
back up."</TE>
<TE>   The camaraderie among Vasquez and the others was evident one
recent evening, as the chorus gathered for one of the last dress
rehearsals before their Barbershop Extravaganza, with performances
Friday through Sunday at the Hermosa Beach Community Center
Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Getting out of Sipes' car, Vasquez spotted two silver-haired
chorus members in the parking lot of the Salvation Army complex where
the group meets. They were wearing the baggy knee-pants and straw
hats they will sport during the show, which includes an original
melodrama about a canoe race between two mythical colleges and,
according to the show director, "a lot of cornball jokes."</TE>
<TE>   "Hiya guys! Lookin' sharp!" Vasquez said. They in turn ribbed him
about the sock garters they were lending him and playfully adjusted
his bow tie.</TE>
<TE>   Sipes said he befriended Vasquez not only because of his belief
that "every kid deserves a chance to succeed in life" but also
because of his desire to encourage more people to try barbershopping.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend brought me into this when I was at a low point in my
life, and it just turned everything around," Sipes said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez said he discovered the fun of singing when he joined a
chorus as a high school freshman and also enjoys rock, jazz and,
"when I'm in the mood for it, classical."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his friends gave him a hard time when he joined the
Coastliners. "They asked me, 'What do you want to do that for?' They
think I'm wasting my time," Vasquez said. "But I'm having a good
time--and they're sitting on their butts, watching TV."</TE>

<HD>City Gets Mobile Clinic for Spaying, Neutering Pets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to a $300,000 contribution from a private group, the city will
inaugurate its first mobile spay and neuter clinic Monday. The aim is
to alter 5,000 dogs and cats a year, mainly in South and East Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Our goal is to provide a solution to the pet overpopulation
problem by going to where it primarily exists," said Erika Brunson,
president of the Coalition for Pets &amp; Public Safety, which funded the
clinic.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the Animal Services Department impounded nearly 80,000
animals in the city. About 60,000 of them were euthanized after no
one came forward to adopt them, according to official statistics.
Brunson estimated there are 44,000 stray dogs and 100,000 feral cats
roaming the city.</LD>
<TE>   The mobile spay and neuter clinic will be leased to the city for
$1 a year, and the Houston-based Spay-Neuter Assistance Program Inc.
will be retained by the city to operate the program five days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Brunson said the clinic will offer its services in neighborhoods
for free or a nominal charge.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the group is seeking funds to provide two additional clinics
to serve other parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn is scheduled to preside over the inauguration
ceremony Monday at the city's South-Central Animal Shelter, 3612 11th
Ave. The mobile clinic will begin operating June 11.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles taxpayers spend nearly $10 million a year to house,
feed, kill and dispose of tens of thousands of healthy but unwanted
animals, and dog bites and attacks are a problem in the city. Most
bites are believed to be inflicted by unaltered animals.</TE>

<HD>Carrier Gets Joyous Reception</HD>
<DH>Navy: After six months, the Stennis and its crew of 5,200
are back in San Diego, a bastion of pride in the military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>With flowers and flags, the 5,200 sailors and Marines of the U.S.
aircraft carrier John C. Stennis returned home Tuesday to an
emotional and joyous welcome from family members and a citizenry
deeply linked to the military.</LD>
<LD>   At the dock at North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado were
7,000 well-wishers. Several thousand more lined the shores of San
Diego Bay to watch the nuclear-powered ship glide into port after a
six-month deployment to the Arabian Sea, where it served as a
platform for airstrikes on Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "God Bless Our Heroes," said several banners in red, white and
blue. Local media had given the arrival several days of "count-down"
coverage.</LD>
<TE>   This, after all, is San Diego, where the comings and goings of
Navy ships and Marine units receive the kind of hoopla that in Los
Angeles is reserved for the premiere of the latest would-be Hollywood
blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism may have dimmed in the consciousness of other
communities. But not so in San Diego County, where there are more
active-duty military than in any other county in the nation: 104,000,
split almost evenly between sailors and Marines.</TE>
<TE>   The tumultuous welcome given to the carrier--complete with
proclamations from the mayors of San Diego and Coronado--was the
outward sign of a deep interdependence between the military and the
civilian population that dates back decades. The military pervades
everything in this city, from history and politics to economics and
social mores.</TE>
<TE>   "In other places, they think about the military on Memorial Day,
but in San Diego, every day is Memorial Day," said Joe Jacobs, who
arrived at North Island three hours early to make sure he could get a
front-row seat for the arrival of the Stennis and his 19-year-old
nephew.</TE>
<TE>   "How important is the military to San Diego?" asked Tom Blair,
editor of San Diego magazine. "Just open the window. You can still
hear the howling over [U.S. Rep. Randall] Cunningham's trial balloon
about sending the Marine recruit depot to Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to active-duty personnel, there are 26,000 civilian
workers and 60,000 retirees, making the military the county's
second-largest economic sector.</TE>
<TE>   The first Tomahawk missile fired into Afghanistan came from a San
Diego ship. The first conventional U.S. troops into Afghanistan were
Marines from Camp Pendleton. More military personnel from San Diego
have died in the war zone than from any region in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The military contributes $9.8 billion a year to the local economy.
It's second only to manufacturing's $25.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Money, money, money, and tradition, tradition, tradition, that's
what the military means to San Diego," said political consultant Jack
Orr.</TE>
<TE>   The city's strong ties to the armed services date to the early
20th century--when the San Diego Chamber of Commerce and local
congressmen began assiduously courting the military.</TE>
<TE>   A watershed in the civilian-military relationship came in 1923,
when the Marine Corps opened its first West Coast training camp here
and the Navy opened a new training site here, eclipsing an earlier
one in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the military, San Diego would be Pismo Beach," said Mike
Stepner, director of land-use planning and housing for the local
Economic Development Corp. "The military has influenced everything
about San Diego: our economy, our politics, even our mores."</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Union-Tribune routinely runs a map on Sunday giving
the location of San Diego-based ships deployed around the globe. The
newspaper planned to devote several pages of coverage to the arrival
of the Stennis. Three of the paper's photographers were assigned to
assure that no angle went uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   Military stories--of training, new equipment, deployments or
changes in benefits--are routinely given prominent coverage by local
TV stations. The military beat is a prized assignment, trusted only
to veteran reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Two stations sent anchorpersons to the Arabian Sea to report on
the Stennis. Though much of the military coverage is upbeat, there
have been stories exposing drug use among active-duty personnel and
substandard housing for military families.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are other factors too, the military presence in San
Diego County tends to reinforce the conservative nature of local
politics. Military service is an important credential for candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Two local congressmen--Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) and Cunningham
(R-Escondido)--are Vietnam veterans. Hunter was an Army Ranger;
Cunningham a decorated Navy fighter pilot. Rep. Darrell Issa
(R-Vista) served in the peacetime Army.</TE>
<TE>   The husband of Rep. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) served a hitch in
the Air Force. One community newspaper refers to her as "a former
military spouse," meant as a high compliment.</TE>
<TE>   There are those, however, who say the military's influence is not
always positive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard in San Diego to discuss issues of how big the
military should be and how much money we should spend on it that
could be used for schools, health care and potholes," said Carol
Jahnkow, executive director of the Peace Resource Center of San
Diego. "So many people's paychecks come from the military, it's
dangerous to discuss issues even with your neighbors. The military
influence strangles political discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Josephine Thomas, daytime manager at the Trophy Lounge, a drinking
and dancing emporium in National City, just a few miles from where
the Stennis is docked, is more interested in the military's economic
impact. The Trophy Lounge bought advertising in the base newspaper
beckoning Stennis sailors, with pictures of waitresses in shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Similar advertising was purchased by Norm's Cocktails in La Mesa
and the Pure nightclub in San Diego; the latter promises free
admission for Stennis sailors and plenty of techno and "progressive
trance" music.</TE>
<TE>   "The sailors are good for us and we're good for the sailors," said
Thomas, who expects a large Stennis crowd. "That's how it's always
been in San Diego."</TE>

<HD>Lost in Isolation, Poverty</HD>
<DH>Culture: Elderly Vietnamese immigrants, estranged from
families, lack the English needed to connect with U.S. life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN and SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bach Van Nguyen, 92, has reconciled himself to his loneliness. His
wife is dead and the mistress who once came between them is gone. He
doesn't get along with his adult children in Florida and rarely
speaks to them.</LD>
<LD>   His most constant companion is a plastic yellow bird, bought for
$8, that chirps at the sound of his voice in a nearly empty Garden
Grove studio apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "The bird likes to talk to me," Nguyen says gleefully. "When I
cough, switch on the light, cook or clean the dishes, it likes to
sing along. ... I really enjoy this bird. We've become friends."</LD>
<TE>   This is not the existence Nguyen and other elderly Vietnamese
envisioned when they left their homeland for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although many fled the communist regime after U.S. troops pulled
out in 1975, others came later, hoping to live out their years in the
embrace of their expatriate families following the Vietnamese
tradition of extended "roof" families.</TE>
<TE>   Many have since stumbled into isolation and poverty, unable to
work or speak enough English to connect with American life around
them, especially when compared with their Spanish or English-speaking
peers, according to a recent "Condition of Older Adults 2002" study
by the Orange County Interagency Committee on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is pronounced in Orange County, home to the largest
Vietnamese population in the nation--about 135,500--but likely is
repeated in San Jose, which also has a significant concentration of
Vietnamese immigrants. About 78,000 Vietnamese live in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Many older Vietnamese who don't speak English aren't aware of
social programs--from meals to transportation--that can connect them
with others, said Pamela M. Mokler, director of the Orange County
Office on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the agency has stepped up outreach efforts
through Vietnamese-language pamphlets, an (800) 510-2020 help line
with translators, an information van that appears at Vietnamese
gatherings such as the annual Tet Festival, and by drawing together
community leaders for suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials intend to turn to Vietnamese-language radio to
reach Vietnamese seniors, who overwhelmingly rely on radio for
information.</TE>
<TE>   The isolation is born of more than language barriers. There are
cultural walls to scale, as well. Many Vietnamese seniors are
satisfied with their living conditions--despite the poverty--because
life here is easier for them than in Vietnam, Mokler said. "A lot of
them came here as political refugees who have a hard time
communicating what their needs are because they are so grateful for
what they have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the figures reveal deep poverty. Nearly two-thirds of
Vietnamese-speaking seniors--62%--were living in poverty, compared to
37% for Spanish speakers and 4.5% for English speakers. The study,
conducted by researchers at Cal State Fullerton and Chapman
University, surveyed 1,035 seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that only 16.8% of Vietnamese-speaking seniors
owned their own homes, compared with 28.3% for Spanish speakers and
80.6% for English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   While 37% of the English speakers tended to live alone, 13.6% of
the Vietnamese speakers did. Only 10% of Spanish speakers lived
alone.</TE>
<TE>   But even Vietnamese seniors living with their children and other
family members encounter isolation as traditions fragment under the
transition to American lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them have to live with their family, but they feel a loss
of pride and respect because the youths don't follow traditions and
they speak mostly English," said Kathy T. Diep, founder of the
Asian-American Senior Citizen Assn. in Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a loose community of isolated seniors, many of whom
gather daily at markets and coffee shops along the strip malls of
Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors who are here often get depressed and they can't
express it," Diep said, adding that linguistic isolation is the
biggest contributor to loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   For Duc Thi Nguyen, there's no family around. Nguyen, 75, who is
not related to Bach Nguyen, rises each morning and prays before a
small Buddhist altar she has erected in her Santa Ana kitchen, then
leaves about 9 a.m. to catch a bus to Little Saigon, where she shops
and has lunch. Some days she goes to a gym to exercise, or to the
Chua Dieu Quang temple in Santa Ana to pray.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen immigrated in 1989 at age 62--a dozen years after her
husband died--to be closer to her three grown children. She moved
into a Mission Viejo home with her children, but the reunion only
lasted six months before the children moved on to jobs in San Jose
and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my children and I know they love me, but they are busy
with their work far away and their families. That's how it is here in
America," Nguyen said. "I want to live here [in Little Saigon] where
there are many older people like me, and it eases the loneliness."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEARBROOK, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Wes Westrum, a two-time All-Star catcher and former manager of the
New York Mets and San Francisco Giants, died Tuesday after a battle
with cancer. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Westrum died at a care facility where he had been living for the
last few months, said Kelly Cease Bowman of Cease Funeral Home in
Bagley, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Westrum signed with the New York Giants in September 1947, and set
an International League record by hitting five grand slams during the
1949 season. He caught every game for the Giants in the 1951 and 1954
World Series, and played in the 1952 and '53 All-Star games.</LD>
<TE>   He hit .217 with 96 home runs and 315 RBIs in 11 major league
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Westrum remained associated with the Giants when they moved from
New York to San Francisco, coaching from 1958 to 1963. He joined the
Mets as a coach during the 1964 season.</TE>
<TE>   When Mets manager Casey Stengel broke his hip the following
season, Westrum replaced him for the remaining 68 games.</TE>
<TE>   He managed the Mets for the next two seasons and went 142-237.</TE>
<TE>   He also managed the Giants in 1974 and '75, and went 118-129.
Westrum's career managing record is 260-366.</TE>
<TE>   Westrum is survived by a daughter, three grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers Can Check Refund Status Online</HD>
<DH>Government: Web-based service is first of several in IRS
roll-out that the agency hopes will lead to direct filing by PC.</DH>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service, pushing ahead with a modernization
program that eventually will allow taxpayers to file returns directly
with the agency online, has launched a Web-based service that allows
consumers to check the status of their tax refund over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which went live Tuesday on the front page of the IRS
consumer site at www.irs.gov, allows those who filed their taxes
using a 1040, 1040A or 1040-EZ form to check the status of their
refund by typing in their Social Security number and filing status
and the amount of the anticipated refund.</LD>
<LD>   The service will respond with information about whether the
taxpayer's return has been processed and when the refund will be
mailed or deposited into the taxpayer's account.</LD>
<TE>   If there is a problem with the return, the computerized service
will identify the nature of the problem and suggest steps to solve
it, the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers also can find out through the Web-based prompt whether
their check was returned to the IRS as undeliverable. About $90
million in refunds is returned each year because of incorrect
addresses, IRS spokesman Anthony Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has been providing the same refund information by
telephone for more than a dozen years, agency officials said.
Taxpayers can call (800) 829-4477 to check refund status.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS believes the Internet-based service is significant because
it is the first of several services that will be launched through the
same secure Web platform, said John Reece, the IRS' deputy
commissioner of modernization.</TE>
<TE>   The next step will be an electronic filing system, which initially
will be accessible to about 6 million people who file 1040EZ forms.
That system, which will be launched next year, is expected to enable
taxpayers to get refunds in one to three days instead of the four to
six weeks it can take under the present system.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the agency also hopes to provide Web-based filing
directly to taxpayers through their home computers. However, Reece
could not estimate when this final stage of the plan would be
operational because the agency is concerned that providing this
service would run afoul of a government regulation that prohibits the
IRS from competing with private tax practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   "This [online refund information service] provides taxpayers with
what we hope will be the first of an ever-increasing series of
convenient, easy-to-use, service-oriented capabilities," Reece said.
"The more self-service we can make this process, the better it is for
everyone."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Exec Says Firm Trashed 'Smoking Guns'</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense witness says work papers that could be
'abused' by plaintiff's lawyers were routinely purged as part of the
document policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A senior Arthur Andersen executive defended his firm's document
policies Tuesday, telling a federal jury here that Andersen routinely
destroyed drafts and other files to prevent lawyers from taking them
out of context and using them as evidence in lawsuits against the
firm or its clients.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Corgel, the first witness called by Andersen lawyers in
the firm's obstruction-of-justice trial, said the firm maintained a
policy of destroying certain drafts and internal correspondence to
keep potential plaintiffs who obtained the documents from using them
to second-guess or "in some way to make accusations or cause harm
where none is warranted."</LD>
<LD>   A grand jury indicted Andersen in March on obstruction-of-justice
charges for allegedly shredding documents to undermine a Securities
and Exchange Commission inquiry of Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen contends that it destroyed records as part of a routine
cleanup effort and did not intend to impede any investigation.</TE>
<TE>   David B. Duncan, formerly the chief Andersen partner in charge of
auditing Enron, has pleaded guilty to obstruction and has testified
for the government in the trial, which is in its fourth week.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Tuesday, Corgel said he first became concerned that
Enron's financial problems would force the energy giant to restate
its earnings around Oct. 25--two days after Duncan ordered
subordinates in the Houston office to comply with the firm's document
policy. Corgel said he didn't become aware of any destruction until
weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Corgel, who heads Andersen's U.S. audit division in Los Angeles,
also said he believed Enron should have disclosed its woes--including
an estimated $500 million in earnings reduction arising from its
off-the-books partnerships--sooner than it did.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had planned for Andersen's Enron auditors and the
firm's in-house accounting experts to meet to resolve disputes over
how Enron accounted for certain controversial transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann referred to the event as a "kumbaya,
let's hold hands" meeting--a description Corgel angrily rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The two also clashed over an e-mail from one Andersen executive to
another suggesting the destruction of documents considered "smoking
guns."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail, sent about three weeks after Andersen ceased shredding
Enron-related papers in Houston, said, "Don't leave smoking guns in
your work papers or elsewhere that can be devastating to the firm."</TE>
<TE>   Corgel reiterated his point that Andersen routinely needed to
purge its files of drafts or other documents that could be "abused"
by plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin said the existence
of the e-mail "proves our point." If the firm had been trying to
impede a federal investigation, he said, such e-mails "wouldn't have
been produced" to prosecutors in trial discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, an Andersen employee who served as a technical
consultant to the Enron team said he did not intend to obstruct the
SEC inquiry when he sent his co-workers an e-mail Oct. 24 asking them
to go through their e-mail and hard drives and comply with the firm's
document policy.</TE>
<TE>   Chad DeJohn said he told employees to comply with the policy
immediately--a deadline he said he knew to be artificial because he
knew they were occupied with finishing work on other projects. He
said his instruction was prompted by an e-mail from his supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Former Andersen manager Jennifer Stevenson, who worked on the
firm's Enron audit team, testified that she did not recall being told
to destroy documents.</TE>
<TE>   She said she interpreted a directive to comply with the document
policy on Oct. 23 to mean that she should, "first and foremost, make
sure that our audit files were complete."</TE>

<HD>Directors Are Forced to Sit in Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Boardrooms are becoming less cushy as more are called on to
take the reins amid scandals</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One big company after another is melting down. Chief executives are
being pushed out. Companies are under investigation. And now there's
another element to the turmoil in corporate boardrooms: More board
directors are having to take over the CEO job for at least a while.</LD>
<LD>   Interim chiefs are everywhere these days. The latest example is
Daniel Dienstbier, president of Northern Natural Gas Co. and director
of Dynegy Inc. The energy company, facing an investigation into its
energy-trading business and accounting practices, Tuesday tapped
Dienstbier as interim CEO to replace Chuck Watson, who resigned.
Dynegy director Glenn Tilton, vice chairman of ChevronTexaco Corp.,
was named interim chairman</LD>
<LD>   In the last two months, independent directors also were tapped to
temporarily run CMS Energy Corp., cable company Adelphia
Communications Corp., recreational vehicle builder Fleetwood
Enterprises Inc., sportswear retailer Cutter &amp; Buck Inc., discount
retailer ShopKo Stores Inc. and clinical lab Specialty Laboratories
Inc., to name just a few. A retired paper company executive has been
interim CEO of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. for the last several
months.</LD>
<TE>   Charles King, head of director recruiting at executive search firm
Korn/Ferry International, said as more CEOs are being let go by their
boards, more outside directors are being tapped temporarily to take
their places.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of becoming interim CEO is one more reason a
boardroom seat is more taxing than ever for the roughly 60,000
independent and management directors of publicly held companies in
the U.S. It's still not like mining coal, but it's not the cushy post
it once was, either.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of energy trader Enron Corp. and accounting firm
Arthur Andersen--and the serious problems at other companies such as
Global Crossing Ltd., Qwest Communications International Inc., Kmart
Corp. and Xerox Corp.--have put directors under growing pressure to
tighten their governance.</TE>
<TE>   A board of directors, typically between eight and 11 people, is
supposed to oversee a company and its management, hire and fire the
CEO and ultimately protect its shareholders' interests. The members
usually include two or three of the company's top executives--such as
the CEO, who often also is board chairman--with the rest being
independent of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   But the definition of "independent" also is under scrutiny. Many
board members are lawyers or investment bankers whose firms do
business with the company. Or the board might include the company's
retired CEO. So are they really independent members or actually
"insiders"?</TE>
<TE>   Either way, directors of all stripes are being excoriated, accused
of being asleep at the switch as big corporations have faltered,
wiping out billions of dollars of stockholders' wealth. Board members
of Enron, for instance, were brought to Capitol Hill along with Enron
executives and harshly criticized by lawmakers for letting the fiasco
unfold. The directors typically counter that they were misled or not
informed by the companies' managements. But it's a defense many
critics don't buy, and calls for corporate governance reform are
intensifying.</TE>
<TE>   Even the board members' trade group, the National Assn. of
Corporate Directors, is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the nation's stock markets to embrace a new set of governance
principles for directors. Among them: that they more closely measure
the performance of CEOs so that directors aren't hit by ugly
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of reform is on boards," said the group's president,
Roger Raber. "And a lot more boards are going to be selective about
who they bring on board."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, some directors think it's no longer worth the trouble to
serve, especially now that many are having to take CEOs' reins
because their companies are in dire trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "More people are turning us down" for board seats, said M. Evan
Lindsay, senior partner at executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles
International Inc., involved in corporate board recruitment.</TE>
<TE>   And running the show wasn't in the basic job description. Although
many boards are stacked with experienced CEOs of other firms, "most
of them aren't coming on [the board] to be the operator of the
company," said John Van de Kamp, a UAL director and former Los
Angeles County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Potential recruits interested in being directors are making more
demands before they serve, including that the companies provide them
with stronger liability insurance against civil lawsuits, Lindsay
said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers, though, are hiking premiums and tightening coverage for
directors in the wake of the scandals, lawsuits and government
investigations of the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Boards are the targets of institutional investors and bondholders,
individual stockholders and their lawyers, union leaders, shareholder
activists and federal and state regulators, all of whom are pressing
directors to take more responsibility for their companies and
securities prices.</TE>
<TE>   This month, for instance, investors at UAL--which is 55% owned by
its workers--used the airline's annual meeting to push through a
nonbinding proposal to separate the jobs of chairman and CEO to make
those in the positions more accountable.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder activists for years have been prodding corporate
managers and directors to do a better job of looking out for
investors' interests. But the pressure on them to act immediately to
fix a problem--even if that means bouncing the CEO--is intensifying,
especially with the economy and the stock market languishing, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   So directors are more willing to show the chief executive the
door, even if they don't yet have a permanent successor inside the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as boards having a trigger finger," but they've
gone from being "very slow in moving CEOs out" to being "more
cautiously willing" to make the change, said Fran Conley, a director
and recently named interim CEO of Cutter &amp; Buck.</TE>
<TE>   When directors of a company fire the CEO, "they don't have all the
information they'd like in order to select a new CEO," even from
within the company, so they pick a director to get a fresh assessment
of the situation, Conley said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to outweigh the negative of having two transitions" in
the top job, she said.</TE>
<TE>   All of this amounts to a huge change in what it means to have a
board seat, a post that once was long on perks and short on demands.
Directors--most of whom are white males over 50 and successful in
their own right--still typically meet only six to eight times a year,
for which they're paid from $45,000 at small firms to $152,000 at the
nation's largest corporations, said Raber of the National Assn. of
Corporate Directors. The compensation usually is divided between cash
and the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, "the perceived risk [of being a director] is greater
and the potential reward less in most people's minds, the risk being
the potential for litigation, embarrassment or even liability," said
Charles Elson, head of the Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rewards, Korn/Ferry's King said they are much more
intangible.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people serving on major corporate boards don't need the
money" because most board members "always have been and remain
sitting CEOs" of other companies or are otherwise already wealthy,
King said. "So more compensation isn't going to persuade more people
to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who serve on these boards typically have spent their
entire careers building two things: their professional reputation and
their net worth," King said. "And now a lot of directors are saying,
'Yes, the rewards of board service are very nice, but I'm putting the
two things I've worked 30 years for at risk.'"</TE>
<TE>   So more directors also are looking much more carefully at
directors' and officers' insurance coverages, said Lindsay of
Heidrick &amp; Struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, they're making sure that the company they're
considering ... has an impeccable record in terms of any kind of
problems."</TE>
<TE>   But as Enron and so many other companies have shown this year, the
problems often are invisible until they erupt into a scandal, leaving
directors vulnerable to outrage and recrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on boards, and sometimes the last ones to know things
are directors," Raber said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why more directors are much more circumspect about ensuring
there is a climate of disclosure at the company they're considering,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   And King predicted that a year from now, when most companies again
elect directors at their annual meetings, there will be a larger than
normal number of individuals who opt not to stand for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with UAL's Van de Kamp, even if it means one of his
peers would have to take the CEO reins for a few months until the
company is righted.</TE>
<TE>   "Boards are under pressure and that's a good thing," Van de Kamp
said. "Boards have the responsibility for the directions that their
companies take. And the most important thing they do is hire the
CEO."</TE>
<TE>   Raber said boards also will be adopting reform principles in the
coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of waiting for the SEC and institutional investors" to
force them to change, "you'll see more boards being more aggressive"
about their duties, he said.</TE>

<HD>Home Prices Up in April as Sales Soar</HD>

<LD>Home prices in California moved sharply higher last month amid
soaring sales as more consumers were drawn into making purchases by
favorable mortgage rates and a shrinking base of homes.</LD>
<LD>   Median prices rose 26% from a year earlier to a record $321,950 in
April, the California Assn. of Realtors said Tuesday. It was the
second consecutive month that the median topped $300,000.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of single-family homes jumped nearly 30% to an annual rate
of 643,000 from a year earlier. The April increase was almost 10%
from the previous month's level.</LD>
<TE>   In the U.S., median prices jumped 7.1% from a year earlier to
$153,300, according to the National Assn. of Realtors, a Washington
trade group. Sales rose 7% to near record levels on a yearly basis of
5.79 million units.</TE>
<TE>   In the West, sales climbed 13% last month from a year earlier as
prices surged more than 12% over the same period. Both increases were
the highest percentage gains recorded nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, the inventory of for-sale homes in April dropped
to a record low. The number of months needed to deplete homes on the
market at the current sales pace was only two months, or half the
amount from a year earlier, said Robert Bailey, president of the
state group.</TE>

<HD>Mid-Size Import-Brand Sedans Top Crash Test</HD>
<DH>Autos: Toyota dominates safety ratings with five models.
Only two American cars receive 'good' rankings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Among mid-size sedans, import brands dominated the crash-worthiness
ratings released Tuesday by an insurance safety group that conducts
independent tests.</LD>
<LD>   All 13 of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's
crash-worthy "best picks" for inexpensive, moderately priced and
luxury mid-size sedans were import models, seven of them Japanese.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota had the most best picks--five--with the 1997-2001 Camry as
well as the redesigned 2002 Camry, the 2000-2002 Avalon, the 2002
Lexus ES 300 and the 2002 Lexus IS 300. The other best picks came
from Acura, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Subaru, Volkswagen and Volvo.</LD>
<TE>   Only two American models received "good" rankings: the 2001-2002
Chrysler Sebring/Dodge Stratus and the 1997-2001 Cadillac Catera,
which has been discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, imports have done well," IIHS Senior Vice President
Steven Oesch said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 49 mid-size models tested, 21 were "good" and 17 were
deemed "acceptable." Two were "marginal" and nine were rated "poor."
The cars include all major mid-size models in the U.S. market,
although some models such as the Ford Contour and Plymouth Breeze
have been discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   The IIHS conducts frontal offset crash tests at 40 miles per hour,
simulating an impact in which the corners of two cars approaching
each other collide. Federal government tests, conducted by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are head-on
collisions with a barrier at 35 miles per hour.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me that the importers dominated, because they
always have been more focused on engineering," said auto safety
advocate Clarence Ditlow, director of the National Center for Auto
Safety in Washington. "When the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration began its frontal crash testing in 1980, every
Japanese car failed, and two out of three American cars passed,"
Ditlow said. "Then every new Japanese model after 1980 passed the
tests."</TE>
<TE>   Ditlow favors all crash testing because it exposes weaknesses in
vehicle structure, but he said he prefers NHTSA's full-frontal crash
test to the Insurance Institute's offset crash. "The IIHS measures
intrusion into the lower occupant area rather than high-speed
survivability," while NHTSA tests protection of the head and chest
area, he said. "We urge consumers to look at vehicles that do well on
both tests."</TE>
<TE>   Passenger cars have become significantly safer in the seven years
the institute has been conducting tests, IIHS President Brian O'Neill
said. "This set of results demonstrates the effectiveness of consumer
safety information in improving crash-worthiness," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   When the institute began testing cars in 1995 only three of 14
were rated good, he said. "Now it's unusual for us to test a new
vehicle design in any size class and not get a good performance," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although auto makers do not consult with the IIHS in engineering
their cars to do well in the offset crash tests, "We certainly
believe that our tests have been a major influence in encouraging
manufacturers to make improvements in their vehicles," Oesch said.
"We know that consumers use this information in their buying
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, and Toyota
Motor Sales USA, the largest importer in this country, said the IIHS
tests were important, but that they do not establish safety standards
based on whether their cars can pass the institute's tests.</TE>
<TE>   "We run a battery of tests; this is just one component," said GM
spokesman Jay Cooney. "We don't design our vehicles to pass that one
test.</TE>
<TE>   "Should you go to the bank on this one test? No. Should it be one
of the factors considered when purchasing a car? Of course."</TE>
<TE>   Toyota spokesman Joe Tetherow said the Japanese auto maker was
pleased with its performance, but also conducts numerous tests to
ensure safety. "Probably some consideration is given [to the IIHS
tests], but overall safety is the key component," Tetherow said.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers don't hesitate to use positive IIHS results in their
marketing. Certain ads for the Mercedes M-class sport utility
vehicle, BMW 3- and 5-series sedans and X5 SUV, Pontiac Bonneville,
Ford Focus, Buick LeSabre and Ford Taurus note their "good" IIHS
rating. (The IIHS classifies the Taurus as a large family car rather
than a mid-size sedan.)</TE>
<TE>   Toyota had a TV ad campaign for its 2000 Sienna minivan built
around its top IIHS rating, showing the van in a crash test with a
Tina Turner song, "Simply the Best," playing in the background.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy CEO Quits as Probe of Sham Trades Intensifies</HD>
<DH>Energy: Chuck Watson is replaced by two company directors.
Major shareholder ChevronTexaco steps in to stabilize firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. Chief Executive Chuck Watson resigned Tuesday amid
increasing questions about the company's finances and the
energy-trading business that so affected California's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy's board of directors gave no reason for the resignation.
But analysts assumed it was related to disclosures of sham
transactions in energy trading and to the fact that Dynegy faces
downgrading of its credit rating unless it can reduce its large debt.</LD>
<LD>   Watson was replaced on an interim basis by two Dynegy directors,
one of whom, Glenn Tilton, is also vice chairman of oil giant
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26.5% of Dynegy. Energy experts said
Tuesday that ChevronTexaco was stepping in to bolster Dynegy's
standing in credit markets and to sort out its business records.</LD>
<TE>   Houston-based Dynegy, which owns power plants in California and
other states plus natural gas pipelines and processing facilities,
was once considered a leading player in the industry of energy
trading and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department for its reporting of a natural
gas transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Along with other energy-trading companies, Dynegy's stock price
has fallen sharply this year. Watson--who in an interview Friday with
The Times vowed to find a way to restore confidence in the
company--becomes the fourth top corporate officer of an energy
company to quit this year.</TE>
<TE>   The credibility of the energy-trading sector has been severely
damaged by disclosures of sham transactions in energy trading,
designed to build up ostensible sales and profits and therefore share
prices of the trading companies.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of Reliant Resources, a subsidiary of Reliant Energy
Inc. of Houston, and CMS Energy Corp. of Michigan have been forced to
resign in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest energy trader of all, Enron Corp., collapsed in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December--just after Dynegy abandoned an
effort to merge with it because Enron's debt was downgraded to "junk"
status.</TE>
<TE>   Now Dynegy, which reported $42.2 billion in sales and $648 million
in net income last year, faces a similar downgrade. The company plans
to sell partial interest in its assets, including major gas
pipelines, to raise money.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy stock, which sold a year ago for almost $55 a share, closed
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $9.69, up 39 cents, as
investors saw in the appointment of Tilton as interim chairman a sign
that ChevronTexaco was supporting the Houston firm.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the San Francisco-based oil company issued a statement
Tuesday that it is "supporting a strategy that will restore investor
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   "Confidence is the crux of the industry's problem," said Stephen
Bergstrom, chief operating officer of Dynegy. He will continue to
serve under Tilton and the interim chief executive, Daniel
Dienstbier, a Dynegy director and head of one of its pipeline units.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its other problems, Dynegy has been hurt by the
disclosure that it engaged in a sham trade with CMS Energy. Watson,
maintained that the trade was at CMS' initiation and benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't enter the transaction to inflate our revenues," Watson
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dynegy also constructed within its financial system a Project
Alpha, which through complex accounting had the effect of swelling
Dynegy's cash flow by $300million while reducing its federal tax bill
by about $80 million. That is the transaction now being investigated
by the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Bergstrom said in an interview Tuesday that Dynegy now would "roll
out information to explain its trading business to shareholders and
investors" and the general public.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 80% of our cash flow comes from hard assets, not from
trading," Bergstrom said, referring to Dynegy's power plants,
pipelines and other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Energy trading began when natural gas was deregulated in the
1980s. Independent gas suppliers, rather than regulated pipeline
companies with guaranteed profits, became the marketers of the
essential fuel and used trading of contracts to hedge risks.</TE>
<TE>   When electricity deregulation came to half a dozen states,
including California, in the 1990s, markets were created to trade
electricity supplies.</TE>
<TE>   But some trading practices had the effect of withholding
electricity at times from the California market, leading to price
spikes.</TE>
<TE>   It was those trading practices that Gov. Gray Davis denounced in
the state's energy crisis of 2000-2001. He referred to Dynegy and
other companies as "pirates" and "snakes."</TE>
<TE>   Those charges were given new credence this month with the release
of Enron memoranda outlining trading ploys to inflate prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating possible
market manipulation by Enron and other California suppliers,
including Dynegy.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's Bergstrom and Watson deny that the firm engaged in
misleading transactions in California's market.</TE>
<TE>   The firm purchased power plants from Southern California Edison,
among other companies, when the state deregulated in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite pledges to invest as much as $200 million to upgrade the
generating plants, Dynegy has not done so and may not be able to
afford to now.</TE>
<TE>   Energy experts predicted Tuesday that ChevronTexaco will have its
financial executives pore over Dynegy's business accounts to see
which operations are valuable and which are not.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco's cumulative investment in Dynegy amounts to $1.3
billion, not counting an additional $1.5 billion Chevron forwarded to
Dynegy last fall in the attempted Enron acquisition.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence, Spending Edge Up</HD>
<DH>Economy: Reports are not all positive. One shows a decline
in the six-month outlook for jobs and new purchases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer confidence edged higher in May, but Americans' expectations
for the future fell for a second month, a private research report
said Tuesday, providing more evidence that the recovery probably will
slow in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Commerce Department said consumer spending rose
for a fifth straight month in April.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the reports showed that consumers probably will keep
supporting the economy recovery until businesses begin investing and
hiring again--what Federal Reserve officials want to see before
considering boosting benchmark interest rates from four-decade lows
of 1.75%.</LD>
<TE>   American consumers power two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board, a private research group, said its closely
watched index of consumer confidence rose to 109.8 in May from a
downwardly revised 108.5 in April. The index was mostly in line with
analysts' forecasts of a slight rise to 109 but below March's reading
of 110.7.</TE>
<TE>   Americans expressed optimism about the current state of the
economy's recovery and labor market. The present situation index rose
in May to 110.3 from 106.8 in April.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the decline in the expectations index that many
economists and investors focused on, sending U.S. stocks and the
dollar lower.</TE>
<TE>   The index fell for a second straight month, to 109.4 in May from
109.6 in April, weighed down in part by the stock market's recent
troubles.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence report showed a decline in the six-month outlook
for making new purchases and finding jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists said the drop in expectations signals that
consumer spending remains dependent on interest-rate-sensitive
sectors such as autos and housing, likely keeping the Fed from
raising interest rates in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "This mediocre showing for the view of the future is somewhat
disturbing as it suggests that the consumer may be tiring and that
the current rate of consumption is being inflated by low interest
rates," said Drew Matus, financial market economist at Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Still, consumer spending probably will stay close to the
respectable 3.2% growth pace it posted in the first quarter, giving
businesses leeway to start boosting investments as the economy
recovers, with profits already improving, some economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.5% to a
$7.32-trillion annualized rate in April after gaining 0.3% the
previous month. Spending on durable goods--items designed to last
three or more years, such as cars or washing machines--jumped 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Personal income grew 0.3% in April, matching analyst expectations,
compared with a 0.4% increase the previous month, the Commerce report
said.</TE>
<TE>   With inflation tame, the increase in incomes and improving labor
market should help bolster consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed inflation remains tame despite a slight
tick higher in April. The personal consumption expenditures index,
closely watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose 0.4%, the
largest rise since 0.6% in October. The core rate, which strips out
volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%.</TE>

<HD>Agents Deny Guilt in Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jeffrey A. Royer and Lynn Wingate are accused of
sharing confidential FBI information with an Encinitas-based stock
trader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A current and a former FBI agent pleaded not guilty Tuesday to
helping an alleged stock manipulator by giving him secret information
from FBI computers.</LD>
<LD>   Former agent Jeffrey A. Royer, 39, and Lynn Wingate, 34, a New
Mexico-based special agent on administrative leave from the bureau,
were arraigned in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn before Judge
Raymond J. Dearie. Their pleas were entered by their court-appointed
lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time, the lead prosecutor said the case, centered
on Encinitas, Calif.-based investor Amr I. "Anthony" Elgindy, may
have implications that go beyond the fraud, racketeering and
obstruction-of-justice charges outlined in the federal indictment
unsealed last week.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Ken Breen, arguing before a
federal magistrate judge in San Diego at Elgindy's initial bail
hearing, questioned whether the Egyptian-born investor may have had
advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and tried to
profit from the information. The magistrate said he would disregard
Breen's statement, but nonetheless denied bail for Elgindy.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, in arguing against bail for Royer, Breen said
authorities found "classified information" among Royer's belongings
last week when they searched Wingate's Albuquerque home. Prosecutors
said Royer and Wingate were living together.</TE>
<TE>   The classified material could make the case much more serious,
Breen said. Pressed by Dearie, the prosecutor said he could not
discuss details except in a private conference. No such conference
was set, although the judge ordered Royer to return to court Thursday
for further discussions on bail.</TE>
<TE>   Royer and Wingate were indicted May 22 along with Elgindy, a
controversial stock speculator with a large following on the
Internet, and two of his associates, Derrick W. Cleveland and Troy
Peters.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Elgindy, Cleveland and Peters used
FBI investigative material--supplied first by Royer and later by
Wingate--in targeting companies' shares for "short sales." In a short
sale, a trader borrows stock and sells it, betting the price will
fall. If the bet is correct, the trader can replace the borrowed
shares later at cheaper prices.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland, who was Royer's primary contact, paid the agent $30,425
over six months in exchange for the information, according to the
indictment. Royer allegedly recruited Wingate to supply confidential
material after he left the bureau in December.</TE>
<TE>   Breen said in court Tuesday that after his arrest, Royer admitted
to much of what he was accused of, including supplying Elgindy with
information from FBI files.</TE>
<TE>   However, Royer's lawyer, Lawrence Gerzog of Manhattan, denied any
such admissions. "My client has assured me that he is completely
innocent, and we intend to contest these charges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gerzog confirmed that Royer left the FBI last year but said he did
not go to work for Elgindy's firm, Pacific Equity Investigations, as
the government asserts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of many errors in the indictment," Gerzog said. He
also said that as a father of three young children who live with his
ex-wife near Denver, Royer has strong ties that would keep him from
fleeing prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Royer, athletic-looking with close-cropped hair, wearing a black
suit and blue tie, was ordered confined to the home where he is
staying with a relative in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Wingate, with long blond hair and a slight build and dressed in a
dark, pinstriped pants suit, was released on $100,000 bail, pledging
as security some land she owns in Colorado plus her mother's home in
Florida. Her mother attended the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Wingate's lawyer, Ian Yankwitt, declined to comment on the charges
after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In suggesting that Elgindy may have had advance knowledge of the
Sept. 11 attacks, Breen said Friday that Elgindy had asked his broker
the day before the attacks to liquidate a $300,000 account held in
trust for Elgindy's children. Breen quoted Elgindy as saying the
stock market would soon plunge.</TE>
<TE>   At least publicly, however, Elgindy took a strong stance against
profiteering related to the attacks. In statements released Sept. 12
and Sept. 13, he urged his followers to refrain from short-selling
investments such as airline stocks, New York real estate investment
trusts or the U.S. dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have experience and those who have the wherewithal will
be tempted to exploit our fellow Americans, who may need to sell, or
who may simply be scared," wrote Elgindy, identified as the
"investigative director" at his public Internet site,
InsideTruth.com.</TE>
<TE>   "We make a request that you refrain from such activity," he said.
"To profit from this tragic event would only reward terror, and
terror cannot be rewarded."</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy's attorney, Jeanne Knight, said Friday that the timing of
Elgindy's call to his broker was coincidental and accused the
prosecutor of using racial profiling to smear her client. Elgindy
holds dual American and Egyptian citizenship, prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Global Execs Offer a Plan to Save Firm</HD>
<DH>Telecom: An equity investment and the sale of some
operations are an alternative to selling the whole company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buoyed by its improved financial performance, Global Crossing Ltd.
said Tuesday that it will propose a bankruptcy reorganization plan
that would revive the company without selling it.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came just days after two key bidders for the
telecommunications company balked at substantially raising their
initial bid of $750 million for a 79% ownership stake. Other bidders
are expected to file offers by a June 20 deadline, with an auction
set for early July.</LD>
<LD>   John Legere, Global Crossing's chief executive, said the company's
creditors will consider the stand-alone proposal from Global Crossing
executives. Under that plan, the company's reemergence from
bankruptcy would be funded by a small equity investment and the
proceeds from the expected sale of three operations.</LD>
<TE>   After cutting thousands of jobs and shuttering 217 offices, Global
Crossing is conserving cash and operating on a tight budget. The
measures have reduced operating costs to about $900 million this
year, down from $1.6 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, revenue has held up amid terrible market conditions,
and the company's cash balance is just $52 million lower than at the
end of January--despite severance and other extra costs.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said those factors helped make the executive proposal
possible. "We have strong support and interest in this," he said.
"The math is just much different than it was on Jan. 28," when the
company filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said he expects the stand-alone proposal to be a group
effort, with potential support and investment from bidders only
interested in parts of the business or from equipment suppliers such
as Lucent Technologies, which have an interest in selling goods to
the surviving entity.</TE>
<TE>   Further details of the plan will be filed June 20, along with
buyout bids from other interested investors.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, based in Bermuda, filed for bankruptcy protection
listing more than $12 billion in debt and $22.4 billion in
assets--the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy filing. The company's
most recent operations report listed total assets of $15.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company spent billions of dollars building a worldwide
fiber-optic network linking more than 200 cities in 27 countries. It
was ultimately forced into bankruptcy by its staggering debt and
falling revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, talks with suitors Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and
Singapore Technologies Telemedia broke down when the creditors
committee rejected the firms' offer to sweeten their $750-million bid
by giving creditors half of the proceeds from the expected sale of
Global Marine Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Global Marine, a Global Crossing subsidiary, maintains and repairs
undersea fiber-optic cables. It has been on the block for more than
six months.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Global Crossing said it also will sell its conferencing
business and its terrestrial network in Britain to raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the unsecured creditors said the Hutchison-ST
Telemedia offer was insufficient. Had a deal been struck, the Asian
firms' bid would have set the minimum offer for rival bids and
allowed the companies to collect a $30-million "breakup" fee if their
bid was superseded.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking ahead, the stand-alone plan is an option receiving
serious consideration against which any proposals for a sale of the
entire company will have to be measured," said Russell Belinsky of
Chanin Capital Partners, financial advisors to the creditors'
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The executives' proposal may raise conflict-of-interest concerns
from potential bidders that have to rely on the cooperation and
candor of Global Crossing managers while weighing their bidding
strategy, said Nicholas Kajon, a partner at Salomon Green &amp; Ostrow, a
bankruptcy firm not involved in the Global Crossing case. With the
bankruptcy judge's oversight, he said, "there should be no
shenanigans."</TE>
<TE>   If a good bid comes along, Kajon said, creditors surely will take
it instead of the managers' plan. "It's the old 'bird in the hand'
theory, and it's a good one."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Asia Global Crossing, more than 58% owned by Global
Crossing, is busily rounding up its own suitors, among them China
Netcom Communication Group Corp., Hutchison, ST Telemedia and Citic
Pacific Ltd.</TE>

<HD>Halliburton Says SEC Probing Its Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Halliburton Co., a provider of oilfield services and engineering,
said late Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has
begun a preliminary investigation of its accounting treatment of cost
overruns on construction jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Halliburton, which had Vice President Dick Cheney as its chief
executive from 1995 to 2000, said it believes that it accounted for
construction claims and change orders in accordance with generally
accepted accounting practices applicable to the construction
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas-based company also said it believes the investigation
is in response to an article in the New York Times last week
regarding construction job claims and change orders that are
negotiated with customers.</LD>
<TE>   The energy industry has come under scrutiny for its accounting
practices since the collapse of Enron Corp. in December.</TE>
<TE>   "In this kind of environment, given what was written in the New
York Times, I think the SEC has an obligation to look," said
Halliburton's Chief Financial Officer Doug Foshee. "We expect to put
this behind us quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton, which said it advised the SEC it will cooperate,
expects to receive a formal request for documents or a subpoena in
the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   The company said before 1998, it did not include the cost overrun
claim items in its revenue or accounts receivable before they were
resolved with the customer. During 1998, Halliburton began to record
these claims in revenue and accounts receivable when the company
expected these items could be collected from the customer.</TE>
<TE>   Foshee said the change of accounting method followed a strategic
move at its construction and engineering group toward fixed-price
projects and away from traditional "cost-plus" deals that guarantee
contractors a certain profit margin over and above their costs.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Monday, Halliburton said it had settled a group of 30
asbestos lawsuits, most involving life-threatening cases of cancer,
for an unspecified amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement involved cases pending in New York and was "at a
value consistent with the company's historical averages for these
types of claims," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton has resolved 207,000 asbestos-related claims through
settlements or court proceedings since 1976 at a cost of $162
million, according to company filings.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton's stock closed up 25 cents at $19.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before news of the SEC investigation was announced.</TE>

<HD>JetBlue to Beef Up Southland Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JetBlue Airways, moving to protect its unused flight slots at Long
Beach Airport from rivals, said Tuesday that it plans to launch
service from Long Beach to Oakland, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   The action also intensifies airline competition in the West, with
young discount carrier JetBlue pushing into markets where Southwest
Airlines, America West and Delta Air Lines are established. But the
added competition could be a boon to consumers by keeping downward
pressure on fares. JetBlue said one-way fares for most of its new
Long Beach routes would be less than $100.</LD>
<LD>   JetBlue, which already flies from Long Beach to its home at New
York's Kennedy International Airport and to Washington, said it will
start the Long Beach-Oakland service Sept. 6 with nine flights a day.
On Oct. 10, JetBlue will begin Long Beach-Las Vegas service with six
flights a day, along with one flight to Salt Lake City. It also will
add a fifth daily flight to Kennedy.</LD>
<TE>   The capacity for commercial jets at Long Beach Airport is limited
to 41 slots because of local noise rules. JetBlue, which has made
Long Beach its West Coast base, acquired the remaining 27 slots
available last year when the facility had plenty of empty space.</TE>
<TE>   But now American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., wants four more
permanent slots at Long Beach. Its request has been denied because
all the slots are taken, and American is threatening legal action.
Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group Inc., also wants three
more slots for new service to Seattle that it plans later this year.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue hadn't planned to use its remaining empty slots until next
year. But as the other carriers petitioned for more space, JetBlue
moved up its plans for the new routes to this fall. By October,
JetBlue will be using 23 of its 27 slots.</TE>
<TE>   American on Tuesday appealed the decision of Long Beach Airport
Director Chris Kunze to City Manager Henry Taboada, who said he has
15 days to issue a decision.</TE>
<TE>   American, the nation's largest airline, contends that the airport
is legally bound to accommodate American's needs, even if it means
adding flights to the 41 allowed.</TE>

<HD>Disappointing Data Drive Stocks Lower</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The consumer confidence index shows improvement
but not as much as anticipated. Gold continues its surge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slumped Tuesday in thin post-holiday trading, as investors
mulled over weaker-than-expected economic data.</LD>
<LD>   Gold continued to surge, boosted in part by escalating tensions
between India and Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials closed down 122.68
points, or 1.2%, at 9,981.58. It was the Dow's first close below
10,000 since May 10 and followed a 111-point drop Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite lost 9.32 points, or 0.6%, to 1,652.17,
though it had been down as much as 29 points before rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Light trading, the result of many investors extending their
Memorial Day vacations, made the market susceptible to greater
volatility, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street got off to a negative start early in the session on
consumer data that showed improvement but not as much as investors
and analysts had anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index
rose in May to 109.8 from a revised 108.5 in April. But a gauge of
consumers' expectations declined.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't bad economic data; it just didn't surprise us on the
upside," said John Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence
Investment. "The market needs good news to make it go forward, and
there's just a dearth of good news right now."</TE>
<TE>   Some blue chips were hurt by new research reports from analysts.
Home Depot dropped $1.88 to $41.54, its lowest since November, after
brokerage UBS Warburg downgraded the stock to "hold" from "buy,"
citing concerns about the retailer's shifting business strategy and
high-level executive departures.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, Intel lost 31 cents to $28.35, after falling
as low as $27.67. Merrill Lynch reduced its near-term earnings
estimates for the chip maker.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill analyst Joseph Osha cut his second-quarter earnings
forecast for Intel to 17 cents from 18 cents a share, citing
potential weakness in orders from some computer makers.</TE>
<TE>   Some investment pros say domestic investors are concerned about
the continuing barrage of bad news on corporate accounting, while the
weaker U.S. dollar is discouraging foreign buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no sense of confidence" in U.S. stocks, Rick Campagna,
co-head of research at Shaker Investments Inc. in Cleveland, told
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's value rose to almost 93 cents, an eight-month high, on
speculation that Europe may enjoy a more robust recovery than the
United States. The yen also gained against the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets, near-term gold futures gained $3.40 to $324.10
an ounce in New York. It was the eighth advance in nine sessions and
pushed the metal to a 21/2-year high.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said fear of war between India and Pakistan was stoking an
already bullish gold market.</TE>
<TE>   Gold stocks, among this year's hottest issues, were mostly higher
again as a result. Goldcorp surged $1.05 to $23.21, and Newmont
Mining jumped $1.34 to $32.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in commodities trading, copper futures had their biggest
gain in 31/2 months after Australia's BHP Billiton said it would
extend a production cutback at a Chilean mine by six months, reducing
output by 20% from 2001 levels. Near-term copper futures rose 1.85
cents to 75.5 cents a pound in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Blue chips under pressure included Coca-Cola, down $1.56 to
$54.64, and 3M, down $1.17 to $126.78.</TE>
<TE>   * Procter &amp; Gamble led consumer products stocks lower, perhaps on
worries about consumer spending. P&amp;G fell $2.25 to $88.01,
Alberto-Culver lost $1.40 to $52.76, and Colgate-Palmolive dropped
$1.24 to $52.22.</TE>
<TE>   * In the retail sector, Federated Department Stores lost $1.05 to
$41.18, Kohl's fell $1.19 to $73.93, and Sears, Roebuck was off $1.30
to $56.15.</TE>
<TE>   * Among major tech names, IBM fell $1.02 to $82.08, Motorola lost
18 cents to $16.67, and Cisco Systems was down 19 cents to $16.38.
But Hewlett-Packard added 1 cent to $18.70, and Oracle rose 9 cents
to $8.94.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotech was a bright spot, as some shares in that sector
continued to rebound on recent positive news about new drug
approvals. Biogen rose $1.19 to $50.66, Cephalon gained $2.32 to
$57.73, and Alkermes added 76 cents to $20.65.</TE>
<TE>   * Some big telecom shares rallied. BellSouth rose $1.15 to $33.25,
and Verizon Communications gained $1.15 to $44.65. The stocks have
bounced sharply after diving in April.</TE>
<TE>   * Major brokerage stocks were broadly lower. Merrill Lynch fell 65
cents to $42.30, Goldman Sachs dropped $1.29 to $76.90, and Morgan
Stanley slid $1.27 to $46.66.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court Bolsters Protections for Patents</HD>
<DH>Decision: Justices reverse lower court, say rule defends
against slightly different imitations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision affecting most patents, the Supreme Court on Monday
gave inventors wider latitude to sue makers of competing products
that don't exactly copy the original.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision overturned a controversial appeals court
ruling and was heralded by inventors and lawyers as the most
important concerning patents in decades. "Everyone was holding their
breath for this one," said Washington lawyer Ray Kurz.</LD>
<LD>   The decision affects about 1 million of the 1.2 million patents in
effect and hinged on the long-standing "doctrine of equivalents."</LD>
<TE>   "Since the beginning of our country, patents were seen to be in
effect even on so-called equivalent products that might be a little
different from what was described in the patent," said lawyer Jim
Carmichael of Los Angeles firm Lyon &amp; Lyon. "It was to prevent
someone looking at a patent and saying, 'That's a great idea. Let's
see how small a change I can make and bring out a competing
product.'"</TE>
<TE>   Suits concerning the doctrine of equivalents were essentially
handled case by case, which "made it hard to predict an outcome,"
Carmichael said. But in 1999, the appeals court handling patents
ruled in a dispute over an air cylinder used in robotics that if a
patent is amended during the application process--and almost all
are--the doctrine was no longer in effect.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said inventors are restricted to the literal
wording in the amended part of the patent and can't take advantage of
the doctrine of equivalents. The court said the rule would prevent
inventors from attempting to recapture subject matter they
relinquished during the application process. The court also said its
decision would clarify what each patent covered.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that allowing the appeals court
ruling to stand would "risk destroying the legitimate expectations of
inventors in their property."</TE>
<TE>   Several technology and biotech firms, including Sun Microsystems
Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Dow Chemical Co.,
had urged the reversal of the appeals court decision. "In those
fields, the technology is evolving so rapidly that it would be easy
for someone to get around the scope of a patent as things change,"
said Carmichael, who works in Washington and is secretary of the
national Assn. of Patent Law Firms.</TE>
<TE>   The association filed a brief in support of the reversal.</TE>
<TE>   But other large companies, such as Intel Corp., IBM Corp. and
Genentech Inc. urged the Supreme Court to uphold the appeals court
ruling, saying it would ward off frivolous patent suits.</TE>
<TE>   The decision did not come down entirely on inventors' side. The
Supreme Court said an amended patent does not automatically get
doctrine-of-equivalents protection. The inventor will have to show
that changes to the patent are more cosmetic than substantial.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came in Festo vs. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki, a
case that has been in the courts for 14 years. Festo Co., a Long
Island, N.Y., manufacturer of robotics and assembly line equipment,
sued its Tokyo-based rival, commonly known as SMC, for allegedly
copying a patented type of air cylinder.</TE>
<TE>   Festo won the first round in district court but lost on appeal.
Now the case, unless settled, will return to district court for a new
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Festo and SMC officials did not respond to requests for comment.</TE>

<HD>State Seeks to Fine Online Pharmacy</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A Los Angeles drugstore could face an
$88.7-million penalty for allegedly selling drugs without
examinations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what probably would be the largest fine ever for illegal
prescription drug sales over the Internet, California state
regulators said Tuesday that they have proposed an $88.7-million fine
against a Los Angeles pharmacy for selling medications directly to
consumers without requiring a doctor's examination.</LD>
<LD>   The state Board of Pharmacy's sanction against Los Angeles-based
Total Remedy &amp; Prescription Center II, pharmacist-in- charge and
co-owner Barry Irvin and pharmacist William Packer must be approved
by the 11-member state medical board. The fine amounts to the maximum
$25,000 for each of about 3,500 prescriptions allegedly filled
illegally.</LD>
<LD>   The case represents the first use of a law passed in 2000 that
requires a "good faith prior medical examination" by a doctor
licensed in California before a prescription can be filled.</LD>
<TE>   Irvin said the charges were "crazy, to say the least," and came as
a complete surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to maintain my normal routine," he said in a
telephone interview, adding that the prescriptions were legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   He has 30 days to appeal the sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmacy is operated at its Los Angeles location like any
other drugstore, said Patricia Harris, executive officer of the
California Board of Pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said the pharmacy's operators also ran a Web site called
CyberHealthServices.com that specialized in so-called lifestyle drugs
such as Viagra for impotence, Propecia for hair loss and Xenical for
weight loss. It is accused of filling prescriptions from out-of-state
doctors who did not examine the patients.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said the Web site was advertised mostly through
unsolicited blanket e-mails. Harris added that the Web site also
showed up on Web searches for Viagra and other drugs.</TE>
<TE>   California officials were made aware of the site in 2001 by the
Pennsylvania attorney general's office, which was working on a case
involving the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania officials told California officials that the building
that handled the credit card calls and shipping was in Glendale, but
it had moved, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   The medications were mailed in a professional fashion, in standard
vials and accompanied by literature, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   That's not always the case with Internet drug sales, according to
the National Assn. of Boards of Pharmacy, a professional organization
representing pharmacy boards in all 50 states. The association said
Web sites and associated boiler room operations began proliferating
five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Many are set up and dismantled within a matter of months or weeks
and offer sales of all manner of drugs with minimal requirements and
without a doctor's advice, leaving consumers to self-medicate without
any instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It scares the heck out of us," said Carmen Catizone, executive
director of the association.</TE>
<TE>   Catizone recalled the recent story of a Florida woman who
contacted an Internet drug sales site and asked for a medication to
help her lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   The woman was sent a powerful amphetamine called Didrex that
quickly sent her blood pressure soaring. Catizone said the woman
stopped taking the drug, but the Internet drug seller would not
refund her money.</TE>
<TE>   Catizone said the operators of such sites in the U.S. and overseas
often mail unpackaged pills in an envelope or a plastic sandwich bag,
without any information such as dosage, possible interactions or,
sometimes, even the name of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The association maintains a Web site, www.nabp.net, with a link to
its Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites, which lists the
pharmacy sites that meet its 17 criteria for trustworthy and safe
service.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said she was aware of a California case in which a woman
received Prozac from another Web site and went into shock when she
self-medicated.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why a state law passed and signed in 2000 was only now
being used to target a serious problem, Harris said the task was
undertaken without a boost in her budget.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said she had a staff of 55, about half of them field
inspectors, to police the state's pharmacies and Internet drug sales
sites. She added that her offices "could always use more resources."</TE>
<TE>   "We have other irons in the fire now. We're working on it," Harris
said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peregrine Systems Inc. fired KPMG as its auditor after one month
because about $35 million of the business software maker's revenue
that must be restated was from sales through KPMG's former consulting
unit.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping KPMG, which spun off KPMG Consulting last year, as auditor
would violate U.S. auditor independence rules because of the past
sales, Peregrine said.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG said it learned of the sales to its former unit after the
firm was hired as auditor.</LD>
<TE>   Peregrine said its audit committee hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to
complete an internal investigation of the accounting irregularities.
It has begun a search for a new auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Diego-based Peregrine fell 32 cents, or 19%, to
close at $1.34 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>A group of utility companies lost a $2.2-billion Supreme Court
challenge of the government's nuclear waste cleanup plan.</LD>
<LD>   Congress, in 1992, ordered utilities that used government
uranium-enrichment services to pay a third of the cleanup bill.
Justices said they would not hear appeals that argue the assessments
are unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration had urged the court not to intervene.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis G. Lyons, a Sacramento Municipal Utility District lawyer,
told the court the assessments are "a naked exaction of money from a
small group."</TE>

<HD>Sempra Energy Sues State Power Buyer to Keep Contract</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy, owner of electric and gas utilities, sued California's
power-buying agency to keep it from canceling a $6.6-billion
power-supply contract.</LD>
<LD>   Sempra said it asked a San Diego Superior Court judge to rule that
"contrary to the Department of Water Resources' stated position, the
company is meeting the terms of the agreement" and the agency is
obligated to take delivery of and pay for wholesale power.</LD>
<LD>   The DWR in April threatened to cancel the accord after learning
the company planned to buy electricity from sources other than an Elk
Hills plant in Bakersfield, which was specified in the contract.</LD>
<TE>   The DWR has been buying power for PG&amp;E Corp., Edison International
and Sempra since last year, after an energy crisis left utilities
unable to pay for electricity. State regulators have been trying for
months to renegotiate $43 billion in contracts that lock California
into paying inflated prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Water Resources had no comment, said spokesman
Oscar Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra's 550-megawatt Elk Hills plant won't start producing power
until next year. The state says the agreement calls for power to
start flowing in April.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra rose 10 cents to $25.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   The world's largest chip maker regularly cuts prices throughout

<LD>   But the company said this round of price cuts--on both high- and
low-end chips--is a direct result of the billions of dollars it has
spent on upgrading chip factories.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. agreed to pay $3.6 million to end two
government inquiries on inaccurate data the company submitted before
winning approval to sell long-distance telephone service in at least
three states, federal regulators said.</LD>
<LD>   The second-biggest U.S. local-phone operator, which didn't admit
guilt in the agreement, said it also would improve training for
employees who interact with government officials, the Federal
Communications Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   Regional phone companies such as SBC must prove their local
networks are open to rivals before the FCC will let them sell
long-distance in states where they dominate local calling.</LD>
<TE>   SBC provided inaccurate information about systems competitors use
to get network access in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, where the
company also sells long-distance, the FCC said.</TE>
<TE>   The problems with the data resulted from "describing highly
technical matters and [were] not the product of any intent to mislead
the commission," said SBC Vice President Priscilla Hill-Ardoin.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Antonio-based SBC rose 31 cents to $35.38 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp., which has been struggling to return to profitability,
named a retired IBM Corp. executive as its chief financial officer, a
job that was open nearly eight months.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Zimmerman, 59, will join the Stamford, Conn.-based
company June 1. He retired from IBM in 1998 after 31 years at the
world's top computer maker. His hiring comes nearly two months after
Xerox settled charges that it inflated earnings and defrauded
investors. The CFO position has been vacant since Barry Romeril

<HD>Vodafone Posts Loss in Fiscal Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vodafone Group, Europe's largest mobile phone company, said it lost
about $19.6 billion last year due to write-downs in the value of
acquisitions it made during its far-flung expansion at the height of
the technology boom.</LD>
<LD>   But the British company reported an operating profit of $10.2
billion for the year that ended March 31, up 34% from $7.6 billion a
year ago and beating analysts' high-end forecast of $10.1 billion.
Revenue rose 53% to $33.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it expects double-digit revenue growth and a
36% rise in earnings for the current year.</LD>
<TE>   Vodafone's net loss, the largest ever for a British company,
included a write-down of about $8.7 billion to cover the reduced
value of its stakes in five companies. Some analysts had expected a
write-off as large as $36.3 billion to hack away at a mountain of
goodwill piled up with the purchase of Germany's Mannesmann two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Vodafone rose in early trading in London as investors
focused on the operating results.</TE>
<TE>   But as the day wore on, doubts over whether the company could keep
up the fast pace of core earnings growth undermined the initial
gains. In New York, Vodafone's shares closed off $1.01 at $15.19 on
the Big Board. The shares have lost a third of their value this year.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P's Initial Rating for Vietnam Moves It Closer to Bond
Sale</HD>
<DH>Asia: Communist-ruled country is building toward a
market-based economy and is seeking entry into the WTO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HANOI</DL>
<LD>Vietnam received a sovereign debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's on
Tuesday, moving the nation closer to a chance to tap world debt
markets for the first time since it began opening its economy in the
mid-1980s.</LD>
<LD>   The Communist-ruled country of 80 million people received a
BB-minus sovereign credit rating. The initial S&amp;P rating on Vietnam's
long-term foreign currency debt puts the country three notches below
the lowest investment-grade level, on par with Bulgaria and Peru and
one notch below India.</LD>
<LD>   Vietnam is moving toward a market-based economy, under which it
opened a stock market in 2000, reached a trade agreement with the
U.S. last year and is trying to join the World Trade Organization.</LD>
<TE>   The country's per capita income doubled over the last decade and
could do so again over the next decade, the World Bank said.</TE>
<TE>   "Governments throughout the region are very worried about Vietnam
because they're such a strong competitor," said John Chambers, deputy
head of sovereign ratings at S&amp;P. "You're going to see this country
emerge as the next Asian tiger economy."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the country needs to open its markets further to win
upgrades, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   The current rating balances Vietnam's "excellent export-led growth
prospects" with the challenges "of transition to a market-led
economy, weaknesses in public finances and limited monetary
flexibility," the rating firm said. "Despite success in achieving
moderate levels of inflation, Vietnam's monetary flexibility is
hamstrung by the central bank's lack of independence, the
inconvertibility of the Vietnamese dong, the high level of foreign
currency deposits and an undeveloped capital market."</TE>
<TE>   The rating is another key step for Vietnam in its plans to borrow
via U.S. dollar-denominated bonds for the first time. The government
hopes to sell the bonds this year.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam also has invited Fitch Ratings Inc. to give the country a
credit rating, and representatives of Moody's Investors Service began
meeting with government officials last week to assess its rating on
Vietnam, the Vietnam Investment Review reported Monday. Moody's has a
B1 rating on Vietnamese foreign currency bonds and notes and changed
its outlook to stable from negative in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving credit ratings from Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch "is one of
the very important conditions to enable us to issue international
bonds," said Tran Xuan Gia, Vietnam's minister of planning and
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Though the government hasn't announced a figure for the bond sale,
bankers bidding to manage the sale expect $300 million to $500
million.</TE>

<HD>Series Has Become Officially Interesting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>First of all, the officials did not cost the Lakers Game 5. But
they're far too prevalent.</LD>
<LD>   After all the whistles and judgment calls, the Lakers had the
scenario any team would love: The ball in Kobe Bryant's hands and a
chance to have the best clutch player in the NBA give them a 3-2 lead
in the conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   He missed his shot, after Mike Bibby had made his seconds earlier
(after Chris Webber appeared to knock a ball out of bounds) and the
Sacramento Kings had a 92-91 victory in a game that was every bit as
tense and dramatic as expected.</LD>
<TE>   The only problem with this game--the flaw with this series--is
that it doesn't stop there. There's a team trying to wring every last
bit of its championship mettle playing an ascending, exciting squad
... and the talk keeps turning around to the guys in the referees'
shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, the officiating tonight was ... " said a man on his way out
of Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   And he was a King fan.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson's postgame address to the media lasted
all of eight seconds before he got to the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   After talking about the exciting finish and congratulating the
Kings, Jackson said: "I thought Kobe got fouled on the last play.
Obviously we didn't get the call."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had the ball on the right side, isolated against Bobby
Jackson. He made his move, he and Jackson bumped and both lost their
balance. Jackson grabbed Bryant's jersey as he stumbled backward,
Bryant went to recover the ball and then launched a jump shot that
missed.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't pull a guy's shirt off and it not be a foul," forward
Rick Fox said. "But in this league, a lot of that is left alone down
the stretch. As a defensive player, I prefer it to be left alone.
Usually you let it go, let the two guys decide it."</TE>
<TE>   It has been the players deciding it at the end, but the tone of
the rest of the game is set by the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings lost Game 4, Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman's
opening comments quickly turned to the physical play he thought the
Lakers got away with, and he officially dubbed it his "sour grapes."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes.</TE>
<TE>   If the players and coaches aren't complaining postgame about the
officiating, they're doing it on the off days, trying to influence
the next game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as old as the game itself," said NBA Commissioner David
Stern, who attended the game. "It's not even boring. It's kind of
interesting to see what new wrinkles can be put on, or what the spin
can be."</TE>
<TE>   This is interesting? Now that's spin.</TE>
<TE>   It's a serious problem when the officiating is so unpredictable
that coaches are basing their strategies around it, as Jackson
indicated Monday when he said he would wait to see how tightly Game 5
was called before he decided whether or not to have Bryant defend
Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem when Shaquille O'Neal is turned into a timid
kitten, hesitant to move toward the basket on offense or attack the
ball on defense because he doesn't know if he will be called for a
foul.</TE>
<TE>   He was called for six fouls on Tuesday night, sending him to the
bench for good with 3:22 left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal easily committed six fouls in the game, but not necessarily
on all the occasions the officials thought.</TE>
<TE>   There's still no way to tell what they're going to call and what
they aren't going to call, and never are they more inconsistent than
when O'Neal is involved.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, O'Neal leaned into Divac, Divac fell down.
O'Neal's been called for an offensive foul on that throughout the
series, but this time a reach-in foul was called on Divac. In the
third quarter, on an almost identical play, no foul called at all.
With the lane cleared, O'Neal cocked back and hammered down a dunk.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal got personal foul No. 3 simply because he has size-22
shoes. Doug Christie stepped on one of them as he dribbled by, he
stumbled and the whistle blew.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the third quarter, Webber drove down the lane and
was bumped by O'Neal in midair. No call.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth, Divac and O'Neal made the exact same collision, and
this time there was a call--O'Neal's fifth. He received his sixth
when Bibby came through the lane, O'Neal rode him with his arm--the
same thing happened with players more close in size throughout the
game with nothing called-- and Bibby stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant caught Doug Christie in the nose with an elbow in Game 1
and Christie was called for a foul. The same play happened in Game 5
and this time it was Bryant who was called.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been consistent," Fox said sarcastically. "They've been
consistently shooting about 35 free throws a game and we've been
shooting about 18. It's been consistent."</TE>
<TE>   It's not all the officials' fault. Sacramento has been much more
aggressive going toward the basket and forcing the issue, especially
going at O'Neal</TE>
<TE>   But at the other end, O'Neal shot only one free throw in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean to tell me Vlade Divac is on Shaquille O'Neal and in the
fourth quarter he has two fouls and he's been guarding him the whole
game?" Samaki Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   What's to be done? Instant replay can help at times, such as
Walker's shot at the end of the first half in Game 4 that replays and
Stern said should not have counted. The league is moving toward using
replays in limited situations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things that are too hard for the human eye to
see," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   It can't be used for every charge/block, but they can use common
sense, and the attitude of the late, great official Earl Strom: The
overriding decision should be the impact of the play. And in this
situation, the impact on the playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Lose on Piniella's Watch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching Tampa Bay's five-run third inning live was tough enough for
Lou Piniella. When a replay began on the Tropicana Field scoreboard,
the Seattle manager lost it.</LD>
<LD>   Piniella stormed out of the dugout after the Mariners batted in
the eighth inning Tuesday night, pointing at a video screen and
taking another opportunity to object to the way home plate umpire
John Shulock called balls and strikes during Tampa Bay's 5-1 victory
at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Shulock responded by ejecting Piniella, who didn't leave quietly.</LD>
<TE>   Piniella and Shulock also exchanged words in the third after Ben
Grieve walked on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded. John Flaherty
followed with his second career grand slam for a 5-0 Tampa Bay lead.</TE>
<TE>   Once he was tossed, Piniella covered home plate with dirt. Shulock
refused to sweep the plate, instead waiting until catcher Dan Wilson
cleaned it--first with his feet and then with Shulock's brush.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of an umpire telling a catcher to clean off home
plate--never in my life. That's a first," Piniella said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Rupe pitched his first career complete game for the Devil
Rays, who won two of three games against the defending AL West
champions at Safeco Field last week.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Toronto 4--Blue Jay closer Kelvim Escobar (1-2) walked
Jason Varitek and Trot Nixon with the bases loaded in the ninth
inning as the Red Sox won at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Chicago 2--Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams sparked an
eighth-inning rally with RBI singles, and Rondell White doubled in
the go-ahead runs as the Yankees won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Baltimore 2--Mark Mulder won for the first time since
April 6, giving up one earned run in six innings as the Athletics won
at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Detroit 2--Chuck Finley struck out 11, including a
club record-tying six in a row, and Travis Fryman drove in three runs
to lead the Indians at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 11, Texas 4--Jacque Jones hit a grand slam and tied a
career high with five RBIs at Arlington, Texas, as the Twins handed
the Rangers their fifth consecutive loss.</TE>

<DH>Angels: Pitcher gives up 11 hits and Royals overcome early
deficit for 7-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>By the time the crowd sang "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," Aaron Sele
was out of the ballgame, again.</LD>
<LD>   The hits just keep on coming against Sele, so many that he cannot
complete as many innings as advertised when the Angels signed him to
a $24-million free-agent contract. The Kansas City Royals pounded
Sele for 11 hits over five innings of a 7-4 victory over the Angels
on Tuesday, and opponents are now hitting .346 against him. No
pitcher in the major leagues has given up more hits.</LD>
<LD>   Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus hit the Angels' first back-to-back
home runs of the season in the first inning, and Garret Anderson
homered too, but the Royals ripped Sele for hits aplenty without any
of them leaving the ballpark. The Angels, winners of 22 of 26 games
through Saturday, lost consecutive games for the first time since
April 22-23.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels are 28-20, including 6-4 when Sele starts. He is 4-3
with a 5.31 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm pitching overly well," he said. "At the same
time, it doesn't really matter. We're winning ballgames."</TE>
<TE>   But Sele's performance has done little to dispel the perception
that has dogged him through his career, that he cannot win big
without big run support. In his four victories, the Angels have
scored at least six runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're seeing Aaron at his best--not even at what
you would say is an average period for Aaron Sele," Manager Mike
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   In signing Sele to the largest contract the Angels ever gave a
free-agent pitcher, the team did not bill him as the second coming of
Pedro Martinez. But they pointed to his endurance, four consecutive
200-inning seasons that translated to a starter who could pitch into
the seventh inning more often than not.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 starts, Sele has completed seven innings once. The most
obvious statistic in explanation: too many hits allowed, leading to
too many pitches and too many opposing runs. Sele doesn't buy it,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "Some games you go out there and give up 15 hits in seven innings
and get a couple double plays," he said. "Some games you give up
three hits, but two of them are long balls, and you lose. I'm the
type of pitcher that gives up hits. I'm not concerned about giving up
hits by any means."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Sele gave up 244 hits in 205 innings, and he still won 18
games for the Texas Rangers. But only once in his career have
opponents hit better than .300 against him--in 1996, when he went
7-11 with a 5.32 ERA for the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said the number of hits allowed is less of an issue than
the problems reflected by the statistic--falling behind in the count
and failing to put hitters away. Kansas City starter Paul Byrd, whose
eight victories tie him for the league lead and account for nearly
half the Royals' total of 20, demonstrated those points. He won
despite giving up the three homers, largely because he never went to
a three-ball count.</TE>
<TE>   Sele shut out the Royals for the first three innings, getting
ahead with first-pitch fastballs. He gave up five runs in the
fourth--in part, catcher Bengie Molina said, because the Royals hit
those first-pitch fastballs without Sele responding by throwing other
pitches. As Molina and Sele continue to adjust to each other, the
catcher said the veteran pitcher often shakes off signs.</TE>
<TE>   "That man can throw four pitches for strikes," Molina said. "For
me to catch that guy, it's a little hard. He can throw any pitch in
any count. I try to guess what's on his mind, and it's very tough.
It's kind of frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said Sele can, and will, pitch better.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not concerned with Aaron," Scioscia said. "We're talking
about some subtle adjustments that he can make and he will make.
We're not talking about a major overhaul. He's going to be fine."</TE>

<HD>It Might Be Time for a Backup Plan</HD>

<DL>KANSAS CITY</DL>
<LD>Benji Gil is expected to rejoin the Angels in the next several days,
raising the question of whether the team ought to carry Gil and Jose
Nieves as backup infielders.</LD>
<LD>   "If we wanted to trade one of them, we could," General Manager
Bill Stoneman said.</LD>
<LD>   The Florida Marlins, in search of a utility infielder, reportedly
inquired about Gil before signing Homer Bush, who was released by the
Toronto Blue Jays.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels would consider trading Gil or Nieves for a left-handed
reliever, but they're not convinced another team would part with
anyone better than Mark Lukasiewicz, now at triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels believe that Nieves, hitting .290 and making an
affordable $240,000, would be claimed on waivers should they try to
send him to Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Alfredo Amezaga is likely to return to Salt Lake when Gil
rejoins the Angels from his rehabilitation assignment there.</TE>
<TE>   Utilityman Shawn Wooten started his rehabilitation assignment with
Salt Lake on Tuesday. When he returns, the Angels might try to send
outfielder Julio Ramirez through waivers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein, who has not played defensively since suffering a
sprained left knee nine days ago, is expected to serve as the
designated hitter tonight and play shortstop during some--but not
all--of the series against Minnesota, four games on artificial turf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jenks, armed with a 100-mph fastball and ranked as the
team's top pitching prospect, was among three minor league pitchers
suspended for seven games by the Angels. After an undisclosed
off-field incident on the road, Jenks and two double-A Arkansas
teammates were suspended for violating an organizational rule.
Stoneman said none of the players were arrested or otherwise in legal
trouble, and a team source said the incident simply reflected
immaturity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we consider very serious," Stoneman said. "The
game isn't just played on the field. There's a lot more to it than
playing the game for three hours."</TE>
<TE>   Jenks, 21, is 3-6 with a 4.66 earned-run average. He leads the
Texas League in walks and ranks second in strikeouts.</TE>

<LD>The list of Southern Section individual boys' badminton champions
looked a lot like Villa Park's lineup on Tuesday, which is why few at
the Orange County Badminton Club in Orange were surprised to see the
Spartans defeat Alhambra Keppel, 12-7, to win their second
consecutive team title.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Go, Raymond Wong and Mike Chansawangpuvana have won the last
three section individual boys' titles and each was on the court
against Keppel. They combined to win eight of nine matches against
the Aztecs, who have won eight section titles since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   "Too deep," Keppel Coach Vy Vien said of Villa Park's 17-0 team.</LD>
<TE>   Keppel (20-1) countered with Elie Wu and Jane Hu, winners of the
last three section individual girls' titles. Wu, the second-ranked
girl in the nation, and partner Eric Adi won an opening-round mixed
doubles match, 15-0, 4-15, 15-12, against Wong and Jennifer Bai,
while Go and Chansawangpuvana and their partners won the remaining
mixed doubles matches.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park's Eva Lee and Connie Hwang then scored a key 15-2, 15-2
win over Wu and partner Carol Tsung in a third-round set pitting both
team's No. 1 girls' doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Keppel's Tracy Chin, playing at No. 2 girls' singles, beat Villa
Park's No. 1 singles player, Shamyla Tariq, 8-11, 11-8, 11-3, in the
fourth round, but Villa Park clinched the match early in the fifth
round when Wong and Scott Bering defeated Larry Au-Yeung and Brian
Pham, 15-5, 15-7.</TE>

<HD>Simon Says Bishop Amat Advances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 61/2 innings of theatrics that featured a five-run rally, a
three-run home run that tied the score and two teams that refused to
back down, La Puente Bishop Amat High asked its ace right-hander,
Adam Simon, to come out of center field and pitch one inning of
relief, with a trip to the championship game at stake.</LD>
<LD>   "That's why I play the game," Simon said. "That's why I want to be
the pitcher."</LD>
<LD>   Simon shut out West Hills Chaminade in the seventh, striking out
Andrew Yaffe with the tying run on base to give Bishop Amat an 8-7
victory Tuesday in a Southern Section Division IV semifinal game at
Lake Balboa Birmingham High.</LD>
<TE>   Top-seeded Bishop Amat (27-2), which has won 25 consecutive games,
will meet Westminster La Quinta, a 12-3 winner over Oak Park, in
Saturday's final.</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade (23-8) fell behind, 7-2, in the sixth after giving up
four unearned runs. But the Eagles rallied for five runs in the
bottom of the sixth, tying the score when UC Irvine-bound Cody
Haerther hit a towering three-run home run to right field.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat went back ahead in the seventh off reliever Sean
Clark, getting consecutive doubles from Jordan Swaydan and Mike
Lange.</TE>
<TE>   Simon (12-0) had three hits Tuesday and picked up his first save
in eliminating the Eagles for the second consecutive season in the
semifinals. He will start on the mound in Saturday's final at Edison
Field after playing center field in last season's final at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade finished with 12 hits, including two each by Haerther,
Kevin Steinhardt and Jared Link.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Again Takes It to Limit for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He struggles early before setting down as L.A.
rallies to beat Brewers, 8-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words "Kazuhisa Ishii" really aren't Japanese for "throw a ton of
pitches, struggle with your control and make your coaches squirm." It
only seems that way.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii tested Dodger Manager Jim Tracy's patience again Tuesday
night, walking two of his first three batters and giving up four runs
in the third inning, but the left-hander has issued so many free
passes and escaped so many jams, Tracy has learned not to panic when
he struggles early.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii then rewarded Tracy's faith in him, settling down after the
third while the Dodger offense began to percolate, and the Dodgers
wound up with an 8-4 come-from-behind victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers before 22,362 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom's two-run home run to left-center in the sixth
inning gave the Dodgers a 5-4 lead, and the Dodgers gained some
breathing room with a three-run eighth, an inning that included RBI
singles by Grissom and pinch-hitter Dave Hansen.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who ranks fourth in the National League in walks, lasted
62/3 innings, allowing four runs on six hits, striking out four and
walking three, to improve to 8-1. He threw 108 pitches, 65 of them
strikes, and helped an overworked bullpen that had thrown 242/3
innings in the last six games.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Giovanni Carrara, who gave up eight runs and 10 hits in
22/3 innings of his last four appearances, rebounded with 11/3
innings of scoreless relief, making partial amends for the two
three-run homers he allowed in Milwaukee's eight-run eighth inning on
May 21, when the Dodgers blew a 5-0 lead and lost, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Corey, recalled from triple-A Las Vegas on Monday, retired
the side in order in the ninth, and the Dodgers moved to within 11/2
games of first-place Arizona in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "He does make you squirm a bit," Tracy said of Ishii, " ... but it
was obvious from the fourth inning on that his command of the
breaking ball, especially early in the count, made his fastball that
much better. He made some quality pitches to get out of some
situations. But once he rectified himself ... he's a very tough guy
to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   When Ishii has struggled with his rhythm this season he's almost
always switched from a full windup to the stretch, so it couldn't
have been comforting to the Dodgers when Ishii opened the game in the
stretch position.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Brewers couldn't capitalize on Ishii's first-inning
walks, they rocked him for four runs on four hits during a 33-pitch
third, a rally that was aided by catcher Paul Lo Duca's throwing
error on Alex Sanchez's bunt that enabled the Brewers to put runners
on first and second with no outs.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Young walked to load the bases, and Jeffrey Hammonds bounced
into a third-to-home force out. Richie Sexson singled to left for two
runs, Alex Ochoa singled to left for one run, and Jose Hernandez's
RBI single to left gave the Brewers a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii finally found a groove after Hernandez's hit, striking out
Mark Loretta, retiring Paul Bako on a fly ball and retiring another
six in a row before Hernandez's leadoff single in the sixth.
Hernandez reached second on a groundout and took third when second
baseman Jeff Reboulet bobbled Glendon Rusch's grounder up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   But Reboulet made a sniper-like throw to third to nail Hernandez,
who had over run the bag, and Ishii was out of trouble. Tracy pulled
Ishii in favor of Carrara after Hammonds' two-out single in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how that always comes to happen," Ishii said through
an interpreter, alluding to his struggles. "But my responsibility is
to keep the other team with a lower number of runs."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored twice in the fourth and once in the fifth
before Grissom's go-ahead homer. Cesar Izturis led off the fourth
with an infield single and took second on Young's throwing error.
Izturis advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on Adrian
Beltre's single to center.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green singled to left, and Eric Karros singled to right to
score Beltre and trim the lead to 4-2. Reboulet opened the fifth with
an infield single, took second on Ishii's sacrifice bunt, reached
third on Izturis' infield single and scored on Beltre's sacrifice fly
to center to make it 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, who had two hits and scored twice, singled in the
sixth before Grissom drove a 2-2 fastball from Rusch over the wall in
left-center for his third home run in the last three games.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown Suffered No New Tears in Elbow</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An MRI test revealed some inflammation and irritation in Kevin
Brown's right elbow but no new tears, news that brought a sigh of
relief to the Dodgers on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But that does not mean Brown, the 37-year-old right-hander, will
be ready to pitch after 15 days on the disabled list or if he'll be
sound enough the rest of this season to return to the form that made
him one of baseball's most dominant pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   This is Brown's second trip to the disabled list in six weeks, his
second significant setback after surgery to repair a torn flexor
tendon Sept. 27, and the Dodgers have no timetable for his return.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll let the coaches determine when he should come back," said
Dr. Frank Jobe, team physician. "I suspect they'll be more cautious
this time because this is the second [setback]. So, it may take
longer."</TE>
<TE>   Such setbacks are normal in the first year after major surgery,
Jobe said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the Tommy John [surgeries] we've done--we've followed a
lot of those," Jobe said. "Usually you try not to let them back for
about a year, but they're never quite as good as they're going to be
until the second year.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems it takes another year before they get their rhythm
right, their ability to let [pitches] go, and they'll have peaks and
valleys until that second year. I think all surgeries are that way."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who allowed only seven earned runs in 261/3 innings of his
previous four starts, felt a little stiffness warming up before
Sunday's game at Arizona, but he told trainer Stan Johnston he was
well enough to start. He lasted 20 pitches and was pulled after
feeling a grabbing sensation in the back of the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy was not informed of Brown's stiffness before the
game, but he did not consider that a breakdown in communication with
the training staff.</TE>
<TE>   "If they felt medically that he could have caused major damage, he
wouldn't have pitched," Tracy said. "When they say there's stiffness,
it's stiffness. That happens to a lot of guys, and they get rubbed
on.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be informed unless they say he shouldn't [start]. I'm OK
with it. If he had really struggled in his last few starts, I'd want
to know about every aspirin he was taking, but he was reaching
plateaus."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans looked into the matter and was satisfied
with how it was handled.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing to indicate that the start would put [Brown] in
peril," Evans said. "It's not Jim's job to know if he's a little sore
or stiff. No one feels great all the time. Nothing transpired Sunday
that would have caused alarm."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right fielder Shawn Green was named National League player
of the week Tuesday after hitting .593 (16 for 27) with nine home
runs and 17 runs batted in last week, including a major league record
four homers and 19 total bases against Milwaukee on Thursday....
Tracy will shuffle his rotation this weekend in order to start two
left-handers against Arizona and to break up Hideo Nomo and Kazuhisa
Ishii in the rotation. Lefty Omar Daal will step in for Brown and
start Friday night, Andy Ashby will pitch Saturday, and Ishii will
pitch Sunday. Odalis Perez will start Monday and Nomo will start
Tuesday in Colorado.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets are boiling mad.</LD>
<LD>   As the Nets and Boston Celtics get ready for Game 5 of the NBA
Eastern Conference finals tonight at Continental Airlines Arena, the
Nets have put a huge chip on their collective shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Over the holiday weekend in Boston, the Nets coughed up a 26-point
third-quarter lead to lose Game 3, then desperately clung to the
remnants of another large third-quarter lead (15 points), to beat the
Celtics, 94-92, and tie the best-of-seven series at 2-2.</LD>
<TE>   The Nets are mad because they feel one horrible quarter, even if
it was a record-setting debacle of a quarter, should not have been
enough to consign them, the team with the best regular-season record
in the East, to summer vacation in the minds and words of so many.</TE>
<TE>   And they're mad because their star and leader, Jason Kidd, was
taunted by Boston Celtic fans in a way that seems, to Kidd anyway,
too personal.</TE>
<TE>   Every time Kidd shot free throws in the fourth quarter Monday,
Celtic fans yelled "wife beater, wife beater," at Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd said Tuesday that he could accept being booed and could
accept the "wife beater" chant. When he was playing for the Phoenix
Suns, he was charged with striking his wife, Joumana. Though the
charges were dropped, he paid a fine and underwent anger management
counseling. The blow to his reputation and to that of the Suns is
believed to have been a factor in Kidd's trade to the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   What he found objectionable were comments made by some fans
directly to Joumana and 3-year-old T.J., the couple's son.</TE>
<TE>   "That bothers me," Kidd said. "I can't protect them. I'm worried
about them at the same time I'm worried about trying to win a
ballgame. You can't do that to somebody's family."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are also tired of being overlooked. "People wrote us off
too soon," guard Kerry Kittles said. "I think we earned a little more
respect than we've been given."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics aren't worried about why the Nets are fired up. They
are trying to figure out how to quit putting themselves in a major
first-half hole.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we can come back because we've done it all year," Boston
forward Antoine Walker said. "But we don't need to be doing it every
game."</TE>

<KH>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS</KH>
<HD>GAME 5 REPORT</HD>
<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAKERS 33 SACRAMENTO 27</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Back inside the Little House on the Prairie, one
wonders how great this state could be if the folks in the capital ran
things with the same gusto they cheer their beloved Kings. Of course,
working for the state might explain why the good people of this burg
feel compelled to blow off so much steam--particularly when the vile,
evil Lakers come to town. Has anyone looked into the notion that so
much blind hatred isn't good for a body? Or perhaps is it good for a
person? Just asking.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The hideously lopsided opening quarters that
plagued the Lakers during Games 3 and 4 at Staples Center. They're
more than competitive, rather than trailing by 20 points as they did
Sunday, they're actually good to start Game 5. It's a remarkable
accomplishment, one they desperately needed to maintain their
momentum from Game 4.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' 15-for-23 shooting (65.2%).</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Kings have been outscored, 113-86, in the last
four quarters including the final three Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Shaquille O'Neal 12, Kobe Bryant, Rick
Fox and Derek Fisher 6; Kings--Chris Webber 10, Doug Christie 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 3; Kings--Webber and Vlade
Divac 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 46 SACRAMENTO 51</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Any number of the awkward plays that led to fouls
against the Lakers and free throws for the Kings highlighted this
uneven quarter. The Lakers played into the Kings' hands by sitting
out on the perimeter instead of driving to the basket and, perhaps,
drawing fouls against the Kings. Sacramento seemed to get the hang of
this, pulling ahead of the Lakers by quarter's end thanks, in large
part, to an 18-6 advantage in free throws by halftime. The Kings also
got a boost from Peja Stojakovic's first appearance since spraining
his right ankle May 9. He made two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Enough minutes in this quarter from O'Neal,
who moved purposefully during the game's opening moments. He picked
up his third foul, sticking out his foot to stop Christie's drive,
and played only three minutes in the quarter. He did not score and
the Lakers lost a valuable option in their offense.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Kings won the rebounding battle in this
quarter, 11-9.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Lakers' paltry 13 points, which took away some
of that momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 9, Fox 3; Kings--Webber 6, Divac
and Mike Bibby 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Robert Horry 3, Fisher 2;
Kings--Webber 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 74 SACRAMENTO 73</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The route to the finals for the Lakers goes
through O'Neal. And O'Neal's route to the basket must result in a
thunderous dunk. Nothing else will do, apparently. O'Neal had 28
points through three quarters, 18 coming on dunks. Perhaps that's as
it should be. O'Neal, the game's strongest player, has been limited
by all manner of nagging injuries. But in this quarter, he seemed to
be as fit as he has been in the playoffs. Divac, Webber and Scot
Pollard have no chance at containment when O'Neal plays in this
manner. Things were going so well for the Lakers that Slava
Medvedenko not only got in the game, his dunk gave the Lakers the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: An answer for O'Neal in this game or this
lifetime. He's too big, too strong and his shots too varied for the
Kings to handle. If he can avoid foul trouble in the final quarter,
the Lakers will take Game 5 and have a chance to take the series
Friday in Game 6 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers' 11 free throws (making eight).</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Kings' 0-for-5 shooting at the line.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 16, Bryant 7; Kings--Bibby 8,
Webber 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 4, Fox 3; Kings--Divac 3,
Stojakovic and Webber 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS 91 SACRAMENTO 92</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: You would have to fight your way off the court in
most pickup games if you called the foul that O'Neal drew for his
sixth against a driving Bibby with 3:22 to play. Commissioner David
Stern was in the house for this one too. It appeared to be a weak
call, a potentially series-altering call, a call that should make the
league consider a fourth and perhaps a fifth referee to overrule such
officiating. Trouble here was that the referees anticipated contact
that never happened and blew their whistles prematurely. Don't e-mail
the newspaper in protest. E-mail Stern. Joe Crawford, Jack Nies and
Bill Spooner are his referees.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Bibby's poise late in the game. He accepted
a return pass from Webber, who picked off Fisher, and swished his
go-ahead jumper with 8.2 seconds to play. There was never a doubt in
his mind, never a hesitation in his step or in his stroke. It was
every bit as pure as Horry's game-winner in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Bibby's nine-for-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: O'Neal's sixth foul.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 8, Fox 7. Kings--Bibby and Webber
7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry and Walker 3. Kings--Webber 5,
Bibby and Jackson 2.</TE>

<HD>No Surprise, It's Been the Kings' Series for a While</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The game of the Lakers' season, the game of the Kings' lives....</LD>
<LD>   Mike Bibby won it with a clutch 22-footer with 8.2 seconds left,
which was only appropriate since Bibby, one of the most anonymous
Kings during the season, has single-handedly changed the equation in
this once-only-fanciful rivalry, turning his underdogs into a team
capable of playing the Lakers on equal terms here, there, anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   This is the Kings' series now, which shouldn't be surprising. It
has been for a while, since Scot Pollard drew Shaquille O'Neal's
third foul, just before halftime in Game 2.</LD>
<TE>   After that, the Lakers would lead for a grand total of 29.1
seconds in the rest of Games 2, 3 and 4. The tenth of a second, of
course represents the official time that Robert Horry's game-winner
dropped at the end of Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   The only fluke is that the series is still going. One less miracle
and the Lakers are already on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bibby emerged -- midway through the Kings' second-round
series against Dallas after Peja Stojakovic was hurt--the Kings were
a high-scoring team the Lakers had proved they could handle.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Bibby getting into the middle time after time, averaging
22 points in this series and opening up the floor, the King offense
has one more dimension than the Lakers have figured out how to
handle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just being more aggressive," said the soft-spoken Bibby.
"During the season, I had a tendency to just sit back and watch. We
have so much offensive firepower, I think that might happen
sometimes. I think I fall into that trap. I just like to watch and
see what everybody else does.... "</TE>
<TE>   Having proved they could look the monster in the eye, in his lair,
and live to tell the story, the Kings went back home and got over
their broken hearts in record time. Or as Coach Rick Adelman said
between games: "We felt we went down there and we controlled those
two games. I mean, they were chasing us all the way and now we're
home."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's game was a tactical race, revolving around O'Neal's foul
problems. O'Neal, who is totally weirded out at the thought of
getting charges on flops here, did everything but run out the door,
trying to avoid calls ... but the Kings kept running after him, and
getting bumped just enough to get the calls.</TE>
<TE>   Foul No. 1 came on a Vlade Divac drive early in the game, which
O'Neal foolishly challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Foul No. 2 came on a Chris Webber drive on which Shaq tried to
duck out of the way, but got Webber with his hip.</TE>
<TE>   On foul No. 3, O'Neal accidentally tripped Doug Christie.</TE>
<TE>   Foul No. 4 came early in the third quarter, trying to get out of
the way of a Webber drive.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow he tiptoed through the rest of the third quarter, getting
no more fouls, scoring 10 points to haul the Lakers, who had trailed
by 10, back into the game.</TE>
<TE>   However, he picked up No. 5, trying to tie up Divac on a drive
with 7:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   Then with 3:22 left, O'Neal found himself picking up Bibby,
slithering to the hoop once more, and was called for bumping him only
a tad, as Bibby went sprawling over the baseline. Nice knowing you
and thanks for coming, big guy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been our philosophy," Adelman said. "We want to make him
[O'Neal] try to play defense. It's hard to just post him up. It's
better to try to attack him with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We move the ball pretty well and we got pretty good movement
tonight. Now he's got to react to people coming at him all the time."</TE>
<TE>   There remained the matter of getting the lead back from the
Lakers, who held on tenaciously, until the Kings inbounded with 11
seconds left, Bibby came off a Webber screen and knocked down his
game-winner, as if he were Jerry West.</TE>
<TE>   On the play before, Webber had gotten the ball, looking confused
about what to do with it, and wound up having it tipped out of
bounds, which, of course, is not what superstars are supposed to do
in these situations.</TE>
<TE>   Asked later about the fact that he was the one setting the screen
for the winning shot, and Bibby was the one shooting it, Webber
bristled anew.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Webber said. "I don't care. You [reporters] can
dog me the rest of my life.... I don't care. Coach could have put on
a uniform and hit that shot and I wouldn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are about six more Kings who could hit that shot
too. That's the problem the Lakers have been wrestling with for five
games and they're running out of time to find an answer.</TE>

<LD>Lakewood High lived up to its mantra Tuesday at Cal State Fullerton,
driving in three runs with two outs in a 4-1 victory over Santa Maria
Righetti in a Southern Section Division I semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Lakewood Coach Spud O'Neil unbuttoned his jersey to
reveal a red T-shirt emblazoned with the words "Two outs ... so
what!" The Lancers have worn the shirts under their uniforms all
season.</LD>
<LD>   Bo Banach had a two-run double in the first inning and Aljay Davis
drove in a run with a two-out bloop single in the fourth. Davis also
had a sacrifice fly in the second inning</LD>
<TE>   "They had the timely hitting," Righetti Coach Scott Nickason said.
"That was huge."</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Lancers, who set a school record with their 28th
victory against five losses, will play top-seeded Camarillo in the
championship game Saturday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo swept Lakewood in a doubleheader earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood right-hander Jon Ortega (8-1) made his team's clutch
hitting stand up by throwing a two-hitter for his second complete
game.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors (21-11), who upset third-seeded Arcadia in the second
round, got their only run in the fourth inning when Ryan Demchak
scored on Pat Dolan's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood, making its first championship-game appearance since 1994
and bidding for its first title since 1987, will face a tougher
batting order in the final.</TE>
<TE>   Slugger Delmon Young is the centerpiece of a Camarillo lineup that
has no apparent weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Young is 10 for 10 against Lakewood pitching the last two years,
although he has not faced Jason Wanamaker (11-0), who will take the
mound Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good enough pitcher," Ortega said of Wanamaker. "He's
handled [Anaheim] Esperanza and [Huntington Beach] Edison, a couple
of good teams. He's proved himself this year."</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo 7, Long Beach Poly 3--Delmon Young gave up four hits
over 61/3 innings and had three hits, including a two-run home run,
and three runs scored for the Scorpions (29-4) at Cal State
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Young (5-1) struck out seven and finished a double short of the
cycle. His sixth-inning home run was his section-leading 17th.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Sutton got the last two outs for Camarillo, which will
attempt to win its first section title on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Poly finishes 22-9.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park 5, Santa Barbara 3--Ben Hanna hit a two-run homer and
scored twice for the Spartans (23-7) in a Division II semifinal game
at Santa Barbara (23-6).</TE>
<TE>   Chris Bragg scored once, drove in a run and took the mound in the
bottom of the seventh to get the game's last two outs with the tying
run at first base.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park advances to play Canyon Country Canyon, an 8-4 winner
over Mission Viejo, on Saturday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 5, Cerritos Gahr 3--Michael Beattie hit his second
home run of the game, a two-run shot in the bottom of the seventh
inning, to give Santa Margarita (17-10) a victory over Gahr (22-8) in
a Division III semifinal game at Santa Margarita High.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Hughes (8-4) scattered five hits and had four strikeouts for
Santa Margarita, which advances to play Riverside Arlington, a 2-0
winner over top-seeded Santa Ana Mater Dei, Saturday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   In the City Section playoffs:</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth 13, Woodland Hills El Camino Real 6--Jason Dominguez,
Bryan Lee and Jordan Sisson each hit home runs to power Chatsworth
(25-5) to a City Championship quarterfinal victory at El Camino Real
(25-5).</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth will play West Valley League rival Cleveland in a
semifinal Thursday at Pierce College. The Chancellors have lost three
times to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando 6, Bell 1--Miguel Gonzalez (4-1) threw a five-hitter
and had two hits and two runs batted in for host San Fernando
(16-13-1), which will play Sylmar, an 8-3 winner over Carson, in a
semifinal Thursday at Van Nuys Birmingham High.</TE>

<LD>Michelle Turner pitched her 15th shutout in her last 16 games, but
had to get out of a seventh-inning jam as La Palma Kennedy High beat
third-seeded Santa Ana Mater Dei, 2-0, Tuesday at Cypress Arnold Park
in a Southern Section Division II semifinal softball game.</LD>
<LD>   The victory sets up an all-Empire League championship this weekend
at Barber Park in Irvine. Kennedy (24-5-1) will play league runner-up
El Dorado, which got a two-hitter from Amanda Watkins to beat
Whittier California, 3-0. Mater Dei finished 26-6.</LD>
<LD>   Against Turner (23-4) in the seventh, Mater Dei loaded the bases
with no outs, but a force at home, a line drive to left field and a
ground ball to third sent Kennedy to its first title game since 1988.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy managed only three hits against Riki Paredes (10-3).
Breanne Sabol doubled and scored on a two-out error in the first
inning, and Jennifer McCard singled and scored on Brooke Porter's
grounder up the middle in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills 3, Camarillo 1--Reliever Allison Cohen (15-1) induced a
one-out, bases-loaded double-play in the fourth inning to protect a
2-1 lead, and second-seeded Dana Hills (25-7-1) advanced to the
Division I final against Etiwanda, a 2-0 winner over Corona Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   Orange El Modena 4, Laguna Hills 3--Winning pitcher Lindsay Klein
tripled, and her pinch-runner, Chelsea Golub, scored on a two-out
fielding error in the top of the 16th inning to send second-seeded El
Modena (28-5) into the Division III finals against Riverside King.</TE>
<TE>   El Modena scored twice in the 14th on a two-run single by Ariana
Munoz, but third-seeded Laguna Hills (26-5) tied it on Erica Corley's
two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran 9, Irvine Northwood 0--Maggie Davidson pitched a
two-hitter, and Tiffany Worthy hit a two-run triple for visiting
Orange Lutheran (26-6), which will play Oak Park, a 1-0 winner over
Anaheim Western, for the Division IV title.</TE>

<HD>Pacifica's Run Comes to an End</HD>
<DH>Softball: Riverside King, in only its third year, scores a
3-0 win in a Division III semifinal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the softball players at Garden Grove Pacifica High began their
season, their goals were simple:</LD>
<LD>   Win the Garden Grove League, which they did for the 11th year in a
row.</LD>
<LD>   Win a tournament; the Mariners actually won two.</LD>
<TE>   Reach the Southern Section Division III championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal wasn't even to win the finals, it was just to get
there," said Coach Rob Weil, who has guided Pacifica to section
championships in 1997, '98 and '99.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Mariners, ranked No. 1 by The Times, fell short of
their last goal on Tuesday, losing, 3-0, to fourth-seeded Riverside
King in a Division III semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Booth (18-1) pitched a five-hitter with 11 strikeouts to
lead King (26-2), which is in the finals in only its third year.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica (28-3-1) entered the season expecting to take advantage
of a powerful offense and a terrific defense--six starters batted
.328 or better and the Mariners committed only 13 errors--but
pitching, surprisingly, has played a critical role in its success.</TE>
<TE>   Brittany Weil is 22-1, a remarkable record given that the coach
wasn't expecting much from his freshman daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Kasey Carter was expected to be Pacifica's primary pitcher, but
she quit the team before school started.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Weil figured freshman Briana Santos, sophomore Crystal Vieyra
and senior Jessica Marical would split the team's innings, "... and
Brittany would throw here and there."</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly didn't feel Brittany was mentally ready for high
school softball this year," he said. "She surprised everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Including herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if I got to pitch a couple of innings, I'd be lucky,"
Brittany said.</TE>
<TE>   Her turning point came April 20, when she beat Santa Ana Foothill
and Santa Ana Mater Dei, which were then ranked Nos. 1 and 2 by The
Times, in consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "We faced quality teams and I had proven that I wasn't there just
because I was the coach's daughter," Brittany Weil said. "I felt like
I really did belong."</TE>

<HD>Replay Could Be on Way Soon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Instant replay is coming to the NBA--perhaps as soon as next season.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been talking about it for the last month," Deputy
Commissioner Russ Granik said during a visit with Commissioner David
Stern to Arco Arena for Game 5 of the Western Conference finals
between the Lakers and the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   The issue also had been raised Monday by King Coach Rick Adelman
after NBC's replays clearly showed Samaki Walker's buzzer-beater
Sunday at halftime was still in his hands when the clock showed 0.0
in the background.</LD>
<TE>   Adelman had no complaints about Robert Horry's winning
three-pointer at game's end, but replays showed the ball was out of
Horry's hands at the final buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman made the point that Horry's shot meant nothing if Walker's
had been correctly disallowed. And if NBC could show its viewers a
frame-by-frame sequence of Walker's shot, then why shouldn't the game
referees be allowed to take a peek if it meant getting the correct
ruling?</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a meeting with the competition committee next week
and it's on the agenda," Granik said. "There are a lot of
complications that have to be worked out. You realize it's not so
simple to look at just whether the shot got off on time or not, but
whether the player's foot was on the line and the referees were ready
to award a three[-point basket] and the game could go into overtime
depending on whether it's a two or a three. There are a lot of things
that have to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have a plan in effect for next season and it will be up
to the competition committee and the owners."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' inability to rebound cost them in Game 4, according to
Sacramento power forward Chris Webber. The Lakers had a 56-42
rebounding edge Sunday, including 25-8 on the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebounding was our most glaring weakness," Webber said. "We have
to hit the boards. Me, Vlade [Divac] and Scot [Pollard] have to get
to the boards. The little guys can help too, but it's up to the big
guys to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Webber put the Kings' Game 4 loss into the perspective that only a
die-hard fan could understand.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted somebody in Sacramento crying [Sunday] like I was crying
when Isiah [Thomas] passed the ball to the Celtics," Webber said,
referring to Larry Bird's steal of Thomas' inbounds pass that led to
Dennis Johnson's layup that beat Webber's beloved Detroit Pistons in
the 1987 Eastern Conference finals.</TE>

<LD>It's not Isiah and Magic, but it's sweet nonetheless.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal and Hedo Turkoglu have hugged and touched both
cheeks before the opening tip in every game of the Western Conference
finals.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a French thing," O'Neal said, laughing. "It's a Muslim
thing."</LD>
<TE>   Turkoglu, from Turkey, and O'Neal share the Muslim faith, which
they learned about each other during the past All-Star game in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Muslims respect each other," Turkoglu said Tuesday night. "It's
nice, you know. It didn't surprise me when he did it, because Muslin
people support each other."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody else touches fists, or something similar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have worked out UCLA forward Matt Barnes, among a
handful of other players in the last two weeks, according to those
familiar with the Laker draft preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford guard Casey Jacobsen, Oregon guard Freddie Jones, Duke
forward Carlos Boozer, Kentucky forward Tayshaun Prince and Notre
Dame forward Ryan Humphrey also have performed for the Lakers, who
have the 27th selection in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the time Robert Horry reached home Sunday night, he had an
estimated 75 telephone messages, all congratulating him on the shot
that ended Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite, he said, was from his father, Robert, who lives in
Columbia, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The message: "I was wondering what took them so long to find you
out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the best quotes of this series--and that's saying
something--was uttered in Tuesday's Sacramento Bee by Jerry
Westenhaver, the general manager of the Sacramento Hyatt where Kobe
Bryant ate a bad cheeseburger.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about juggling reservations in the wake of a possible
NBA Finals here, Westenhaver said, "It's gut-check time, figuring out
what you're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant would agree with the part about the gut check.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing about Samaki Walker's three-pointer at the end
of the first half Sunday in Game 4 was not that the shot apparently
was taken after the buzzer had sounded.</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing is that it went in.</TE>
<TE>   Before that shot, Walker had made one three-pointer in his
six-year career, while attempting only six.</TE>
<TE>   It was his first three-point shot in more than a year.</TE>

<DH>O'Neal fouls out, and Bryant can't answer Bibby's shot as
Kings take a 3-2 edge</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>What Robert Horry wrought, Mike Bibby leveled with the jump shot that
pushed the Lakers to the edge of elimination Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   They will play Friday night at Staples Center only for the chance
to keep playing, to continue the defense of two NBA titles they
played seven months to make three.</LD>
<LD>   With Shaquille O'Neal having fouled out and all of Arco Arena sure
it was Kobe Bryant's game to decide, Bryant missed from 18 feet as
time expired.</LD>
<TE>   The Sacramento Kings defeated the Lakers, 92-91, because Bibby's
open 22-footer, with Derek Fisher on the floor before him and 8.2
seconds remaining, was true, just as Horry's three-pointer was two
days before. And Bryant, who appeared to tire in the final
possessions, could not answer.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who lead the best-of-seven Western Conference finals,
three games to two, are a victory from their first NBA Finals in 51
years, when the franchise was based in Rochester. Game 7, if the
Lakers force it, would be here Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, King co-owner Gavin Maloof incited the crowd from
atop the scorer's table, and Vlade Divac threw kisses, and a
once-downtrodden organization was on the brink of something new too,
and perhaps not expected.</TE>
<TE>   Off an out-of-bounds play, Bibby, more than the Laker backcourt
could handle for five games, cut around a Chris Webber screen with 10
seconds left and the Kings behind, 91-90. Already he had made two
free throws that drew the Kings to within one point 35 seconds
before, and then Webber gave him the ball and blocked Fisher and
watched Bibby release the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there are a lot of people on this team who could
have taken the last shot," Bibby said. "I'm just happy to be the one
to hit it. I told Chris that if he handed the ball out to me, I was
going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are a loss from what they once--and perhaps
still--believed was unthinkable, a season that ends before June. As
this town hurled itself at a victory that gets them close,
four-quarter close, the Lakers walked glumly away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be another war on Friday," King Coach Rick Adelman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers could at least muster that, in their first elimination
game since Game 7 of the 2000 conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby scored 23 points and Webber had 29. The Kings scored the
final four points, from a 91-88 deficit, and Bryant missed his last
four shots and seven of his final eight. The Lakers again felt
shorted by the officials here, and believed Bryant, who scored 30
points on 29 shots, was fouled on the final play.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys saw the replay," Bryant said somberly. "There's no need
for me to comment on that. It's irrelevant at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's shot hit the rim, long, with less than a second left. He
turned from the right side, 18 feet away, and shot, his jersey
fluttering and Bobby Jackson's hand in his face.</TE>
<TE>   "Just went a little long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had time. From out of bounds, and from a one-point deficit,
the basketball went from Rick Fox to Robert Horry to Bryant, on the
right wing. Bryant jab-stepped and Jackson reached forward, grabbing
Bryant's jersey, which ripped from his shorts. Bryant reset and then
went up for the shot, which was flat, like a handful of others down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Just fell short for the Kobe-ster," said O'Neal, who was granted
one free-throw attempt in 32 minutes, missed it, and scored 28
points.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson dashed straight up the floor, leaped and punched the air.
The Kings hugged. Team owners loosened their ties and rejoiced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things," Adelman said. "Either he makes it or
misses it."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal spent the last 3:22 with a towel over his shoulders,
another on his lap. He made his final eight shots, and then sat after
he fouled Bibby in the lane, his sixth. The Lakers scored six points
after that, and held leads of 85-80, 87-85, 89-88 and then 91-88,
when Samaki Walker made two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson feared Bryant fatigued under the weight of last
week's illness, and 45 minutes played--none defending Bibby--and then
carrying the offense without O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt pretty good," Bryant said. "My shots were falling short.
Some looks were better than others. Would those shots fall if I was
completely healthy? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how his jersey got pulled from his shorts, Bryant
half-smiled and said, "On that last play? He pulled it out."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were incensed. They believed the game should have
concluded with Bryant at the free-throw line, shooting for the win.
They believed O'Neal should have gone to that same line more than
once.</TE>
<TE>   Not four minutes into the third quarter, O'Neal and Bryant each
had four fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson left them both in the game, and the Kings lowered their
shoulders and went to the rim. Generally, the Lakers let them go.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely got bad breaks," Horry said. "But, that's one of
the advantages of having home-court advantage. We're one game from
being eliminated. But we've been in that situation before."</TE>

<HD>Kings' Jackson Stands in the Way at Finish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Sacramento King guard Bobby Jackson stands 6 feet 1; Laker guard Kobe
Bryant is 6-7.</LD>
<LD>   Even given the inflation that invariably happens whenever the
heights and weights of professional athletes are listed, Jackson
versus Bryant rates as a mismatch of considerable proportions.</LD>
<LD>   With time running out and the Kings clinging to a one-point lead,
Jackson found himself alone on Bryant. The bench player, energetic
though he has been for the Kings, was up against perhaps the league's
best player.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson would later say he relishes such challenges, although
facing Bryant in that situation probably wasn't his ideal one-on-one
matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine being on an island by yourself with one of the best
players in the league," Jackson said. "And he's hot. And he's got 30
points."</TE>
<TE>   With a frenzied crowd poised for something dramatic, the
little-known substitute stood his ground. The superstar missed.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and the Sacramento Kings came away 92-91 winners against
Bryant and the Lakers in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals
Tuesday at Arco Arena. The Kings lead the best-of-seven series, 3-2,
and can finish the Lakers in Game 6 on Friday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 30 points; Jackson four.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant made 11 shots; Jackson two.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant did not score with Jackson hounding him after Doug Christie
fouled out with 3:14 remaining. Christie had been dogging Bryant's
heels for most of Game 5, playing him about as closely as possible,
but he went to the bench after hacking Rick Fox with the score tied,
85-85.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Rick Adelman could have turned to Hedo Turkoglu, a 6-8
small forward, to check Bryant in the closing minutes. Adelman could
have assigned Peja Stojakovic, a 6-9 swingman, to shadow Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Or Adelman could have put Mike Bibby, only 6-1, on Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   He picked Jackson instead.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant would make only one more shot, an 11-foot fallaway that
gave the Lakers an 89-88 lead with 2:09 remaining, but Jackson had
been picked off on the play.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings would take a 92-91 lead on Bibby's jump shot with 8.2
seconds remaining. The Lakers still had plenty of time to counter,
although with center Shaquille O'Neal fouled out, their options were
somewhat limited.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Lakers got the ball in Bryant's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Stationed along the right sideline, Bryant was forced far from the
basket. Jackson knew he had only one chance against Bryant and that
was to push him away from the low block.</TE>
<TE>   "Willpower," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Kings retreated, leaving Bryant and Jackson to
settle matters. Jackson reached in and punched the ball away from
Bryant, who recovered it almost immediately. Bryant then rushed a
last-second jumper toward the basket that was off target, falling
into Stojakovic's waiting hands at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted him to make a tough shot," Jackson said. "I tried to
push him out [on the perimeter]. I wanted to make sure he didn't get
the easy jumper he loves. If he had gotten in the paint, it would
have been over."</TE>
<TE>   Bravado plays a big part of Jackson's game. He is a confident
player, particularly so given his rather unremarkable NBA career.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are his third team since the Seattle SuperSonics took
him with the 23rd pick in the 1997 draft.</TE>
<TE>   "I love situations like that," he said. "I want to be on their
best offensive player. I know one guy is not going to stop anyone in
this league. You've got to bother him [Bryant]. I tried to knock the
ball loose and get a hand in his face. It was a tough shot. It almost
went in.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best defense I could have played."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Getting Picked Apart</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's go right to Sacramento's last play, Mike Bibby's winning shot,
because it shows how the Kings are handling the Lakers, beating them,
maybe even toying with them a little.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby takes the ball out of bounds, passes to Chris Webber,
follows the ball to Webber, who hands it back to him. In the handoff
process, Webber turns to a screening position and levels the pursuing
Derek Fisher. Bibby has time to set, get a good look at the basket,
square up and swish the game-winning shot.</LD>
<LD>   What's wrong with this picture?</LD>
<TE>   Why and how should a player get that open in a do-or-die
situation?</TE>
<TE>   It has happened throughout the series and says as much about the
Kings' offensive firepower and versatility as it does about the
Lakers, who have been unable or unwilling to adjust defensively.</TE>
<TE>   In this situation, and throughout the series, the Lakers are
violating what I consider to be the No. 1 rule of defending the pick.
Make the big man beat you. Don't get beat by the ball or the small
man. The fear of mismatch, the hesitancy to switch, is beating the
Lakers. The hesitation of the big man--usually Robert Horry playing
against Webber--to jump out and defend the smaller player--in this
case Bibby--is an example of the Kings' ability to exploit the
Lakers' defense. Sacramento has had a field day with handoffs and
picks that start all sorts of plays that end with medium-distance
jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   Who is hurting the Lakers more, Webber or Bibby? Just like that
last shot, Bibby is doing most of the damage. Ideally, you don't want
Horry defending Bibby, leaving Fisher to deal with Webber, but we are
five games into this series and Bibby is still shooting the most
deadly daggers.</TE>
<TE>   On the Kings' final play, did you see any Laker flying out at
Bibby? All you saw was Fisher being obliterated by the pick and Bibby
having time to set and deliver yet another bull's-eye into the
Lakers' three-peat hopes.</TE>
<TE>   I've said that Phil Jackson is a tremendous coach. I also don't
know what his defensive mind-set is or his overall philosophy, but it
does seem like it's time to try something different on that pick
play. It's time that Horry becomes willing to get beat by the big
man, because--let's face it--the Lakers are now getting beat by the
little man, shooting over them and dribbling around them.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and Rick Adelman threw another wrinkle at the Lakers
too. They had Webber and Divac set picks high and ran Bibby past both
of them, usually Webber first and then Divac. Poor Fisher. By that
time, he is so banged around and out of rhythm against Bibby that
he's got to feel like a lotto ball in the air bucket.</TE>
<TE>   I've said this before, but it still applies. Speed kills, and it
is killing the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles isn't playing Laker ball because it is playing
Sacramento's tempo. Sacramento is the best in the game at advancing
the ball after a score. Just about every other team in the NBA walks
it up after a score. These guys get it out of the net and are off to
the races. When the Lakers get caught in that, they shoot too early
in the clock and they don't swing the ball from one side to the other
on offense. The triangle goes flat and the Laker offense is one-sided
(played on the first side of the court they start on).</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings win the series, it will be unlike Jackson's
championship teams that dominated on defense. This will be a rarity,
an NBA conference title won with offense. That's the Laker challenge
now, to not let this become an offensive championship.</TE>

<LD>LeBron James has drawn his first NBA foul--and it cost the Cleveland
Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   The league fined the Cavaliers $150,000 Tuesday and suspended
Coach John Lucas for the first two games of next season for including
James, one of the nation's top high school basketball players, in a
voluntary workout for players last week at Gund Arena.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, the league said Lucas was fined for "violating
league rules prohibiting contact between NBA teams and players not
yet eligible for the NBA draft."</LD>
<TE>   James, a junior at St. Vincent-St. Mary High in Akron, Ohio, was
invited to a May 22 workout along with several local college players
and some free agents by Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   Cavalier spokesman Ed Markey declined to comment, and Lucas did
not immediately return a message seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The league's rules state, "teams may not directly or indirectly
have or engage or attempt to have or engage in any discussion,
communications or contact whatsoever with any player who has
remaining intercollegiate basketball eligibility or is otherwise
ineligible to be selected in such draft."</TE>
<TE>   At the workout, the 17-year-old James dazzled the Cavaliers and
others in attendance, soaring for several spectacular dunks and
showing why many believe he will be the first player taken in the
2003 NBA draft if he decides not to attend college.</TE>

<HD>Board Told to Reimburse Baffert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has awarded trainer Bob Baffert $102,780 in
compensation for expenses incurred during his long-running battle
with the California Horse Racing Board, Baffert's lawyer Neil Papiano
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert, the trainer of Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner War
Emblem, has a much more lucrative payday pending--a Triple Crown
sweep by the colt in the Belmont Stakes on June 8 would net $5.6
million in purse and bonus money--but Tuesday's ruling represented
yet another victory for the trainer against the racing board.</LD>
<LD>   In April, a Los Angeles judge dismissed the board's case against
Baffert, which stemmed from one of his horses testing positive for
morphine at Hollywood Park in May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   According to a CHRB spokesman, the board is appealing the April
ruling and the more recent judgment, which says that the board must
reimburse Baffert for his legal and administrative expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's horse, Nautical Look, won an allowance race at Hollywood
Park, then tested positive for the illegal drug. A second test of the
horse's urine confirmed the positive, but when Baffert asked that
blood taken from the horse be tested, he was told that the racing
board's official laboratory had thrown away the sample.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood Park, trainer Beau Greely said that Like A Hero,
winner of the Alydar Stakes there on May 23, will run in the Belmont
Stakes. Like A Hero will likely be the most lightly raced horse in
this year's field. He will be ridden by Laffit Pincay, who won the
Belmont three consecutive years in the early 1980s.</TE>

<TE>   Lawrence Phillips, a former Nebraska and Baldwin Park High
standout, is getting another chance to resume his troubled football
career--with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.</TE>
<TE>   But he still needs clearance to enter Canada because he has a
criminal record in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Alouette General Manager Jim Popp said he has reached agreement
with the 27-year-old running back. But Popp said the deal won't be
signed until Phillips receives permission from Canadian immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Kendyl Jacox, a free agent who started 16 games at center for San
Diego last season, has signed a five-year contract with the New
Orleans Saints.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Four former Notre Dame football players surrendered to authorities
in South Bend, Ind., to face charges in the gang-rape of a female

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Martin Gelinas and the Carolina Hurricanes didn't let another late
game-tying goal rattle them. And now they're making their first trip
to the Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   Gelinas, in the slot, tipped in Josef Vasicek's centering pass
8:05 into overtime Tuesday night, lifting the Hurricanes to a 2-1
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs and clinching the NHL Eastern
Conference finals in six games.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff O'Neill also scored for the Hurricanes, and Arturs Irbe
stopped 35 shots, as Carolina improved to 6-1 in overtime games this
postseason.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome was eerily similar to Carolina's 2-1 Game 2 overtime
victory, in which the Maple Leafs forced overtime on Alyn McCauley's
goal in the waning seconds.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Toronto captain Mats Sundin who provided his team
brief hope, tying the score with 21.8 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina will open the finals on the road against either Colorado
or Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Santiago Delivers for Giants in 10th</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benito Santiago hit an RBI single in the 10th inning to extend his
hitting streak to 13 games and give the San Francisco Giants a 1-0
victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday night at San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   After Mike Myers (3-2) walked Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent hit a
bouncing single to left off Bret Prinz. Santiago followed with
another single to left as the Giants won the second of a four-game
set against the defending World Series champions.</LD>
<LD>   Giant closer Robb Nen (3-0) pitched the top of the 10th for the
victory.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona starter Miguel Batista gave up only one hit through nine
innings, and Jason Schmidt gave up only three hits over nine innings
for the Giants. He struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went 0 for 2 with two walks, a day after hitting his 585th
career home run against the Diamondbacks. Bonds needs one more home
run to match Frank Robinson for fourth place on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds did make a spectacular defensive play in the ninth inning
when he made a running leap at the warning track to snag Luis
Gonzalez's fly to deep left.</TE>
<TE>   Batista left his last start--last Wednesday against the
Giants--after three innings because of a cut on his right thumb and a
blister on his forefinger. The Diamondbacks went on to win 12-5.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Pittsburgh 0--Matt Clement didn't allow a hit into the
seventh before Brian Giles singled, then settled for a two-hitter in
his first career complete game to lead the Cubs at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Clement (3-3), whose longest previous start was 81/3 innings
against the Dodgers on July 4, 2000, didn't give up anything
resembling a hit until Giles lined a clean single up the middle
leading off the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Houston 1--Albert Pujols and Eli Marrero each hit
two-run home runs in the first inning at Houston as the Cardinals
clinched the season series with the St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis was outhit, 10-5, but improved to 9-2 against Houston
with six games left between the teams in September.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, New York 3--Bobby Abreu doubled twice and drove in
two runs at New York as the Philles rallied past the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Glanville scored on Jimmy Rollins' double-play grounder in
the seventh to break a 3-3 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Florida 5--Aaron Boone homered twice, including a
solo blast with two outs in the 11th inning, to give the Reds the
victory at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Boone's homer off Vladimir Nunez (4-1) capped a back-and-forth
game that had the Reds go ahead in the top of the ninth before closer
Danny Graves blew a save in the bottom half.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Montreal 2--Andruw Jones hit a tiebreaking two-run
single in the fifth, and the ailing Braves took over first place in
the NL East for the first time this season with a victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves lost two more players when Chipper Jones fouled a ball
off his right leg and Marcus Giles sprained his right ankle trying to
avoid a tag. Jones is expected to miss two to three days. After the
game, Giles was put on the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, San Diego 2--Bobby Estalella homered with two outs in
the top of the 12th inning and the Rockies beat the Padres for their
seventh victory in eight games.</TE>

<HD>Northridge Coach Off to Fresno</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Northridge baseball Coach Mike Batesole, who led the
Matadors to the Big West Conference title this season, was hired
Tuesday as coach at Fresno State. Batesole, 38, will coach the
Matadors for the rest of the season. Northridge plays Maine in the
first round of the NCAA regionals Friday at USC's Dedeaux Field.</LD>
<LD>   Batesole is replacing Bob Bennett, who retired after 34 seasons
and 1,302 victories. Fresno State has had two coaches since 1948.
"The community and the university are really something special,"
Batesole said. "The athletic department has some momentum rolling.
The attendance is outstanding and the facilities are the best in the
West."</LD>
<LD>   Batesole, who was named Big West coach of the year, interviewed
for the opening two weeks ago. Clemson assistant Tim Corbin was also
a candidate but reportedly backed out on Friday. "I knew that this
was an opportunity for him," Northridge Athletic Director Dick Dull
said. "We've had a dialogue about this as long as five or six months
ago. He indicated to me that this was his dream job."</LD>
<TE>   Batesole is 255-156-1 in seven seasons at Northridge. In 1996, the
Matadors won 52 games, won the Western Athletic Conference title and
reached the NCAA West Regional final.</TE>
<TE>   Batesole is credited for leading the program back to its current
level after it was cut along with three other sports in June of 1997.
Those sports were reinstated a month later but many baseball players
transferred to other schools.</TE>

<HD>They Shouldn't Expect Bryant to Save the Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant sauntered into Arco Arena late Tuesday afternoon wearing
a pinstriped New York Yankee jersey, number 42, and it was perfect.</LD>
<LD>   He was Mariano Rivera, baseball's best closer.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant trudged off the court through deafening craziness
several hours later, head down, and it was perfectly awful.</LD>
<TE>   He was Mariano Rivera in the seventh game of last year's World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when the Lakers needed basketball's best finisher to
finish their most important game of the season, Bryant's shots
clanged like gopher balls off the seats.</TE>
<TE>   In the final seconds of what could be their worst loss in three
years, the absence of Bryant near Mike Bibby was as silly as a
bases-loaded walk.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers needed him most, when Bryant is at his best, the
game ended as suddenly as a flare to left field.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento Kings 92, Lakers 91.</TE>
<TE>   Blown save, Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "He has come through for us so many times ... " said Samaki
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   And the first night this spring that he didn't? This loss in Game
5 of the Western Conference finals means the Lakers now trail the
Kings three games to two, with two last gasps at maintaining a
dynasty this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   This series so filled with drama and passion has now also provided
a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   This idea that one man can continually pull one of the mightiest
teams in professional sports from the rushing rivers suddenly doesn't
seem so swift.</TE>
<TE>   When everybody knows you are getting the ball, somebody is
eventually going to stop you, even if that somebody is yourself.</TE>
<TE>   As Mariano Rivera learned against the Arizona Diamondbacks last
fall, there is a point when every human realizes their humanity.</TE>
<TE>   For Game 4 hero Robert Horry, this moment occurred midway through
the fourth quarter Tuesday, when he quite literally lost his pants.
He tried taping them to his waist, then finally donned a new pair on
the sidelines in front of everyone.</TE>
<TE>   For Bryant, this moment occurred soon thereafter, and it wasn't
nearly as funny.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we have to stop counting on just him," Walker said.
"All of us need to get to work."</TE>
<TE>   With 3:22 remaining, they behaved as if they had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal fouled out, and Bibby converted one of two free
throws to tie the score at 85-all. And Coach Phil Jackson essentially
stood up and patted his right hand.</TE>
<TE>   It was Kobe Time.</TE>
<TE>   It was Penetrate And Make The Game Winning Assist Time, as he did
in the first round against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   It was Rebound And Make The Winning Basket Time, as he did in the
second round against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "Down the stretch, they give me the ball, and I create something
for either myself or my teammates," Bryant was explaining afterward.</TE>
<TE>   But when he's still fighting the effects of an apparent food
poisoning, when he's only two days removed from requiring intravenous
fluids after a game, that creation is apparently not always so
pretty.</TE>
<TE>   His first shot after O'Neal left, he missed it.</TE>
<TE>   His second shot, he made a fallaway jumper with Hedo Turkoglu in
his face to give the Lakers a one-point lead with 2:09 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last shot he would make.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was tired," said Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   He was certainly something. Because he wasn't Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   He missed a jumper that could have given them a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   He missed a runner on the next possession that also could have
given them a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with 29 seconds left, a really good time for that
three-point lead, his driving shot was blocked by Vlade Divac.</TE>
<TE>   "Would those shots have been falling if I was completely healthy?"
Bryant said. "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the shots were short, confirming this weariness,
should provide his answer.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he was given any time to catch his breath, going from
clank to clank to the final shot in the final seconds. He took the
18-footer only after he mishandled his dribble, only after defender
Bobby Jackson appeared to tug at his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   That shot clanked too.</TE>
<TE>   The buzzer sounded and Bryant walked away after missing seven of
his last eight shots and each of his last four.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's teammates claim that Bobby Jackson fouled him on the last
play.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you think his shirt got pulled out of his pants!"
exclaimed Walker.</TE>
<TE>   But Bryant shrugged and said, "You guys saw the replay. There's no
need for me to comment on that. It's irrelevant at this point."</TE>
<TE>   What's not irrelevant is why Bryant, who brilliantly stopped Bibby
in the second half in Game 4, was not guarding him in the final
moments on Tuesday, when Bibby bounced off a pick and hit the
game-winning 22-footer as Derek Fisher was swallowed up by Chris
Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jackson, who never had Bryant guarding Bibby during the game:
"[Kobe] said, 'I don't feel quite comfortable picking him up at this
time and not being used to his move,'" Jackson said. "I think it was
a decision he wanted to make, and I concurred with him."</TE>
<TE>   Anybody who knows the competitive Bryant knows that would be a
strange decision indeed. Yes, in the end, he had five fouls, but
still ...</TE>
<TE>   "You know I wouldn't use those exact words," Bryant said when
informed of Jackson's quote. "That's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   They have three days to figure it out, and not a moment more.</TE>

<LD>These people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   CAROL SPENCER, signed, "with hatred and arrogance": "You are a
bourgeoisie elitist. If that isn't in L.A.'s dictionary, I'll have a
Sacramento school send you one."</LD>
<LD>   I want you to know I love both hollandaise and bourgeoisie sauce.</LD>
<TE>   H. Vu: "Where do you find the cows you keep talking about in
Sacramento? Except for the fake ones, and a few kept at UC Davis for
research purposes, I haven't run into too many in my 20-odd years of
living in Sacramento. You will have to introduce me to one the next
time you are in town."</TE>
<TE>   Get your own date.</TE>
<TE>   SHERWOOD STERLING: "You made fun of it the other day, but those of
us named 'Sherwood' would like to think that our golfing companions
are not offended by our first name."</TE>
<TE>   Think whatever you want.</TE>
<TE>   ROB HAROL: "You are not unlike a fungus with your ability to grow
on people and all."</TE>
<TE>   That's the nicest e-mail I've ever gotten.</TE>
<TE>   DAVID R. STERN: "Remember what happened to Frasier Crane when
"Cheers" ended and he moved to Seattle. The same success can happen
to Ryan Leaf."</TE>
<TE>   I agree. I think he'll make a great radio talk-show host.</TE>
<TE>   JEFF ROSE: "Your avoidance of interesting or real topics is
stunning. It's amazing you can write so many words and have so few of
them worth reading. You confuse sarcasm for humor, and what I am
reminded of is a Grinch: your heart has shrunk to the size of a pea,
a pea left in the hot baking sun for a record-hot summer. And your
character has dried up with it. You sir, have, like Luke Skywalker's
father, succumbed to the dark side, and, like all who go there and
cannot return, it will hurt you more than it hurts us."</TE>
<TE>   Say hello to Nurse Ratched for me when she tucks you in tonight.</TE>
<TE>   FEFEREINA: "Dear Mr. Personality Plus, how well do you swing a
bat? Oh, you're big with the words, but I'm sure your baseball skills
are totally in the minus category. Darin Erstad takes after our great
leader, Tom Osborne, of Nebraska fame."</TE>
<TE>   Was he the guy giving the "steal" sign to all those football
players?</TE>
<TE>   HOWIE HENDLER: "You continually put down Kevin Brown because you
say he doesn't have the arm of a marquee pitcher. I don't ever
remember seeing you on a major league roster. Probably because there
is enough flab on those arms of yours that you can't pick a baseball
up."</TE>
<TE>   Nope, not enough steroids.</TE>
<TE>   PP MORALES22: "Let me guess, your favorite team is the Dodgers.
You're just an Angel hater. Idiot! Why would you write about the
Angels being dull?"</TE>
<TE>   Because my favorite team is the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   BRENT MANSON: "I live in Bloomington, Ill., which is in Bulls'
country, so it is hard to get a friend to watch the Lakers' game with
me. I don't know if you missed it, but Mike Bibby had time to clip

<HD>Caminiti Admits Using Steroids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Players privately joke about baseball's growing steroid problem, so
they weren't surprised to learn Tuesday that another former star had
gone public about his onetime secret that's now getting regular
exposure.</LD>
<LD>   In a Sports Illustrated report on steroids in baseball, Ken
Caminiti, following the lead of Jose Canseco, said that there's
rampant steroid use in the major leagues, revealing that he won the
1996 National League most-valuable-player award while on the
muscle-building substance.</LD>
<LD>   A recovering alcoholic and former drug user who has retired after
15 seasons in the big leagues, he said, "At least half the guys are
using steroids," which helped him bat a career-high .326 with 40 home
runs and 130 runs batted in for the San Diego Padres in '96.</LD>
<TE>   Canseco, also retired from baseball, estimated that 85% of major
leaguers use steroids, saying he planned to write a book about drug
users in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Players were waiting for another shoe to drop, and they figure
things are only getting started.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been around for a long time, it's definitely out there,
and guys talk about it," said Milwaukee Brewer first baseman Richie
Sexson, who hit 45 homers last season and said he does not use
steroids. "As a player, if you've been around the game long enough
and you know people, you know what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   "When guys, all of a sudden, get to be the size that some guys are
now, you know that something's a little bit different. Like I said,
because you know what's out there, this really isn't surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Anabolic steroids, which are illegal in the United States unless
prescribed by a physician for medical reasons, increase muscle mass
by elevating the body's testosterone. Heart and liver damage are
among the possible side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the NFL and NBA, which prohibit steroids, Major League
Baseball and the NHL do not test for them. Banning steroids in
baseball could not occur without the approval of the players'
association.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome drug testing for me at any time," said first baseman
Eric Karros, whose 261 homers are the most in Los Angeles franchise
history. "I've never done anything, but I'm the only person I can
comment on.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak about other people, nor would I feel it was right
to speak about them. If somebody wanted to use it, that's their own
decision, and I would not be surprised if I found out that other
players used it. It would not be shocking to me."</TE>
<TE>   Karros said the reason players turn to steroids is simple: money.</TE>
<TE>   "That probably has a lot do with it," he said. "If I were in a
situation where it meant making a team or not making a team, and
fortunately I've never been put in that position, but maybe that's
why somebody does it. Or maybe they feel like that's what makes them
a great player, or it becomes a crutch or something."</TE>
<TE>   Active players who said they do not use steroids say they have
mixed feelings about those who do.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to do what you've got to do," said catcher Paul Lo
Duca, who said he would not oppose being tested for steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're battling for a job, and the guy you're battling with is
using steroids, then maybe you say, 'Hey, to compete, I need to use
steroids because he's using them.' Maybe you feel that's the only way
to compete with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong, I don't condone it, but it's a very tough
situation. It's really all about survival for some guys."</TE>
<TE>   And players are aware of the long-term medical risks.</TE>
<TE>   "If guys want to do that and take five or 10 years, or whatever it
takes off your life, to secure their family's future, then that's
what they choose to do," Sexson said.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's definitely a health issue."</TE>

<HD>Padres' Farm Teams Tested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Padres began random steroid testing of their minor
league players in 1997, but that was inspired by concerns of abuse by
young players in the farm system, not by abuse by the team's 1996
National League MVP, Ken Caminiti, a team official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I had gotten wind that some of our minor leaguers were using; I
knew they were," said Priscilla Oppenheimer, the Padres' director of
minor league operations who called for the tests. "Everybody had
suspicions that certain [major leaguers] were using, but that was not
the reason for our decision. Not Caminiti. Not at all."</LD>
<LD>   According to Oppenheimer, the team didn't know Caminiti was using
steroids.</LD>
<TE>   Oppenheimer said the Padres had six positive results in 1997 among
players who had played the previous season with the Class-A Rancho
Cucamonga Quakes, the team she most suspected of steroid abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball mandates random testing of minor leaguers,
but teams such as the Padres and Houston Astros use additional
testing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our perspective is to test so we can educate," Tim Purpura, Astro
assistant general manager said.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres randomly test 26 of their 180 minor leaguers during
spring training, then test seven or eight on each of their minor
league affiliates twice during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We catch about three players a year," Oppenheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that after a first violation, the player sees a doctor,
who warns about the consequences of steroid use. No Padre minor
leaguer has tested positive twice, she added.</TE>

<HD>Sprint for the Finish</HD>
<DH>Measuring Williams' Growth Goes Beyond Her Accomplishments
on Track</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her rare idle moments, USC sprinter Angela Williams sometimes
wonders whether she has been running in place all this time.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the spectacular 100-meter time of 11.04 seconds she
clocked as a freshman will be her crowning achievement, even though
she's poised this week to become the first athlete to win four NCAA
100-meter dash titles.</LD>
<LD>   And whether her times, either at the NCAA championships starting
today in Baton Rouge, La., or later, will reflect her nurturing of a
talent she sees as a sacred trust.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't beaten it yet," she said of her school-record time, "so
it upsets me, because every year you want to think of yourself as
improving. And I sit and ask myself, 'Am I improving or am I going
stagnant?'"</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the clock says, Williams--who will run the 100, 200
and the 400-meter relay at Baton Rouge--has grown in many ways.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of what she's brought to the program, you get an Angela
Williams probably once in a coaching career," said Ron Allice, USC's
director of track and field. "Certainly, she's the greatest sprinter
in the history of women's track and field at USC, and maybe one of
the better sprinters ever, in terms of her accomplishments, whether
male or female, collegiately."</TE>
<TE>   Better times will come, she believes, when she finishes school and
can focus on what she sees as her purpose in life: to run fast and
joyously and be a positive role model.</TE>
<TE>   "You hit that peak, and to work beyond it is difficult," said
Williams, whose wind-aided 10.98 as a junior at Chino High was the
first sub-11 second clocking for a high school girl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take small things now, and it's hard to focus on
small things when you have to run the 4 by 100, the 100, the 200 and
sometimes the 4 by 400. I get stretched wide all across the track. A
lot of times I get tired, and when it's time to run the 100 I'm
thinking about the rest of the load I have."</TE>
<TE>   That load has been increased by misfortune at major events.</TE>
<TE>   A torn hamstring ended her chances of making the 1996 U.S. Olympic
team, and flu kept her off the 2000 team. She finished third in the
100 at last year's U.S. championships but was eliminated in the
semifinals of the 100 at the world championships. When she was taken
off the 400-meter relay team after running two rounds at the world
meet, her faith was tested--but not broken.</TE>
<TE>   Those disappointments "just dragged me down in the dirt. But that
made me stronger," she said. "It's something I'll never forget,
because I know it's all about business when you move to that level.
To me, it's all fun and games, but I learned when I get around those
people I have to be prepared for all things, and I wasn't, being the
younger one on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I went back home and thought about it and said, 'I'm just going
to run so fast that I can't be ignored.'"</TE>
<TE>   This year, for the first time, she took weight-room workouts
seriously, and she was rewarded. She won the NCAA 60-meter indoor
title and won the 100 at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays April 21
in 11.06 seconds, among the world's top six times this season. She
also won her second Pacific 10 Conference 100-meter title, in 11.42
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I would normally run effortlessly but it is just truly effortless
now," said Williams, a winner of the Honda Award for track and field.</TE>
<TE>   She first felt that ease when she was 9 and began to run in
organized programs. Her mother, Pamela, is a runner, as is her
father, Johnny, a youth track coach. But even they didn't realize she
was extraordinary until observers told them she had potential to be
an elite athlete. Her parents promptly sat her down and told her to
appreciate her gift, a lesson she hasn't forgotten. Her track
scholarship is one of her most precious prizes, because she otherwise
couldn't have afforded USC.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people with talent, but some of them don't make
it because no one ever explains to them what they can do with that
talent," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her talent was affirmed again when she was 12 and Florence
Griffith Joyner called her family to offer encouragement and offer to
make her a track uniform to wear at a photo shoot. Williams admired
Griffith Joyner, a triple gold medalist at the 1988 Summer Olympics,
but she wasn't awestruck.</TE>
<TE>   "I hung up on her," Williams said, laughing. "I didn't know who
she was. I was watching TV. I could care less. I was like, 'OK,
right. Yeah.' She called back and asked to speak to my dad. He came
back in the room and said, 'Do you know what you just did? You know
who that was?'</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been a person to really admire other people. I think
it's because I had the gift since I was young that I feel no one is
better than anybody else. We all have gifts."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith Joyner told Williams she hoped the youngster would break
her records, and they had a cordial relationship until Griffith
Joyner's death in 1998. The next great U.S. female sprinter, Marion
Jones, has also touted Williams as the hope of the future. "I think
what's happening now is I'm being accepted," Williams said.
"Regardless of whether they were going to accept me or not, I was
coming anyway."</TE>
<TE>   But will that faster 100 time come too?</TE>
<TE>   Williams expects the NCAA 100 champion will have to run 11 seconds
or faster. Allice believes she's capable of it, conditions
permitting. "She rises to the occasion based on the level of
competition," Allice said. "She runs just as fast as she needs to, to
be successful.... She doesn't put the hammer down until it's the big
one."</TE>
<TE>   This is a big one.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the significance of winning the fourth one because
it's something that will last the rest of my life," Williams said. "I
want to go down in history for doing good things.... When I run, it's
to change lives, to let other people know they have a future and they
have to prepare themselves for whatever is coming and always be
positive."</TE>

<HD>It Rains on Henin's Parade</HD>
<DH>Tennis: The fifth-seeded player is ousted from the French
Open by Hungarian Aniko Kapros, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Didn't we always know that the traveling circus was the perfect
training ground for the tennis tour?</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the circus may be a bit more normal.</LD>
<LD>   Hungarian Aniko Kapros, 18, spent her childhood watching her
parents, Attila and Aniko, perform around the world in a traveling
circus.</LD>
<TE>   "They were artists," she said. "It's hard to explain. They have
this board in the middle of the stage and my mom flips and my dad
catches her. That's mainly it."</TE>
<TE>   So, for years, she watched her parents flip. Then Tuesday, Kapros
returned the favor, so to speak, turning the French Open upside down
with one of the biggest upsets in recent years. On a rainy day in
Paris--there were four weather-caused delays--the 179th-ranked
qualifier defeated fifth-seeded Justine Henin of Belgium in the first
round, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Henin, a semifinalist here last year, was in obvious physical
discomfort, suffering from a sinus condition and an injured left
thigh. In hindsight, she said she should not have played."Everybody
warned me, I must say," she said. "I decided to play just the same.
It's a mistake. I suppose this is not a mistake I will repeat."</TE>
<TE>   This went beyond the usual disappointment. Henin had been viewed
as a favorite here, particularly after her two terrific clay-court
finals against Serena Williams earlier this month. They split those
matches and most figured they would meet again in the French Open
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I feel awful, beyond frustration," Henin said. "I feel
physically awful. I have great difficulties even thinking that I lost
in the first round here in the French Open. I'm very disappointed. I
haven't been able to fend for myself. I was expecting more from
myself, but this is not the end of my career."</TE>
<TE>   The weather didn't help. Thirty-four matches were postponed until
today, among them the first-round meeting of defending champion and
top-seeded Jennifer Capriati and Marissa Irvin of Santa Monica. They
started play on the main show court but when rain stopped them, their
match was moved to Court 2 at 8:20 tonight, a curious scheduling
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati led, 4-0, before Irvin got on track and cut the deficit
to 4-2. Irvin had five break points to pull within a game when rain
stopped the match and it was eventually suspended because of
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian Kim Clijsters, a finalist here last year, survived a
spirited challenge and her shaky play, defeating Tatiana Poutchek of
Belarus, 3-6, 6-3, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   In a men's upset, Hicham Arazi of Morocco defeated No. 8 Roger
Federer of Switzerland, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Federer had been viewed as one
of the top contenders after winning recently in Hamburg, Germany.
Arazi has not played particularly well in 2002 but has twice reached
the quarterfinals in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions helped Arazi, Federer said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not suited for my game, obviously," he added. "I've
never experienced anything like it, raining consistently for over
21/2 sets. If it rains really [hard], we can stop. But it was just
raining enough, so we could keep playing. That was a little bit
unlucky."</TE>
<TE>   The first rain delay provided a significant assist to the
three-time women's champion, No. 6 Monica Seles, who was in danger of
elimination against clay-court specialist Angeles Montolio of Spain.
Montolio took the first five games and led, 7-6 (4), 3-3, as Seles
struggled. After the interruption, Seles looked like a new player,
leaning into her shots with more force and won the final nine games,
taking the first-round match, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, all the rain delays couldn't put the feverish Henin
back together again.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Kapros, the Australian Open junior champion in 2000,
couldn't stop smiling as she talked about growing up in the Bahamas,
the circus life and her mother's bronze medal in gymnastics at the
1972 Olympics in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   There is something to be said about a teenager who rattles off her
weight--143 pounds--when asked and acknowledges that her serve is,
well, essentially a liability.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty bad," she said, laughing. "My serve sometimes depends a
lot if I'm nervous. I served really bad today. It was surprising to
win games on my serve.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it wasn't a hard serve. Maybe it even surprised her. It
was a soft serve. You have to get used to it, that if you get a soft
serve, you have to hit it in. She really didn't."</TE>

<TE>   Barbara Schwartz of Austria, who essentially beat the U.S.
single-handedly in Fed Cup play in April, lost in the first round
after suffering an injury in the third set against qualifier Maria
Goloviznina of Russia, who led, 2-6, 7-5, 5-2, when Schwartz had to
quit..... Seles was asked about captain Billie Jean King's dropping
Capriati from the Fed Cup team last month. Seles had supported King
at Fed Cup and had spoken out again at an event in New York,
apparently irritating the U.S. Tennis Assn. "They asked me not to
talk about it, so I have to respect the USTA's wishes on that
matter," Seles said.... Lindsay Davenport said recently that she
intends to support King by playing in the Fed Cup this summer against
Israel.</TE>

<DH>The much-anticipated quadrennial soccer event is at hand,
meaning the world will be watching--at all hours of the clock</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The English have a word for it: "skiving." Loosely defined, it is the
act of avoiding serious activity--shirking work, skipping an
assignment, calling in sick.</LD>
<LD>   During the month of June, as England's national soccer team
pursues the World Cup in a land and a time zone far, far away,
skiving will become England's national pastime.</LD>
<LD>   With an eight-hour time difference separating England from Japan,
matches played at 3:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. in the Far East will start
at 7:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. in England. This presents a dilemma for
English businesses, as evidenced by a recent Barclaycard survey that
estimated that 40% of the nation's soccer fans will be skiving off
work in order to watch England and Ireland matches.</LD>
<TE>   The survey also estimated that such wide-scale skiving will cost
the England economy as much as 3.2 billion pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Umbro, the English sporting goods company that manufactures the
national team's uniforms, is encouraging the burgeoning army of
truants with a wink and nudge, offering fans a "bunk-off" Web site
that includes a very proper-looking doctor's sick note that can be
printed, filled out and handed to the boss.</TE>
<TE>   The word is out, and with the World Cup set to open Friday,
employers across the country have made preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Peterborough.net, a U.K. business Web site, offers the following
advice for British companies and corporations:</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the matches take place in the morning U.K. time. Firms
should be aware of this, particularly on the 7th June, when England
play Argentina. This match takes place at 12:30 p.m. U.K. time, and
there is the possibility, however slight, that employees may try to
call in sick on that day, or simply not turn up for work, so they can
watch the match at home on television."</TE>
<TE>   Fashioning a World Cup game plan, the site suggested that
employers allow their staff to start their shifts later during the
World Cup and either work later or make up the time after the
tournament. It also advised allowing employees extended lunch breaks
or bringing a big-screen television into the office.</TE>
<TE>   "If you choose this option," the site cautioned, "bear in mind
that with breaks etc., the game could stretch more than two hours."</TE>
<TE>   England's first match, against Sweden, is Sunday, kicking off at
10:30 a.m. U.K. time. The Church of England, realizing that soccer is
a religion unto itself, sent an e-mail to dioceses throughout the
country advising they arrange to televise the game for parishioners
and also approved changing the time of services.</TE>
<TE>   So St. James' Church in Clerkenwell, London, will screen the game
and cut short its customary Sunday services to make way for St.
Michael Owen. The church also will allow parishioners to bring their
own beer.</TE>
<TE>   "It is part of our way to show Christians are not complete weirdos
who sit in the monastery and never have any fun," vicar Andrew
Baughen told National Public Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking, swearing and verbal abuse of the opposition will not be
allowed, however, according to the vicar.</TE>
<TE>   Churches in England will be competing for attendance with pubs and
restaurants, which have been granted permission by the High Court to
open and begin selling alcohol at 7 a.m. during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a petition by a Bristol pub owner challenging the
country's existing laws that pubs not serve alcohol until the
afternoon, Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, ruled in April that
"If one were to ask anyone today whether the World Cup was a national
special event, I apprehend that the reaction would be immediate, that
it was such an event. The customers are going to the public house ...
to take part in a collective enjoyment of the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Spectators can obtain the satisfaction of being involved as
collective participants in what is happening many thousands of miles
away."</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 miles away, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   So far away that in March, a group of soccer fans in Ireland
circulated a petition urging Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to move
clocks forward by nine hours during the World Cup so that Ireland
would be on Japan time.</TE>
<TE>   The Give Us Back Our World Cup campaign collected more than 5,000
signatures calling for the time change, which, if enacted, would have
had Irish workers punching time clocks at 4 in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's a whole lot to ask," Irish Times
sportswriter Mary Hannigan said on NPR. "It's only a month."</TE>
<TE>   Getting up for a 7:30 a.m. kickoff, Hannigan said, "is just an
unreasonable time, really, for Irish soccer fans to get up and watch
their football. See, there's a tradition here. We go to the pub, and
we all gather maybe two hours before kickoff. We all drink a few
pints of Guinness or whatever's on offer. We all get happy and merry
and get ready for the big game.</TE>
<TE>   "It kicks off maybe normally 8 in the evening or 9. We win, then
we celebrate wildly till about 3 in the morning. So 7:30 [a.m.]
kickoffs in the morning are just not natural."</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the Irish government did not take the petition seriously.
So fans of the Irish team will have to drink their beer for
breakfast, drowning their sorrows before noon. And with Ireland
taking on Germany and Cameroon without captain Roy Keane, who was
booted off the team for insubordination last week, that could mean
record amounts of beer consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, in Los Angeles, World Cup games will kick off at 10:30
p.m., 11:30 p.m., 2 a.m., 2:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC
will televise all of the tournament's 64 matches--57 live, including
the final, set to start at 3:30 a.m. June 30. The networks will also
rebroadcast certain games of interest, such as England-Argentina and
every U.S. match, at a more reasonable hour--late morning or noon.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. first-round television schedule:</TE>
<TE>   June 5 versus Portugal: Live at 2 a.m. on ESPN2, re-aired at noon
by ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   June 9 versus South Korea: Live at 11:30 p.m. on ESPN2, re-aired
the next morning at 11 by ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   June 14 versus Poland: Live at 4:30 a.m. ESPN, re-aired at 11 a.m.
by ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Donnelly, media relations director for the Galaxy, is an
ardent soccer enthusiast who believes for the World Cup to be
experienced correctly, it must be experienced live.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely watching the games live," he said. "I'll have to
change my sleeping patterns, maybe come home from work, go to bed at
5:30 [p.m.] and get up at 2 a.m. I'm ready to make that commitment.
It's only once every four years."</TE>
<TE>   Some fans are conquering the time gap by narrowing it. Many are
booking vacation trips to Malaysia and Thailand during the World Cup,
where the time difference with Japan and Korea is only one or two
hours. Hotel operators in Thailand report bookings are up 10% from
last June.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the unusual case of Andy Nicholson, a soccer fan
living in Sheffield, England, who is taking unpaid leave to drive a
van 14,500 miles to see World Cup. His trip, which began in
mid-April, will take him six weeks through 10 countries, two sea
crossings and more than $24,000.</TE>
<TE>   "People are bound to think I'm mad," Nicholson told London's the
Mirror before embarking on his journey, "but if I break down, that
will just add to the whole challenge. It promises to be a real
adventure. And it is an ideal opportunity to travel halfway around
the world and see some amazing games at the end of it. It is the
adventure of a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   That's the thing about World Cup fever. Once it strikes, people
are driven to the strangest extremes.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Soon, the debacle of 1998 will no longer matter. Three weeks from
now, the United States team's woeful performance in the France '98
World Cup will have ceased to be an issue.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, fans might well be talking about the debacle of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Four years have passed, new players have emerged, a new coach has
revitalized the team and more than a few results have gone the
Americans' way, but all that does not mean that the U.S. will do any
better this time around.</LD>
<TE>   Portugal, South Korea and Poland could turn out to be just as
difficult a series of opponents as Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia were
in 1998, when the U.S. team lost all three of its first-round games,
the players got into an ugly brouhaha with then-coach Steve Sampson
and American soccer was left with a black eye.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing 32nd in a 32-team tournament does not cut it on the U.S.
sporting landscape. The television cameras vanish and the losers are
left to slink off into the bushes and lick their wounds in anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, such thoughts are far from the minds of
Coach Bruce Arena and his players. All is sweetness and light in the
U.S. camp, where the mood is upbeat and confidence is high.</TE>
<TE>   The scars have healed. Even though 10 of Arena's 23 players are
holdovers from 1998, time has worn away the rough edges of that
unpleasant experience, when a 2-0 loss, a 2-1 loss and a 1-0 loss
sent the team home in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a much different attitude now," said striker Brian McBride,
whose goal against Iran was the only one the U.S. scored in France.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people bring up 1998 way too much.... There just wasn't
complete harmony.... I don't think the players had the right
attitude, or the coaches."</TE>
<TE>   McBride acknowledges that the results in 2002 might not be much
different, but accepts that as the way things are.</TE>
<TE>   "If we play our best soccer and don't get positive results, we
have to be happy with that," he said. "It's not our goal, but soccer
is a weird game. Sometimes you have a great game, you play well as a
team, and you don't win. You just have to be focused on the right
things."</TE>
<TE>   One area of focus for Arena has been the relationships among the
players, making sure the mix is right and that there are no
malcontents lingering in the corners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think team chemistry is quite a bit better [than in 1998],"
defender Eddie Pope said before the team left for South Korea. "There
are quite a few more smiling faces walking around right now."</TE>
<TE>   Here, however, many of the smiling faces are Portuguese. Portugal
is an overwhelming favorite to win the opener against the U.S. in
Suwon a week from today. After that, South Korea will have 62,000 of
its own fans on hand in Daegu to give it a boost in the Americans'
second game on June 10. Closing the first round against physically
strong Poland, which might only need a tie at that point, is not
going to be any picnic either on June 14 in Daejeon.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, though, the Americans are concentrating on Portugal and
how to stop its impressive list of highly paid players.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Jeff Agoos believes teamwork will make up for any
deficiencies in star quality.</TE>
<TE>   "When you compare us to teams like Portugal, we may not match up
against them individually," he said. "But we can be a better team
than the teams we are playing against, and that's what can make the
difference for us."</TE>
<TE>   Arena has drummed that point home for four years.</TE>
<TE>   When asked in a recent on-line interview about what happened in
France, he said only those who were there and took part will ever
know the full story but that "obviously, there were things that went
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   As Arena pointed out, however, it wasn't the end of the road.
Failure in France didn't undo all the work that had preceded that
World Cup, just as the U.S. performance in Korea/Japan '02 will not
undo the work of the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't fall off the face of the Earth," Arena said. "That's
why we're still around.... I think it would be tremendous if we could
move forward into the second round. If we don't, and we still show
well and show improvement, it'll be positive for the sport in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   He meant the U.S., not South Korea.</TE>

<LD>GOALKEEPERS--Small, fleet and unpredictable, 29-year old Oscar Perez
is a younger model of Jorge Campos, now a 35-year-old veteran
experiencing his third World Cup as a bench observer. Oswaldo Sanchez
of Guadalajara is Coach Javier Aguirre's probable No. 2 keeper.</LD>
<LD>   DEFENDERS--The loss of Claudio Suarez to a broken leg in April was
initially seen as devastating, but Rafael Marquez has stepped up as a
calm, skilled organizer in central defense. He and Cuauhtemoc Blanco
are Mexico's key players during this World Cup. Marquez will be
flanked by Melvin Brown on the left and Manuel Vidrio on the right.
It's a solid enough group for CONCACAF competition, but it will need
to be better than that against the likes of Italy and Croatia.</LD>
<LD>   MIDFIELDERS--The loss of Jesus Arellano to a two-game suspension
cost Mexico its only true playmaking midfielder. Subsequently,
Aguirre has stocked his five-man midfield with hard-working,
hard-tackling types in hope of closing down the opposition and
counterattacking with long, quick feeds to Blanco and Francisco
Palencia. Many Mexican fans were displeased with the selection of
Gabriel Caballero, but he is one of the few attacking options in
midfield. Stamina is a concern for 35-year-old Alberto Garcia Aspe.</LD>
<TE>   FORWARDS--Blanco and Palencia have benefited from playing overseas
and have formed a capable partnership. Both, along with Jared
Borgetti, can find the back of the net. Getting them the ball is the
issue. Luis Hernandez had an outstanding World Cup in 1998, but age
has caught up with him, as Galaxy fans well know. He is Mexico's
all-time scoring leader with 33 goals, but here, at 33, he is a bench
player.</TE>

<HD>HOW THEY'LL LINE UP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GOALKEEPER--As Coach Bruce Arena has said time and again, there is
nothing to choose between Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel and that is
why he will wait until the last minute to name his starter. He has
even hinted at playing both during the first round. Tony Meola
provides the depth. The U.S. is in good shape in the nets.</LD>
<LD>   DEFENDERS--The starting back line will likely feature Tony Sanneh
and David Regis at the corners, and neither inspires confidence.
Quicker, more agile players have exposed the vulnerability of the
U.S. outside backs, but Arena has few options. Steve Cherundolo, or
more likely Frankie Hejduk, can fill in at right back, but the
improvement is slight. Jeff Agoos can slide over to play left back,
but that leaves the middle with a problem</LD>
<LD>   MIDFIELDERS--The loss of Chris Armas to injury was a huge blow.
Pablo Mastroeni could fill the defensive midfield role well, as could
John O'Brien or even Claudio Reyna, but that detracts from the latter
pair's offensive abilities. Earnie Stewart will be wide right and
offers pace and a decent shot. Cobi Jones is his backup. On the left,
Arena might surprise everyone and start DaMarcus Beasley ahead of
Eddie Lewis..</LD>
<TE>   FORWARDS--The starting duo will be Brian McBride and Clint Mathis.
The former has slipped in form recently, not surprising considering
his numerous injuries, and the latter might be burdened by increasing
expectations in light of the publicity he has received. That leaves
Joe-Max Moore, in fine form, and Josh Wolff, whose speed will be
needed, to come off the bench and rescue the starters. Statistic to
dwell upon: The U.S. has not scored more than two goals in a World
Cup since 1950.</TE>

Best finish: Champion in 1978, 1986
1998 showing: Eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals
Coach: Marcelo Bielsa. Is he the crazed obsessive who justifies the
nickname "El Loco" or a wizard who has outfoxed the world with his
unorthodox 3-3-1-3 formation? Argentina will have an answer as soon
as the whistle blows on the June 30 World Cup final
Players to watch: Gabriel Batistuta, Hernan Crespo, Juan Sebastian
Veron, Claudio Lopez, Ariel Ortega, Javier Zanetti
In brief: Along with France, the most talented team in the
tournament. So much talent, in fact, that Batistuta, one of the
world's best strikers, might not be able to crack the starting
lineup. Too many skilled players and not enough positions have
scuttled Argentina more than once in previous Cups

Coach: Robert Waseige. Underwent quadruple bypass surgery during

of reliable goal scorers. As evidenced by Belgium's recent 2-1
victory over France at Paris, has a knack for squeezing a lot out of

Players to watch: Marc Wilmots, Gert Verheyen, Wesley Sonck
In brief: Belgium is the only country to have qualified for the last
six World Cups without hosting or having won the tournament. Like
goal posts and grass fields, the Belgians are always there--and
usually just as exciting
Quick quote: "We don't have superstars. There's no Beckham or Owen.
We all need each other."--Waseige
Forecast: Should they win the weakest group in the tournament, the

<HD>Brazil No Longer So Beautiful</HD>
<DH>Group C: Once beloved for its technique and style, the
Brazilian game has given way to a foul-and-stall defensive approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>So Brazil has qualified again for the World Cup, extending its
unequaled streak of perfect attendance to 17 tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   Says who?</LD>
<LD>   The yellow jerseys look familiar. The players still come equipped
with optional surnames. But if Brazilian soccer once meant something
to the rest of the world--peerless finesse and technique, a style as
easy on the eyes as it is tough to defend--this cannot possibly be
Brazil.</LD>
<TE>   A Brazil that lost six times in 18 qualification games and
finished tied for third with Paraguay, one point behind Ecuador?</TE>
<TE>   A Brazil that went through three coaches in 10 months and more
than 60 players before qualifying on the very last day?</TE>
<TE>   A Brazil that abandoned its famed jogo bonito--the beautiful
game--in favor of a cynical, foul-and-stall defensive approach local
media have derisively nicknamed futbol brucutu--bullyboy football?</TE>
<TE>   The homeland of Pele and Garrincha today harbors the most brutish
domestic league in the world, racking up an average of more than 60
fouls a game. The national team, once revered for its artistry and
innovation, is now captained by a defensive midfielder named Emerson
Ferreira, a red card waiting to happen who specializes in hard fouls
and crunching tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Luiz Felipe Scolari, the current coach, often plays with five
defenders behind a pair of holding midfielders, encouraging his
players to "kill the play"--foul someone to stop the action--and
waste time whenever possible.</TE>
<TE>   This is Brazil?</TE>
<TE>   Not to such aghast alumni as Zico, who watched the team lose to
the likes of Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile during qualifying and
complained, "Even worse than playing badly is seeing the team play
without creativity and daring, which have always been the strong
point of Brazilian football."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing really has been the same since Brazil meekly surrendered
the World Cup to France in the 1998 final, 3-0. That day, Ronaldo,
the 21-year-old curator of the Pele legacy, morphed from myth to
missing in action, seeming to sleep-walk through the match after
suffering from (depending on which report you read) an anxiety attack
or an epileptic seizure or a nervous breakdown or a severe case of
rookie big-game jitters.</TE>
<TE>   From that day forward, Brazilian soccer has steadily backslid, a
slump that coincided with Ronaldo's literal disappearance from the
field for nearly three years because of knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Brazil was eliminated by Cameroon at the Olympics, which
cost coach Wanderley Luxemburgo his job. Luxemburgo's replacement,
Emerson Leao, lasted only nine months. Leao oversaw a Brazilian team
that lost to Australia, 1-0, and played Japan and Canada to scoreless
draws in the 2001 Confederations Cup--and learned he had been fired
at the airport before boarding the flight home.</TE>
<TE>   On came Scolari, Brazil's eighth coach since 1990, who quickly
sized up the situation: "If I don't win, I'm dead meat."</TE>
<TE>   "Big Phil," as the Brazilian media refer to him, adopted a style
of soccer as blunt as his philosophy in career advancement. He bulked
up on defense-minded players and instructed them to just get the
result, to do whatever it takes.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the approach yielded some of the most embarrassing
defeats Brazil had ever seen. Brazil opened the 2001 Copa America
with a 1-0 loss to Mexico, the team's fourth defeat in a
row--Brazil's longest losing streak since 1921. A few days later,
Scolari's team was eliminated from the tournament by Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   "Write it down in your notebook, in the book of records," Scolari
said at the time. "I will be the coach who lost to Honduras. If it's
humiliating, shameful or ugly, put whatever adjectives you want. But
we're all hurting."</TE>
<TE>   Scolari eventually squeezed out a World Cup berth, concluding a
9-6-3 campaign Pele dismissed as "terrible." But he did not help
himself when he announced his 23-man roster and did not include
Romario, the most valuable player of Brazil's 1994 championship squad
and still a potent goal scorer at 36.</TE>
<TE>   The wrath of the Brazilian media rained down hard. Jornal dos
Sports called Scolari "public enemy number one," describing him as
the man who had "declared war on all Brazilian fans."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite the turmoil, Brazil stands a fair chance of reaching
the quarterfinals, thanks to its generous placement in a first-round
group that includes Turkey, which last appeared in the World Cup in
1954; China, which has never appeared in a World Cup; and
injury-depleted Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   A gift from the "soccer gods," Pele called it.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ronaldo has returned, scoring seven late-season
goals for his Italian club team, Internazionale, and playing 70
productive minutes in an April friendly against Portugal. Scolari
knows what a fit and motivated Ronaldo might mean for his troubled
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an obligation," Scolari says, "to win the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   But if he does, will anybody applaud?</TE>

In brief: The disappearance of "jogo bonito," the "beautiful game,"

Scolari signaled for more of the same when he refused to include

trying to score in the first 15 minutes of each game

<HD>Lions Could Be Roaring Again</HD>
<DH>Group E: Cameroon, strong on the field but weak in the
administrative department, appears to have best shot of any African
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>In the Cameroon capital of Yaounde, at the national stadium, the
broken remains of a statue of a soccer hero lie on the ground like so
much rubble.</LD>
<LD>   Can it be that Roger Milla has been forgotten so soon?</LD>
<LD>   It was at the 1990 World Cup in Italy that Milla brought smiles to
the faces of soccer fans worldwide with his hip-wiggling dance with a
corner flag each time he scored a goal for Cameroon.</LD>
<TE>   The Italy '90 tournament was a watershed year for the Indomitable
Lions and for African soccer in general. Cameroon, riding Milla's
goals and the goalkeeping of Thomas N'Kono, went all the way to the
quarterfinals and came within a lion's hairbreadth of beating England
and reaching the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Cameroon is at the forefront once again. A gold medal won at
the Sydney 2000 Olympic games and a second consecutive African
Nations Cup, won in Mali in February, have made the Indomitable Lions
the standard-bearer for Africa's World Cup challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia also will
represent the continent at Korea/Japan '02, but the overwhelming
belief is that it will be Cameroon that goes the greatest distance.</TE>
<TE>   Desire is one reason why--and not Cameroon's marvelously named
forward, Joseph Desire Job.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with African Soccer magazine earlier this year,
striker Samuel Eto'o Fils, who at 17 was the youngest player at the
France '98 World Cup, explained what drives the Indomitable Lions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that our strength comes from wanting to show what we can
do," he said. "There is the hunger from each of us to fulfill our
real potential as a footballing nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, when we find ourselves together, it's just like one large
gathering of friends. The players have grown up together in some of
the slums of Yaounde and Douala, and today they are claiming the
rights they never had when they were younger."</TE>
<TE>   Another driving force is Coach Winfried Schaefer, a blond,
blue-eyed German who took over from Jean-Paul Akono, the coach of
Cameroon's gold-medal team at Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   Akono resigned after an unexpected defeat in World Cup qualifying,
a result that had angry fans stoning his home in Yaounde.</TE>
<TE>   Schaefer was brought in with one goal in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt about the individual ability of my players," he
told African Soccer, "but I found out they lack self-belief, tactical
discipline and organization--virtues that make German football tick."</TE>
<TE>   Schaefer got instant support from an unlikely source: Milla.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what it is about German people but they know how to
organize things," Milla said. "I believe he is the right man for the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, Germany will be one of Cameroon's first-round
opponents, along with Ireland and Saudi Arabia. Even before the
Germans suffered a string of injuries that cost them four potential
starters, and even before the Irish self-destructed when captain Roy
Keane was kicked off the team, Cameroon's chances of winning the
group were pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they are even better. The team has quality at almost every
position, and especially up front, where the fleet Eto'o Fils is
paired with physically imposing, goal-scorer extraordinaire Patrick
Mboma.</TE>
<TE>   If anything can throw Cameroon off track, however, it is a lack of
similar quality at the federation level. The sport's movers and
shakers are nowhere near as organized as Schaefer's team.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Cameroon played Denmark in Copenhagen in a warmup game
and the players then returned to Paris to catch their charter flight
to Japan. But there was a two-day delay, which officials first blamed
on mechanical problems with the aircraft but later admitted were
because of an unseemly squabble over $42,000 in World Cup bonus money
that had not been paid to each player.</TE>
<TE>   That finally was resolved and the plane took off. It took a
roundabout route, with long stopovers in Ethiopia and India, and then
got only as far as Bangkok, Thailand, before there was another long
delay.</TE>
<TE>   This time is was because the pilot had forgotten to get permission
to fly through Cambodian, Vietnamese and Philippine airspace. The
plane was on the ground for seven hours while the players fumed. When
it comes to African teams, little is ever easy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Milla's statue lies in the dust in Yaounde.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disgusting," said Eto'o Fils, "and shows again how negligent
we are in Africa to our past heroes, people who sacrificed so much
for their country."</TE>
<TE>   But if this Cameroon team can match the feats of Milla's team,
perhaps it will be enough so that new statues can be raised in honor
of both generations of players.</TE>
<TE>   The African and Olympic champions would deserve no less.</TE>

World Cup record: Played 14 (3-5-6); goals for: 13; goals against: 26
Best finish: Quarterfinalist in 1990
1998 showing: Eliminated in the first round
Coach: Winfried Schafer. The 52-year-old German was hired in
September as Cameroon's fourth coach in 12 months, assigned to clean
up the perpetual disarray that is Cameroon soccer. Believes that with
the right organization, Cameroon can reach the semifinals
Players to watch: Patrick Mboma, Samuel Eto'o, Marc-Vivien Foe,
Geremi Njitap, Rigobert Song, Lauren Etame-Mayer
In brief: Many believe Schafer is the right man to harness the
immense potential of Cameroon's talent pool, which has produced two
major titles--the 2000 Olympics, the 2002 African Nations Cup--in the
last 21 months. At 40-1, the best longshot bet in the tournament

Coach: Bora Milutinovic. The former Yugoslavian national team player
has coached the U.S., Mexico, Costa Rica and Nigeria in the World Cup
Players to watch: Fan Zhiyi, Li Tie, Hao Haidong
In brief: It took the Chinese 44 years to qualify for their first
World Cup and the players are apologizing even before the tournament
begins. "We can't deny that in the World Cup we are a new army and a
weak team," the players said in an open letter intended to ward off
public outcry should they fail. "Insufficient skills and experience
means we are destined not to go far." That says it all. The speed,
aggression and intensity of the World Cup will overwhelm the Chinese
Quick quote: "He [Milutinovic] is a very kind, very amusing old man,
but he is also a coach of high caliber."--Zhiyi
Forecast: After taking four countries to the second round,
Milutinovic's luck is due to run out in the first round</TE>

World Cup record: Played 4 (2-2-0); goals for: 4; goals against: 6
Best finish: Second round, 1990
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Alexandre Guimaraes. Played on Costa Rica's memorable 1990
team. The Ticos lost only one of 11 qualifying matches after he took
over from Gilson Nunes
Players to watch: Walter Centeno, Rolando Fonseca, Paulo Wanchope
In brief: Costa Rica's team has been on a downward spiral ever since
it qualified for Korea/Japan '02, and the loss of defender Reynaldo
Parks to injury only makes things worse. It opens against China, led
by former Costa Rica coach Bora Milutinovic, and from there it gets
even tougher. "We played like turtles," bemoaned one Costa Rican
newspaper after a recent loss to a Japanese club team
Quick quote: "We won't be playing to entertain, we'll be playing to
win."-- Guimaraes
Forecast: The Ticos peaked under Milutinovic at the Italia '90 World
Cup and do not have what it takes to get out of the first round this
time around</TE>

World Cup record: Played seven (5-2-0); goals for: 11; goals against:

1998 showing: Third
Coach: Mirko Jozic. Replaced Miroslav Blazevic, the architect of
Croatia's third-place finish in 1998, in January 2001 after Croatia
opened World Cup qualification with draws against Belgium and
Scotland. Conservative and defense-minded, Jozic guided Croatia to a
5-0-1 record during its last six qualifiers
Players to watch: Alen Boksic, Robert Prosinecki, Davor Suker, Robert
Jarni, Robert Kovac
In brief: Croatia was the surprise team of the 1998 World Cup in
France, reaching the semifinals in its first attempt. Many of the key
components of that squad--Suker, Jarni, Prosinecki among them--are
now in their 30s, weighting down hopes for a repeat run this year
Quick quote: "I wish we had five players who are younger, faster and
better than Prosinecki. But we don't."--Jozic

Coach: Morten Olsen. Played on the "Danish Dynamite" team that lit up
the 1986 World Cup at Mexico
Players to watch: Ebbe Sand, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Thomas Helveg
In brief: Without giant goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, now retired from
international play, and the brothers Laudrup, Brian and Michael,
Denmark isn't what it was four years ago in France. Still, the Danes
have plenty of heart and two top-notch strikers in Sand, the 2001
German Bundesliga top goal scorer, and Tomasson, who is headed for AC
Milan after winning the UEFA Cup with Feyenoord, so who knows? The
Danes might surprise
Quick quote: "I don't think we have a star. The team is the
star."--Olsen
Forecast: Everything will depend on the June 1 game against Uruguay,
when heat and the lack of an internationally experienced goalkeeper
could be the Danes' undoing</TE>

his players and Bucaram urged him to reconsider
Players to watch: Ivan Kaviedes, Agustin Delgado, Alex Aguinaga,

In brief: Amazing but true, Ecuador finished second behind Argentina
in the South American World Cup qualification group, one point ahead
of Brazil. With a suspect defense, finishing second in this group

In brief: Had hopes of matching its 1990 semifinal run, until it saw
its first-round draw and the midfielders started dropping. Beckham's
broken foot has been a cause of national hysteria and the loss of
Steven Gerrard was a massive blow. Beckham is expected back no later
than the Argentina game, a rematch England has pined for since '98

to Portugal's attack.</DH>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Take a poll of the United States players and ask them which player
they are most worried about facing in the World Cup and the answer is
unanimous: Luis Figo.</LD>
<LD>   As reigning FIFA world player of the year and soccer's second-most
expensive player of all time behind Zinedine Zidane, Figo is to
Portugal what Zidane is to France. In a word, indispensable.</LD>
<LD>   If anyone can lead the Portuguese to the world championship they
desperately desire, it's the 29-year-old millionaire from a
working-class suburb of Lisbon. He has done so twice on a smaller
scale, so why not on the biggest stage of all?</LD>
<TE>   In 1989, the same year the U.S. qualified for the World Cup for
the first time in 40 years, Figo inspired Portugal to victory in the
FIFA Under-17 World Championship.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the same year the U.S. brought Bora Milutinovic aboard as
coach to improve its soccer fortunes, Figo was part of Portugal's
victorious team in the FIFA World Youth [Under-20] Championship.</TE>
<TE>   A wide-ranging player who is happiest on the flanks, Figo has
pace, stamina, strength, excellent close control and an accurate
shot. Add to that exceptional dribbling skills and a crossing ability
that puts him on a par with England's David Beckham, and you have the
complete player, one equally at home as a forward, playmaker or
winger.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that former Dutch national team coach Louis Van Gaal
once said that if he could draft any player in the world, his first
choice would be Figo.</TE>
<TE>   "Figo is a great player, with great mentality and desire to win,"
Van Gaal said. "He is simply fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Portugal's World Cup coach, Antonio Oliveira, goes even further.
"Figo is to this team what Eusebio was to the team of '66 [that
reached the World Cup semifinals]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Having made his debut for Sporting Lisbon in 1989, it wasn't long
before the teenage Figo--full name Luis Filipe Figo Madeira
Caeiro--was being tracked by even more famous clubs outside Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian clubs Parma and Juventus sought Figo, but it was Johan
Cruyff, then coach of Barcelona, who lured him to Spain in 1995, the
year before Figo helped Portugal reach the quarterfinals of the 1996
European Championship in England.</TE>
<TE>   Figo became an instant fan favorite at Nou Camp, Barcelona's famed
stadium. In his five years and 172 games for Barcelona, he was a
vital contributor to teams that won two Spanish championships, two
Spanish Cups, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But he made one major mistake. He promised that he would never
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reassure fans that Luis Figo, with all the certainty in
the world, will be at the Nou Camp on July 24 to start the season,"
he told Barcelona's Sport newspaper on July 9, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Figo had not taken into account the resolution of Florentino
Perez, who made bringing Figo from Barcelona to Real Madrid the
central plank of his campaign for the presidency of Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   July 24 duly arrived and it turned out to be the very day that
Figo was whisked into Madrid by private jet, having agreed to wear
the all-white uniform of Barcelona's fiercest rival, which paid the
Catalan club a then-world record transfer fee of $56.1 million, the
amount specified in the buyout clause in Figo's contract.</TE>
<TE>   With the stroke of a pen, Figo had become the world's most
expensive player and the most despised man in Catalunya.</TE>
<TE>   Figo found the sum almost obscene.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the law of the market," he told the Spanish sports daily
Marca at the time. "I didn't ask anyone to pay it and it's not my
fault that they did. If you ask me if I'd pay that amount for any
player, then I'd say no. It's an outrage."</TE>
<TE>   Outrage or not, the record didn't last long. One year later, Perez
brought Zidane to Real Madrid from Juventus for a staggering $64.45
million.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of the French World Cup winner took some of the onus
off Figo, who had edged Zidane in becoming European player of the
year in 2000, the same year he helped Portugal reach the semifinals
of the European Championship in Belgium and the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   In the season just ended, Figo and Zidane added to their honors
when Real Madrid celebrated its centenary year by winning the
European Champions Cup. Along the way, however, Figo hurt his right
ankle, an injury that has cast doubt over his World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a goal scorer or a defender," he said. "I'm not a passer.
Soccer for me is speed. Quick on the ball, quick thinking, quick to
move."</TE>
<TE>   A bad ankle will slow down Figo, but the U.S. players fear him all
the same. On June 5, they will find out if those fears are justified.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   Among the Elite</TE>
<TE>   Luis Figo's career has taken him to three of the most storied
teams in European soccer:</TE>

<TE>*--*
World Cup record: Played 78 (48-16-14); goals for: 162; goals
against: 103
Best finish: Champion, 1998
1998 showing: Defeated Brazil, 3-0, in the final to win it all
Coach: Roger Lemerre. Was an assistant on the 1998 World Cup-winner
and inherited a team that, if anything, has grown even stronger since
then
Players to watch: Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira, Djibril Cisse
In brief: Since its victory at Paris four years ago, the world
champion has won the 2000 European Championship and the 2001 FIFA
Confederations Cup. The question is whether erratic goalkeeper Fabien
Barthez can avoid a costly blunder once the knockout phase is reached
Quick quote: "We are not pretentious and we are not developing a
superiority complex, but we know that we have a quality team."--
Zidane
Forecast: If it can keep clear of injuries (Zidane will miss the
opener) and overcome South American opposition in the later rounds,
France can become the first country since Brazil in 1962 to repeat as
champion</TE>

Best finish: Champion in 1954, 1974, 1990
1998 showing: Eliminated by Croatia in quarterfinals
Coach: Rudi Voller. One of Germany's greatest players, he scored 47
goals in 90 appearances. Had virtually no coaching experience when he
succeeded Erich Ribbeck after Germany's first-round ouster in the
2000 European championships, but guided the team past Ukraine for a
spot in the 2002 Cup
Players to watch: Dietmar Hamann, Christian Ziege, Michael Ballack,
Oliver Kahn
In brief: Already in a down cycle, German soccer has received
disheartening news recently, with key injured players Sebastian
Deisler, Mehmet Scholl, Christian Worns and Jens Nowotny out of the
tournament. Odds of advancing would be better with a better striker
Quick quote: "German football is a little depressed at the
moment."--German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer
Forecast: Second round would be an achievement</TE>

<TE>*--*
World Cup record: Played nine (2-3-4); goals for: three; goals
against: seven
Best finish: Quarterfinalist in 1990
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Mick McCarthy. What will be his World Cup legacy? The coach
who outmanuevered powerful Netherlands for an unlikely trip to the
2002 tournament? Or the man who snuffed Ireland's second-round hopes
by booting captain Roy Keane off the squad a week before the opener?
Players to watch: Robbie Keane, Shay Given, Jason McAteer, Niall
Quinn, Steve Staunton
In brief: Ireland entertained thoughts of matching its quarterfinal
run of 1990. But McCarthy's dismissal of Keane, the team's best
player and inspirational leader, changes everything. In 1998, U.S.
coach Steve Sampson cut his captain, John Harkes, weeks before the
tournament and his demoralized team never recovered, going 0-3 and
out
Quick quote: "As long as I am coach of the Ireland team, Roy [Keane]
will not play for us."--McCarthy
Forecast: Chances of advancing may have vanished with Keane</TE>

Best finish: Second round in 1994, 1998
1998 showing: Eliminated in second round by Denmark
Coach: Adegboye Onigbinde. Late replacement for Shaibu Amodu, who
came and went as Nigeria's coach for the fifth time earlier this
year. Onigbinde coached the Super Eagles to the 1984 African Nations
Cup final
Players to watch: Nwankwo Kanu, Jay-Jay Okocha, Taribo West,

In brief: Highly skilled, as always, but straddling the precipice of

finishing anywhere, first to fourth, in this group
Quick quote: "I know we're in the group of death, but Nigeria [is]

<HD>Owen Has New Goals in Mind</HD>
<DH>Group F: With Beckham questionable, young striker who
sparkled with great shot in '98 will try to lead England's return to
glory days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Michael Owen was a mere lad of 18 when he scored England's most
celebrated World Cup goal since Geoff Hurst's controversial
extra-time winner in the 1966 final against West Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Why, and how, it is celebrated says all one needs to know about
England's experience in the World Cup over the last 36 years.</LD>
<LD>   In only his second World Cup start, in the 1998 second round
against Argentina, Owen and the shot that made his reputation
appeared to emerge from nowhere--a blur of white against a sea of
Argentine blue, darting past and around some of the most savvy
defenders in the tournament, before Owen delivered on the run,
driving the ball hard past startled keeper Carlos Roa.</LD>
<TE>   London's Daily Telegraph described the goal as "a golden
footballing moment that had grown men on their knees howling,
believing for a brief and shining instant that England was truly a
great footballing nation again."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Owen told the Telegraph that the shot "changed my
life, it changed the way people saw me. Every football fan remembers
exactly where they were.... They tell me exactly what they were doing
at the time and how they will never forget that."</TE>
<TE>   One thing about that goal and that game:</TE>
<TE>   Without it, England would have lost in regulation, sparing itself
the tease of extra time and the agony of being eliminated in a
penalty-kick shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the greatest English goal of the last eight World Cups came
in a losing effort.</TE>
<TE>   In a game that ended in penalties, the same way England lost to
West Germany in the 1990 semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In a game against Argentina, the same country that ended England's
1986 World Cup with Diego Maradona's infamous "Hand of God" goal.</TE>
<TE>   In a game that finished without David Beckham on the field.
Beckham, England's best midfielder then and now, was red-carded in
the 47th minute, forcing his teammates to forge ahead short-handed
for 75 more minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It was a gallant, lion-hearted performance in defeat, the kind of
thing at which England has come to excel. Four years later, England
readies for another World Cup with Beckham questionable for the
opener--he's recovering from a broken foot--and Argentina awaiting in
the second group game, casting a dark shadow over England's hopes of
progressing far in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the course of the 2002 World Cup could hinge on the June
7 England-Argentina match in Sapporo. To the winner of Group F goes a
second-round match against the likes of Denmark or Senegal, followed
possibly by a quarterfinal encounter with Turkey or Belgium. In other
words, a berth in the final four is there for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   Finish second in Group F, however, and this is the probable road
ahead: defending champion France in the second round, Brazil in the
quarters. In other words, don't unpack all your bags.</TE>
<TE>   Until Beckham's return, the captain's armband has gone to Owen,
all of 22 now. If the goal against Argentina announced his arrival as
a striker with world-class potential, Owen's 2000-2001 season removed
all doubt. In leading Liverpool to titles in the English League Cup,
the F.A. Cup and the UEFA Cup, Owen was named European player of the
year and World Soccer magazine's world player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he helped trigger England's bottom-to-top rise
in its World Cup qualification group by scoring a hat trick last
September against Germany in a 5-1 victory in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Owen is back at the World Cup, but he hardly recognizes the place.
This time last Cup, he was little more than a rumor, used only as a
substitute in England's first two matches by a coach, Glenn Hoddle,
who considered Owen too callow and--an opinion he will never live
down--not a natural goal scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Long gone is the element of surprise. Argentina won't be caught
flatfooted again by the kid in the No. 10 shirt with the face going
on 15. Today, Owen doesn't travel as lightly. He arrives in Japan
toting a heavy piece of baggage known as expectation.</TE>
<TE>   Talking with reporters before a recent tuneup match against South
Korea, Owen acknowledged that "When you come on the scene as an
18-year-old, you are not expected to do anything and you are in a
win-win situation. You can make a name for yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different type of pressure now.... It's a difficult group
we are in, and I don't think goals will be easy to come by. But as
long as they are important goals, I don't mind."</TE>
<TE>   England, Argentina and the rest of the world will be settling in
to see what the kid comes up with for an encore.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have come back and just score a great goal," Owen said,
"the next question is: Are you going to do something else, or will it
be just that goal?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't change that goal for the world. It was a great moment
and something I will never forget. But if you want to get to the top
of in any profession, you do not just score one goal in a World Cup
against Argentina. You have got to keep going."</TE>

World Cup record: Played 15 (4-5-6); goals for: 19; goals against: 27
Best finish: Second round in 1986, 1998
1998 showing: Eliminated in the second round
Coach: Cesare Maldini. The 70-year-old father of Italy's veteran
World Cup defender Paolo Maldini, he was an assistant on Italy's 1982
World Cup-winning team
Players to watch: Jose Luis Chilavert, Carlos Gamarra, Jose Cardozo
In brief: Paraguay's chances of finishing second behind Spain could
depend on the play of backup goalkeeper Ricardo Tavarelli, filling in
for Chilavert in the first game because Chilavert is suspended for
spitting on Brazil's Roberto Carlos during qualifying
Quick quote: "Ninety percent of sports journalists in Paraguay are
incompetent."--Chilavert
Forecast: Friction between players and coach could undermine
Paraguay, as could the always inflammatory comments of Chilavert
himself. A first-round exit would be no surprise, despite the team's
strong showing in 1998</TE>

Coach: Jerzy Engel. Running battles with the highly critical Polish
media only motivate him more. "Life in the media and in a squad are
two different things," he said
Players to watch: Jerzy Dudek, Tomasz Klos, Emmanuel Olisadebe
In brief: The Poles were regarded as a stronger threat before they
lost warmup games to Japan and Romania. Much depends on naturalized
Nigerian striker Olisadebe at one end and Liverpool goalkeeper Dudek
at the other. Dudek says he has recovered from a knee injury and is
ready to go for the opener
Quick quote: "World football has moved forward so much since Poland's
glory days. Still, I would be extremely happy to repeat those
results."-- Engel
Forecast: The Poles are physically imposing enough to bulldoze their
way to second place in the group, but internal strife and unfamiliar
conditions could see them lose their way</TE>

Coach: Antonio Oliveira. A former midfielder for Portugal who is in
his second spell in charge of the national team, having quit after
leading Portugal to the quarterfinals of the European Championship in
1996
Players to watch: Luis Figo, Rui Costa, Pedro Pauleta
In brief: The twin spurs prodding the Portuguese are their
controversial loss to eventual champion France in the semifinals of
the European Championship in 2000 and the fact that they will host
that same tournament in 2004. It is also the last chance for this
generation of players to make an impact at a World Cup
Quick quote: "Even if we do not win the World Cup, there is a belief
among the squad that we can go a long way."--Figo
Forecast: Portugal will finish first in the group and then beat
Croatia or Mexico to reach the quarterfinals. After that, it's up to
Figo</TE>

<HD>A Forecast of Reign for Spain?</HD>
<DH>Group B: With a world of talent but a history of
underachievement, Spaniards have a favorable grouping at the World
Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The picture is worth a thousand tears, telling the sad story of 50
years of Spanish soccer exasperation in a single snapshot.</LD>
<LD>   It was taken two years ago, inside Jan Breydel Stadium in Bruges,
Belgium, site of the 2000 European Championship quarterfinal between
Spain and France. The camera lens succeeded where Raul Gonzalez had
failed, zeroing in on its target and capturing the star child of
Spanish soccer after he had launched a last-minute, potential
game-tying penalty kick high into the Belgian sky.</LD>
<LD>   Raul, as he is simply known through Spain and his sport, is frozen
in despair, standing alone, his head buried in his hands as the final
seconds tick off on France's 2-1 victory.</LD>
<TE>   The ball is off somewhere in the distance, contemplating re-entry
into the stratosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Spain--forever supremely talented, forever extremely
disappointing--had found another way to lose in a major tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Two years earlier, touted as a serious challenger for the 1998
World Cup, Spain didn't get out of the first round, losing to Nigeria
and failing to score in a draw with Paraguay.</TE>
<TE>   Four years before that, Spain fell in the World Cup quarterfinals
on an 88th-minute goal by Italy's Roberto Baggio.</TE>
<TE>   Four years before that, Spain went out in the second round against
Yugoslavia, on a goal in the 93rd minute, after hitting the post
twice in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   And so it has gone, for more than half a century, for Spain, which
hasn't advanced beyond the World Cup quarterfinals since 1950, when
it finished fourth. Even when it played host to the event, in 1982,
Spain lost to Northern Ireland in group play and was quickly ousted
in the second round by West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Here we are again, at the outset of another World Cup, and a lot
of people who ought to know better are touting Spain for the final
four. Why? Because of La Liga, the country's prestigious professional
league and its recent run on European trophies.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Raul and Real Madrid won the European
Champions League--for the third time since 1998. Valencia finished
runner-up in the same competition in 2000 and 2001. Alaves was a UEFA
Cup finalist in 2001. Barcelona, home of Rivaldo, is one of the most
famous clubs in the world.</TE>
<TE>   It's an impressive resume, yet success on the club level has never
translated for Spain on the world stage. One reason: Many of the top
names that populate La Liga from September to May will be trying to
take out Spain in June. Rivaldo starts for Brazil, Real Madrid's Luis
Figo and Zinedine Zidane are the midfield leaders for Portugal and
France, respectively. Valencia's Pablo Aimar, Roberto Ayala and
Cristian Gonzalez belong to Argentina for the next month.</TE>
<TE>   But a bigger reason is the state of the Spanish team's psyche,
after so many decades of underachievement. In short, it's shot.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jose Antonio Camacho sounds as if he's already cushioning
the floor for another fall, noting how Spain has traditionally
struggled in World Cup openers against lowly regarded
opponents--Spain opens this one against Slovenia--and talking about
resigning if Spain is eliminated early again.</TE>
<TE>   He also has set up Raul as most valuable scapegoat, telling
reporters in Madrid recently, "I told Raul that while a few years ago
I thought he was being given too much responsibility, now is the time
for him to start pulling the cart. With Real Madrid, Raul has won
just about everything there is to win, and now what's left for him is
to win with the Spanish team."</TE>
<TE>   After scoring only once in both the 1998 World Cup and the 2000
European Championship, Raul knows the pressure is on him to produce
in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time we did well," he told World Soccer magazine.
"Spain have never got the results they deserved at the World Cup. I
don't know why. Bad luck at critical moments and a lack of
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Group B, which also includes Slovenia, South Africa and Paraguay,
is Spain's to lose. Should it win the group, Spain would likely face
Ireland or Cameroon in the second round, with Portugal looming in the
quarterfinals. The final four is reachable, but Paraguay goalkeeper
Jose Luis Chilavert, never afraid to stir the pot, predicts further
calamity ahead for the Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the weak opponents Spain played during World Cup
qualification, Chilavert told Paraguay radio, "It's really easy to
get through if you are playing teams like Andorra, Liechtenstein or
Israel. If Spain had played in the South American qualifiers, I am
sure they would not be going to the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, the Spaniards can shrug that off as Chilavert, who
loves the sound of his voice. On the other hand, Spain lost its
starting goalkeeper, Santiago Canizares, for the tournament after
Canizares dropped a bottle of aftershave and severed a tendon in his
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Old Spice?</TE>
<TE>   No. But it smells like the same old story.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Lament</TE>
<TE>   For all its perennial talent and its successful professional
league, Spain has never finished higher than its fourth-place finish
in 1950. A look at recent disappointments:</TE>
<TE>   1998--A loss to Nigeria and a draw with Paraguay cost Spain a
berth in the second round for the first time since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   1994--The Spaniards succumb to an 88th-minute goal by Roberto
Baggio in a 2-1 quarterfinal loss to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   1990--After winning its group, Spain falls in overtime in the
second round to Yugoslavia, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   1986--Spain's 5-1 semifinal victory over Denmark is one of the
tournament's most stunning results, but then the Spaniards are
themselves upset in the quarterfinals by Belgium on penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   1982--Spain's saddest showing: as tournament host, it can only tie
with Honduras, loses to Northern Ireland, then finishes last in its
second-round pool.</TE>

World Cup record: Played seven (2-4-1); goals for: seven; goals
against: 13
Best finish: Second round in 1994
1998 showing: Eliminated in first round
Coach: Nasser Al-Johar. This is Al-Johar's second stint as Saudi
Arabia's coach, returning to the team in 2001 just in time to salvage
a struggling qualification campaign. In so doing, Saudi Arabia became
the first Gulf nation to reach three consecutive World Cups
Players to watch: Obedi Al-Dossary, Nawaf Al-Temyat, Talal Al-Meshal
In brief: Saudi Arabia surprised in 1994, reaching the second round,
and disappointed in 1998, going three games and out. Temyat was voted
2001 Asian midfielder of the year, but the talent around him is too
lean to advance in this group
Quick quote: "I hope the players stay fit and perform in a way that
portrays our football in its best light."--Al-Johar
Forecast: Last in this demanding group</TE>

World Cup record: Debut
Best finish: Debut
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Bruno Metsu. With dark, shoulder-length hair and blue eyes,
French-born Metsu has an almost messianic look, but he endeared
himself to the Senegalese by marrying a local woman in March, thus
showing that his attachment to the country "went well beyond
football," according to Dakar's Le Soleil newspaper
Players to watch: El Hadji Diouf, Ferdinand Coly, Khalilou Fadiga
In brief: The Lions of Teranga, as they are known, are made up
primarily of Senegalese players living and playing in France, chief
among them Africa's 2001 player of the year, striker Diouf, an
eight-goal scorer in qualifiers now being pursued by Liverpool
Quick quote: "If we crash out early, it will be no surprise. But I
have a feeling we will spring a few surprises."--Diouf
Forecast: A woeful lack of warmup games could be costly in a group
where no prisoners will be taken. A first-round exit is almost
guaranteed</TE>

Coach: Guus Hiddink. Coached the Netherlands to the semifinal round
in 1998, routing South Korea, 5-0, along the way, before taking on
this much-different and far more demanding challenge
Players to watch: Hong Myung-Byo, Yoo Sang-Chul, Seol Ki-Hyeon
In brief: No host nation has failed to advance to the second round. A
recent run of six games without a loss, including a 4-1 victory over
Scotland and a tie against England, has encouraged the Koreans to
believe that their team might not be the first to fail
Quick quote: "When the roots of the tree are different, it is no use
just changing the leaves."--Lee Young-Pyo
Forecast: Who knows what midfielder Lee is talking about, but Korean
fans should realize that their team has as good a chance as the
Americans or Poles of reaching the final 16</TE>

World Cup record: Debut

1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Srecko Katanec. A former midfielder for Sampdoria in Italy and
now a national hero for putting Slovenia on the world stage
Players to watch: Zlatko Zahovic, Milenko Acimovic, Djoni Novak
In brief: When Slovenia gained its independence from Yugoslavia in
1991, few expected that within a decade it would qualify for not only
the European Championship in 2000, but also the 2002 World Cup, the
latter impressively coming at the expense of Romania and Yugoslavia
Quick quote: "I've got the impression that [the public] in Slovenia
is suddenly expecting miracles from us. Fans seem to have lost touch
with the ground under their feet."--Zahovic
Forecast: Zahovic is the only world-class player Slovenia has, but if
Katanec can keep the team's mind on its task and keep it riding a
wave of national pride, the smallest nation in the World Cup might
cause the biggest surprise and reach the final 16</TE>

old North American Soccer League, then went home to found a team he

Players to watch: Sibusiso Zuma, Lucas Radebe, Benedict McCarthy
In brief: To celebrate South Africa's second consecutive World Cup
appearance, the government minted commemorative coins, including a
one-ounce gold coin depicting a soccer player. Without injured top
goal scorer Shaun Bartlett, the coin is worth more than the Bafana
Bafana's chances
Quick quote: "I think the team now will start believing in
themselves."--Sono

soccer federation denied former coach Carlos Queiroz of Portugal sole
say in picking the team and he quit. It could be three games and out</TE>

reminding ourselves that Spain has never won anything at the World
Cup."
Quick quote: "I want my players to go on the pitch with aggression.

<TE>*--*
World Cup record: Played 38 (15-15-8); goals for: 66; goals against:
60
Best finish: Third in 1994
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coaches: Tommy Soderberg, Lars Lagerback. Soderberg replaced Tommy
Svensson, who coached Sweden to the 1994 semifinals, in 1997.
Lagerback was promoted from assistant to co-coach three years later.
They guided Sweden to the top of its 2002 qualification group
Players to watch: Fredrik Ljungberg, Henrik Larsson, Magnus Hedman,
Patrik Andersson, Anders Svensson
In brief: In Larsson, who led European club players in scoring in
2001, and Ljungberg, whose late-season scoring led Arsenal to the
English Premier League and F.A. Cup titles, Sweden has more offensive
punch than in '94. Andersson appears ready after tearing knee
ligaments in February
Quick quote: "If [Larsson] just plays his game and the rest of the
team pull their weight, we will be more than satisfied."--Lagerback
Forecast: No surprise if Sweden reaches the second round</TE>

World Cup record: Played 3 (1-2-0); goals for: 10; goals against: 11
Best finish: Never beyond the first round
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Senol Gunes. A fan of military analogies, whose spoutings
include: "Everyone's a captain, everyone's a general. The team will
be a good army, and when the time comes they will battle."
Players to watch: Hakan Sukur, Yildiray Basturk, Alpay Ozalan
In brief: It was in 1954 that the Turks last played in the World Cup,
but the success of their club teams in Europe in recent seasons has
improved the lot of the national team, which reached the European
Championship quarterfinals in 2000. Accomplished goal scorer Sukur,
the so-called "Bull of the Bosphorus," who scored six goals during
qualifying, holds the key to the second round
Quick quote: "I feel like a bomb ready to explode."--Ozalan
Forecast: A second-place finish behind Brazil is expected. Anything
less would be a failure</TE>

World Cup record: Played 37 (15-14-8); goals for: 61; goals against:

Best finish: Champion in 1930, 1950
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Victor Pua. Coached Uruguay's under-20 team to a second-place
finish in the FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia in 1997
Players to watch: Paolo Montero, Alvaro Recoba, Sebastian Abreu
In brief: Making its first appearance at the World Cup in 12 years,
Uruguay brings a team sprinkled with quality players but at times
lacking cohesion and focus. It barely managed to qualify through a
playoff against Australia and its warmup results since then have been
indifferent. Pua says a victory in the Denmark opener is the key to
moving on
Quick quote: "They will all be tough matches."--Pua
Forecast: If the Uruguayans can maintain some defensive composure and
avoid red cards, to which their overly physical approach makes them
prone, they have enough firepower up front to reach the second round,
where they will bow out</TE>

World Cup record: Played 17 (4-12-1); goals for: 18; goals against: 38
Best finish: Semifinalist in 1930
1998 showing: Eliminated in the first round
Coach: Bruce Arena. Since taking over from Steve Sampson in 1998,
Arena has compiled a 31-16-13 record, but he is only 6-11-5 outside
the U.S. and 2-5-1 against European opposition. Prepared for the job
by winning five NCAA titles at Virginia and two MLS Cups with D.C.
United
Players to watch: Claudio Reyna, DaMarcus Beasley, Clint Mathis
In brief: All too much has been made of the three-losses-and-out
shambles of 1998. The fact is, exactly the same thing could happen
this time because the U.S. defense cracks under sustained pressure.
That said, advancing is not impossible, merely difficult
Quick quote: "We aren't going to Korea to have a vacation."--Arena
Forecast: The battle plan is to hold the fort against Portugal,
defeat South Korea and go for broke against Poland. There's a chance
it might work, but don't bet the house</TE>

<HD>Look Out, World: ZZ Still Tops</HD>
<DH>Group A: France's Zidane was looking better than ever, but
he will sit out opener because of thigh injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Think of it as a warning shot fired across the bows. That's certainly
how the other 31 World Cup teams viewed it.</LD>
<LD>   The shot in question was unleashed May 15 at Hampden Park in
Glasgow, Scotland. It flew off the raised and outstretched foot of
Zinedine Zidane and crashed into the back of the Bayer Leverkusen net
to earn Real Madrid its ninth European Champions Cup.</LD>
<LD>   More important, from Zidane's standpoint, was the fact that with
one mighty swing of his left leg he had repaid the $64.9 million that
the Spanish club had spent on acquiring him from Juventus only 10
months earlier and, at the same time, added a coveted Champions Cup
winner's medal to his own glittering collection.</LD>
<TE>   Reaction to the goal--seen worldwide because it came in a showcase
game, a European Cup final--was instantaneous, and nowhere was the
excitement greater than at France's World Cup training camp in
Clairefontaine, south of Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "It was magic," midfielder Christophe Dugarry said. "His movement
was magnificent, the precision of the shot incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Hughes, perhaps the most perceptive of commentators on the
world's game, described it perfectly in the next day's International
Herald Tribune:</TE>
<TE>   "If there was any doubt that Zinedine Zidane, the son of an
Algerian janitor, has grown into one of a handful of men throughout
history who can turn soccer into art, he dispelled it [with that
goal]," Hughes wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane argued that he had "simply slammed at the ball without
thinking," saying that it was "pure instinct." If so, it is a feral
instinct, the same kind he showed four years ago at the Stade de
France outside Paris, where his two headed goals in the 1998 World
Cup final sent Brazil spinning to a 3-0 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, again, on the marvelous May 15 goal:</TE>
<TE>   "In the split seconds that it takes for three opponents ... to
lose a yard of positioning, Zidane had anticipated every option. Just
inside the penalty box, 18 yards from the net, he balanced his weight
expertly on his right foot, with which he has scored many of his
great goals, and almost from behind his own body hooked the left foot
toward the flight of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He struck it on the volley, almost a meter off the ground. He
hooked it with such beautiful timing, such brutal power, that Joerg
Butt, the Leverkusen goalkeeper, did not have a prayer of a chance of
intercepting it."</TE>
<TE>   The same thought must have crossed the minds of all 31 goalkeepers
who could come face to face with Zidane at the World Cup, and
especially those of Uruguay and Denmark, who will see him in the
first round (Zidane will sit out the opener Friday against Senegal
because of a thigh injury).</TE>
<TE>   The scary thing about Zidane is that, at 29 and having won just
about everything there is to win, he still is hungry for more.
"Zizou," as the two-time world player of the year is nicknamed, earns
$12 million a year as the world's highest-paid player and has hardly
taken it easy since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   First came the European Championship in 2000, where he again was
head and shoulders above every other player, moving Pele to remark,
"Zidane is even better now than two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2001, where France again
prevailed. And now, just this month, the European Champions Cup, a
trophy that had twice slipped from his grasp while he was playing for
Juventus.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my best footballing years ahead of me," he warned in an
interview with Agence France-Presse. "Maybe not five years, but I
hope at least another two or three years at the highest level."</TE>
<TE>   But there is another side to the man from Marseille, or, to be
more precise, that Mediterranean port city's largely immigrant
district of La Castellane. For one thing, he is a husband and father.</TE>
<TE>   He and his Spanish wife, Veronica, have three sons, the first
named Enzo in honor of Zidane's own soccer hero, Enzo Francescoli of
Uruguay. His youngest son was born only last week. Then there is
Zidane the off-field leader, the Legion of Honor  winner and United
Nations goodwill ambassador, the quiet man who speaks up when he
believes it is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Such a moment came during the recent French presidential election,
when Zidane, along with many other French World Cup players, called
on voters to reject National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen
because, in Zidane's words, his party "has nothing in common with the
values of France."</TE>
<TE>   That brought a snarl from Le Pen, who said, "Zidane is nothing
special.... I would say to him as well, 'I will give you part of my
votes if you give me a proportion of your wages.'"</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen was crushed in the election.</TE>
<TE>   France's World Cup foes are anticipating the same fate.</TE>

Best finish: Champion in 1934, 1938, 1982
1998 showing: Eliminated by France in quarterfinals
Coach: Giovanni Trapattoni. The most successful coach in the history
of Italy club soccer. Firm believer in the future-is-now philosophy,

<HD>Mexico's Blanco Taking Flight</HD>
<DH>Group G: Star forward, who quit for three months after
feeling slighted by travel plans, is key to team's chances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Most valuable lesson learned from Mexico's most troublesome journey
to the 2002 World Cup:</LD>
<LD>   Fly direct, fly united.</LD>
<LD>   For the cost of one nonstop plane ticket from Madrid to Mexico
City in November, Mexico's soccer federation nearly scrimped itself
out of a trip to Asia to compete for international soccer's biggest
prize.</LD>
<TE>   Needing a victory over Honduras to qualify for the World Cup, and
needing to fly in star forward Cuauhtemoc Blanco for the match,
Mexico picked a bad time to go cheap--sending Blanco, who plays for
the Spanish club Valladolid, an economy-class ticket that included
stopovers in Barcelona and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco was so incensed when he inspected the itinerary, he
purchased a first-class ticket to fly direct from Madrid. But that
was nothing compared to Blanco's reaction when he boarded the plane
and spotted national teammate Francisco Palencia already on the
flight, courtesy of a ticket provided him by the Mexican federation.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco did a slow burn from Madrid to Mexico City, played the
game, scored two goals and set up the other in Mexico's
berth-clinching 3-0 victory. Then, barely a week later, he announced
he was quitting the team.</TE>
<TE>   "My cycle with the national team is over," Blanco said in an
emotional television interview in mid-November. "I gave my life for
the team. And they hurt me and they broke me."</TE>
<TE>   How important is Blanco to Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   In the seven qualification games in which he played, Blanco scored
nine goals, most on the team.</TE>
<TE>   But he missed nine qualifiers, primarily because of an
eighth-month injury absence from late 2000 to mid-2001. Blanco
ruptured knee ligaments in a 7-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago in
October 2000--and without him, Mexico went 1-3-2 in its next six
qualifiers.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last June, after a 3-1 loss to Honduras, Mexico's
prospects for a trip to the World Cup were so dim that federation
officials fired coach Enrique Meza, who had replaced Manuel Lapuente
only eight months earlier. They then rolled the dice with former
national team midfielder Javier Aguirre, who had impressed with his
surprising success as coach of the Mexican club team Pachuca.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre immediately cleaned house, getting rid of 19 of the team's
31 players, including former Galaxy forward Luis Hernandez and
goalkeeper Jorge Campos. Aguirre brought in 10 newcomers, most of
them young, all of them willing to, as the coach put it, "give
everything."</TE>
<TE>   He also caught one lucky break: Blanco rejoined the team in time
for Aguirre's second game, coming on at halftime with Mexico trailing
Jamaica, 1-0. Mexico was 45 minutes from World Cup elimination, but
two goals by Blanco salvaged a 2-1 victory and kept the qualification
bid alive.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Mexico defeated Trinidad and Tobago, 3-0, and scraped
out a 0-0 tie at Costa Rica, setting up the must-win finale against
Honduras in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico had to get three points from the match. Blanco had to be
there.</TE>
<TE>   Federation officials went all out, shipping him a coach ticket
with two connections. At least they didn't make him wait standby.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco's retirement from the national team lasted three months.
Persistent lobbying by Aguirre and teammates softened his stance and
by late February, Blanco announced that he had "thought things over,
some people have made me reflect and the best thing for my football
career and for Mexico is for me to have the opportunity to represent
our country."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing for Mexico, because without Blanco in Japan, the team
plane might as well just keep idling on the tarmac, ready for the
quick trip home. After a string of unimpressive performances in
tuneup matches in April and May, Mexico beat Bolivia in San
Francisco, 1-0, and AC Milan in Los Angeles, 2-1, largely because of
the contributions of Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   Against Bolivia, Blanco entered the game at halftime and broke a
scoreless tie within two minutes, feeding Palencia for the only goal
of the match. Three days later against Milan, Blanco scored the
eventual game winner on a swerving drive from outside the penalty
area.</TE>
<TE>   With its already limited midfield further weakened by Jesus
Arellano's two-game red-card suspension, Mexico will need more of the
same from Blanco and Palencia to have a chance of advancing from a
first-round group that includes 1994 finalist Italy and 1998 bronze
medalist Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   For benefit of his players and Mexico's passionate fans, Aguirre
says he has set his sights on outstripping every previous Mexican
World Cup performance, which would mean a spot in the semifinals. But
Aguirre has already achieved his real triumph--just getting Mexico
this far was a major achievement.</TE>
<TE>   How long Mexico lasts depends a good deal on Blanco. For the sake
of team and country, the team bus had better be air-conditioned.</TE>

World Cup record: Played 37 (8-21-8); goals for: 39; goals against: 75
Best finish: Quarterfinalist in 1970, 1986
1998 showing: Eliminated by Germany in second round
Coach: Javier Aguirre. Salvaged Mexico's qualification campaign by
replacing Enrique Meza in June and going 4-0-1 down the stretch. Has
sacrificed traditional Mexican flair for a more tactical approach
Players to watch: Cuauhtemoc Blanco, Francisco Palencia, Rafael

In brief: The midfield lacks a true playmaker, reducing strategy to
the essentials of defending and getting the ball to Blanco and
Palencia. That might succeed against CONCACAF rivals, but Italy and
Croatia are another matter
Quick quote: "The ultimate goal is to do better in the World Cup than
any of the previous Mexican teams."--Aguirre
Forecast: Those are the semifinals Aguirre's talking about. That's
the pipe dream. Here's the reality: Mexico will be hard-pressed to

<HD>Nakata Still on Learning Curve</HD>
<DH>Group H: Japan's top player appears to have grown from last
World Cup and his struggles in Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>It's an older Hidetoshi Nakata who comes into this World Cup, but is
he any wiser?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Japan's best known, highest paid and potentially most
influential soccer player has had lessons aplenty since he sprang
onto the international stage at the France '98 World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   What he learned in that time is vital to Japan's chances of
advancing to the second round from a modest group that includes
Belgium, Russia and Tunisia.</LD>
<TE>   Before the '98 World Cup, England's World Soccer magazine talked
about Nakata's "excellent vision, dribbling and possession skills,
rounded off with bold, well-timed passes" and described him as "the
joker who brings out the best in his teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Well, then 21-year-old Nakata and his teammates did not fare too
well in their initial World Cup foray. They were ousted in the first
round after single-goal losses to Argentina, Croatia and Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   It was a humbling experience for Nakata, even though his own
performance led to a second consecutive Asian player of the year
award.</TE>
<TE>   More important, his play--not to mention the shock of his dyed-red
hair--caught the eye of several European clubs. In the end, it was
Perugia that splashed out $3.5 million to bring him to Italy from
Bellmare Hiratsuka of Japan's J-League.</TE>
<TE>   Nakata flourished in Italy's Serie A. It did not hurt his cause
when he scored twice against Juventus in his debut for Perugia, and
his stock continued to rise so that by January 2000 Perugia was able
to realize a healthy profit on the midfielder when it sold him to AS
Roma for $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   The year 2000 marked the beginning of tougher times for the player
known as "Hide," whose rebellious outlook and rock-star dress style
had made him the idol of millions of young Japanese. One indication
of his popularity is his Web site, which receives more than 1 million
hits a day.</TE>
<TE>   At Roma, however, life became more complicated, not the least
because there already was someone occupying Nakata's midfield
playmaking position--Italian national team standout Francesco Totti.
Japan's idol found himself on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was his relationship with Philippe Troussier, Japan's
no-nonsense French coach. It was prickly at the best of times because
of the distance separating them. Troussier was in Japan trying to
build a team that could avoid the embarrassment of becoming the first
host nation not to reach the second round of the World Cup. His star
player, meanwhile, was concentrating on a career in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know him," Troussier told World Soccer earlier this year.
"He comes back just one day before each [national team] match. I
think Nakata has trained with me, in four years, maybe a maximum of
20 days."</TE>
<TE>   The distance between coach and player grew even greater during the
2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, a tournament co-hosted by Japan and
South Korea as a trial run for the World Cup. Japan did well in the
eight-nation event and reached the final, along with world champion
France.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Nakata said he would rather go back to play for Roma
in its Serie A title-clinching match than stick around to play for
Japan against France. Troussier argued in vain, and Nakata, always
stubbornly individualistic, flew back to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Japan, without Nakata, lost to France, 1-0. In Rome, meanwhile, AS
Roma clinched the Italian championship for the first time in 18
years, but Nakata didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   Troussier, unhappy at Nakata putting his own interests ahead of
those of the Japanese team, suggested pointedly that Nakata's place
on the 2002 World Cup team was anything but secure. "Nakata is not
God," he snapped angrily.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was he an AS Roma player by the time the 2001-02 Italian
season rolled around. Roma sent him to Parma for $26 million. Again,
he spent more time on the bench than on the field, leading to the
cruel joke that Japanese fans who follow Parma wear Nakata's Parma
jersey more often than he does.</TE>
<TE>   But this year has seen a turnaround for Nakata. Earlier this
month, he scored a vital goal that helped Parma win the Italian Cup
over Juventus. He also scored for Japan in a 2-0 victory over Poland
in Lodz. It was Japan's first victory in Europe in 31 years and it
marked a visible thaw in Nakata's icy relationship with Troussier.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, he came with five managers, two doctors and a
helicopter," Troussier observed wryly. "Now he comes with a bicycle."</TE>
<TE>   If Nakata is more humble, he is also taking more of a leadership
role at Japan's training base in Fukuroi, southwest of Tokyo, working
with younger players and helping the team achieve the camaraderie
that will carry it into the second round.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons, apparently, have been learned.</TE>

<TE>*--*
World Cup record: Played 34 (16-12-6); goals for: 60; goals against:
40
Best finish: Fourth in 1966
1998 showing: Did not qualify
Coach: Oleg Romantsev. Coached Russia to its last major tournament,
the 1996 European championships, but resigned after failing to reach
the second round. Returned after Russia failed to qualify for the
1998 World Cup
Players to watch: Vladimir Beschastnykh, Yegor Titov, Alexander
Mostovoi, Valeri Karpin, Ruslan Nigmatullin
In brief: Beschastnykh, a forward, is an exciting talent and Mostovoi
is valuable and versatile, playing sweeper and striker during
qualifiers. But Russia has lost four of five games this year and was
booed in Moscow after losing to Yugoslavia in a penalty shootout
during its World Cup send-off match
Quick quote: "The class of our players is not as high as that of the
world's top teams. Our chances depend on team play and our ability to
raise squad morale to the highest level before the start of the
tournament."--Romantsev
Forecast: In this group, second round is a possibility for all except
Tunisia</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>So here I am again, strapped into a stifling metal tube 39,000 feet
above the Earth's surface being fed indigestible and unidentifiable
substances at periodic intervals and surrounded by people of peculiar
odor who elbow me whenever I fall asleep or delight in dropping their
seatback into my lap.</LD>
<LD>   There must be a reason for this beyond the usual masochistic
streak.</LD>
<LD>   There is. It's what awaits me at the other end of this long and
torturous journey through the no-longer-friendly skies. In short,
another World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   OK, before you have that knee-jerk reaction, the one where you
say, "Jeez, it's only a soccer story," and quickly flip the page,
bear with me for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to tell you why Zinedine Zidane, athletically
speaking, makes Shaquille O'Neal look like a cross-eyed, overweight
bouncer in search of the nearest fast-food joint.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to tell you how a Brazilian by the name of Roberto
Carlos can do things with his feet that Eric Karros can't even do
with his hands.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not even going to tell you that there are entire neighborhoods
in Los Angeles where the residents care far more about the new soccer
stadium going up in Carson than any new NFL stadium planned for
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   I have no drum to bang here, no cause to espouse. If you like
basketball, fine. As</TE>
<TE>   far as I'm concerned, there's too much scoring.</TE>
<TE>   If you like baseball, go for it. To me it looks more like eight
guys standing around scratching themselves while two others play
catch.</TE>
<TE>   If you like football, bully for you. But when the next NFL season
rolls around, tell the players to take off the helmets and padding
and play like real men, like rugby players.</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not going to argue the merits of one sport over another.
To each his own, or her own, as the case may be.</TE>
<TE>   But consider for a moment just a few of the things that are going
on beyond the narrow confines of Staples Center or Chavez Ravine.
Consider that there is a whole other world out there beyond Catalina
Island, a world that doesn't give a corner kick if the Lakers won or
the Dodgers lost.</TE>
<TE>   The world out there doesn't even know they were playing each
other.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft I am on is heading for Seoul. At least I trust that
it is. Things are confusing at LAX these days and the place is
crawling with foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine by me. With foreigners I can talk about the real Cobi,
the one who spells his name C-O-B-I, not K-O-B-E.</TE>
<TE>   With foreigners I can debate--in plain English or admittedly
broken Spanish--the merits of Italy's forward line or Mexico's
midfield or Japan's defense.</TE>
<TE>   With Americans, it's not quite the same. All too many of them seem
to think it's important that some guy named Goober or Floyd or Earl
drove his car around in a circle a little faster than some guy named
Earl or Floyd or Goober.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what I like most about soccer in general and the
quadrennial World Cup in particular. It's a sport without boundaries,
without borders. Thirty-two countries will be taking part in the
World Cup over the next month. The United States is one of them,
which is a good thing. Isolationism is a rotten notion, in sport and
in politics.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of it all, a world champion will be crowned in
Yokohama, Japan. A real world champion. A champion who has emerged
from among many nations, not only one. I don't care if it's Cameroon
or Croatia, Paraguay or Poland. What matters is that the whole world
took part.</TE>
<TE>   Can Major League Baseball, the NHL, NBA, NFL and NASCAR say the
same? Not a chance. All they can produce are national champions, not
international ones. World Series? Not until the world is invited.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I have a whole month of treats in store.</TE>
<TE>   Just contemplating the prospect of England versus Argentina or
Brazil versus China or the U.S. versus Portugal is enough to keep my
mind off whatever it is the flight attendant has just placed in front
of me.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the window, the clouds are slipping past. In a few hours,
the plane will start its descent.</TE>
<TE>   The real world awaits. Ole, ole, ole, ole.</TE>

World Cup record: Played six (1-3-2); goals for: four; goals against:
six
Best finish: First round in 1978, 1998
1998 showing: Eliminated in first round
Coaches: Ammar Souyah and Khemaeis Laabidi. The co-coaches are a
stopgap after the sudden resignation of Henri Michel in March. Their
task: Try to get the weakest team in the tournament out of Japan
without too much embarrassment
Players to watch: Zied Jaziri, Zoubeir Baya, Khaled Badra
In brief: Michel resigned after a dismal performance at the Africa
Nations Cup in January; Tunisia did not score in three matches and
failed to reach the quarterfinals. Goalkeeper Chokri El Ouaer
followed, claiming he was retiring from the national team because of
back problems. Bending over to retrieve the ball out of his own net
would have only exacerbated the condition

<HD>GM Sets Price for Hummer H2 SUV; a Lament for Jaguar's
F-Type</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. has always promised that it would bring the
forthcoming Hummer H2 sport utility vehicle in at less than half the
price of its king-size sibling.</LD>
<LD>   True to its word, GM's Hummer division last week said the base
suggested retail price on an H2 would be $48,800. The H1, a civilian
version of the Humvee military vehicle, has a base price of $108,000.</LD>
<LD>   The smaller H2, which was designed specifically to be a civilian
vehicle, will hit showrooms in or around July. It comes with a
standard 6-liter V-8 gasoline engine (versus the H1's 6.5-liter turbo
diesel) that produces 316 horsepower and 360 pounds-feet of torque.
It has a nine-speaker Bose stereo system and 35-inch all-terrain
tires but lacks the H1's standard central tire inflating and
deflating system.</LD>
<TE>   A pair of options packages, Lux for $2,575 and Adventure for
$2,215, will boost the price past the $51,000 mark. The Lux package
adds heated leather front seats and a six-disc CD changer; the
Adventure package adds air suspension, brush guards and crossbars for
the roof rack.</TE>
<TE>   GM says other options, including fog lights and chrome trim
pieces, will be available through dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Financing</TE>
<TE>   Toyota and Honda don't usually play the incentives game, but to
boost demand and respond to incentives from rivals, they have begun
to offer low-interest financing on Camry and Accord models.</TE>
<TE>   Honda started offering rates as low as 2.9% on the Accord this
month and is giving $750 rebates to dealers as it gets ready to
introduce the new-generation Accord in September.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota last week started offering rates as low as 3.9% on the
newest Camry.</TE>
<TE>   Cheerio, F-Type</TE>
<TE>   We reported in the Business section a week ago that Ford Motor
Co.'s drive to staunch its financial hemorrhaging has created a
casualty at its Jaguar subsidiary: the F-Type roadster.</TE>
<TE>   But we did it without lament, and the loss of the F-Type is truly
worth lamenting.</TE>
<TE>   We wonder whether aficionados would rather see Ford ax a few dozen
top executives and use their multimillion-dollar pay and incentive
packages to save the stunning roadster, penned by Jaguar design chief
Ian Callum and first shown as a concept at the 2000 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The F-Type was given the production go-ahead last year by Wolfgang
Reitzle, since-departed head of Ford's Premier Automotive Group,
which includes Jaguar among its brands (with Aston Martin, Land Rover
and Volvo).</TE>
<TE>   Alas, a 2003 F-Type is not to be.</TE>
<TE>   The bobtailed two-seater, which was to have been an "entry-level"
roadster from Jag with a price tag somewhere south of $60,000, is
being put on indefinite hold, said Jaguar spokesman James Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Ford wants all its units, Jag included, "to concentrate on our
core products," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Sad, a little, that at Jaguar these days "core product" means
four-door sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycle Plans</TE>
<TE>   After 101 years in business, the Automobile Club of Southern
California has figured out that a lot of its members ride motorcycles
and would appreciate some of the club's emergency services being
extended to them when they are two-wheeling.</TE>
<TE>   So beginning this month, the Auto Club will add motorcycle towing
to its for-fee services. Cost is $23 a year for up to four service
calls for motorcycles. The service calls can include on-site fixes
such as flat repair and emergency gasoline delivery, as well as
towing to a nearby garage, which usually means trucking the
motorcycle on a flatbed or in a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcycle coverage is offered as an addition to the club's
existing recreational vehicle service program, which now will be
called the RV and Motorcycle Roadside Assistance plan.</TE>
<TE>   Club officials said they decided to add motorcycles to the service
after a study showed a 15% growth in motorcycle registrations in
California between 1997 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be sure that our towing service is available for our
members whether they travel on four wheels or two," said Sharon
Supple, vice president of emergency road services.</TE>
<TE>   Members who purchase the RV and Motorcycle Roadside Assistance
service option will use a dedicated telephone number that directs
calls to Auto Club service counselors who coordinate the special
needs required for a motorcycle tow.</TE>
<TE>   New Ventures</TE>
<TE>   It is an ever-shrinking world.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler, which used to be Germany's Daimler-Benz and North
America's Chrysler Corp., now owns a 37% controlling share of Japan's
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and has a 10% stake in South Korea's Hyundai
Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, DaimlerChrysler executives say they are:</TE>
<TE>   * Developing a 10-year plan to integrate support services for the
Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler and Mitsubishi brands to be able to share
parts distribution, dealer services, logistics and salary payments
across the group.</TE>
<TE>   * Discussing a plan to jointly develop front-wheel-drive compact
car platforms with Hyundai.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Hyundai and Mitsubishi have signed a deal to jointly
develop engines.</TE>
<TE>   Evo Sales Date Set</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi still is doing things by itself, though, and one of
those things is importing the Lancer Evo--the rally-based screamer
that drivers in Europe and Asia have been able to enjoy for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent Rim of the World rally in the mountains above Los
Angeles, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America President Pierre Gagnon
was telling every journalist he met that the U.S. version of the Evo,
with 272 horsepower, would start arriving in December.</TE>
<TE>   The sport compact will go on sale around the end of January.
Because of its name recognition--the Evo has been a mainstay of
several best-selling rally-based computer games--it is expected to be
a hit.</TE>

<HD>Driver Tells How FasTrak Error Stalled in Slow Lane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I read your article on tollway cheaters ("Cracking Down on
Repeat Tollway Violators," Highway 1, May 15), and I would like to
point out that there is a flip side to this issue.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer I received three notices of tollway violations for the
91 Freeway's FasTrak lanes--all stating that my car was there about
5:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is I have never driven in these lanes. In fact, on the
date of the first violation, my car was parked at Los Angeles
International Airport's Lot B while I was in Indiana.</LD>
<TE>   I am still being hounded for payment of these fines despite
providing a receipt for the LAX parking. My request for positive
proof of the violation has been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the system is flawed, but drivers are not the only ones
who are cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Zarow</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Zarow's story sounds like a "Twilight Zone" episode. How
could her vehicle have mysteriously shown up on the 91 Freeway three
times when she says she was nowhere near it?</TE>
<TE>   "I knew they had no proof that my car was on the FasTrak lane,"
said Zarow, an assistant professor of neurology at USC's Rancho Los
Amigos National Rehabilitation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Zarow said she sent the tollway's operators an affidavit and a
second letter explaining that her vehicle had been wrongly
identified. She demanded to see photographic evidence or other proof
that her vehicle had been on the tollway at 5:30 a.m. on July 19 or
on the two other dates in question.</TE>
<TE>   The only response she received, she said, was a letter telling her
to pay up.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out, though, that Zarow was telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Her car's license plate number is nearly identical to that of a
FasTrak motorist who was responsible for the violations, said Greg
Hulsizer, general manager of California Private Transportation Co.
The company owns and operates the tollway, which stretches from
Orange County into Riverside County in privately built center lanes
of the 91 Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   When the real culprit used the tollway without using the required
transponder that identifies paid-up customers, Hulsizer said, the
license plate was photographed.</TE>
<TE>   But when tollway employees reviewed the photos, he said, the
letter "T" on the plate was misread as an "I"--and that made it match
the license plate on Zarow's vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   It's uncommon, Hulsizer said, but license plate numbers and
letters can be obscured by the frame around the plate or by shadows.
The result: ID photos are misread.</TE>
<TE>   He said photographs of license plates are double-checked before
violation notices are sent.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are only human. Sometimes mistakes do get made," Hulsizer
said, and when they do, "we try to make things right as quickly as we
can."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's tollways have had their share of problems through
the years. It's not just cheats who sneak free rides--the subject of
a current crackdown by the tollway operator and the California
Highway Patrol--but also equipment and software glitches that have
resulted in backlogs of unpaid citations.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Hulsizer said, the company did receive Zarow's
affidavit claiming the violation notice was invalid, determined that
the offending vehicle was not hers and billed the responsible driver.</TE>
<TE>   Under company policy, Hulsizer said, Zarow should have been
notified by mail that she was off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   But Zarow said she never received notification. What she did get
was two more notices for violations allegedly occurring about the
same time in the morning on different days.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the paperwork did not catch up with her case in time
to clear Zarow of the other alleged violations.</TE>
<TE>   "Those notices went out before we got her affidavit," Hulsizer
said.</TE>
<TE>   And when those notices went unpaid, the company passed the bills
to a collection company.</TE>
<TE>   Zarow wrote another letter and the tollway operator investigated
the problem, but Hulsizer was unable to explain why Zarow never heard
anything.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, though, after our call to California Private
Transportation, Zarow learned she had been cleared of the violations.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't have to worry now," Hulsizer said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zarow is relieved to have the matter resolved, it took 10
months from the time she received her first violation notice.</TE>
<TE>   After all that, she said, "somebody dropped the ball here."</TE>

<HD>Cut to the Chase</HD>
<DH>History--and defense--are on the side of the Italians as
they go for their fourth Cup championship.</DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>This could be the World Cup where Giovanni Trapattoni meets
Admiral Yi Shun-Sin-hopefully not in person, as since the venerable
admiral died in 1598.</LD>
<LD>   Be that as it may, Italy's coach still might find it useful to
refer to the deeds performed by the admiral more than four centuries
ago. Yi , as naval historians know and you should too, was the
inventor of the "turtle ships."</LD>
<LD>   These ingenious devices were nothing more than wooden ships
armored by encasing them in a sort of shell-hence the name. Yi used
them to such good effect that he defeated a superior force of
Japanese vessels and became a Korean maritime hero in the process.</LD>
<TE>   What, you might understandably be asking, does this have to do
with the World Cup? Well, nothing and everything.</TE>
<TE>   What we are doing here is making a case for Italy, which very well
might not need any help at all. If it does, though, here it is, free
of charge.</TE>
<TE>   Defense has long been Italy's forte. The country didn't win the
World Cup three times simply by singing arias at opponents; it had to
shut them up too. The names of Italy's defensive heroes ring down
through the ages: Franco Baresi being the most recent and Paolo
Maldini the most current.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Trapattoni himself. Known affectionately as "Trap"-a
name Yi would have enjoyed-Trapattoni is Italy's most successful club
coach of all time.</TE>
<TE>   A quick glance at his resume shows seven Italian league titles,
one German league title, two Italian Cups, the European Champions
Cup, three UEFA Cups, one European Super Cup and one
Toyota/Intercontinental Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But, sadly, no World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Not until now.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's team bristles with offensive weapons, just like Yi's
famous turtle ships. There are, for instance, no fewer than six
top-class forwards on the Italian roster: Francesco Totti, Alessandro
Del Piero, Marco Delvecchio, Filippo Inzaghi, Vincenzo Montella and,
perhaps best of all, Christian Vieri.</TE>
<TE>   Trap doesn't need to tell his forwards anything. What he needs to
do is build a shell around them. A defensive perimeter so tight that
nothing can penetrate, and even if it does, there still will be
Gianluigi Buffon or Francesco Toldo in goal to handle the odd shot or
two.</TE>
<TE>   It's a can't-miss plan, an armor-plated way to the silverware.
Here, then, is the route map to Italy's fourth World Cup:</TE>
<TE>   Group A</TE>
<TE>   Mon dieu! Is there nothing that can stop the French? Not here,
there isn't. Coach Roger Lemerre's world champions win the group with
ease. Denmark wilts in the heat and humidity and Uruguay, deservedly
or not, grabs second. Senegal is left thinking how nice it was to
take part.</TE>
<TE>   Group B</TE>
<TE>   Spain, still pawing at the dust like an angry bull over its last
miserable World Cup effort, gores everyone in sight. Paraguay's Jose
Luis Chilavert finds he is not invincible after all. South Africa
trips up and tiny Slovenia finds itself through to the last 16.</TE>
<TE>   Group C</TE>
<TE>   World Cups are not arranged for Brazil to go out in the first
round. Never have been, never will be. Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho
and company run circles around the rest. Turkey is stuffed by Brazil
but has enough to finish ahead of Costa Rica and China.</TE>
<TE>   Group D</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese navigated their way to the Far East centuries ago,
so navigating a way through these shallow waters is no challenge at
all. Can you say Luis Figo, Rui Costa and Pauleta? Second place?
Well, it won't really matter who gets it, so why not say the United
States ahead of South Korea and Poland?</TE>
<TE>   Group E</TE>
<TE>   Don't be fooled by Germany's tragic tale of injuries and lowered
expectations. Coach Rudi Voeller still has plenty left in reserve and
is wily enough to prefer finishing second behind Cameroon and thus
avoiding Italy in the quarterfinals. Ireland and Saudi Arabia are
just along to provide color.</TE>
<TE>   Group F</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "group of death" is overrated. The Swedes are
ordinary as usual and the Nigerians are disorganized as usual. The
much touted Argentina-England rematch in Sapporo turns out to be a
dud. The South Americans boast about winning the group and the
English whine about being the runner-up. Nothing new there.</TE>
<TE>   Group G</TE>
<TE>   Italy has been given virtually free passage to the quarterfinals,
thanks to the draw. Nothing here will give Vieri and company any
trouble, and goalkeeper Buffon will be lucky if he even sees the
ball. Croatia's doddering elders hold on for second, while Mexico and
Ecuador head for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Group H</TE>
<TE>   Among this lot it would be almost a blessing if Coach Philippe
Troussier's Japan won it all, but it doesn't have the goods to do
better than finish second. That means the dull men from Belgium
probably will prevail, leaving the Russians and Tunisians free to do
some shopping before shipping out.</TE>
<TE>   Second Round</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon-Slovenia: Patrick Mboma gallops through the mud-the rainy
season has arrived by now-and slays the Slovenians, whose own star,
Zlatko Zahovic, is totally eclipsed.</TE>
<TE>   Italy-United States: Perhaps that warmup game in Sicily wasn't
such a bright idea after all. The Italians know the Americans' many
weaknesses and exploit them to the fullest. Ciao, Clint Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   Spain-Germany: It's about that time again, the moment when Raul
disappears and the Spanish fold like a tent in a windstorm. The
Germans chose this route intentionally, and Bayer Leverkusen's
Michael Ballack finally gets some revenge on the Real Madrid gang.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal-Croatia: Those red-and-white checkered flags that saluted
Davor Suker and company all the way to the semifinals in 1998 finally
are lowered as the Croatians bow before a rampant Portuguese team
superbly marshaled by Costa &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   France-England: A David Beckham goal off a free kick throws an
early scare into the French, but they turn up the heat when Djibril
Cisse replaces Thierry Henry and win by two clear goals, one thanks
to an English goalkeeping blunder.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil-Japan: Having achieved their ambition by reaching the
second round, the Japanese stand around and watch in awe as the
Brazilians show what they really can do if they ignore the
instructions of dour Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Ronaldo gets a hat
trick.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina-Uruguay: Ugly, ugly, ugly. The referees who have had it
relatively easy up until now have their hands full in this River
Plate classic. The Uruguayans kick everyone in sight, the Argentines
do the same but manage a couple of Hernan Crespo goals as well to go
through.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium-Turkey: With the Japanese knocked out of the tournament
the day before an no one much interested in seeing Nico Van Kerkhoven
tackle Abdullah Ercan, FIFA is reduced to giving away tickets for
this yawner in Miyagi. Oh, yes, Belgium wins.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterfinals</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon-Italy: Every tournament produces at least one classic
game and this is it. The Africans' power, unpredictability and
enthusiasm has them attacking for 90 minutes. The Italians use the
counter while working out of their defensive shell and prevail, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   Germany-Portugal: Coach Antonio Oliveira changes Portugal's
tactics and uses two forwards instead of one. The move bewilders the
predictable Germans, but it still takes a brilliant goal by Nuno
Gomes to beat the tournament's top goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn, as the
Portuguese advance.</TE>
<TE>   France-Brazil: The much anticipated rematch of the 1998 final
turns out to be less thrilling than it should be. The French, minus
injured Zinedine Zidane, have run out of steam and the Brazilians,
saving themselves for the semifinals, are content with a 1-0 win.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina-Belgium: Knowing that Brazil awaits, Coach Marcelo
Bielsa's squad turns it up a notch to play some mind games with the
Brazilians. Juan Sebastian Veron is in top form and Gabriel Batistuta
notches a pair of goals in an easy win.</TE>
<TE>   Semifinals</TE>
<TE>   Italy-Portugal: Curiously, the Portuguese revert to a single
striker, Pauleta, and the Italians have no problems containing him.
Luis Figo causes them some problems, scoring a superb goal from
distance, but Italy prevails on two Vieri goals.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil-Argentina: Scolari plays it scared, using his peculiar
five-man defense and insisting that the forwards get back to help
out. Denied their freedom to improvise, the Brazilians sulk,
especially Rivaldo, and go down by the game's only goal.</TE>
<TE>   Final</TE>
<TE>   Italy-Argentina: It's raining heavily in Yokohama. Trapattoni
throws up the shutters, bolts on the armor plate and closes up shop.
It's scoreless at the half. It's scoreless after 90 minutes. It's
scoreless after extra time. It goes to penalty kicks and Buffon
finally earns his keep with three extraordinary saves The turtle
ships have won. Did you have any doubt?</TE>

France is positioned to win it all again</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There hasn't been a repeat World Cup champion in 40 years, not since
Brazil in 1962, and that team had Pele.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil came reasonably close four years ago, taking its defense of
the 1994 championship to the final round. There, the Brazilians
picked a bad time to run out of Ronaldo and lost to France, which now
steps up for its chance to be pilloried by the doomsayers, and there
have been more than a few.</LD>
<LD>   The case against Les Bleus goes something like this: France won't
have home-field advantage this time, France won't have Didier
Deschamps and Laurent Blanc this time, France won't have a
Paraguay-Italy-Croatia path to the final this time, France won't have
the same burning ambition to win one for the republic this time,
France's star midfielder Zinedine Didane injured his leg in an
exhibition match Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Le blah, le blah, le blah.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane, the best player in this tournament, did tweak his thigh
and will miss France's World Cup opener against Senegal. France
should probably be able to manage that one without him. In 1998,
Zidane was red-carded in France's second match and was suspended for
the next two, against Denmark and Paraguay in the second round.
France managed.</TE>
<TE>   France lost that exhibition in Paris while playing without Thierry
Henry, one of the world's best forwards, and Zinedine Zidane,
probably the world's best player. They will both be in the lineup in
Asia, although Zidane will sit out the opener because of a thigh
injury.</TE>
<TE>   France also has the best back line in the tournament, still manned
by '98 veterans Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly and Bixente Lizarazu.
Patrick Vieira, the key cog in Arsenal's double championship season,
has more than adequately replaced Deschamps in the central midfield.
And Fabien Barthez remains the most entertaining goalkeeper on the
planet-which, admittedly, is not always a great thing for France.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, this French team, unlike the '98 winners, has real
forwards-Henry, David Trezeguet, Sylvain Wiltord. Four years ago,
France won the World Cup without a goal from a forward in its last
four games.</TE>
<TE>   That won't have to happen this time. With a better team than the
one that won four years ago, France will claim the trophy again in
2002. And after dispatching England, Brazil, Argentina and Italy in
the final four rounds, the French will have deserved it.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP A</TE>
<TE>   Subtitled: Three More Warmups for the Cup-Holders. (And by that,
we mean three cushy first-round games for the defending champions-not
the plastic rings in your car cradling the results of your 4 a.m.
coffee run, designed to get you through two more halves of live World
Cup soccer.) France kicks back, Uruguay kicks everybody else, Denmark
hobbles away with second place.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP B</TE>
<TE>   Beating Raul? It has happened before, most notably in 1998, when
Spain, with its and its heralded striker, finished behind Paraguay
and Nigeria and were was eliminated in group play. This time, Spain
postpones its traditional tent-folding until the quarterfinals, shuts
out Paraguay but fails to shut up Paraguayan insult comic/goalkeeper
Jose Luis Chilavert. Only one miracle at a time.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP C</TE>
<TE>   No beautiful games here, especially from Brazil, which shuts down
the samba and methodically dispatches Turkey, China and Costa Rica.
Turkey, visiting in the World Cup for the first time since 1954, is
delighted to discover it has better soccer players than China and
Costa Rica. Highlight of the group: China Coach Bora Milutinovic's
postmatch news conferences, which baffle translators in five
languages.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP D</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper controversy rages in the U.S. camp as Coach Bruce Arena
names Kasey Keller his starter over Brad Friedel. Back-line
controversy rages in the U.S. camp as Arena names his four starters
for the Portugal game and insists they all must play. Americans
recover from Portugal defeat to beat South Korea and tie Poland, and
squeak though on goal differential.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP E</TE>
<TE>   Oh no, no Keano! Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy wins the admiration
of his colleagues by telling his disruptive captain, Roy Keane, to
catch the next flight home, but loses any chance of seeing the light
of the second round. Cameroon, coached by a German, beats Germany,
which could use a Cameroon midfielder or two, for the top spot in the
group.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP F</TE>
<TE>   In between hourly radio updates on the condition of captain David
Beckham's foot, all of England watches the boys tie Sweden (the
tabloids are despondent) and tie Argentina (the tabloids are
exultant) before doing the business in a must-win finale against
Nigeria. Argentina wins twice to take first place and most important
prize of all-a second-round matchup against Denmark, thus avoiding
France until the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP G</TE>
<TE>   Croatia edges Mexico in the opener, and that takes care of that.
Italy and Croatia advance, Mexico and Ecuador start thinking about
the next Copa America.</TE>
<TE>   GROUP H</TE>
<TE>   Belgium's streak of consecutive World Cup ties ends at four,
because even the Belgians can figure out how to beat Tunisia. Japan
also beats Tunisia for its first-ever World Cup victory and a
crowd-pleasing trip to the next round.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND ROUND</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon-Paraguay: The Indomitable Lions send Patrick Mboma at
Chilavert, then Samuel Eto'o, then Lauren Etame-Mayer, then
Marc-Vivien Foe. Chilavert keeps on talking, to himself, muttering
incoherently after a two-goal defeat.</TE>
<TE>   France-England: Or is it an Arsenal intrasquad scrimmage? The
English Premier League champions are represented by Sol Campbell,
Martin Keown and Ashley Cole on England's back line and by Thierry
Henry, Sylvain Wiltord and Patrick Vieira in the French attack.
Confusion reigns in London as emotionally torn fans watch Emmanuel
Petit, former Arsenal midfielder, win it for France.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina-Denmark: Watching highlights of France over England, the
Argentine players give thanks it's not them. Argentina 2, Denmark 0.</TE>
<TE>   Spain-Germany: A mismatch, according to the track records. Spain,
the team that doesn't know how to win, against Germany, the team that
refuses to lose. But this isn't 1990, and Carsten Jancker isn't
Juergen Klinsmann. Spain shocks Germany. Spain shocks Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Italy-United States: Well, Yanks, it was an improvement over 1998.
Now go home and find some fullbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil-Japan: Brazil rolls, Japan claims glorious triumph over
long-since eliminated South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium-Turkey: Enough to make a Belgian soccer fan go cold
turkey. Hope the sake's strong.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal-Croatia: Out with the old, in with the new. Portugal
becomes this year's Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   QUARTERFINALS</TE>
<TE>   France-Brazil: Rematch of the '98 final. Ronaldo feels better this
time. It won't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon-Italy: Indomitable Lions meet the irresistible force,
also known as Italy's eight-man defense. To the dismay of lovers of
wide-open soccer throughout the world: Italy, 1-nil.</TE>
<TE>   Spain-Portugal: The Iberian championship. Portugal is new to this
territory, Spain suspects it might be on borrowed time. Ignorance is
bliss. Portugal 2, Spain 1.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina-Turkey: The Turks are here because it was either them or
the Belgians. But not for long.</TE>
<TE>   SEMIFINALS</TE>
<TE>   Italy-Portugal: Tortured by nightmares of Italy going out of the
'94 and '98 World Cups on penalties, Italian Coach Giovanni
Trapattoni gambles and instructs his forwards to go forward during
regulation. What's this? Goals? By Totti, Vieri and Del Piero? Who
would have imagined?</TE>
<TE>   France-Argentina: Basketball fans switching over from the NBA
Finals quickly agree: This is the real final. Unlike the Lakers, the
French staff carefully inspects all players' meals. Unlike
Sacramento, spectators in Saitama have actual lives. In a classic,
France moves on.</TE>
<TE>   THE FINAL</TE>
<TE>   France-Italy: The last time these two met in a major tournament,
Italy was moments away from claiming the 2000 European Championship,
leading, 1-0, in the 90th minute. The Italian fans were already
celebrating when Wiltord, a second-half substitute, broke free to
equalize just before the final whistle, setting up overtime and
Trezeguet's eventual winner. France won't cut it nearly so close this
time. Trois-peat, anyone?</TE>

<HD>Beekeepers Aren't Just in It for the Honey</HD>
<DH>Insects: For the many Southland residents stung by the
apiculture bug, it's more than a hobby: It's a way to defend the
community against killer bees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As passions often do, the urge to keep bees can strike without
warning. Take Ern Shockley's case.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago, Shockley, now 79, was an attorney with a busy
practice in Los Angeles. Among his clients was a 90-year-old woman
who believed there was nothing better for her arthritis than a good
bee sting. Before Shockley could say "billable hours," he was the
proud owner of 20 hives, and hundreds of thousands of bees.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Reese, 71, was smitten in the late 1970s. One day his wife
noticed that their children, waiting for the school bus outside their
Pasadena home, were staring up into a tree.</LD>
<TE>   The attraction turned out to be a swarm of bees. The Reeses
finally found a beekeeper to remove them. Afterward, the beekeeper
asked if he could keep a couple of his hives in their backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Reese not only agreed, but he soon had 10 colonies of his own
bees, with 20,000 to 30,000 per colony.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Reese is down to two colonies and describes himself as a
"bee-haver." He explained, "Hobbyists are referred to as bee-havers,
not beekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever they call themselves, Southern California has hundreds of
people who keep bees--mostly for fun, not profit. And lest anyone
think they are in it just for the honey and the buzz, local
beekeepers say they are the first line of defense in the effort to
keep aggressive Africanized (or killer) bees from taking over the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   The keepers' numbers are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   According to John Hurley, apiary inspector for the Los Angeles
County Agriculture Commission, residents who keep bees are supposed
to register with his office, but only 41 are on the rolls. Yet there
are about 100 members of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Assn. and
another 100 in the Orange County organization.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley is not surprised that many do not register. The requirement
is not well known, he said, "and it's not like buying a car, where
it's automatic."</TE>
<TE>   Registered or not, professional or hobbyist, local beekeepers are
fascinated by bees. They were the first "domesticated" insects, their
champions will tell you. The ancient Egyptians kept them, eating
their honey and using it to mummify the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Reese is one of those who see local beekeepers as a defense
against Africanized bees. "We who keep good, friendly European bees
are essentially an early-warning system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Reese is constantly studying his hives, he believes he
would notice if an Africanized queen moved in. Then he would
"re-queen" his hive, replacing the aggressive queen with a more
docile European queen that had been mated with European drones.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Webster of East Los Angeles is a second-generation
beekeeper. His father, Jorge, began keeping bees in Compton in the
late 1960s, at the urging of an apiarist buddy.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son now run their own bee-removal firm.</TE>
<TE>   They also keep about 150 hives in a Whittier bee yard. (It is
legal to keep bees in the city of Los Angeles, but zoning regulations
make it hard to do so on a large scale, Webster said.)</TE>
<TE>   Webster, 38, is constantly on the lookout for Africanized bees.</TE>
<TE>   "You keep an eye on your queen," he said. "You mark her back [with
nontoxic dye], and you keep an eye on her."</TE>
<TE>   If an Africanized bee moves in and displaces a European queen, you
replace it with a mated queen guaranteed by its supplier: "You keep
the genetic line really, really docile," Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Bleitz, 49, of Burbank tends thousands of bees in a canyon at
the Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bleitz buys her queens from a reliable vendor, she has a
favorite source for free bees--Los Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo is committed to environmentally friendly pest control,
said Bleitz, who has been hired to keep an eye on its bees.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, she was called in when wild bees built an enormous hive
high up in the new chimp house. Clinging to specially built
scaffolding, Bleitz removed 350 pounds of honeycomb, which was given
to the bears.</TE>
<TE>   "It was driving the chimps nuts, because they could smell it and
they wanted some," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a week, Bleitz checks traps that she has set up at the zoo
to snare bees that might otherwise trouble visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The traps are upended garden pots made of recycled paper.</TE>
<TE>   She baits the traps with a few drops of citrus-scented bee
attractant, and the bees crawl in through the little drainage hole in
the pot.</TE>
<TE>   Bleitz scrutinizes the bees she gathers at the zoo, observing
their behavior and taking measurements to see if they are Africanized
bees, which tend to be smaller and have other distinguishing physical
characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   If the bees pass muster, she may add them to one of her 20 hive
boxes, perched near the top of a sunny canyon in the Verdugo Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bleitz, who never wears banana- or floral-scented sunscreen
because it attracts and roils bees, has a special fondness for the
ones she gathers at the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "I call them mutt bees," she said, "because they're a combination
of everything [bee-wise] that came to California."</TE>
<TE>   Like other local beekeepers, Bleitz sees herself as a front-line
fighter in the battle against the Africanized honeybee.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't stop the Africanized bee," she said. "It's here, but
you can mitigate its presence."</TE>
<TE>   Good home and yard maintenance is one way to discourage them, she
said. Unlike the European variety, Africanized bees will move into an
empty can left lying in a backyard and into a flue or attic
unprotected by fine-mesh screening.</TE>
<TE>   Bleitz thinks encouraging more beekeeping by savvy apiarists also
would help keep the unwanted bees in check.</TE>
<TE>   She would like to see beekeeping allowed in more public areas,
such as Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Hurley doesn't expect to see beehives in Griffith Park anytime
soon, not in a community as litigious as ours.</TE>
<TE>   "Liability is an issue," said Hurley, who has spoken to park
administrators about the possibility. "If [bees] are there with
permission of the city and somebody gets stung, who's responsible?"</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mussen, a UC Davis Extension apiculturist, believes amateur
beekeeping is down statewide as a result of some major setbacks: the
appearance of two different mites that harm honeybees, and the
alarming invasion of the Africanized subspecies.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to be problem after problem after problem," Mussen said.
"It makes beekeeping less fun--more work and less fun."</TE>
<TE>   The passion for beekeeping peaked, he speculated, during the late
'60s and early '70s, when "honey was pure and sugar was
poison--remember those days?"</TE>
<TE>   Mussen thinks the odds are poor that more widespread beekeeping
can save Los Angeles from domination by Africanized bees.</TE>
<TE>   Africanized bees cope better than the European variety with the
more lethal of the two bee mites, Varroa destructor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And once a hive is Africanized, it takes many generations of
breeding before the offspring are as tame as the most ornery European
bees.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not beekeeping is effective in controlling killer bees,
Hurley said, "It's a wonderful hobby."</TE>

<LD>Probable Starters</LD>
<TE>Clint Mathis</TE>
<TE>FORWARD #11</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Conyers, Ga.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Australia (Nov. 6,1998)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Mathis' profile has skyrocketed in recent weeks. The problem is,
he now has to deliver or face the brunt of the heat if the U.S. fails.
But if the New York/New Jersey MetroStar catches fire, so might the U.S.</TE>
<TE>Brian McBride</TE>
<TE>FORWARD #20</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Arlington Heights, Ill.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Honduras (March 25,1993)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Injuries that have resulted in surgery for a blood clot problem
and broken cheekbones have taken their toll. He still has the best aerial
game among Americans and is fearless about mixing it up.</TE>
<TE>Bruce Arena</TE>
<TE>COACH</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>Debut as coach: vs. Australia (Nov. 6, 1998)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Has produced a record 31 wins, more than any U.S. national team
coach, and evaluated 93 players before picking 23-man roster. Neither
guarantees that the U.S. will advance to second round.</TE>
<TE>John O'Brien</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #5</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Playa del Rey.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Austria (April 22, 1998)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: A starter for Dutch league-champion Ajax Amsterdam, he is very
comfortable on the ball and equally useful on defense and offense. But
the Chris Armas injury means he will play defensive midfield.</TE>
<TE>Claudio Reyna</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #10</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Springfield, NJ.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Norway (Jan. 15, 1994)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: The Sunderland player is the playmaker and viewed as the key to
reaching the second round. But strangely, since it runs almost every play
through him, the team looks more fluid without him on the field.</TE>
<TE>Earnie Stewart</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #8</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Point Arena, Calif.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Portugal (Dec. 19, 1990)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: One of only two players on the roster with a World Cup goal, the
NAC Breda player has spent more than a dozen years in the Dutch league.
Uses speed well and has one of the best shots on the team.</TE>
<TE>David Regis</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #6</TE>
<TE>Hometown: La Trinite, Martinique.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Kuwait (May 23, 1998)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: A player who can look good one moment and dreadful the next. A
dearth of left-side defenders made him the obvious first pick. The knock
on Regis: Once beaten, he does not get back and challenge again.</TE>
<TE>Tony Sanneh</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #22</TE>
<TE>Hometown: St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. China (Jan. 9, 1997)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Has the height, strength and power to intimidate opponents but
not enough speed to stay with many of them. Also has a tendency to give
the ball away far too often. Needs to raise game further.</TE>
<TE>DaMarcus Beasley</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #17</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Fort Wayne, Ind.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. China (Jan. 27, 2001)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Youngest and fastest player on the U.S. roster. At 20, the
Chicago Fire winger could be around for four World Cups. The problem is
his slight size, which means he spends a lot of time on the ground.</TE>
<TE>Kasey Keller</TE>
<TE>GOALKEEPER #18</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Lacey, Wash.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Colombia (Feb. 4, 1990)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Sat on bench at Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League
until late in the season. Spectacular in leading the U.S. to the Gold Cup
championship in February. Best shot-stopper of all three U.S. 'keepers.</TE>
<TE>Jeff Agoos</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #12</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Dallas</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Guatemala (Jan. 10, 1988)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Much improved since moving from left back to centerback and
being reunited with Eddie Pope. Susceptible to speed and can be caught
out of position when trying to cover for others, which is often
necessary.</TE>
<TE>Eddie Pope</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #23</TE>
<TE>Hometown: Greenboro, N.C.</TE>
<TE>Debut: vs. Trinidad &amp; Tobago (Nov. 11, 1996)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: A long slump appeared to have ruled the D.C. United defender out
of this World Cup, but he gradually returned to the form that had
European teams interested in him a couple of years ago.</TE>

<TE>Manuel Vidrio</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #5</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Canada (July 18, 1993)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Played for Aguirre at Pachuca in the Mexican League. Not
particularly fast, but very aggressive and a strong tackler. Even broke
fellow national team player Francisco Palencia's jaw in a club match. He
began his career with Chivas in 1992.</TE>
<TE>Alberto Garcia Aspe</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #8</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Honduras (April 26, 1988)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: A leader of Mexico's 1994 World Cup team, he had retired from
international soccer before Aguirre talked him into returning to the
team. At 35, he's now more a defense-minded ball-winner than a playmaker.</TE>
<TE>Gabriel Caballero</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #19</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Albania (March 13, 2002)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Caballero is a controversial selection to Mexico's national
team--born in Argentina, he was naturalized Dec. 11 and played his first
game for Mexico, at 31, in the spring. A favorite of Manager Javier
Aguirre when he led the Mexican League in scoring at Pachuca.</TE>
<TE>Oscar Perez</TE>
<TE>GOALKEEPER #1</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Brazil (Dec. 16, 1997)</TE>
<TE>Briefly:, Nicknamed "the Rabbit" for his quick reflexes, which help
compensate for his diminutive (5 feet 6 inches) size. Excels at coming
off his line. A more adept shot-blocker than Jorge Campos, though about
the same size. Had the starting position, since March.</TE>
<TE>Melvin Brown</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #20</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. United States (Jan. 7, 2001)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Relative newcomer to the national team has stabilized the left
back position with his solid play. Reached the final of the 2001
Libertadores Cup with Cruz Azul, and his play at that time put him in
position to play a significant role with the national team.</TE>
<TE>Rafael Marquez</TE>
<TE>DEFENDER #4</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Ecuador (Feb. 5, 1997)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Central defender who added considerable polish to his game while
playing in France's First Division with Monaco. Replaces injured Claudio
Suarez as the inspirational leader of the defense. Has a pretty volatile
temper that shows itself on the field occasionally.</TE>
<TE>Cuauhtemoc Blanco</TE>
<TE>FORWARD #10</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Uruguay (Feb. 1, 1995)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Mexico's most valuable player, he led the team with nine goals
during qualification despite playing in only seven games and starting
only four. Coming off a strong season with the Spanish club Valladolid.</TE>
<TE>Francisco Palencia</TE>
<TE>FORWARD #17</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Bolivia (June 8, 1996)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Speed and shooting accuracy make him an effective complement to
Cuauhtemoc Blanco. Acquitted himself well for a so-so Espanyol team in
the Spanish First Division this season. Spent most of his career with
Cruz Azul before heading to Spain.</TE>
<TE>Javier Aguirre</TE>
<TE>COACH</TE>
<TE>Debut as coach: vs. United States (July 1, 2001)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Former Mexican national team midfielder hired to rescue Mexico's
stalled World Cup qualification campaign. Took over a 13-1 team,
overhauled the roster, switched to a 3-5-2 formation, emphasized defense
and finished 4-0-1 to qualify.</TE>
<TE>Ramon Morales</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #7</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Brazil (July 12, 2001)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Industrious outside midfielder who marks well and covers a lot
of ground. Work ethic has made him a regular in Aguirre's system. Very
fast, controls the ball well and has a calm presence along the back line
despite lack of international experience.</TE>
<TE>Joahan Rodriguez</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #18</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: Vs. United States (Oct. 25, 2000)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Has speed and some attacking instincts, though isn't counted on
to be a primary scorer. Began professional career at Cruz Azul, but has
developed into an international-caliber player at Santos.</TE>
<TE>Gerardo Torrado</TE>
<TE>MIDFIELDER #6</TE>
<TE>Mexico debut: vs. Argentina (June 9, 1999)</TE>
<TE>Briefly: Hard tackler who replaces the suspended Jesus Arellano in
central midfield and can force the opposition to the outside. One of
three Spanish-based players in Mexico's starting lineup, he spent last
season with Sevilla.</TE>
