<DL>MIAMI BEACH</DL>
<LD>It's a classy art show. It's a funky happening on the beach. It's a
hot social scene. It's a cool video lounge where you lie on a
foam-covered ramp while watching arty pictures on a big screen.</LD>
<LD>   Bottom line: Art Basel Miami Beach 2002 -- the New World's first
taste of Europe's most important art fair -- is about buying and
selling modern and contemporary art.</LD>
<LD>   And here's what you can buy:</LD>
<TE>   A $250 collage made of printed fabric, splats of pigment and bits
of fluff by Los Angeles artist Johnathan Pylypchuk.</TE>
<TE>   A $1,500 watercolor listing the items Winona Ryder shoplifted by
the Basel team Claudia &amp; Julia Muller.</TE>
<TE>   A $48,000 stuffed-animal "Misfit" with the head of a Doberman and
the body of a calf by Cologne, Germany, artist Thomas Grunfeld.</TE>
<TE>   A $275,000 gouache image of a woman by French modernist Fernand
Leger.</TE>
<TE>   A $590,000 patchwork fabric head mounted on a tarnished silver
bowl and encased in vitrine by French-born American sculptor Louise
Bourgeois.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a Rothko," a woman said to her husband, spotting "Maroon
on Blue," one of Mark Rothko's trademark paintings of ethereal clouds
of color. "It's got to be a million."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the price is $8.5 million. And yes, you can buy that too.</TE>
<TE>   But broad as the range of styles and prices is, Art Basel Miami
Beach is anything but a free-for-all. Indeed, the organizers of the
event, which opened Thursday and runs through Sunday at the Miami
Beach Convention Center, are banking on prestige and quality control
to make it a success.</TE>
<TE>   The fair is the creation of Art Basel, a division of MCH Swiss
Exhibition Ltd., which runs a 33-year-old annual fair in Switzerland
that is also called Art Basel and is considered to be the top global
marketplace for contemporary and modern art. Years in the making, Art
Basel Miami Beach was scheduled to debut last year, but it was
postponed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami fair is Samuel Keller's baby, and, as its director, he
calls it "the little sister of Art Basel." It probably won't pack in
50,000 people, as its big sister does, and the organizers decline to
predict attendance or even issue a day-by-day head count.</TE>
<TE>   But their goal is clear. "We want this to be the most important
art show on the American continent, a cultural and social highlight
of the Americas," Keller says.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't easy in an art world where fairs have been
proliferating. But Chicago's marketplace, once the Americas' premier
modern and contemporary art fair, has lost its luster, and Art Basel
Miami Beach has created quite a buzz.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the participating dealers say the Swiss organizers' track
record and selection process have instilled confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a well-oiled machine," says Los Angeles dealer Louis Stern,
who is showing French and American modern art and Latin American
painting at his booth. People like fairs because they can see a lot
of art at one place in a few hours without the intimidation factor of
galleries, and this particular one increases "the comfort level," he
says, because the participants have been screened and encouraged to
bring their best work.</TE>
<TE>   The 160 galleries represented in the fair were chosen from more
than 450 applicants, Keller says. An international committee of 11
dealers, including Shaun Caley Regen of Los Angeles' Regen Projects,
made the selection, coming up with galleries from 23 countries on
five continents. Participants include top-tier veterans of the Swiss
fair, such as Gmurzynska of Cologne, Richard Gray of Chicago, Beyeler
of Basel and Karsten Greve of St. Moritz, Cologne, Paris and Milan,
along with dealers in business for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   At the convention center, participants had a choice of booths
ranging from about 550 square feet to 1,330 square feet, at a cost of
$34 a square foot. In addition, 20 young, cutting-edge
galleries--including L.A.'s China Art Objects and Sandroni Rey --
paid $5,000 apiece to set up shop in shipping containers on the
beach. Total expenses per dealer -- including rental fees, shipping,
transportation and lodging -- run from about $15,000 to $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like a huge gamble, but the dealers aren't complaining.
"It's double the cost of the Art Show at the Armory in New York,"
says New York dealer James Cohan, referring to a prestigious annual
fair sponsored by the Art Dealers Assn. of America. "But the
organizers have done a brilliant job of marketing."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people -- including artists, critics, museum
directors and curators with collectors in tow -- turned out for the
invitation-only opening on Wednesday night. Dressed up in suits and
evening gowns, or dressed down in denim and sandals, the crowd filled
the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   At New York-based Deitch Projects' spacious booth, Japanese artist
Momoyo Torimitsu's "Corporate Warrior" attracted double takes that
turned into fascinated stares. Her artwork is a motorized sculpture
of a life-size -- and very lifelike -- man in a dark suit, white
shirt and tie who lies on the floor and drags himself along on his
elbows.</TE>
<TE>   "I became very interested in competition after I moved to New York
six years ago," she says. "This is an American businessman, and I
would like to make two more, a European and an Asian. The three of
them would bump into each other."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile at nearby Collins Park, where the shipping container
galleries are installed in an enclave called Art Positions, throngs
of people jammed plywood walkways laid over the sand and crammed
themselves into the steaming hot containers. Those who made their way
into the space set up by Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, another New York
gallery, found Los Angeles artist Mark Bradford at work in a beauty
shop as art installation.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother was a hairdresser, my mother is a hairdresser and
I'm a hairdresser," says the artist, who also uses permanent wave
papers to make abstract wall pieces. In Miami he is creating new
hairdos for fair visitors by adding strands of hair selected from a
rack of braids, curls and falls.</TE>
<TE>   The price?</TE>
<TE>   "Just tips," he says. "I'm not doing a full job. It's a gesture."</TE>
<TE>   Many dealers say they made sales at the opening reception. By the
time the doors closed on Thursday, the first public day, others had
put red dots on labels, indicating works were sold, and replaced
small pieces carried away by their new owners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good," says Los Angeles dealer Margo Leavin. Meeting new
clients and reconnecting with old ones, she sold works to collectors
from New York, Florida, Germany and France.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," says Ana Iturralde, who operates L.A.'s
Iturralde Gallery with her sister, Teresa. She is pleased with the
international mix of the crowd, including collectors from Venezuela,
Brazil, Puerto Rico and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone asks, 'Why Miami?' But once you get past that, it makes
perfect sense," Keller says. The city has sufficient facilities
within easy walking distance. Its location is relatively accessible
for South Americans and Europeans. And of course the climate is a
draw.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's art community has rolled out the red carpet with a slew of
openings at museums and private collections. But perhaps the most
telling tribute to the potential power of Art Basel Miami Beach is
the appearance of a piggybacking art fair, Scope, which popped up at
the Town House hotel, just a few blocks from the convention center.</TE>
<TE>   For $3,000, a dealer could get lodging and an exhibition space.
Thirty immediately signed up.</TE>
<TE>   "It came up at the last minute," said one, Los Angeles' Jean
Milant, of Cirrus Gallery. "But I figured, why not?"</TE>

<LD>With 84-year-old Nelson Mandela at her side, American talk show queen
Oprah Winfrey broke ground in South Africa Friday for what will be
the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. She is putting up $10
million for it.</LD>
<LD>   "We are looking for strong, brave girls with heart. I believe
girls are going to take over the world. Men have been in control long
enough but, don't worry, we're prepared to share power," Winfrey said
at the ceremony on the 22-acre wooded site, 25 miles south of
Johannesburg.</LD>
<LD>   The academy's doors will open in January 2005 and Winfrey's
millions will be spent over a decade to build it and run it with the
provincial education ministry, according to Caren Yanis, executive
director of the Oprah Winfrey Foundation.</LD>

<LD>Facing economic woes like a lot of other arts institutions, musicians
at the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have come up with a
self-sacrificing plan that they hope will prove inspirational. They
are offering a $100,000 challenge grant to stimulate public donations
to the orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   For every dollar collected, the musicians will match it with a
dollar of their own, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. "Some
people see their subscription as their contribution to the orchestra.
But ticket sales account for less than 50% of our budget," said
cellist Hampton Mallory.</LD>

<HD>Letterman alley draws a protest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television talk show host David Letterman wasn't even there to see
his college town name an alley for him -- and he was still upstaged.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders in Muncie, Ind., were displaying a sign Thursday
night dubbing one of the city's busiest alleys, "Dave's Alley -- Open
24 hours," when fans of Garfield, the cartoon cat, showed up to
protest.</LD>
<LD>   Cartoonist Jim Davis, who created Garfield, is a Delaware County
resident; Letterman only lived there while he attended Ball State
University.</LD>
<TE>   The two protesters, costumed as Garfield and dog Odie, held picket
signs saying "Dave Bites," "Cats Rule, Dave Drools" and "Alleys are
for cats."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Dan Canan said the eastern Indiana city was planning a
parade next June to honor Garfield's 25th birthday. Apparently, all
Letterman gets is the alley, though officials plan to install a
24-hour Internet camera.</TE>

<DH>Sexy or sober? To figure it out, our intrepid reporter
consults the image doctor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just be yourself, dear. What Mom really meant as she nudged you
toward your first date: Just be your brand.</LD>
<LD>   If Chevys are "like a rock" and State Farm is "like a good
neighbor," why not let out your "boy next door"? Or be a sailor of
tall ships. The ideal running mate. An urban leprechaun.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Christensen identifies these "personal brands" the way an
adman might. The former Hollywood casting director has designed a
technique that helps his clients answer a question the self-help
business rarely asks and one most people take to their grave: What
does everyone think of me?</LD>
<TE>   Christensen calls his life's work "Sam Christensen's Image Design
Process." The patent is pending.</TE>
<TE>   He is not a stylist. He is in the personal marketing business. If
you understand how others see you, he believes, you're more likely to
be a success. In hair and wardrobe make-overs, he says, "what we're
making over to is some standard that somebody else invented. It
leaves out what ultimately is our biggest asset, which is our
individuality."</TE>
<TE>   Christensen hatched his method 12 years ago to get his actor
friends the head shots that better conveyed the personalities he knew
well. Now, professionals from a variety of industries come to his
darkened North Hollywood studio -- not to reinvent themselves, but to
learn how to capitalize on what they've already got.</TE>
<TE>   Passing through the studio's narrow lobby, where actors' photos
are displayed like high art, each client plops into a chair for the
first exercise but says nothing. Christensen, several graduates of
his program and the rest of the class -- maybe eight or so students
-- start checking off adjectives to describe the person they are
seeing for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to mimic is the daily scrutiny that we're put
under," Christensen says.</TE>
<TE>   When I took the chair recently, in my eyeglasses and khakis, the
class' smart-kid bells started ringing. "Intelligent" registered with
all 13 of my evaluators. There was also strong agreement for
"intellectual," "analytical," "logical" and "hard-working."</TE>
<TE>   In short, I didn't strike people as a fun guy.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen's classes quickly progress to conversation designed to
discover an individual's vibe and capitalize on it. Facing a video
camera, students share their biographies, fantasies and quirks while
their classmates react on note cards. When I described my morning
ritual of slicing fruit on cereal, one classmate found me
"comfortable," another "collegiate" and a third thought of the Dewey
Decimal System.</TE>
<TE>   I was gunning for "sexy," and still no one saw it.</TE>
<TE>   As for Christensen, he is 54 and fit, with a tidy gray beard.
Talking with his hands, he lectures from a tall director's chair. He
unabashedly name-drops from his career as a casting director --
television's "MASH" is among his bigger credits -- and as a talent
manager and promoter of theater and musicians. In his office, a full
shelf of his bookcase is occupied by dictionaries and thesauri. Just
as I must have strawberries on my Rice Krispies, Christensen
compulsively makes beds.</TE>
<TE>   He has led more than 5,400 people through his image process. Each
session runs four intense days or, for those who have the time, a
leisurely four weeks. At $695 per student, Christensen has made
plenty of money counseling actors. Lately, prodded by partner Ken
Cortland and other alumni, the guru with the dull sense for business
has realized he is sitting on a gold mine. All of us, Christensen has
discovered, are as curious about ourselves as starlets are.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations pay for their managers to see him. Salespeople enroll
to figure out why they can't close the deal. And recently Christensen
has started counseling members of two groups renowned for being hung
up on their images: teenagers and politicians. "The bottom line is,
it doesn't matter what you do," he says. "Sooner or later, you --
your personality, your own impact -- comes into play."</TE>
<TE>   Christensen's thinking about personal image and branding draws
from Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious, Joseph
Campbell's observations on universal mythology, and the mystique
machine of the old movie studios. Society casts each of us into a
role, Christensen posits, and no one will believe us if we play
somebody else.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some stuff everybody just knows [about us], and we might
as well deal with it," Christensen says.</TE>
<TE>   If we acknowledge our roles -- that is, our images or personal
brands -- and capitalize on them, we can achieve what Christensen
calls a "charismatic moment" by demonstrating to others that we have
accepted ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen laments those he could have helped.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Richard Nixon would still be the president if he had come
up and said, 'You know, look, I'm quick, I'm shifty. I will do
anything it takes to make it work.' "</TE>
<TE>   If Al Gore were to take Christensen's course, he would notice the
comments about him falling into categories. Surely there would be a
"stiff" plank, Christensen thinks. And maybe a "grandstanding" one
too.</TE>
<TE>   My own list of themes sounded like a warped variation of
watchwords I had recited in Boy Scouts: I am sophisticated, grounded,
quick-witted, guarded, logical, hard-working, decent, well behaved,
intellectual and efficient. I am charming, regular, aloof, pedantic,
shy, thoughtful, comfortable and judgmental.</TE>
<TE>   (My facilitator misspelled that last one, but I decided it was too
in-character for me to tell him.)</TE>
<TE>   The themes led to phrases that Christensen calls "essences." These
summarizing statements are supposed to allow us to talk about
ourselves truthfully with new acquaintances, in job interviews, at
auditions, on dates, wherever.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen and his facilitators brainstorm to develop students'
essences, drawing from classmates' feedback and their own talents for
pithy phrases and  mots justes. A back-and-forth with the student
ensues to pick the most apt and comfortable seven.</TE>
<TE>   Here are mine:</TE>
<TE>   Your parents will love me.</TE>
<TE>   Spontaneity by appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Valedictorians are the best kissers.</TE>
<TE>   Attuned to the ebb and flow.</TE>
<TE>   By invitation only.</TE>
<TE>   Still considering all the options.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I could be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   To people who know me, several of these statements resonate
strongly. My friends say they love "spontaneity by appointment," and
cite as evidence my hobby: performing improvisational comedy. That's
the time during the week I set aside to behave however I want and be
surprising. Then I go back to being "by invitation only."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in my class seemed mostly satisfied with their essences.
Tom, a German actor with a regal countenance, "loves baby ducks and
they love me." To those of us who had watched Tom for four days, that
phrase fit him perfectly. To Tom, it clarified an aspect of his
personality. To anyone else, it sounds like nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the class let out, my skepticism kicked in. True
to my essences, I started "considering all the options." How was my
descriptive package any different than an astrological sign that

<TE>   "In the horoscope," Christensen explained, "you're not given the
opportunity to choose." Meaning, I figure, that I can choose to
describe myself as "self-reliant" rather than "aloof."</TE>
<TE>   I continued to test Christensen's assertion that regardless of
where we are or who we're with, our image stays consistent. It did --
I drew the same adjectives from my sister as I did from high school
students in a journalism workshop. As I walked away from a bar one
night, a raggedy guy caught up with me, and before he could even ask
for money, he read what everyone else apparently sees in my face.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa, brainiac!" he said. And that earned him a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   With all this confirming research, I figured I needed to embrace
my brand. I don't waste time guessing what others think about me. I
am more accepting of my lot in life. I pay attention to when I need
to turn up one aspect of my brand or turn it down.</TE>
<TE>   I typed out my essences -- all that is both appealing about me and
is not -- and carry them in my wallet. Naturally, it bothers me that
the slip of paper is not laminated.</TE>
<TE>   I think these cryptic phrases are giving me new clarity and
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I could be wrong.</TE>

<LD>As an old man, the economist John Maynard Keynes once was asked how
he could express views that differed from his own published theories?</LD>
<LD>   "When the facts change, I change my mind," he replied. "What do
you do?"</LD>
<LD>   If you're a great newspaper with a national presence like the New
York Times, you writhe around a bit, trying to find a face-saving way
to explain editorial decisions that appear to fall somewhere between
miscalculation and mistake. At least that's what has been going on
for the last few days in the paper's newsroom, where the decision to
kill two sports columns whose views differed from those of the Times'
editorial page has stirred an unusual amount of internal dissent and
raised questions about editor Howell Raines' penchant for crusading
in the news columns.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, the campaign began in July, when the paper began
publishing stories about the National Council of Women's
Organizations' request that the Augusta National Golf Course abandon
its men-only membership policy. Augusta is home to the Masters, the
sport's most prestigious tournament. Since the club's social
backwardness is exceeded only by its members' net worth, it naturally
declined the council's invitation to join the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the New York Times has published more than 40 news
stories, editorials and columns on the controversy. And, when that
controversy seemed to flag, it published a story about the lack of
notice taken of the issue by CBS, which televises the Masters. One of
the editorials even called on golfer Tiger Woods to boycott this
year's tournament unless Augusta admits female members. Woods was
singled out not only because he is the sport's marquee name but also
because he is African American and, for many years, Augusta was
notoriously racist.</TE>
<TE>   The paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist, Dave
Anderson, wrote a column dissenting from the editorial, reportedly
arguing that Woods was under no obligation to forgo playing over a
dispute in which he was not involved. The piece was killed by the
Times. So, too, was a column by Anderson's colleague, Harvey Araton,
who reportedly wrote that sports-minded women face issues of far
greater consequence than an elite Georgia golf club's distasteful
membership policies.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of the columns created unease in the Times' newsroom,
where there already were questions about the proportionality of the
paper's attention to the Augusta issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big deal to us and very disturbing," said a senior
Times writer, who asked not to be identified. "People feel they're
seeing something new, the idea that everybody here has to march in
lock step. What's really unfortunate is that this is about an issue
that very few people inside the paper think is particularly
earthshaking. Who cares whether a rich woman gets to play golf at
this stupid club?" By Wednesday, word of the unpublished columns'
existence had leaked to other news organizations, and the paper's
managing editor, Gerald Boyd, issued a memo to his staff.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's piece, he said, had been killed because it argued
directly with a Times editorial. "Part of our strict separation
between the news and editorial pages entails not attacking each
other," Boyd wrote. "Intramural quarrelling of that kind is unseemly
and self-absorbed." Araton's piece was not published, according to
Boyd, because its logic was faulty. "Our news columns enforce no
party line," his memo said.</TE>
<TE>   But according to several veteran staff members -- all of whom
spoke on the condition they not be identified -- Boyd's explanations
seemed to many unconvincing and unsatisfactory on at least two
counts.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole [Augusta] issue just isn't as big a deal as we've made
it," said one. "The 'CBS is silent' story really put people over the
edge. That was not, by any standard most of us understand, a
front-page story in the New York Times. This wasn't a war or a hugely
corrupt businessman or anything that really touches the lives of most
people who read this newspaper." In fact, the incongruity of the CBS
story's placement, according to the reporter, made many wonder
whether "this whole thing hasn't punched some of the buttons Howell
acquired growing up in the South."</TE>
<TE>   Other staff members were disconcerted that Anderson had been
prevented from registering reservations about an editorial many of
them also found objectionable. "It's wrong to try and force Tiger
Woods to take up this thing as his issue," one writer said. "It's
actually sort of offensive. Why single out a black man to do it? If
the editorial page wants to do it, that's fine. But when the paper
decides a columnist cannot disagree, it sounds authoritarian -- and
sort of unsavory.</TE>
<TE>   "The message of Anderson's column was 'Let Tiger play golf.'
That's a respectable opinion and it ought to be aired."</TE>
<TE>   By week's end, Raines and Boyd apparently had seen some merit in
that argument. Friday, Anderson said the spiked columns would be
published. "They're going to run both columns sometime this weekend.
That's the plan. I assume there will be an editorial note with them.
I think it's terrific that they've done this. I'm gratified that the
editors decided that they made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Boyd nor Catherine Mathis, a Times spokeswoman, would
confirm that a decision had been made.</TE>
<TE>   Changing your mind -- or admitting that you wrongly made it up in
the first place -- is far more burdensome for institutions than it is
for individuals, even great ones like Keynes. The only weightier
cross to bear is that of assumed infallibility</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore, who participated in the 19th
century Vatican Council that promulgated the papal version of that
concept, once was approached by a woman who demanded to know how far
he thought Pius IX's infallibility extended.</TE>
<TE>   "Madam, that is not an easy question," the prelate responded. "All
I can say is that a few months ago in Rome, his Holiness called me
Jibbons."</TE>

<LD>The American Institute of Architects will not have a Gold Medal
winner in 2003. At a meeting in Washington Thursday, the
organization's board of directors did not achieve the three-fourths
majority needed to select the winner of its highest honor, which is
awarded annually to an architect whose work has had "a lasting
influence on the theory and practice of architecture."</LD>
<LD>   The AIA did not release names of the nominees, in accordance with
the organization's bylaws. Nor would its spokeswoman, Tricia
Chamberlain, say how many of the 48 board members were present for
the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Gold Medal comes up for consideration each year, the
board is not required to award it annually -- there have been only 59
recipients since the first Gold Medal was awarded in 1907.</LD>
<TE>   The AIA did announce other major awards Thursday, including naming
the Seattle firm Miller/Hull Partnership as recipient of the 2003 AIA
Architecture Firm Award, the highest honor bestowed on an
architecture firm. Architect and educator Marvin J. Malecha, dean of
the College of Design at North Carolina State University in Raleigh,
was named the 2003 recipient of the Topaz Medallion for Excellence in
Architectural Education.</TE>

<LD>The most-watched show on television last week wasn't "Everybody Loves
Raymond," the CBS sitcom that appeared atop the Nielsen Media
Research list on Wednesday. That was only the most-watched show in
prime time, with 20.5 million viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Figures released Friday showed that two daytime programs on
Thanksgiving did better: Fox's telecast of the Washington
Redskins-Dallas Cowboys football game (with 24.2 million) and NBC's
coverage of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (with 22 million).</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, also unveiled Friday were the final late-night standings
for the November sweeps period. They showed little change from the
corresponding four-week period a year ago. Jay Leno's "Tonight Show"
on NBC averaged 5.9 million viewers a night, equaling its 2002
showing, while David Letterman's "Late Show" on CBS fell slightly, to
4.3 million.</LD>

<LD>Two early Christmas presents arrive this weekend, as Vanessa Redgrave
and Mary Tyler Moore deliver touching performances in holiday movies
premiering Sunday night. Both play feisty old dames who could easily
have become crotchety cliches in lesser hands.</LD>
<LD>   In "Miss Lettie and Me," airing at 8 p.m., 10 p.m. and midnight on
TNT, Moore's hardened Georgia farm owner slowly learns to love again
when her grandniece arrives for an extended unscheduled stay. In "The
Locket," airing at 9 p.m. on CBS, Redgrave's lonely, ornery patient
at a senior health facility helps a troubled caretaker seize a second
chance at romance.</LD>
<LD>   A cynic might call this a battle of the corporate sponsors: "Miss
Lettie and Me" is the second Johnson &amp; Johnson Special Presentation
(after this summer's "Door to Door") while "The Locket" is No. 214 in
the venerable Hallmark Hall of Fame series. In the truer holiday
spirit, these films share an underlying message: Embrace love and
forgiveness; let go of fear.</LD>
<TE>   "Miss Lettie and Me," which was directed by Ian Barry and adapted
by Dalene Young from a Katherine Paterson short story, is the lesser
movie, marred by an obvious plot and an overly chipper performance
from child co-star Holliston Coleman. But Moore can still, as the
song says, take a nothing day and suddenly make it all seem
worthwhile. Her nuanced transformation is as pleasing as it is
predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's character, Lettie Anderson, lives alone with only her
wounded pride, her farmhand Isaiah Griffin (Charlie Robinson from
"Night Court") and occasional visits from her mah-jongg club to keep
her company. Lettie was devastated when the niece she raised as a
daughter left town, and vowed never to let her herself get hurt
again.</TE>
<TE>   Her quiet existence is disrupted during the holiday season when
her 9-year-old grandniece, Travis (Coleman), arrives unannounced at
her doorstep. Lettie and her niece have been estranged for so long,
she didn't know Travis existed.</TE>
<TE>   The bitter Lettie shuns Travis, leaving the girl to spend time
with Isaiah and his aging mom (a radiant Irma P. Hall). Ultimately,
with the help of Lettie's old flame, Samuel Madison (Burt Reynolds at
his mellow best), Travis teaches Lettie to open her heart again --
just in time for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Locket," directed by Karen Arthur and adapted by Ron Raley
from Richard Paul Evans' 1998 bestseller, the older character does
most of the teaching.</TE>
<TE>   As the story opens, Michael Keddington (Chad Willett), who dropped
out of college to care for his mother, is suddenly at a crossroads.
He yearns to return to school but, after his mother dies, he must pay
off her hospital bills, so he takes a job at a health-care facility
run by Helen Staples (Mary McDonnell). That's where he meets Esther
Huish (Redgrave), the wise if cantankerous widow who gradually opens
up to Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, whose alcoholic father abandoned the family years ago,
has a devoted girlfriend, Faye (Marguerite Moreau), but he feels
unworthy of her, especially after Faye's father schemes to break them
apart. Michael's life is further complicated when a jealous co-worker
falsely accuses him of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Esther, who sees parallels in Michael's life to the thwarted love
in her own past, implores him to follow his heart. Her holiday gift
to Michael of a locket -- symbolic of one person's missed
opportunities -- comes to represent his second chance.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur's subtle storytelling style and Redgrave's invigorating
performance elevate this story.</TE>
<TE>   As Michael takes Esther to visit Thomas, the old beau she has been
waiting half a century to see, she hands the young man her walking
cane in a moment of rejuvenation. The scene later takes a bittersweet
and awkwardly lifelike turn when Thomas' early dementia creates an
unexpected distance.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, she and Michael are reminded of how quickly life
can pass.</TE>

<HD>Success returns, but he's wary of it</HD>
<DH>Despite his hip cachet, jazz singer Jimmy Scott knows he
has to roll with the punches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynell George</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time jazz singer Jimmy Scott got all decked out to celebrate
the Hollywood premiere of a new documentary about his life, the
projector broke.</LD>
<LD>   Chalk it up to yet another variation on one of his recurrent life
themes.</LD>
<LD>   During a screening of the documentary last July, about midway
through Scott's bittersweet, slip-tempo re-imagining of "Pennies From
Heaven," the screen went black. The Egyptian Theatre's auditorium was
packed. It was the eve of Scott's 77th birthday. Friends, fans,
family had driven and flown miles. But the glory moment was
interrupted.</LD>
<TE>   Scott made the best of it. As he always seems to. Someone pulled a
piano from a corner. Someone else sat down at the bench. And Scott
sank into an impromptu performance -- 20 minutes of signature songs
-- for a crowd that could have never dreamed how lucky misfortune
could be.</TE>
<TE>   "I was driving him back to his hotel and was feeling sorry that he
hadn't gotten a chance to see it," recalls Matthew Buzzell, the
producer-director of "Jimmy Scott: If You Only Knew." "He looked at
me and said, 'Baby, was that your machine?' ... I thought, you know,
Jimmy did what he's been doing most of his career. He punted."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the projector rolled without a hitch. Scott, decked
out in his too-big tuxedo with razor-sharp creases, chatted with
friends and fans (including actors James Avery and Robert Guillaume)
in the Egyptian lobby before the screening, then went inside and
spoke to the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank you. Each and every one of you," he said in a voice as
fragile as expensive stemware. "It was your embrace that helped
create a life for me."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   Just 10 years ago, Scott rose from the depths of obscurity to an
odd perch of fame: He acquired a hip cachet; club dates filled with
celebrity faces, his unmistakable voice folded into soundtracks and
college radio playlists as he transformed creaky standards into
complex pieces of modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Only months before, he'd been making do, scratching together a
life back in Ohio as a waiter at Bob's Big Boy, a dishwasher, an
elevator operator. Friends who had known him in his near-glory years
singing with Lionel Hampton's troupe and high-tailing it with Charlie
Parker, or had romanced to his haunting imprint on standards, would,
out of goodwill, plug him into dates in small clubs and after-hour
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   A fortuitous appearance in 1991 singing at the funeral of a
friend, songwriter Doc Pomus, scored him his first recording contract
in decades. And the release of his 1992 Sire Records album, "All the
Way," turned everything around. In the decade since, Scott has been a
Grammy nominee, released half a dozen albums, and has been touring
Europe and Asia for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   This fall he's begun celebrating the fruits of that pivotal
decade. Along with Buzzell's documentary arrives a comprehen- sive
biography, "Faith in Time" (DaCapo Press) by David Ritz. He can add
to the list the reissue of two highly acclaimed but long-unavailable
'60s recordings, "Falling in Love Is Wonderful" (with Ray Charles)
and "The Source," now snipped free from legal red tape. Right about
now, Scott is basking in a second act that has not only resurrected
his career, but also helped to carve out his place in jazz history.</TE>
<TE>   But he's still wary.</TE>
<TE>   All this looking back of late, says Scott, has been educational.
"You don't realize just how much you put into the existence of a
career," explains Scott, relaxing in his black satin do-rag and plaid
shirt and khakis, with his "lady," Jeanie McCarthy. He sits on the
bed in his sunny, triangular room on the top floor of the Culver
Hotel, not far from the Jazz Bakery, where he's headlining this week.
The hotel served as a dormitory for the actors playing "The Wizard of
Oz's" Munchkins, and it's decorated with memorabilia from the film,
including paintings of Judy Garland, one of Scott's childhood heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "This activity of 'show business' has practically been my life.
Then," he shrugs, "there are disgusting parts to think about. But,
I'm glad too. Because you realize that ... there might not be a
second chance to recoup anything concerning your career. But
fortunately, for me, that's the joy. Being able to continue the work
and still love it. It's not a showoff thing for me. It's a life that
I have had to live."</TE>
<TE>   Although Scott is quick to flash his sun-blast of a smile,
collapse into a giggle or charm all passersby with a "How ya doin',
baby?," the dramatic ups and downs of a tumultuous career and chaotic
personal life have marked him. He's frail and cautious after a hard
battle to recover what was his.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, who returned to his native Cleveland in the mid-'90s, knows
that much of his suspicion is tangled up in years of bad choices and
even worse luck. It's difficult to throw off old habits. For all of
his shrug-it-off optimism, there's a flinty flip side. "He doesn't
trust anybody," McCarthy says flatly. "That's how he deals with it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, says Scott, "I've put limits on my trust."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's struggle in the music industry and beyond was made even
more complex by a congenital condition called Kallmann's Syndrome, a
hormonal disorder that stunted his growth, interrupted puberty and
thus relegated his voice -- richly textured but soft -- to the higher
octaves.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd be a singer," Scott recalls. Music was
something he fell into. "My art teacher had me sing a song about
'Ferdinand the Bull,' that's how I -- and everyone else -- found out
I could sing."</TE>
<TE>   Then he couldn't seem to stop. "The older entertainers around
Cleveland would sneak me in the clubs and give me a couple of bucks,
then send me home, right quick!"</TE>
<TE>   But Scott attributes his skill and fortitude to his mother,
Justine, "her spirit, her creativity." "She had us singing all kinds
of ditties. So you learned that, hey, you can take a taste of it all.
People look at me strangely when I tell them my choice of singers
back there was Paul Robeson. But the man told a story so profoundly.
When I was a kid and I said to Ma, 'If Moses don't go down there and
let them people go, that man's going to die!' That's the emotion I
got out of it. He was such a profound storyteller in the song."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it explains why Scott doesn't fall for just any song --
and why those songs become hard-wired into the listener's memory.
"Honey, let me tell you, the lyric and the story within the song was
an important thing for me. I picked songs that meant something or at
least made the audience think about their own lives."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't matter if it was a ballad or a pop song. "It was the
thoughts, the emotions, that come out of you. You're not interested
in the form of the song. But what the song is about."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary and the book are preservationist acts: a formal
way to slip Scott, who had long been omitted or misidentified on
liner notes or excised from jazz history books, into his proper
place.</TE>
<TE>   But as much as outside circumstances have blocked his way, Ritz
has noted something else about Scott's struggles. "Certain people
don't know how to embrace success because they never had it," the
author says in an interview. "And Jimmy got close four or five times
in his life and lost it. Sometimes he's walked away himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been behind the beat -- in his singing. In his life.
So meeting this new thing called 'international success' is like
anticipating the beat. And that is something that Jimmy doesn't do.
If you anticipate the beat, you lose your groove."</TE>
<TE>   A few nights later, working Elton John's "Sorry Seems to Be the
Hardest Word" at the Bakery as if doing a high-wire act, Scott
manipulates both the tension and emotion in the room -- sometimes
simply with a pause. He barely breaks a sweat as he moves about the
stage in his forest-green tux and matching slippers.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in this space, where he can control the pace, the pauses,
he's at ease. Free.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've learned, just like the title of the book, you have to
have faith in time, that things will be rightly handled," he
explains.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the lyric in 'Without a Song' -- a lot of that, for me,
depicts the truth. 'I got my troubles and woes / But sure as I know
the Jordan will roll / I'll get along as long as my song is strong in
my soul.' "</TE>

<HD>Anthony Wilson lets soloists stretch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guitarist Anthony Wilson's dance card has been pretty much dominated
by Diana Krall for the past year or so. Not that there's anything
wrong with grooving around the world as a vital part of the rhythm
section for the most visible, breakout jazz artist of the past
decade.</LD>
<LD>   But Wilson, the son of noted jazz composer and bandleader Gerald
Wilson, has other goals in mind as well. One of the most important is
the music of his nine-piece ensemble. On Thursday at Rocco's in
Hollywood, he made an extremely rare appearance with the group,
concentrating for the most part on trying out a lengthy new suite
titled "Tokyo Wednesday."</LD>
<LD>   In the suite's untitled segments -- which ranged from open, airy
passages to in-the-pocket rhythmic grooves -- he provided ample
opportunity for the fine soloists in his ensemble to stretch out.</LD>
<TE>   The results were extraordinary, especially in the presence of the
wildly idiosyncratic playing of veteran tenor saxophonist Benny
Wallace, the crisp bop stylings of pianist Donald Vega and the
muscular swing of baritone saxophonist Adam Schroeder (two young
players with enormous potential), and Wilson's combination of
articulate musicality and passionate swing.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Darek Oles and drummer Mark Ferber drove the ensemble with
turbocharged rhythmic energy, balancing laid-back textures with gusts
of propulsive power, tossing in their own sterling improvisational
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   As musically (and financially) rewarding as his gig with Diana
Krall may be, Wilson is correct in working to keep the imaginative
music of his nine-piece ensemble alive. In "Tokyo Wednesday," he has
the perfect vehicle for the band's next recording.</TE>

<HD>Arledge was good, but he wasn't God</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Wide World of Roone has just gotten wider.</LD>
<LD>   What is it about eulogies? Why can't we celebrate the dead for who
they were instead of for who they weren't? It's as if the reality of
their lives was not good enough, making it necessary to wrap them in
gauzy, feel-good fantasy.</LD>
<LD>   That was true for Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. Only
after she died did we learn from teary media mourners that Diana was
America's "princess of hearts." Only after his death did we learn
from the same black-creped TV crowd that Kennedy was "America's
prince," which happens also to be the title of a new TBS movie about
him.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes Roone Arledge, the media royal who died Thursday at age
71. Arledge left deep footprints in television, first as vice
president and later president of ABC Sports, then as head of ABC
News.</TE>
<TE>   But not this deep.</TE>
<TE>   "The man who invented the way we watch TV has died," KABC anchor
Marc Brown read from a TelePrompTer on Thursday night. Oh, please.
Why not go ahead and say he invented TV itself?</TE>
<TE>   Which Michael Eisner, chief executive of ABC owner Disney, came
close to doing on Thursday's "Nightline," saying Arledge had "created
modern television." Didn't Oprah do that?</TE>
<TE>   "A force of nature," perhaps. That's what ABC's Ted Koppel called
Arledge at the top of "Nightline's" affectionate but mostly measured
tribute to his former boss. But the Creator, the Supreme Being
responsible for all of television as well as thunderbolts. The Big
Fella himself?</TE>
<TE>   Some people at ABC should get a grip.</TE>
<TE>   There was more of this earlier when Charles Gibson, host of ABC's
"Primetime Thursday," announced that Arledge had "reinvented
television news." And on Friday a front-page headline in this
newspaper said he "revolutionized the coverage" of news and sports.</TE>
<TE>   Sports, all right. But news, no way. Instead, some of his
eulogizers have reinvented hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   Give Arledge credit. Lots of it. He was, indeed, a visionary of
great influence, one whose legacy was profound and largely positive.
Even if he did stumble from time to time. And even if ABC's Summer
Olympics coverage did jingoistically unfurl itself like Old Glory
under his leadership, a flag-waving tradition later extended by the
Patrick Henrys at NBC.</TE>
<TE>   It was Arledge, after all, who gave America "ABC's Wide World of
Sports" and groundbreaking "Monday Night Football," and personally
snipped the umbilical cord on newborn instant replay and slow-motion
replay so that viewers for years to come could see every play again
and again and ... please, not again.</TE>
<TE>   He also knew talent. He realized there was much more to Howard
Cosell than IQ, arrogance, ego and nastiness. He created "World News
Tonight" and saw that Peter Jennings could become a major star with
credibility as its anchor. He was also master of the clone. Grabbing
the coattails of "60 Minutes" -- which was created by Don Hewitt at
CBS, let's not forget -- he fashioned the second most influential TV
magazine in history, and named it "20/20."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't create Koppel, but it was under Arledge's watch that
"Nightline" surfaced and became a late-night institution, building on
the ratings momentum from the Iran hostage crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But reinvent TV news? Revolutionize it? Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone did that in the last 20 to 25 years it was Ted Turner,
whose creation of CNN and its companion "Headline News" forged a
24-hour news cycle that put information on a perilous racetrack with
hairpin curves. The result? A redirecting of the rest of daily
journalism to meet the challenge of the CNN beast, which acquired its
own competitors on the 24-hour news front. If not for Turner, in
other words, there would be no MSNBC or Fox News Channel and thus, no
Bill O'Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   That's reinvention. That's revolution.</TE>
<TE>   And that metamorphosis will expand should reports be true about
ABC News being on the verge of a cost-cutting merger with CNN that
would shrink news diversity and be a terrible thing for journalism
and the nation.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders how Arledge would have responded to that.</TE>
<TE>   His resume is already so vast and thick, why do some feel the need
to add a faux sheen? "Nightline" has been great for America, and
Barbara Walters could make even Saddam Hussein cry. When it comes to
TV news coverage from the drafting board on up, however, Turner's
asterisk will loom largest.</TE>

<LD>BURT Prelutsky's article ("The rites and wrongs of crediting script
rewriters," Nov. 30) should be required reading for everyone in the
entertainment business. That there are people who would dilute or
even deny credit to the original writer is beyond absurd. One last
time, can we all say it together? The original writer is where it all
begins. If he hadn't shown up with his script, everyone else would be
painting houses.</LD>

<HD>The museum as theme park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TO say that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has been co-opted by
the local entertainment industry because of its "Keith Edmier and
Farrah Fawcett 2000" show misses the larger point (Letters, Nov. 30).
This is a national (if not international) epidemic affecting art
museums on all levels, from the small regional ones (e.g. Laguna Art
Museum, "Surf Culture") to the larger powerhouses (e.g. Guggenheim
Museum, "The Art of the Motorcycle").</LD>
<LD>   In a country where the "pursuit of happiness" is a promised
"right" and success is defined in terms of the absence of pain, it is
not surprising that such a sacred, often difficult, institution as
the museum has been demeaned to the level of a user-friendly theme
park.</LD>
<LD>   For post-modern America, entertainment is the omnipresent drug of
choice, from teachers performing stand-up comedy to animal acts in
the Crystal Cathedral. It is our mindless means to escape the pain of
intellectual and spiritual demands on the way to having a nice day.
Museums have had to turn to entertainment in order to be relevant and
survive in a society looking for the eternal smile.</LD>

<LD>EVERY time I'd tell one of my friends that Michael Jackson was once
again on the L.A. airways, they were unaware he was back. Yes, let
the market decide, as Jess Cortland asked in his letter (Nov. 30) --
but KLAC-AM did almost no promotion of his show, and that's the real
crime.</LD>
<LD>   To me, Jackson will always be the quintessential talk show host.
Let's hope he finds a home in L.A. soon with a station that can
promote and nurture his brand of "intelligent talk."</LD>

<LD>BOB Baker's observations about our local news stations are,
unfortunately, spot on ("A 7 1/2-hour game of trivial pursuit," Nov.
29). After traveling the country a great deal lately, I can only
report the problem is pandemic. The country is flooded with reporters
who've been taught to smile and (sometimes) enunciate, yet exhibit
talent for little else. I often wonder if they've invested as much in
their journalistic education as they did in getting their teeth
capped. Where's the actual story, you fool?</LD>

<LD>Tim Rutten's article was an excellent commentary on the ill-advised
choice of Henry Kissinger to head the investigation of Sept.
11("Kissinger kiss-up: Media not doing their job," Dec. 4). It
clearly detailed his duplicity while in government service, as well
as the media's fawning deference to him.</LD>
<LD>   However, I find it ironic that the article was buried on the
bottom of the Calendar section where it could be easily missed,
rather than on the opinion page. Will the cover-ups never end?</LD>

<LD>FOR Michael Crichton to assert that the post-Freudian world will see
an end of coming-of-age novels seems premature ("Tall tech tales," by
Bettijane Levine, Nov. 29). Certainly, novels reflect the context of
the times they are written in, but the coming-of-age conflict is as
old as literature itself. A third of "The Odyssey" explores the
maturity of Odysseus' son, Telemachus. The story of Moses is one of a
young hothead maturing to return and free his people, as Robert Alter
points out in his "The Art of Biblical Narrative." And so on.</LD>
<LD>   Although these examples are not novels, as literary forms changed,
the story has remained much the same. Perhaps our new youths finding
adulthood will undergo different types of feats -- but based on Harry
Potter's latest exploits, perhaps not.</LD>
<LD>   As long as young men and women continue maturing, coming-of-age
stories will continue to resonate. Crichton might try his hand at a
tale of endless childhood and defend his thesis -- theoretically, a
tale more terrifying than carnivorous dinosaurs and evil
nanoparticles.</LD>

<HD>A modern departure for old-music singers</HD>
<DH>Anonymous 4 leaves its signature medieval sounds off a new
program of carols.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems entirely appropriate that the four women who comprise the
early music vocal ensemble Anonymous 4 would get snowed in in Omaha
on Monday, the day after premiering their touring program "Wolcum
Yule." The songs are wintry and Christmasy, and one is even called
"Snow Carol."</LD>
<LD>   But soprano Johanna Maria Rose didn't appreciate the charming
synchronicity of it all.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a day from hell," she said, by phone from tour stop No. 2,
Arcata, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   The "Yule" program is something of a departure for Anonymous 4 --
which also includes Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer and Jacqueline
Horner, whose voices are almost equal in range, tending toward
soprano. It started in 1986 after the original members (all but
Horner) came together at a medieval culture workshop at a monastery.
This is the first concert they've done that features no medieval
music. And it is only the third project that involves not just modern
or contemporary music, but also brand-new music, songs the quartet
has commissioned.</TE>
<TE>   With a dozen mostly medieval discs to its name, the quartet might
be tempting fate. Critics everywhere like to compare them to a chorus
of angels, an ethereal effect created by their dead-on pitch and
unique timbral blend, sustained by a steady diet of mostly Latin
plainsong and chant. That formula has sold more than a million
recordings worldwide, including their latest, "La Bele Marie," which
hit No. 7 on Billboard's classical chart and stayed there for 15
weeks, and "11,000 Virgins," featuring songs by Hildegard of Bingen.</TE>
<TE>   But, in fact, the "Yule" program has plenty of connection to
Anonymous 4's modus operandi: It's the product of prodigious
research. The group usually tours and records based on one research
project at a time. The "Yule" program is taking its live bow through
Dec. 20; it won't be released on CD until next fall..</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who shares research duties with Genensky, says her "Yule"
studies began last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the one who was the shepherdess for this program. A friend
in Germany helped me dig up some stuff, and she sent me various
collections and books about the subject. I also used the 'New Oxford
Book of Carols,' where I found a carol from Dorset, in England, the
west country. I was able to contact the Dorset County Museum and have
them e-mail me JPEGs [compressed graphic images] of manuscripts from
the 1800s."</TE>
<TE>   The other element of the program, newworks, brings up a different
kind of research. Which composers do you ask to create a carol, and
what makes something a carol?</TE>
<TE>   Rose says it comes from the French word carole, a dance done in a
circle. "It's believed that it derived from ancient pagan rites, so
the term became known for songs that had a kind of call and response,
which then turned into a verse and refrain.</TE>
<TE>   "Carols were not at first specific to winter, or Christmas, at
all," Rose adds. "There were carols or round dances for different
kinds of festivals. Eventually, in the later Middle Ages, the carol
became more specific to winter and Christmas. The form can vary now;
it no longer needs to have a verse and refrain and can be more free.
A carol is generally accepted as a short piece that has to do with
winter celebrations."</TE>
<TE>   Ergo: the element of snow. One of the composers Anonymous 4
commissioned is Briton Jocelyn Pook, perhaps best known for her score
for Stanley Kubrick's final film, "Eyes Wide Shut." Pook was
recommended to Rose by John Schaefer, host of a syndicated radio
program, "New Sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Pook set her "Snow Carol" to a poem she asked England's poet
laureate, Andrew Motion, to write. Although it makes no reference to
Christmas, Rose points out that it has snow imagery and a reference
to angels.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as close as it comes to being a carol. It's all around the
edges; it's not stated directly at all. It's a carol because Pook
says it's one," Rose adds with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The other contemporary composer is another Briton, Peter Maxwell
Davies, who has written chamber music, operas, symphonies and film
scores. His "A Calendar of Kings," Rose says, is a dissonant,
technically difficult, challenging piece. "We picked Davies -- we had
heard his music and he's obviously very well known -- because we were
interested in trying something a bit more dense, more crunchy, which
his music tends to be. It has a beautiful text about the quest of the
three kings looking for their star."</TE>
<TE>   Davies has called the work, set to an existing poem by George
Mackay Brown, a musical journey reflecting the journey of the three
kings. "However," Rose says, "it bears absolutely no relation to the
original meaning of the word 'carol.' "</TE>
<TE>   Angels seem to be a recurring theme. Anonymous 4's next program is
called "American Angels." Santa Monica-born Genensky is doing the
research for this project, an exploration of early shape note and
gospel songs from the 18th and 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, says Genensky, the project is about the "roots of
roots music.... We go back to the very earliest American rural sacred
music and follow the trail through the 19th century and country
gospel. The first concert is in April as part of a semester-long
residency we're doing at Princeton University. After that, we return
to our medieval roots with a second Hildegard program."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Christmas music attracts audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "Carols are popular because they are a connection to ancient
traditions," Rose says. "In spite of the fact that we have lost so
many connections, the cycle of the year is something I think is so
ancient, so part of us. Even though we're not aware of it as we used
to be, it's reflected in the original cycle of the carol, the
circular nature."</TE>

<HD>Pianist Lang: a wayward spirit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 20, pianist Lang Lang combines formidable -- if limited --
technique, uncanny showmanship and stylistic waywardness and
vulgarity. That's a potent mix that has jump-started his career and
doubtless will carry him a long way.</LD>
<LD>   It generated two encores after a widely cheered performance of
Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto Thursday with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion: Liszt's arrangement of
Schumann's song "Widmung" (Dedication), almost amateurish in Lang's
reaching for expressivity, and the pianist's own arrangement of
"Stars and Stripes Forever," which got the Philharmonic audience
clapping along. Move over, Horowitz.</LD>
<LD>   Lang dedicated "Widmung" to Mehli Mehta, who died in October at
age 94.</LD>
<TE>   In Tchaikovsky, Lang played very loud and very soft, though hardly
anything in between. He ventured the fastest, hardest octaves and the
jazziest rhythms imaginable. He threw conductor Zubin Mehta at least
one curve by suddenly changing the dynamic in one phrase from loud to
soft, then back to loud.</TE>
<TE>   But Mehta, the old pro, didn't miss a beat. If anything, the
conductor leaned over occasionally to emphasize where the beat was
and perhaps to remind the young innovator that they were supposed to
be playing the same game. Tchaikovsky, however, seemed quite
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta opened the program with a steady, monochromatic account of
Liszt's nearly monothematic "Orpheus," and followed that with a
sprawling reading of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   In both works, the Philharmonic brass and winds were surprisingly
sloppy and prone to pitch problems.</TE>

<HD>Charlie Brown, old or new, still charms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When ABC broadcast "A Charlie Brown Christmas" for the first time
last year, after it had been on CBS since 1965, the network presented
a digitally remastered version and added an informative
behind-the-scenes feature. The hourlong package was a ratings winner,
and the mini-documentary earned an Emmy nomination.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday at 8 p.m. and repeating Friday at 9 p.m., ABC is looking
to match that success by following the holiday classic not with a
"making of" segment, but with "Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales," a
collection of new animated vignettes based on the comic strips of the
late Charles M. Schulz.</LD>
<LD>   Although the five shorts, each focusing on a specific "Peanuts"
character, are faster-paced and more slickly animated than the
original, they are just as charming. There's no overarching story
line here, but the same message of peace and joy amid life's little
anxieties resonates throughout.</LD>
<TE>   In the first vignette, Snoopy faces rejection from Lucy as her
ice-skating partner -- and from the cat next door.</TE>
<TE>   The next four segments feature Linus, Sally, Lucy and Charlie
Brown each struggling over letters to Santa or the objects of their
affection, among other escapades.</TE>
<TE>   The humor is classic Schulz, and the punch lines come quickly, as
opposed to the more languid timing of the original Christmas special.
Perhaps that's a concession to viewers brought up on quick-cut
videos, but it also makes sense, given that the source material is
from comic strips. More important, it's a refreshing change-up from
director Larry Leichliter.</TE>
<TE>   Although Schulz died in 2000, two key players behind the 1965 show
were involved with this special: executive producer Lee Mendelson and
producer Bill Melendez.</TE>
<TE>   With efforts like these, it's a welcome thing that Christmastime

<LD>When Jesselito Bie, artistic director of San Francisco-based
Steamroller, enters naked to a voice-over spewing his vital
statistics, flaunting a Mylar-covered Hula Hoop, you suspect you're
in for, well, a visceral experience. Neither he nor his company
disappointed the audience: Bie's 45-minute work, "Young Gods
(Revisited)," proved the main event at Highways Performance Space on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Paired with (and presented by) Cid Pearlman's locally based
Nesting Dolls, the program, billed as "Nesting Dolls vs.
Steamroller," was no contest. Steamroller, in its Los Angeles debut,
left the Dolls in the dust. Bie's work, a witty and fearlessly
athletic treatise on beauty, took its musical cues from such
disparate sources as Smashing Pumpkins and the Crystal Method, while
Bie's taped narration was also a hoot.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with a quasi-catfight at a ballet barre, the work
featured vignettes in which posing, preening and gymnastic gambits
ruled. Arnel Alcordo, Jennifer Chien, Lena Gatchalian, Ami Student,
Yayoi Kambara and Bie spoofed "Swan Lake," disco dancing and working
out, in a style Bie rightfully dubs guerrilla dance.</LD>
<TE>   Alas, Pearlman's premiere, "High Fall" -- in seven parts featuring
Ann Kaneko's video projections (apples, dancers, pampas grass) -- was
hampered by bad rock music, lack of meaningful through line and an
over-dependence on props.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen able dancers, working with limited movement vocabulary,
did little besides twirl, thud to the ground and roll on the floor.</TE>

<HD>Global's Headquarters May Be Sold to Tom Gores</HD>
<DH>The L.A. financier will buy the Beverly Hills campus for
more than $50 million, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He didn't get the company, so he's settling for the headquarters
instead.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles financier Tom Gores, who lost out on the bidding for
fallen telecommunications giant Global Crossing Ltd., will soon own
one of the firm's crown jewels: the posh Beverly Hills campus where
Chairman Gary Winnick ran his empire from an oval office reminiscent
of the one on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Gores has a contract to buy Global Crossing's former 2 1/2-acre
campus on Santa Monica Boulevard and North Crescent Drive from
Winnick for more than $50 million, knowledgeable real estate sources
said. The deal would be one of the largest Beverly Hills office
transactions in years, valued at more than $400 per square foot.</LD>
<TE>   "That's way, way over market value," said Howard Sadowsky, vice
chairman of real estate brokerage Julien J. Studley Inc., who
negotiated separately with Global Crossing on behalf of a possible
tenant. The price may make sense for Gores, however, because he
intends to move his company into the property, Sadowsky noted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the classic, beautiful office buildings in Southern
California," Sadowsky said. "It's like walking into the White House.
The land and the setting can't be duplicated."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick bought the property for $41.5 million in 1998 through a
partnership known as North Crescent Realty V. It housed the
headquarters of Global Crossing, Asia Global Crossing and Winnick's
Pacific Capital Group and Colony Capital investment companies.</TE>
<TE>   Though Global Crossing was technically headquartered in Bermuda
and had substantial offices in Rochester, N.Y., the seat of power was
clearly in Beverly Hills, where Winnick, co-Chairman Lodwrick Cook
and Chief Executive John Legere kept offices. The new owners spent an
additional $7.5 million on an elaborate restoration of the property
that was closely supervised by Winnick. (Most of the company's
executive offices are now in Madison, N.J.)</TE>
<TE>   The buildings are nearly vacant today after housing as many as 250
employees during Global Crossing's peak. The property was put on the
market after several unsolicited offers were made, real estate broker
Martin Morganstern of Cushman &amp; Wakefield said in September.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Morganstern nor Global representative Gregg Ritchie
returned phone calls requesting comment. Mark Barnhill, a spokesman
for Gores' company, Platinum Equity, said: "We do not discuss whether
or not we are considering potential acquisitions."</TE>
<TE>   But other real estate sources said Gores has put down a
nonrefundable $5-million payment on the transaction, which is
expected to close in February. Under terms of the pending deal,
Winnick would get to keep his office at the site for another year.</TE>
<TE>   The property includes two buildings totaling about 124,000 square
feet, a parking structure, lush gardens, reflecting pools and
fountains. The complex dates to the late 1930s, when it was designed
by Los Angeles "architect to the stars" Paul Revere Williams under
the direction of "agent to the stars" Jules Caesar Stein.</TE>
<TE>   Stein, an ophthalmologist and musician, founded the Music Corp. of
America in 1924. He abandoned his medical career to book dance bands
and singers at speak-easies and nightclubs on Chicago's South Side.
By the mid-1930s, MCA represented more than half of the major bands
in the country. Stein then moved to Hollywood, where he signed such
famous names as Bette Davis, Fred Astair and Greta Garbo.</TE>
<TE>   For a headquarters suitable for his highflying image, Stein turned
to Williams, a USC-trained architect who had designed mansions for
automaker E.L. Cord and actor Lon Chaney.</TE>
<TE>   Stein wanted a classic domestic ambience that Williams helped
deliver by using white painted bricks that were actually larger than
normal but appeared normal-size from a distance, thereby making the
building appear smaller. He added green shutters, a portico and a
decorative cupola to the two-story, neo-Georgian structure.</TE>
<TE>   Details included elegant, sculpted moldings, railings, cornices
and paneling. In addition to 30 offices, it included a projection
room, a radio station and a hidden bar that would swing into position
at the touch of a button. It sat on a plaza entered through massive
iron antique gates, which Stein bought in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Stein's protege and successor, former theater usher and publicity
man Lew Wasserman, went on to run burgeoning MCA from the famous
office for decades. In 1964, MCA sold the property to Litton
Industries, whose president, Tex Thornton, hired Williams to design a
second, larger three-story building that complemented the original.</TE>
<TE>   Gores is president, chief executive and owner of Platinum Equity,
a private mergers, acquisitions and management company.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old lives in Beverly Hills and is listed on the Forbes
list of wealthy Americans as having a net worth of $1.5 billion. He
and his older brother, Alec, joined forces to bid on the assets of
Global Crossing last summer before two Asian companies struck a
pending deal to pull the company out of bankruptcy protection. Alec
Gores' Los Angeles company, Gores Technology Group, has often
competed with Platinum Equity to buy tech businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Alec Gores did beat Tom to one of Gary Winnick's trophy
properties, however. In September, Alec Gores bought Winnick's Cape
Cod-style house in Malibu with half an acre of land for close to the
$9.8-million asking price.</TE>

<HD>Joblessness Takes Surprise Upturn</HD>
<DH>Loss of 40,000 jobs in November, mostly in retail and
manufacturing, shows recovery's sluggishness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 6% last month,
matching an eight-year high set in April, the Labor Department said
Friday, suggesting the nation's economic recovery remains fragile and
job creation lackluster.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the economy lost 40,000 jobs in November, with particular
weakness in manufacturing and retail. The report, which followed
recent glimmers of economic vitality, raised new questions about the
power of the current expansion.</LD>
<LD>   "We need firms to start getting confident about the future and
begin to rehire," said Joel Naroff, an economic consultant in
Holland, Pa. "Only then will the recovery reach full force."</LD>
<TE>   Major stock markets slipped after the employment news but had
regained the lost ground by midafternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Friday that the report was disappointing but not
expected to prompt a near-term change in interest rates. Many had
forecast a more modest rise in the unemployment rate from its October
level of 5.7%. The loss of payroll jobs was also a surprise, with
many having predicted a modest gain.</TE>
<TE>   "On balance, today's economic data was much weaker than expected,"
said Stan Shipley, senior economist at investment firm Merrill Lynch,
noting that many of his peers had projected that the nation would
generate 35,000 jobs last month.</TE>
<TE>   The report suggested that the economy was growing at a sluggish 1%
to 2% annual rate, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The data provide "grim confirmation of the need for additional tax
relief," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of
Manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Others lashed out at politicians for failing to extend the federal
program of temporary unemployment insurance benefits by 13 weeks, a
proposal that was endorsed by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration and the House leadership can partially redeem
themselves by announcing immediately that extending and strengthening
that program will be the first order of business when the new
Congress convenes in early January," said Wendell Primus, director of
income security at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the net decline of 40,000 jobs, the experience in large
sectors of the economy varied markedly.</TE>
<TE>   Retail employment slid by 39,000. Manufacturing cut 45,000 jobs, a
sweeping pattern that affected autos, aircraft, electronics,
fabricated metals and other industries.</TE>
<TE>   Construction was flat. But service jobs expanded by 50,000, driven
in part by gains in health care, engineering and auto repair.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage brokerages also reported job increases, fueled by
refinancing activity.</TE>
<TE>   Average hourly earnings grew 0.3% to $14.93, maintaining a growth
trend that some considered hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   The average workweek for private-sector employees held flat at
34.2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The net decline in 40,000 jobs was the largest since nine months
ago, when companies eliminated 165,000 payroll jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints Friday were loudest in the manufacturing sector, which
has lost jobs for 28 straight months.</TE>
<TE>   "This latest uptick in unemployment, and especially the continuing
hemorrhage of manufacturing jobs, underscores the pressing need for
aggressive action to restore strong economic growth," the
manufacturers group's Jasinowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Some commentators interpreted the loss of 39,000 retail jobs in
November as a troubling sign of weak hiring for the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   But others questioned whether the number was a fluke, or suggested
that it could be explained by technology that reduces the need for
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "With the technology, it's possible that they need less people to
stock stores and sell goods," maintained Edgar E. Peters, chief
investment officer of PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, who
believes a modest economic recovery is in progress.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending -- fueled of late by low mortgage rates,
refinancings and relatively high levels of employment -- has been a
key to the nation's economic recovery. Peters maintained Friday that
consumer spending would hold up and that there was nothing in the
jobless report to suggest otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to previous recoveries, which began with significantly
higher levels of unemployment, the current expansion has not been
expected to unleash a vast wave of hiring, economists said. Rather,
companies have been trying to keep their payrolls lean. Moreover, the
6% rate of unemployment, although high compared with recent years,
remains close to levels that once were viewed as full employment,
after routine attrition and job changing are considered.</TE>
<TE>   Although the jobless report disappointed many, most economists do
not view the monthly labor numbers as a barometer of future economic
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, I think people are comfortable with their jobs,"
Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   "An unemployment rate of 6% is not going to make anybody worried
about losing their job. I think things are pretty normal, as far as
ordinary Americans go."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Lifted by O'Neill Resignation</HD>
<DH>The Dow rises 22 points with the shake-up in Bush's
economic team, ending five days of losses. The broader market also
edges up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow Jones industrials' eight-week winning streak ended Friday,
although Wall Street managed a modest gain after news that President
Bush had shaken up his economic team.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement that Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and White
House advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey had resigned lifted the market from
an early slump caused by a disappointing unemployment report.
Analysts said the shuffle offered hope of a fresh approach to
bolstering the economy.</LD>
<LD>   "The market doesn't like O'Neill," said Scott Wren, equity
strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Investors are hoping to see a
replacement "who's going to be more in tune with the global economy
in terms of what makes it tick," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow climbed 22.49 points, or 0.3%, to close at 8,645.77 and
end five straight days of losses. The Dow plunged 121 points in early
trading Friday before recovering on news of O'Neill's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also finished higher. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index rose 5.68 points, or 0.6%, to 912.23, while the Nasdaq
composite index gained 11.69 points, or 0.8%, to close at 1,422.44.
Winners led losers by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 8
to 7 on Nasdaq in light trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow fell 2.8% for the week to snap its eight-week winning
streak. Since hitting a multiyear low on Oct. 9, the Dow is up 18.7%,
despite its recent losses. The Nasdaq dropped 3.8% for the week and
the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.6%, ending three straight weeks of gains.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate rose to
6% in November, matching an eight-year high set in April. The number
offered a bleaker snapshot of the U.S. economy, although analysts had
forecast a slight increase from the 5.7% rate in October.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields slipped on the jobs report. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 4.09% from 4.14%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The weak economic data helped drive the dollar to its biggest
loss against the euro in eight weeks as traders fretted about the
strength of the U.S. recovery. In New York trading, the euro closed
at $1.01, up from $1.00.</TE>
<TE>   * Verizon Communications and Philip Morris, which both pay
dividends of at least 3%, climbed on hopes a new Bush economic team
will back more favorable tax treatment for dividends. Verizon, the
largest local-phone company, added $1.12 to $40.19, while Philip
Morris, the largest cigarette maker, climbed 59 cents to $39.95.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold futures had their best week since late May, rising to a
two-month high as a weaker dollar and recent declines for stocks
increased the metal's appeal as an alternative investment. In New
York trading, gold rose $1.50 to $326.30 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial shares helped lead the market higher. Citigroup added
42 cents to $37.56. J.P. Morgan Chase added 82 cents to $24.43. Bank
of America climbed 64 cents to $68.24.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors and Walt Disney led a decline in consumer-related
shares after the November jobs report. GM fell 70 cents to $37.25.
Disney slid 47 cents to $17.17.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange climbed $7.90, or 23%,
to $42.90 in their first day of trading. The world's second-busiest
futures market sold 3 million shares at $35 each in its initial
public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   * Carlsbad-based Isis Pharmaceuticals shares fell $1.72, or 22%,
to $6.19 after an analyst lowered his rating on the stock because of
concerns about a cancer drug still being tested.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Paul H. O'Neill knew he was an occasional embarrassment
to his boss, and he knew it might get him in trouble one day.</LD>
<LD>   After searing himself repeatedly on Washington's political stove
top, President Bush's blunt-spoken Treasury secretary acknowledged
this year he was trying to change his ways. "I've touched the hot
burner so many times," he said, "I'm doing my best not to touch it
anymore."</LD>
<LD>   Yet only days before announcing his resignation Friday, O'Neill
was expressing reservations about reducing the tax on stock
dividends, an idea gaining favor in the White House.</LD>
<TE>   Whether by choice or by compulsion, O'Neill couldn't keep his
finger out of the flame.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to have been marching to the beat of his own drummer,"
said conservative economist Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury
Department official. "Maybe in a different administration, that would
have been tolerable. But this is an administration that prides itself
on everybody speaking off the same script. Clearly, he was not in
sync."</TE>
<TE>   For most of his life, O'Neill has seemed a little out of step with
the company he kept.</TE>
<TE>   He was born 67 years ago into a family headed by a poorly paid
orderly at a veterans hospital in St. Louis. The O'Neills pinched
pennies and got by the best they could, but it was an unlikely
launching pad for a life that one day would lead to the heights of
wealth, fame and power.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill worked odd jobs as a boy, married young and paid his way
through college. Ivy League he's not: O'Neill received his bachelor's
degree in economics from Fresno State College and a master's in
public administration from Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is one of the wealthiest men in Washington, O'Neill
bristles at suggestions that he has no empathy for the less
fortunate. "I started my life in a house without water or
electricity," he said during a heated exchange with Sen. Robert C.
Byrd (D-W.Va.). "I don't cede to you the high moral ground of not
knowing what life is like in a ditch."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill began his career in 1961 as a computer systems analyst for
the Veterans Administration. He worked his way up the ranks of
government bureaucrats. In 1974, he landed the No. 2 job in President
Ford's Office of Management and Budget, where he became friends with
two other aspiring administration officials, Dick Cheney and Alan
Greenspan.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill left government service in 1977 for a career in the
private sector. He became vice president and later president of
International Paper Co., one of the nation's biggest corporations.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, the board of Alcoa Inc. was looking for a chief
executive to restore the ailing aluminum producer to financial
health. One of its directors, Greenspan, recruited O'Neill for the
job.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill turned Alcoa back into an industrial powerhouse, boosting
its revenue, profit, stock price and market share. For his efforts,
he was richly rewarded: The stock and options he received as CEO were
worth more than $100 million by the time he left the job in January
2000 to become the leader of Bush's new economic team.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate acclaim did not translate into political success.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the start, O'Neill became known as the loose cannon of
Bush's Cabinet. Instead of an administration band leader, he was
perceived as a political troublemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his tenure, O'Neill rankled the rest of the team by
telling Congress that the president's signature tax cut initiative
was unlikely to help the economy in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   He roiled international currency markets by saying the
administration was not interested in trying to pursue a strong dollar
policy.</TE>
<TE>   He antagonized Wall Street securities traders by suggesting he
could master their jobs in "a couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   He ruffled feathers on Capitol Hill by characterizing a House
tax-cut plan as an exercise in congressional "show business."</TE>
<TE>   He infuriated Argentina and Brazil by expressing doubts about
their use of international aid, only to turn around and endorse
emergency bailouts backed by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill acknowledged that he had problems sticking to the script.
"When I see people doing the scripted stuff, I don't know whether
they can think or not," he told reporters in August. "I turn my mind
off because I figure they don't really know anything."</TE>
<TE>   But Cabinet service is Washington's equivalent of a Broadway
musical, and O'Neill's off-key arias brought consistently unfavorable
reviews from the arbiters of political theater.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, he said things that were not very helpful and
sometimes flatly contradicted what people in the White House were
saying or doing," said Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the
libertarian Cato Institute. "He seemed to forget that the Treasury
reports to the White House, not the other way around."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he seemed out of touch too, making predictions despite
compelling evidence to the contrary. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he
said the economy would quickly roar back to life. Instead of a
rebound, a recession was already in the cards.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers say it is unfair to blame O'Neill for the
administration's inability to sell the president's economic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not clear the administration has a coherent economic
policy," said liberal economist Dean Baker at the Center for Economic
and Policy Research. "Obviously, he wasn't the person to give them
one. But if people are saying he wasn't a team player, it's not clear
what the team is."</TE>
<TE>   Others say the very skills that made him a successful corporate
executive may have undermined his ability to function as an effective
administration spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're the CEO of a corporation, you're a cheerleader, you're
in there trying to rally the troops, to get everybody working
together," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics is different," Wyss said. "If you want to make change,
you've got to convince people change is necessary, and that means not
always being on the sunny side of the street."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, it became clear over time that O'Neill had lost
credibility with all of his key constituencies: Wall Street, Main
Street, Capitol Hill and, most important, the White House.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the final straw was O'Neill's decision to spend 10 days
touring the impoverished nations of sub-Saharan Africa with Bono, the
rock vocalist turned Third World evangelist.</TE>
<TE>   The trip drew the scorn of O'Neill's critics. But Bono offered a
more charitable assessment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the AIDS emergency in Africa with Paul O'Neill," he said
through a spokeswoman. "I saw his convictions. We will miss him."</TE>
<TE>   It is a sentiment shared by some of those who are critical of
O'Neill's tenure as Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fond of him," said Reynolds, the Cato Institute scholar.
"He's quirky. He's fun. He's an interesting person.</TE>
<TE>   "But he'd be more interesting somewhere else."</TE>

<HD>HP, Gateway to Put Workers on Leave</HD>
<DH>The cost-cutting move comes as the computer industry
struggles to create demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway Inc. said Friday that they had
ordered noncritical workers to take off up to 20 days without pay
over the holidays in an effort to reduce costs in an industry hit by
sluggish sales and intense price competition.</LD>
<LD>   The moves by the No. 2 and No. 3 sellers of personal computers in
the U.S. are a sign that the industry is struggling to find ways to
generate demand at a time when PCs have penetrated 55% to 60% of U.S.
households.</LD>
<LD>   Contract workers in HP's information technology division will take
off 20 business days between Dec. 9 and Jan. 10, said Arch Currid, a
spokesman for the Palo Alto company.</LD>
<TE>   "Our action is purely a cost-cutting measure," Currid said. The
workers who will be furloughed normally perform support rules, such
as staffing operations that run manufacturing processes and data
centers.</TE>
<TE>   Currid would not say how many workers would be affected or how
much money HP expected to save. HP ordered contract workers to take
off 14 business days in July, saving the company about $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most of HP's regular employees also will take a week off during
the holidays, though with pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Customer and mission-critical operations," including customer
support, call centers and order fulfillment, will continue that week,
Currid said.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway, based in the San Diego suburb of Poway, will furlough
administrative, product development and other workers for five days
between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31. A similar order was issued last
Christmas to trim expenses at the troubled computer manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of a focus to manage our costs as tightly as we can,"
spokesman Brad Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The order affects "a relatively small percentage" of Gateway's
11,000 employees, Williams said. He would not give a specific figure
or the amount of money Gateway hoped to save.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Ted Waitt told a technology conference Tuesday
that Gateway would need a couple of strong weeks leading up to
Christmas to reach the low end of its guidance on quarterly earnings.
The company said in October that it expected to lose 10 to 13 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Investors rewarded both companies in New York Stock Exchange
trading Friday. HP shares jumped 57 cents to $18.83, and Gateway
shares rose 18 cents to $3.60.</TE>

<HD>PacBell, MCI in Pay Phone Battle</HD>
<DH>SBC and WorldCom say their units have the right to provide
local service to California prisons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Powell</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In yet another instance of telecommunications industry infighting,
WorldCom Inc. and SBC Communications Inc. are squabbling over who has
the right to provide local phone service to California prison
inmates.</LD>
<LD>   SBC's Pacific Bell, in a Bankruptcy Court filing Thursday, charged
that WorldCom's MCI unit illegally disconnected Pacific Bell pay
phones in several California juvenile facilities and then hooked its
own local lines into the phones. WorldCom says MCI has the right to
provide phone service and equipment under a February contract with
the state of California.</LD>
<LD>   The case is the latest salvo in a heated battle between WorldCom
and SBC in particular, and between "Baby Bell" local phone companies
and long-distance rivals in general.</LD>
<TE>   MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier, now offers local
phone service in 40 states, including California, where Pacific Bell
is the dominant provider. Pacific Bell is seeking permission to offer
long-distance in California and also is asking the state to let it
charge MCI and others more to lease its phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to figure out how to make money at the business
they've got; instead, they want to go after the other's business,"
said Peter Sevcik, president of NetForecast, a telecom consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   MCI has had a contract for 10 years to provide local and
long-distance service for 85% of the 3,000 phones in 49 California
state prisons and juvenile facilities. Pacific Bell had a subcontract
with MCI to provide the local service and the phones.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Communications Inc. provides service to the other 15%. In
2001, according to the California Department of General Services, the
3,000 phones generated $85 million in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In February, when MCI signed another contract with California, it
decided to offer the local service itself and install its own phones.
Pacific Bell claims it still has the right to provide phones and
local service.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bell spokesman John Britton said MCI began illegally
connecting its own local lines to Pacific Bell's phones until Pacific
Bell ordered it to stop.</TE>
<TE>   MCI spokeswoman Natasha Haubold declined to comment. The issue is
to be heard by the Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>IBM to Purchase Rational Software</HD>
<DH>Analysts say Big Blue is getting a good deal in its
$2.1-billion acquisition of the profitable firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. agreed Friday to acquire longtime customer Rational
Software Corp. for $2.1 billion, the largest in a recent string of
acquisitions to bolster its software operations.</LD>
<LD>   The deal values Cupertino, Calif.-based Rational at $10.50 a
share, a 28% premium to its closing price Thursday. The shares jumped
$2.12, or 26%, to $10.29 in Nasdaq trading Friday. IBM shares slipped
74 cents to $82.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   "The price is acceptable, if not more than acceptable. They got a
pretty good deal," said UBS Warburg analyst John Jones, who does not
own shares in IBM or Rational.</LD>
<TE>   Rational makes tools that companies use to develop software for
everything from air traffic control systems to cell phones. Its
revenue totaled $689 million in 2001 and is forecast to dip to $650
million in 2002. The overall market for software development tools is
expected to grow from $9 billion this year to $15 billion in 2006,
according to technology research firm IDC.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Rational would allow Big Blue to offer a wider
range of software development tools to its customers, said Steve
Mills, IBM's senior vice president for software.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Klein, an analyst who follows Rational for UBS Warburg,
said he was surprised that the company would agree to a deal now and
at just $10.50 a share.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Rational is profitable and has a strong balance
sheet, positioning the company well now that the worst of the
technology bust seems to have passed. Rational also has valued its
independence for more than 20 years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rational's president and chief operating officer, Tom Bogan,
said the deal comes at the right time and at the right price.</TE>
<TE>   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM plans to merge Rational's operations into
its software group and keep Michael Devlin, Rational's chief
executive and co-founder, as its general manager. IBM said it
expected to retain most of Rational's 3,400 employees.</TE>
<TE>   IBM said it would continue to produce Rational's development tools
for Java-based programming, the free Linux platform and Microsoft
Corp.'s .Net platform.</TE>

<LD>Glenn Tilton, the chief executive of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines,
said a Bankruptcy Court filing is a "more likely outcome" in the wake
of the government's decision this week not to bail out the No. 2 U.S.
carrier.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been preparing for a Chapter 11 filing for months, and we
are ready if we decide that's the best course for the company,"
Tilton said. He warned that in bankruptcy, deeper cost savings would
be needed, and union work rules must be "on the table."</LD>
<LD>   Pilots union leaders held their second day of meetings with United
managers, but refused to say whether they had discussed a possible
attempt to avert bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   A United confirmed that its board planned to meet today, but

<LD>The new board of directors at troubled Liquid Audio Inc., a pioneer
in the field of online music distribution, has agreed to give much of
the company's cash back to its shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The company announced late Thursday that the board, which was
reconstituted in October, had voted unanimously to return $2.50 per
share to investors, a move that will cost $57 million.</LD>
<LD>   Spokeswoman Kim Strop said the Redwood City-based company will
have about $20 million in cash, enough to operate for at least
another year. But she also said Liquid is exploring several options,
including selling all or part of its assets and dissolving the firm.</LD>

<HD>Universal Unveils Chinese Project</HD>
<DH>The Vivendi unit makes a deal to build a theme park in
Shanghai, the country's largest city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates and Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Universal Parks &amp; Resorts has cleared a great bureaucratic wall in
China.</LD>
<LD>   The unit of Vivendi Universal unveiled a preliminary deal today to
build a theme park in Shanghai after lengthy negotiations gave it the
early foothold over rival Walt Disney Co. in China's largest city.</LD>
<LD>   The Universal unit and Shanghai officials reached an agreement in
principle to build the park along the Huangpu River and open it in
2006, although company sources cautioned that more government
approvals would be needed.</LD>
<TE>   Disney is well underway with its own plans for a theme park in
China: Groundbreaking for Hong Kong Disneyland is scheduled for
January, with the opening slated for 2005 or 2006. Disney also had
been engaged in discussions to build a second park, in Shanghai or
elsewhere, Disney Senior Vice President Leslie Goodman said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement marks a symbolic victory for Universal against
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said they don't consider the jump of a few years
all that significant over the long term given China's population of
1.2 billion and a burgeoning middle class that is expected to expand
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be more than enough opportunities there," said Michael
Demetrios, chief executive of Los Angeles- based Intra-Asia
Entertainment Corp., which is developing theme parks in China.</TE>
<TE>   Universal has been negotiating to build a park in Shanghai for
more than a year. The park appears to be a sweet deal for the company
and Vivendi Universal, its financially ailing parent, and an
indication of how much China wants the project.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials said the Universal project could create
thousands of jobs and help turn Shanghai into China's leading tourism
center.</TE>
<TE>   Universal didn't disclose how it beat Disney to the punch, but
said it has been scouting out the market for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "We are both world-class theme park operators, we just worked
harder in this project and got it," Frank P. Stanek, a Universal
development official, said at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the company probably would invest about $75 million
in the park, estimated to cost about $1 billion. Its quasi-government
partners, Shanghai Waigaoqiao Group Co. and Jinjiang Group Co., would
fund the rest. In return, Universal would get a stake of about
one-third and also reap management fees for operating the park,
people familiar with the details said.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Shanghai would be modeled after the company's Orlando,
Fla., theme park and would feature high-tech rides and movie and TV
themes.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's U.S.-traded shares rose 10 cents to $16.22 on the New
York Stock Exchange Friday after the news surfaced in the Wall Street
Journal.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Rallies Around Resignations</HD>
<DH>The stock market sees the ousters as a signal that the
administration finally is focused on the economy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wall Street was never happier with Paul H. O'Neill than when waving
him goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   That message was clear Friday when a stock market that had been
pummeled early in the day by a bad unemployment report staged an
abrupt U-turn on news of the ousters of the Treasury secretary and
White House economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 120 points in
early trading, rebounded after the announcements to close at
8,645.77, up 22.49 points. Other stock market indicators also rose.</LD>
<TE>   From Wall Street's perspective, based on interviews with market
pros Friday, the shake-up at the White House meant two things, both
of them good: Bigger tax cuts are on the way, and the Bush
administration finally is focused on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill "instilled zero confidence anywhere," said Alfred E.
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. He
added, "Lindsey's IQ is probably 260, but he couldn't communicate."</TE>
<TE>   With business confidence extremely fragile and the markets only
"slowly moving into a glass-is-half-full mentality," the
administration realized it needed someone who could deliver its
positive message about economic policy, Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill apparently irritated some White House colleagues and other
top Republicans by saying that a big tax-cut package was unnecessary
because the economy was headed back on track. O'Neill also worried
that tax cuts could add to the federal budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't what the White House -- or the financial markets --
wanted to hear.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, the former chairman of Alcoa Inc., wasted little energy
on currying favor with Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong industrialist, he emanated disdain for purely
financial pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Wall Street Journal after less than a
month on the job, he described stock traders as "people who sit in
front of flickering green screens" making decisions about tiny
movements in prices. It's a job, O'Neill boasted, that he could learn
"in about a couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The attitude marked a 180-degree shift from that of Clinton
appointee Robert E. Rubin, the former Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. executive
who was one of the most popular Treasury secretaries ever -- at least
on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   During Rubin's 4 1/2-year tenure, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock
index rose 200% amid the strongest bull market in U.S. history. By
contrast, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 35% since the Bush administration
took office in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Still, David M. Blitzer, chief strategist at Standard &amp; Poor's,
said he would regret O'Neill's departure because he found his
outspokenness refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   "He speaks his mind. I'll take that even if I disagree most of the
time," said Blitzer, an economist.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he added, the stock market found the secretary's
sudden resignation uplifting because it seemed to signal that the
White House had refocused its attention on the economy after devoting
most of its time and energy to the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been pushing hard for the elimination or sharp
reduction of taxes on stock dividends, an idea that has been on
investors' wish list for years but now seems within reach. It would
be a particular boon to investors in utilities and blue-chip stocks,
which tend to pay higher dividends.</TE>
<TE>   The dividend tax-cut idea is "kind of exciting," Vincent Boberski,
strategist and chief economist at RBC Dain Rauscher in Chicago, said
Friday. "It's the first time I can think of that the Bush
administration has done something with the stock market in mind."</TE>
<TE>   To Arthur Micheletti, chief investment strategist at Bailard,
Biehl &amp; Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif., one message was that the
president had absorbed the lesson that even success in a popular
military action couldn't guarantee him a second term without economic
success at home. "Bush doesn't want to repeat his father's mistake,"
he said.</TE>

<LD>Saudi funds--A Dec. 1 article on a debate among U.S. Muslims over
Saudi donations said that some Saudi funds are disbursed through the
Islamic Foundation of Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah in Culver City. According
to the foundation's chairman, Khalil Khalil, he has disbursed Saudi
funds to local mosques, but did so as an individual, not in his
capacity as head of the foundation. The foundation, itself, does not
disburse Saudi funds to local organizations.</LD>

<LD>Proposition 49, passed by voters in November, would pay for before-
and after-school programs in elementary and junior high schools with
money from the state's general fund. The measure would not go into
effect until the noneducation portion of the budget grew by at least
$1.5 billion over its highest level in the previous four years.  A
2000 UCLA study and a 2002 UC Irvine report found that where an
after-school program was in place, there was an improvement in grades
and standardized test scores, more kids stayed in school and went on
to college, and there was a reduction in teenage criminal activity in
the surrounding area. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with someone who worked on
this measure and several people who work in existing after-school
centers.</LD>

<TE>   Proposition 49</TE>
<TE>   The opening of after-school programs via Proposition 49 is
expected to begin in 2004 or 2005; start-up is directly linked to the
health of the state budget. Arnold Schwarzenegger conceived the idea
and was the architect of it.</TE>
<TE>   He traveled to inner-city schools throughout the country and gave
kids the message that if he could make it, as an immigrant from
Austria, anybody could. But then he realized that it really wasn't
true, that these kids didn't have a fair chance. He had the advantage
of having had teachers, coaches and parents to supervise his
activities after school.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, which was also inspired by the success of LA's
BEST, requires that there be an academic, recreational and homework
component in every program. Generally, what Arnold says is: Give me
an hour of homework and learning and I'll give you two hours of
whatever fun thing you want to do. His programs are successful
because he lets the kids help design them.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers define the hours between 3 and 6 p.m. as a danger
zone for kids; it is the time when teen violence is prevalent, kids
get injured, get high, become pregnant, etc. For years, law
enforcement people lobbied for increased after-school programs
without success. Now Proposition 49 will make a real difference.</TE>

<TE>   Boys and Girls Club</TE>
<TE>   of Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   There are currently close to 4,000 members at the Santa Monica
club. Each club is autonomous. In ours, after the first year's fee of
$20, we charge $10 yearly. But if someone cannot pay the fee, it is
waived by doing chores or volunteer work at the club.</TE>
<TE>   We've begun an initiative to open satellite programs on school
campuses because it is difficult for some kids to get to our main
branch. We use a classroom or a portion of the school, which may run
other programs in addition to ours. Satellites usually stay open
until 6 p.m.; our main branch is open until 8 or 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   When the children come to the club after school we encourage them
to complete their homework before getting involved in other
activities. We are fortunate to have so many volunteers from colleges
and local businesses. The main branch has a learning center, computer
workshop, arts and crafts, gymnasium, skate park, game room and other
outdoor activities. We continually initiate new programs to keep the
children interested. Recently we started a Friday skate night.</TE>
<TE>   Our program is valuable because it provides children with adult
supervision. There's someone here to work with them and care for
them. It gives them a place to come and feel comfortable. We
discipline them as needed and sometimes work with the parents.</TE>
<TE>   We teach our members how to make good choices, like saying no to
drugs, cigarettes and alcohol. We teach teens how to fill out job
applications, how to dress, how to go on an interview. Companies come
in and give talks about career opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   We also help students obtain scholarships. We speak to teens about
avoiding pregnancy and encourage them to go to college. Most
important, we let them know that somebody here cares for them.</TE>
<TE>   The Boys and Girls Club has always had a special concern for those
from disadvantaged circumstances, but our dedicated staff is here for
all young people. It's too soon to know if Proposition 49 will
benefit our club.</TE>

<TE>   Kids in Sports</TE>
<TE>   This is an offshoot of the Amateur Athletic Foundation, which was
set up with money left over from the 1984 Olympics. It is now an
independent, nonprofit organization. Last year more than 9,000
children participated at 14 sites. The neighborhoods we seek to place
our programs in are those where the children need the most help. The
major difference between us and other sports leagues is that we
empower community members to take responsibility in their children's
lives and the lives of all the neighborhood kids. We help them form a
governing board of parents and volunteers. With our guidance, the
board sets up the leagues and schedules and does the recruiting,
registration and advertising. We provide training for the coaches,
supply the uniforms and equipment and pay for the referees. If
problems arise, we are there to help.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's working in the snack bar, coaching or being a board
member, parents are required to take part. Most activities are from 5
to 7 p.m. during the week. Game day is Saturday, although some clubs
have so many teams that they have to play every night.</TE>
<TE>   I think Proposition 49 is excellent, but I don't think it will
have a major effect on what we do.</TE>
<TE>   Increased self-esteem, better communication skills, learning to
work with others to accomplish common goals, development of
leadership qualities and physical and mental fitness all help to keep
kids off the streets and prepare them for school, college and life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marie Cazares</TE>
<TE>   activities consultant, LA's BEST</TE>
<TE>   We offer after-school activities that the children would not
normally get in school, such as tennis, piano and chess lessons, and
the entire program is free. Located on site at 104 elementary schools
primarily in disadvantaged areas, the program serves more than 18,000
children. The idea is to catch the kids early.</TE>
<TE>   There's a great emphasis on making these kids understand that
whatever situation they're in, they don't have to stay there. We
teach them that they can achieve, that anything is possible. If these
kids were not in LA's BEST, they would be at home. Maybe they
wouldn't be alone, but sometimes families don't push kids to try
harder, reach that goal, go over and beyond, to think about the
future.</TE>
<TE>   I am a product of LA's BEST. I thought when I grew up I'd stay at
home with a husband and kids. But being in this program encouraged me
to go to college and finish; it encouraged me to accomplish what I
thought I never would. So many of our kids have similar stories to
tell.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to academic enrichment, we offer wood shop, arts and
crafts, engineering clubs, football, basketball, volleyball and more.</TE>
<TE>   We're in support of Proposition 49. But no one has a crystal ball;
we just don't know when it will kick in. When it does, LA's BEST
would be well positioned to benefit from it.</TE>

<LD>When Hamid Karzai traveled to West Germany last year at this time for
the international conference that designated him the interim
president of Afghanistan, U.S.-led forces were searching caves in
Tora Bora, warplanes were bombing targets across Afghanistan and
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar was negotiating the surrender of
the city of Kandahar before making good his escape.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai returned to Bonn this week with much of his nation at
relative peace, the Taliban government gone, women back in school and
the capital, Kabul, featuring traffic jams of trucks and cars, not
tanks. All of these good signs, however, do not add up to a
functioning nation.</LD>
<LD>   Warlords battled this week in western Afghanistan, where one of
the chieftains collects millions of dollars a month from customs
duties that should be going to the central government in Kabul.
Controlling the warlords requires an army. Building an army takes
money, lots of it. Until the army is built, someone else has to keep
the peace.</LD>
<TE>   Congress last month authorized aid of $425 million a year for the
next four years for Afghanistan, plus a $1-billion fund to support
the international peacekeeping force now in Kabul. Congress needs to
begin appropriating the money; the Bush administration should
establish a special Afghanistan-only account and stop the executive
branch's green-eyeshade folks from cutting it.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has sent nearly $600 million in humanitarian
assistance and reconstruction aid to Afghanistan during the last
year. Other nations gave hundreds of millions more. But far more is
needed.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. estimate of the cost to train, equip and sustain the Afghan
army being assembled is $350 million a year for two years. The U.S.
Agency for International Development's ambitious plan to build
schools and hospitals, dig drainage ditches, restore irrigation
facilities and pour tar for roads to get crops to market will cost
hundreds of millions more.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department agreed last month to dispatch U.S. customs
officials to Afghanistan to help improve collection of customs duties
at the border, which will also help Karzai's anemic government.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no troops in the 4,800-member international
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan but has supplied financial and
logistical support. Washington needs to persuade nations such as
Britain and Germany, which provide many of the troops, to put them in
cities like Kandahar and Jalalabad. That would let the Karzai
government expand its writ beyond Kabul. Afghanistan also will
benefit from the planned increase in the number of U.S. troops doing
reconstruction work.</TE>
<TE>   Depriving the warlords of financing, territory and troops would
give the central government more influence and, at least as
important, more money. That is the only way to permanently reduce the
burden on aid-giving nations without risking the return of chaos to
Afghanistan.</TE>

<LD>If the refrigerator police have their way, the current weeks of
bounteous holiday food and drink might simply illustrate everything
that's wrong about America. It's not just that all that food makes
you fat. It also might kill you.</LD>
<LD>   Humans have been ratted out. Literally. Laboratory experiments on
rodents and other animals suggest that drastically decreasing caloric
intake -- in plain English, starving yourself -- might significantly
increase human lifespan, to as much as 110 years, and defer heart
disease and other ailments. Rats that haven't been subjected to the
spartan diet droop listlessly in their declining years, whereas
rodents who have been put on the diet cavort friskily in their cages.</LD>
<LD>   The National Institute on Aging has begun scientific trials
involving about 200 people to see whether humans are no different
from rats and other creatures in this regard. These pioneers are
forgoing gastronomic pleasures to eat low-calorie diets in the hope
of longer lives.</LD>
<TE>   The test will take years, but presumably McDonald's and other
fast-food chains that bombard consumers with super-sized sodas and
juicy hamburgers are already suffering from heartburn. McDonald's is
being sued by overweight customers. What's next on the menu for the
tort industry? Ninety-nine-pound weaklings suing because they aren't
even skinnier?</TE>
<TE>   Scientists theorize that drastically restricting calorie intake
may reduce production of damaging free radicals in the body by
reducing metabolism. Therefore, it may be that no amount of exercise
would have the same effect on longevity as semistarvation.</TE>
<TE>   Whether those souls who gird themselves to follow such a diet will
lead happier lives is a less answerable question. It's also the case
that something seems a little off about reducing Americans to a mass
of guilt for eyeing another slice of pizza.</TE>
<TE>   In the December Atlantic magazine, cultural critic Jonathan Rauch
notes that according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Americans' life expectancy has reached a high of 77
years. "If Americans are living longer ... ," he asks, "what exactly
is the problem?"</TE>
<TE>   But if Americans want to both have their cake and eat it when it
comes to longevity, then less may truly be more.</TE>

<LD>Even Scrooge McDuck might be hard-pressed to think of something this
mean: Although the lame-duck Congress came up last month with a
$90-billion plan to bail out the insurance industry in the event of a
new terrorist attack, it failed to reach agreement on a federally
funded extension of temporary unemployment benefits.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, almost a million unemployed Americans will have the
House of Representatives and the White House to thank for seeing
their benefits cut off three days after Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   The temporary unemployment benefits extension, which has been in
effect for less than a year, will start running out Dec. 28. The
House approved a measly five-week extension for only a few states
with the highest unemployment, and the Senate passed a broader
13-week plan. House Republican leaders said it was too expensive and
refused to compromise.</LD>
<TE>   It's not as though the job market is recovering. The national 6%
unemployment rate is unlikely to shrink in coming months, despite a
bump last quarter in economic growth. Last week, the National Assn.
for Business Economics predicted that the growth rate in the fourth
quarter would drop to 1.4% annually, compared with 4% in the previous
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is helping the unemployed through a rough patch the right
thing to do, it makes economic sense. Pumping in money that will be
spent quickly on necessities stimulates the economy.</TE>
<TE>   During the recession of the early 1990s, Congress passed a
generous temporary program, regularly extended it and ended it only
when it was clear that unemployment was declining.</TE>
<TE>   Fiscally beleaguered states could dip into their tax-funded
unemployment trust funds, which are not part of regular budgeting, to
extend benefits state by state. Such a move, however, requires action
by some state legislatures that will not be in session soon. The
federal trust fund of more than $25 billion that exists to help the
unemployed in hard times is what the government should be tapping
into.</TE>
<TE>   When the 108th Congress convenes Jan. 7, it has until Jan. 11 to
pass a so-called continuing resolution to keep paying the
government's bills. It should include a temporary unemployment
benefits program in the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   For that to happen, President Bush and the House Republican
leadership have to come on board. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) and Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield) have spearheaded the
charge against extending benefits. They will continue to resist as
long as the White House does not intervene. The president has yet to
show his hand on extending benefits, but after Dec. 28 the scrutiny
on him should intensify.</TE>
<TE>   An extension of several weeks would do more good to the economy
than harm to the burdened federal budget. And the benefit would be
much swifter and surer than that of the misguided federal tax cuts.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cell Phones and Driving a Lethal Mix, Study Says," Dec. 2:
Clearly, some people can't talk and drive at the same time. However,
many others can do so safely. Since our politicians tend to be
reactors, the safe ones will end up being punished for the sins of
the unsafe drivers. A fairer response would be for police officers to
look for these unsafe drivers and cite them for "unsafe driving."
That would not require another law on the books or punish those who
can drive and talk at the same time.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The study of cell phones and driving accidents by Harvard
University's Center for Risk Analysis is rather incomplete. One would
need to compare the number of accidents and deaths involved while
driving with passengers, while putting on makeup, drinking coffee or
driving alone. Far more people are killed in accidents while carrying
passengers in their vehicles than driving with cell phones. Should we
ban passengers in cars?</TE>
<TE>   Jim de Boom</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article on cell phone use while driving, you state that a
previous economic analysis by Harvard researchers found that "the
benefits of being able to readily communicate for business or
pleasure while on the road clearly outweighed the social costs of
injuries and deaths in accidents."</TE>

<LD>Re "Homeless Often Take a One-Way Street to Skid Row," Nov. 30: With
those who broke the law, we threw away the key, but now they are back
in town with their token of $200 from the state and a message from
the law that says, "Get it right this time." Some have been out of
mainstream society for years, so what can we expect? No family or
friends to come home to. No skills or education provided while they
sat behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   When I see these "outcasts" living on the sidewalks, existing in
squalor and filth, without hope, I have to ask myself, what do we do
now? Wasn't all this prison time a waste of our money? Couldn't it
have been better spent in a more beneficial way, realizing that the
outcome would affect all of us? Wouldn't their lives have had more
meaning with rehabilitation, education and medical treatment? And
couldn't we have lived with them much more easily than what we have
to face today? Are we willing to change the way we have been doing
things?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Selling Out the Forests" (editorial, Dec. 3), on forest policy and
changes to the forest planning process, ignores many of the key
issues surrounding the changes. Multiple uses of national forests
play a critical role in local and regional economies, while assuring
that wildlife and wilderness are preserved over the long term.
Unfortunately, abuse of the Endangered Species Act and the use of
litigation by "environmental" groups to impose de facto wilderness
have stopped effective planning and many uses for our public lands.</LD>
<LD>   A common-sense approach to the administration of public lands is
long overdue, as clearly illustrated by the tremendous fires
throughout the nation in 2002. These conflagrations should remove any
doubt about the need to reform forest management practices.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Only Sense Is of Loss," Dec. 2: It is hard to figure out why
there is almost equal sympathy given in this article to the victims
of this monster, Michael Carneal, and the monster himself. Am I
supposed to feel sorry for Carneal's lack of being able to figure out
why he was "shooting people"? It appears that his only explanation is
that he was bored with life. ("I didn't have anything to lose.") It's
more typical now for The Times to go inside the mind of the murderer
and find out "why" and "how" and all the other things that make it
almost glamorous for Carneal to sit in prison and figure out the
unthinkable. Yes, he is excited about getting his buttered popcorn
since he keeps his cell clean. Unbelievable. Bravo to Missy Jenkins
and her never-ending will to live.</LD>

<TE>   My thanks to Stephanie Simon for her evenhanded article on the
1997 school shooting in West Paducah, Ky. I have nothing but sympathy
and respect for Missy Jenkins, the paralyzed victim profiled, and
appreciation of her work on the national campaign to stop school
violence. However, I find it more than ironic that these efforts are
made within the context of a country whose national policy is one of
problem-solving through violence. When citizens pursue that policy on
the individual level, we wring our hands and wonder why. Isn't it
obvious?</TE>

<LD>Why would The Times give Constance Rice, a civil rights attorney, a

only a month, for crying out loud. Give him a break. Read this, Ms.
Rice: Most of the communities that are hotbeds of gang violence
cannot curb gangs because they are an integral part of their culture.
It's a cultural thing. Blaming it on the LAPD is patently ridiculous.
These communities hold the solution to the gang problem, not Chief
Bratton.</LD>

cops we have, how well trained and equipped they are, nothing will

parent is the most important task that we citizens have in life, and

<LD>Sports journalism could go a long way toward expanding the fan base
for women's sports merely by giving those athletes and sports the
coverage they deserve ("Women's Sports Still Looking for an
Audience," Dec. 3). However, sports journalism is overwhelmingly
dominated by men. To adequately cover women's sports in daily papers
and local television networks would be to invite many more women to
become sports reporters, editors, announcers, producers and pundits.
Precisely because women can do those jobs every bit as well as their
male counterparts, the guys at the sports desk are unlikely to extend
those invitations any time soon.</LD>

<LD>Re "Rattling 'Doors of Hell' in Mideast," Commentary, Dec. 3:
Bouthaina Shaaban offers plenty of idealistic advice to the U.S. and
Israel about occupation, media representation and respect for human
rights. Were she not the representative of Syria, the de facto
occupier of Lebanon, a country actively contributing to unrest in the
region and with a rather dismal human rights record, she might be
more credible. On the other hand, perhaps Shaaban's country would
like to live up to her stated ideals and lead by example, by truly
allowing Lebanon to be more than a Syrian puppet state, refraining
from providing arms to those intent on destroying all of Israel and
ceasing anti-Jewish portrayals in the media. Sad to say, I suspect
that the time for that will be when the "doors of hell" have frozen
over.</LD>

<LD>   Emerald Hills, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaaban of the Syrian Foreign Ministry does a masterful job of
portraying Syria's "kinder and gentler" nature. However, she omits
basic facts: Syria is relatively tolerant of minorities because
President Bashar Assad and the Assad royalty are a minority
themselves -- Alawite. She alludes to Syria's resistance to Muslim
extremists, but she doesn't spell it out. In the early '80s, former
President Hafez Assad killed up to 10,000 people in the Muslim
Brotherhood city of Hama.</TE>
<TE>   Her anger at Israel, though, is understandable; the Jewish state
had the audacity to resist Syria's wars of aggression in 1948 and
1967. Ariel Sharon also had the nerve to defend Israel's northern
border and halt the Syrian domination and near-annexation of Lebanon
in 1982 at the height of Lebanon's civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Friedman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is not racist to conclude that significant percentages of
Islamic peoples support and applaud the killing of innocents (witness
the wide celebrations after 9/11). Can Shaaban or others who hold
similar views cite dozens of terrorist murders all over the world
committed by Christians or Buddhists? One can easily identify such
targeted killings of innocents committed by terrorists in the name of
Islam. To paraphrase the Bible, "By their fruits we shall know them."</TE>
<TE>   It may not be politically correct to say so, but Islam has been
hijacked by the extremist clerics, who are represented regularly on
national broadcasts throughout the Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   Shaaban's commentary cannot change the reality of Islamic radical
violence throughout the world.</TE>

<LD>William Fain's comparison of lost opportunities for our L.A. River
and the Tiber in Rome is historically interesting ("Finding a Heart:
the L.A. River," Commentary, Dec. 2). In fact, many of his ideas for
both rivers are already being studied here by different
community-based groups. One example, Connect the Parks, is a study
underway to create landscaped pathways connecting parks, schools,
recreational facilities and neighborhoods adjacent to the L.A. River
in the communities of Echo Park, Elysian Valley and Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   There is no lack of interest in communities bordering the river.
Nor is there a shortage of wonderful ideas. Let's hope the political
will is emerging to actually do something about an asset that we have
in common with Rome.</LD>

if they weren't so frightening. The historic old center of Rome is
one of the world's great places and Fain wants to improve it with a
convention center, marina and hotel complex. How about throwing in a
few strip malls, car washes and mega-billboards? As for the rebirth
of the L.A. River, so that this drainage ditch becomes our Danube, he
didn't tell us where he'd get the water to fill it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Los Angeles' Toilet-to-Tap Fear Factor," by D.J. Waldie (Opinion,
Dec. 1), with the subtitle that "despite public worries, reclaimed
water has been proved safe": The "worries" are not just from the
public. The National Research Council's report on augmenting drinking
water with reclaimed water bases its so-called worries on analyses
made by some of the nation's top scientists. The U.S. does not have
the technology to even detect some of the thousands of toxins and
carcinogens that could make it through the reclamation process and
find their way into drinking water.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that some communities are currently drinking reclaimed
water does not make it safe. It often takes many decades to detect
the damage done by such projects that tinker with the public health
and welfare. And sometimes the effects are not detected due to
massive data evaluation problems caused by individuals who migrate
out of the study area. The L.A. City Council, in its wisdom, did the
right thing by examining this issue in depth and putting the project
on hold.</LD>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This "fear factor" is unrealistic and unwarranted. Perhaps L.A.
Mayor James Hahn fails to realize that most of the water consumed in
the U.S., especially from the Mississippi River system, has been
consumed and eliminated at least nine times by the time the water
runs from its upstream beginnings to the Gulf of Mexico. California
is able to afford once-consumed water because it redirected fresh
Sierra Nevada streams over 400 miles to dry Southern California, in
one of the country's biggest examples of stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and his supporters do not understand natural systems and
their mechanisms to clean polluted water. The Department of Water and
Power's Tillman Reclamation Plant is one of the nation's finest
wastewater treatment systems and deserves to be fully utilized. It is
time that the fear factor gives way to scientific reality. Critics
who do not understand the wastewater system need to do their homework
while keeping their mouths shut and their taps open. Retreated sewage
water is the norm throughout the developed world.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The skills to measure (or keep out) biological contaminants are
not advanced enough for me. Yes, inorganics are filtered out by
reverse osmosis membrane technology. However, never before have such
enormous quantities of analgesics, hormones and pharmaceutical
residues made their way into our sewers and treatment plants. Their
action may be well understood, but the membranes that would keep them
out are not available now and won't be for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Research over the last few years in places such as golf course
lakes that receive reclaimed water directly is not encouraging. The
published literature states that in the U.S. and in Europe some
aquatic life in these lakes and ponds has been found to have the
wrong sex's proteins; e.g., males with female egg-sac proteins.</TE>
<TE>   No one can predict how long larger quantities of powerful
biological and pharmaceutical residues would persist in our aquifers
or what their long-term effect on immature humans would be. I would
call that unsafe. It makes more sense to choose desalination; it's
feasible, several cities and water districts have started up with it
and, eventually, the cost will come down.</TE>

<LD>Re "Debate on Black Students Rages," Dec. 1: It is important to
question how race figures into what are at best subjective
interpretations of behavior. My brother's and my experience as
African Americans attending Chicago schools with all-white faculties
taught us that there are racial double standards in assessments of
behavior and performance. At various levels, both of us were
classified as slow and having behavioral problems, for behaviors and
performance that were equivalent to those of other students. These
racial double standards also led us to be placed in slower tracks
regardless of standardized test performance. The work my parents did
was in teaching us how to respond to these double standards and not
become discouraged. My brother is an investment banker and graduate
of the U.S. Naval Academy and I am a PhD and professor.</LD>
<LD>   However, our experience points to the fact that teachers like
Scott Phelps may be more of the problem than the solution. When
authority is arbitrary and applied with racial double standards, kids
will often resist the system out of frustration. They frequently give
up or become confrontational. I can say that on rare occasions I
responded in this manner.</LD>
<TE>   The challenge for my parents was recognizing what was bad behavior
and what was unfair treatment. They taught us not to lose our
composure or dignity in situations where we were stereotyped and
treated unfairly. It is difficult for young people to understand that
authority is unjust and arbitrary, yet respect it at the same time.
Teachers, the media, law enforcement and others send the negative
messages to African American children.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps' comments were unfortunate in that they simply repeated
well-worn stereotypes about blacks that date back to slavery. They
were not legitimate then and they are not legitimate now. African
American students need a message of love and empowerment, not
stereotypes and judgment.</TE>

<TE>   Everyone has this problem all wrong. Race is not the issue; it's
the individual student's attitude and lack of parental
responsibility. Disruptive students rob teachers of their ability to
teach and also violate the other students' right to receive quality
education. It is obvious that students at Pasadena's Muir High School
are receiving a substandard education, as shown by poor test scores.
But don't expect solutions from the school district, parents or
politicians because this problem has no solution.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Muir will continue to act as baby-sitters. However, I
think there are enough bright students there who will struggle hard
to educate themselves and go on to college and become successful.</TE>

<TE>   The Pasadena schools' Assistant Supt. George McKenna says, "Some
of these kids deserve credit just for showing up." What? That is the
same as me saying I should be paid at my job "just for showing up."
Students attend school to be educated, to learn to become productive
members of society. And to be educated takes more than just showing
up.</TE>

<TE>   It ain't the color. It's the culture. Having witnessed
well-behaved, neatly uniformed black students from 4-year-olds to
young adults in quiet attendance to lessons in many other parts of
the world, it's clear to me that color does not define behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the movie "The Emperor's Club" with a black friend who
teaches special ed, I was dismayed to notice she was in quiet tears
throughout much of the picture. It wasn't a sad picture. I asked her
what was wrong. She replied that she was just so envious of the
classroom decorum that the obviously private school enjoyed and was
so frustrated by the lack of same in the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? Uniforms, standard codes of deportment and expulsion
for infractions. Free public education is a privilege, not a right.
Of course, there should be second -- even third or fourth -- chances
for readmittance based on sincere commitment to follow rules. And
what, one might ask, do we do with all the expelled reprobates? Leave
them to their gang wars? I wish I had an answer.</TE>
<TE>   I do know that schools are supposed to prepare one to make a
living. More emphasis and respect for trade paths would help. More
respect for honest work in our society would help, too.</TE>

<TE>   As a former Muir teacher and longtime Pasadena resident, I believe
Phelps failed the test of sensitivity to the generations-long racial
divide in Pasadena. While it's his right to fulminate, the school and
community reasonably should expect Phelps to balance his rights with
his responsibilities. There was little constructive in Phelps'
expression.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as a teacher who left 50% African American Muir to teach at
50% Asian American Arcadia High School, I believe the Arcadia
community would have tolerated without a peep my possible declaration
that, overwhelmingly, the disruptive Arcadia students are white.</TE>

<LD>Re "Big Food Has Become a Big Problem," Commentary, Nov. 28: Ellen
Ruppel Shell raises important concerns about the epidemic of obesity
but she loses me when she jumps on that tired old bandwagon of
absolving individuals of responsibility for the consequences of their
choices and calls for government regulations and subsidies to address
the problem. To hear Shell describe it, health-conscious consumers on
their way to purchase fresh produce at a farmers market are
intercepted and rendered helpless by the hypnotic advertising of "big
food," at which point they obediently head for the nearest Burger
King to order a triple cheeseburger and super-sized fries.</LD>
<LD>   It is not big food but Mother Nature that has teased us by giving
meat, sugar and fat more appealing flavors than those found in fruits
and vegetables. As with so many situations in life, there is a
choice, or at least a balance to be struck, between immediate
gratification and long-term benefit. If there is a legitimate role
for the government, it is to make sure that health insurers and
employer health plans are not intimidated by "discrimination"
lawsuits if they attempt to assess a fat fee on their corpulent
clients.</LD>

<TE>   It seems the boogeyman has escaped from underneath our children's
beds and is now firmly entrenched in society. According to Shell, the
boogeyman, taking the form of advertising, is the cause of chronic
obesity in our society. She views lifestyle choices as related to
obesity, but seemingly relegates such choices to a consequence of
advertising instead of advertising being a consequence of choices. To
blame advertisers is easy, but once the logic is digested, it is as
satisfying as the fast food blamed.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone over 30 remembers walking to a friend's house, the local
swimming pool or the local McDonald's -- even if it were more than a
mile away. Today, many parents view such freedom as akin to child
endangerment. Dovetail this with computers and TVs, school cutbacks
on recreation and a part of society that believes everything big
(think Costco) is good, and it's easy to understand why our children
are overweight. The boogeyman has escaped from underneath our
children's beds, but the boogeyman is us. That is OK. If we accept
that our choices have created the problem, then maybe we will feel
empowered that new choices can help undo it.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County planning commissioners were within the law when they
went on private field trips to the ranchland where Washington Mutual
Bank wants to build thousands of homes, a county judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Henry J. Walsh's decision shot down another attempt by
Calabasas and other Ahmanson Ranch opponents to delay the project,
which will get another look Tuesday by the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   As the would-be neighbors of the 3,050-home development, Calabasas
and residents of Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Monday sued
Ventura County, its Planning Commission and bank subsidiary Ahmanson
Land Co., seeking a court order stalling the Ahmanson approval
process.</LD>
<TE>   Calabasas' attorney argued the planning commissioners should have
alerted the public before they visited Ahmanson Ranch to examine
Washington Mutual's plans to protect the endangered red-legged frog
and spineflower, and should have invited anyone who was interested to
join them.</TE>
<TE>   Planning hearings last month resulted in the commissioners voting
3 to 2 to endorse a new supplemental environmental study of the
development completed earlier this year. County supervisors will take
up the report Tuesday. Their approval would allow the long-delayed
project to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   From the start of the brief hearing Friday, Walsh was skeptical
that the commissioners' trips violated California's open-meetings law
and would compromise the county supervisors' evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the irreparable harm here if these proceedings are
allowed to continue?" Walsh asked Calabasas' lawyer, Katherine Stone.
Stone replied that the commissioners heard only one side of the
controversial development at the ranch -- the developer's -- and that
"irreparably tainted" their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Staring over his reading glasses, the judge countered: "There were
two days of public hearings after those field trips took place,"
offering adequate time for Ahmanson opponents to rebut the builder.</TE>
<TE>   Defending Ventura County, County Counsel Frank Sieh said anything
the commissioners learned on their field trips was included in
documents available to the public before the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "No new information or different information was received by the
commissioners on which their decision was based," Sieh said.</TE>
<TE>   The planning commissioners toured Ahmanson Ranch in October and
November, but no more than two went on each trip. Planning staff
members chaperoned to ensure commissioners did not confer on how they
would vote. The arrangement satisfied Walsh that the visits did not
constitute an illegal meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "This project has received intense scrutiny for a number of
years," the judge said. "There is nothing that is being hidden from
the public."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition fighting to stop the development of Ahmanson Ranch
would like to delay any approvals related to the project until after
Jan. 6. That is when Ventura County Supervisor-elect Linda Parks, an
Ahmanson opponent, takes over for Frank Schillo, who supports the
project. Parks' inauguration might shift the board to oppose the
project.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Planners Approve 708-Home Project Near Channel
Islands Harbor</HD>
<DH>The development also includes beaches, boat slips, an
amphitheater and community center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oxnard Planning Commission has unanimously approved a
$100-million residential project, which includes hundreds of houses
and condominiums, a marina and commercial buildings on 135 acres near
the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The Seabridge project, an extension of the Mandalay Bay
development, is the last major element of a 20-year-old plan to
develop the Channel Islands Harbor area, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Plans include 708 new homes, a new marina with 241 boat slips
connecting to the harbor, a public three-mile waterfront promenade,
two public beaches, a community center and an outdoor amphitheater.</LD>
<TE>   About half of the 276 single-family homes would be in a gated
community, but pedestrians could enter the subdivision on walkways
and on a bridge from shopping areas along Victoria Avenue, developers
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a product that's designed for the public to be able
to access the water" in the project, said developer Bill Wynne, a
developer with Mandalay Bay Partners in Oxnard, one of three
companies that are financing the project.</TE>
<TE>   The new homes and condominiums would range in price from about
$400,000 to more than $1 million for the houses on the water, Wynne
said.</TE>
<TE>   Developers are not certain what they would build on all of the 35
acres of the project reserved for shops and businesses. The project
would include neighborhood specialty outlets such as coffee shops,
grocery stores and drugstores.</TE>
<TE>   City zoning already allows for such tourist-oriented uses as boat
and bike rentals, skating rinks, theaters, hotels, conference
facilities, restaurants, boat sales and sport fishing operations.</TE>
<TE>   Seabridge, which will be considered by the City Council in
January, is the most recent in a flurry of new construction projects
that have added thousands of homes and a large new shopping center to
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   As Ventura County's largest and fastest-growing city, Oxnard's
population increased nearly 20% in the 1990s to about 170,000
residents. It now stands at about 182,000.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the City Council approved construction of the RiverPark
project along the Ventura Freeway, the largest
business-and-residential development in county history.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for about 2,800 living units centered on village
greens. Last week the City Council agreed to support construction of
a $12-million downtown movie theater, plus 10,000 square feet of new
shops. The city pledged to build a 545-space parking garage nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Morey Navarro called Seabridge a quality
project.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a shot in the arm for the whole west side of
the city," Navarro said. "The developers went way out of their way to
satisfy the community. If there was any question left unanswered,
then we must have forgotten to ask."</TE>

<LD>Two suspected bank robbers led Brea police on a high-speed chase
along city streets and a freeway Friday with their 7-month-old
daughter unbuckled in the back seat, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "We arrested them with money and a gun in the car," Brea Police
spokesman Lt. Martin Needham said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 4:45 p.m., when a 34-year-old man walked
into the Wells Fargo bank in the 300 block of North Brea Boulevard
and held up a teller with a gun, Needham said. After being given an
unspecified amount of money, the man got into a rented sport utility
vehicle driven by his 21-year-old wife, who led police on a 10-minute
chase through Brea, Fullerton and Placentia at speeds up to 95 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The chase ended at an apartment complex on Birch Street in Brea,
where the couple -- identified as Robert Lewis Bandy and Teffany
Tanee Crain of Garden Grove -- were arrested without incident.</TE>

<LD>Three men have been arrested in connection with the theft from an
Irvine animal shelter of two Chihuahua puppies they apparently had
mistaken for pit bulls, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Mehrad Sepanjasa, 19, Ariyo MacKay, 18, and Kamyar Katouzian, 24,
were arrested Wednesday at a local pet supply store when they brought
the puppies for vaccinations, according to Irvine Police Lt. Dave
Freedland.</LD>
<LD>   A store employee alerted authorities after seeing a flier
describing the puppies stolen from the shelter Sunday. The flier said
the puppies could be identified by microchips implanted under their
skin.</LD>
<TE>   The employee said the men insisted the dogs were pit bull pups
after veterinary staff members said they were Chihuahuas.</TE>
<TE>   The men were held on suspicion of receiving stolen property, and
the pups were returned to the shelter in good condition, police said.</TE>

<HD>Trashed Frat House Puts Hopes on Hold</HD>
<DH>Brothers sold their homes to buy a fourplex near Cal State
Fullerton for retirement income. Then came the party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento and Jorge Restrepo came to the United States from their
native Colombia a quarter-century ago, about the time the Sigma Pi
fraternity brothers began renting a fourplex a few blocks from the
Cal State Fullerton campus.</LD>
<LD>   After a lifetime of working as welders, the Santa Ana brothers
sold their homes about 18 months ago and used the money to buy that
frat house -- a rental investment they hoped would fund their
retirements.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, they were still picking through the rubble after police
say the house was vandalized when the fraternity was evicted for
falling three months' behind on their $4,100-a-month rent.</LD>
<TE>   "Where they come from, young men don't act this way -- especially
university students. They have more respect for themselves and
others," said Edgar Restrepo, Sacramento's 27-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad worked two, three shifts a day all his life to acquire
what he has gotten. To have this done to him ... there are no excuses
for this."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton police continue to investigate the incident, which
occurred late Monday or early Tuesday after a final party at the
house.</TE>
<TE>   More than $100,000 in damage was done. Bathroom fixtures and
windows were smashed. Holes were punched in walls and paint
splattered inside and out.</TE>
<TE>   A balcony was torn off the building and broken furniture was
dumped in a courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty bad -- totally trashed," said Fullerton Police Lt.
Doug Cave, who said the investigation is focusing on 14 men who
reportedly were recently expelled from Sigma Pi.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a strong intent to do as much damage as possible," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   University officials also are investigating and could punish those
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've ever had anything like this happen," said
Shari Scott, coordinator for Greek life on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Other fraternities have reached out to the Restrepo brothers,
offering to help clean up and make repairs to the former Sigma Pi
house.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting Friday, they also agreed to raise money for the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Restrepo said his father and uncle appreciate the offers,
but will let their insurance company handle the mess.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to rent the fourplex again, but "definitely not to
another frat," Edgar Restrepo said. "And not to college students."</TE>

<HD>Laguna Official Enters Plea</HD>
<DH>Councilman Baglin pleads not guilty to a conflict charge
over real estate transactions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach Councilman Wayne Baglin pleaded not guilty Friday to a
felony conflict-of-interest charge that stems from his work as a real
estate broker on behalf of the sellers of two properties the city
bought last year.</LD>
<LD>   Baglin stood next to his attorney, Michael Molfetta, during a
brief appearance at Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana as
Judge Ronald P. Kreber accepted the plea and ordered him to return to
court Jan. 13 so a trial date could be set.</LD>
<LD>   Baglin refused to comment afterward, referring all questions to
his attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Asked whether his client was open to a plea bargain, Molfetta said
"only if it includes dismissal" of the charge, which he maintains is
baseless.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have declined to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin, in the middle of a four-year term, held the mayor's seat
when he was indicted Oct. 31, a day after five city officials
testified before a grand jury convened by the Orange County district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He resumed his role as a councilman Tuesday when Councilwoman Toni
Iseman was appointed mayor as part of the city's annual rotation.</TE>

<HD>Luster Says He Was Terrorized by Deputies</HD>
<DH>Date-rape suspect testifies a detective threatened to push
him down a flight of stairs and others locked him in a hot patrol
car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking the stand during a pretrial hearing, millionaire date-rape
suspect Andrew Luster told a judge Friday that arresting officers
terrorized and intimidated him during a police interrogation two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   One detective threatened to push him down a flight of concrete
stairs if he was uncooperative, Luster testified. He also said other
deputies with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department kept him locked
in a hot patrol car for an hour after his arrest.</LD>
<LD>   "They locked me in and let me suffer," Luster, 38, testified. "I
was having a difficult time breathing."</LD>
<TE>   Referring to the alleged threat to push him down stairs, which the
detective denies, Luster said, "It was terrorizing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contend Luster's statements during a July 18,
2000, tape-recorded interview should be excluded from his trial next
week because, they said, investigators violated his rights and
altered portions of the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's sudden appearance on the stand was one of several
dramatic developments Friday in the Ventura County rape case.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Superior Court Judge Ken Riley denied a
defense motion to disqualify the Ventura County district attorney
from the case because of alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said he found no evidence of police or prosecutor
malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling strikes at the heart of the defense case. For months
attorneys have argued prosecutors have lied, falsified evidence and
concealed items that could exonerate Luster -- allegations
prosecutors have denied.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's lawyer, Roger Jon Diamond, urged Riley to allow evidence
of an overzealous prosecution, calling it critical to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can show systematic police misconduct over a period of
time," Diamond said, "we believe the jury can draw an inference that
the witnesses are unreliable."</TE>
<TE>   But Riley, assigned to the case for more than a year, said, "I
find no evidence that there has been purposeful police
misconduct....This is not going to be a police misconduct case."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers are under a gag order and could not comment on the
rulings.</TE>
<TE>   While striking a blow to the defense case, Riley also denied a key
prosecution motion Friday. He ruled that seven women who have accused
Luster of drugging them at bars, parties, and, in one case, at a Las
Vegas strip club, may not testify.</TE>
<TE>   Their proposed statements are too speculative and potentially
time-consuming, Riley said. But he said prosecutors could possibly
call the women as rebuttal witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with raping three women after knocking them out with the
date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women, a UC
Santa Barbara student, reported being drugged at a Santa Barbara bar
and raped at Luster's beach house.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of the home, detectives found videotapes that
prosecutors say depict Luster having sexual relations with two other
unconscious women. He is charged with raping both women.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers say Luster has been framed, the tapes altered and
witnesses coached to lie. They argue the sexual relations were
consensual.</TE>

<HD>Mannheimer Is Cleared in Attack</HD>
<DH>Citing a lack of physical evidence, the panel votes 11 to 1
in favor of the businessman in the beating of his former wife in
1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westlake Village businessman Lee Mannheimer, accused of smashing the
skull of his ex-wife, was cleared Friday when jurors in the civil
trial found that the woman's lawyers had not shown he was responsible
for the 1999 attack.</LD>
<LD>   Following two days of deliberations, jurors voted 11 to 1 in favor
of Mannheimer, 59, and cleared him of battering 51-year-old Linda
Morrisset, a Newbury Park accountant.</LD>
<LD>   However, one juror said some members on the panel believed the
defendant was involved in the attack with a metal flashlight that
left Morrisset brain damaged and partially paralyzed.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of us had a gut feeling he may have been responsible," said
juror Jerry Landis of Port Hueneme, "but there just wasn't enough
solid evidence to comfortably pin it on one person."</TE>
<TE>   The lone holdout, a man on active duty in the military, left the
courthouse without talking to reporters after the 5:30 p.m. verdict
in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, Sandy Kueny of Moorpark, said deliberations were
highly charged at times as the panel tried to sort through three
weeks of testimony in what one attorney described as a "he-said,
she-said" case.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just one thing," Kueny said. "It was several things
that we had to go over again and again."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they were swayed by the absence of physical evidence
linking Mannheimer to the Sept. 11, 1999, beating.</TE>
<TE>   They also said a key factor was the testimony of the couple's
12-year-old son, Maxx, who said his father was at home the night his
mother was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Mannheimer nor Morrisset was in court when the verdict was
read.</TE>
<TE>   But in a telephone interview Friday night, Mannheimer said he was
elated but confused as to why it took jurors "so long" to reach a
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy," Mannheimer said, noting that he was sitting
next to his son in their home. "My son is a first-class Boy Scout who
doesn't lie. Much of what was said by the plaintiff were things that
never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said that what happened to Morrisset was a tragedy, but
that he didn't do it. The person who did, he said, was likely a jewel
thief who broke into the house and then attacked Morrisset when she
surprised him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty of justice that the Sheriff's Department hasn't
brought this person to justice," he said. "Linda is the mother of my
son, and I have tried to help her."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have joint custody of Maxx, but Mannheimer said
Morrisset is unable to care for the boy because of her injuries. She
had been seeking $2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's attorney, Allen Ball, called the verdict a great
disappointment. He said he believes the evidence shows that
Mannheimer was responsible for his ex-wife's injuries. "Linda is
going to be the only one in a wheelchair this Christmas," Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   Ball said Morrisset may decide to appeal on the grounds that the
jury was not allowed to consider whether Mannheimer masterminded the
attack by directing someone else to carry it out.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez, called the verdict a relief
but a tragedy for his client's entire family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long four years for him," Ramirez said. "It's a shame
these disputes end up in court."</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset filed a lawsuit two years ago after local prosecutors
declined to charge Mannheimer in the near-fatal attack at Morrisset's
home near Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
family housekeeper. After waking from a 16-day coma, Morrisset
identified Mannheimer as her attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested him, but he was released after prosecutors
decided there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the biggest stumbling block was Morrisset's
inability to fully recall the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors in the civil case said Morrisset's conflicting accounts
also concerned them.</TE>
<TE>   During the civil trial, Morrisset's attorney argued that there had
been a mix-up over where the couple's son would sleep on the night of
the attack, and that Mannheimer became enraged and attacked her.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 10 Years for Assault on Newport Officer</HD>
<DH>Judge gives Jeffrey Minor the maximum sentence for fleeing
drunk-driving stop with officer clinging to car. He was located in
Italy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a letter to the Orange County court that sentenced him Friday,
Jeffrey Minor pledged his devotion to a life of sobriety.</LD>
<LD>   He said he was sorry for dragging a Newport Beach police officer
with his Porsche while trying to escape a 1998 drunk driving arrest.
He said he was "sickened and embarrassed" by his actions, which came
five years after he killed a man while driving drunk in Riverside
County.</LD>
<LD>   But Orange County Sheriff's Department records showed that Minor,
who fled to Italy while on bail for the Newport Beach crime,
continued drinking even after he was arrested on an international
warrant and locked up in Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. Guards
cited him for drinking "pruno," a crude wine some prisoners brew in
their cells, records show.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Orange County Judge Kazuharu Makino sentenced Minor to
the maximum possible term: 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   By imposing the sentence, Makino granted the wishes of three
sisters whose father died in a 1993 traffic collision caused by a
drunken Minor. One of the sisters had pleaded for leniency at Minor's
sentencing in Riverside County. Minor was driving 70 mph at the time
of the crash that killed Menno Kramer. He was sentenced to one year
in jail -- but he served less than half that time -- and five years
of probation.</TE>
<TE>   "It does sicken me that Minor didn't change at all after taking a
life and being given leniency," Yvonne Karney, a daughter of Kramer,
wrote in a letter to the Orange County Probation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer and her sisters said they were distressed to learn that
Minor, 34, the son of a wealthy potato grower, was driving drunk in
1998 when he was stopped for speeding in Newport Beach. Before he
could be arrested, Minor jumped back in his car and drove away with
23-year-old Officer Kristen Arnold dangling through an open door. The
officer was ejected when the Porsche swerved into a parked car but
escaped serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   After posting bail, Minor fled to Italy, where he fought
extradition to Orange County for two years. He was convicted earlier
this year of drunk driving and assault with a deadly weapon on a
police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Before the sentencing, Minor submitted a letter to be included in
his probation report.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 100% focused and readily prepared to take each and every step
to maintaining sobriety," Minor wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In March, however, Orange County Jail officials cited Minor for
fighting and for drinking alcohol in custody, according to the
probation report.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Kramer, another of the victim's daughters, wrote that she
hopes Minor learns from his latest mistake. "What I would like more
than anything would be for Jeff to be accountable for his actions and
to stop making excuses and stop running from his problems," she
wrote.</TE>

<HD>Killings Way Up, Coroner Reports</HD>
<DH>14 homicides left out of state report, official says.
Sheriff's Department to reexamine numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of homicides in Orange County's largest cities during the
first half of the year was underreported to the state attorney
general's office, the county's deputy coroner asserted Friday.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Kurt Murine said, a state report released this week
indicated an increase in homicides of 12.5% compared with the same
period in 2001, when the actual increase was 70.8%.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important to understand that the increase in violent crime,
specifically homicide, in Orange County is being underreported and
its significance underappreciated," Murine said.</LD>
<TE>   Murine said the biggest discrepancy was from the Orange County
Sheriff's Department, which reported one homicide from January to
June. He said the department recorded 10 homicides during that
period.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department, said he would look into the conflicting numbers.
"According to our records we had just one homicide," he said. "I
don't know where the coroner's office got its statistics."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear which Sheriff's Department numbers the state
counted. Murine said all sheriff's patrol areas should be counted.
But the state report appears to have counted only homicides in
unincorporated areas, not the many small cities sheriff's deputies
also patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's office is a division of the Sheriff's Department,
overseen by Sheriff Michael S. Carona.</TE>
<TE>   Five additional killings went unreported by the cities of Anaheim,
Costa Mesa, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, Murine said. That resulted in
the state attorney general's crime report listing only 27 homicides
in Orange County's largest cities instead of 41, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't begin to point fingers as to why these homicides aren't
being reported," Murine said. "Some cases can take months and months
to be resolved and reviewed. It's possible that some of the [law
enforcement agencies involved] didn't have the full benefit of closed
investigations.</TE>

<HD>Oakmont Project May Be Halted</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendale officials and a developer announced Friday that they are
"close to an agreement" that would shelve the proposed 572-home
Oakmont V subdivision and preserve the land as open space.</LD>
<LD>   "The deal being worked out would be for no development of the
property," said Lee Gregg, vice president of Gregg Artistic Homes,
which owns the 238-acre site in the Verdugo Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for the city of Glendale, the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy and the Mountains Recreation and Conservation
Authority to buy the property. Involved parties are still "in
mediation" and therefore prohibited by law from discussing the sale,
including the price, Gregg said.</LD>
<TE>   Oakmont has been one of the hottest issues in Glendale for more
than a decade, drawing hundreds of residents to public hearings that
ran as long as 11 hours. An agreement "gets us past that divisive
issue," City Manager Jim Starbird said.</TE>
<TE>   The Glendale City Council has scheduled a special meeting for 6
p.m. Tuesday to consider the purchase. If everything comes together,
title to the property could be transferred to the city, the
conservancy and the authority within 72 hours, Starbird said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a complete purchase that takes the entire property and
moves it into public ownership ... to preserve a significant,
valuable open-space resource in the city," he said.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Want Answers From Planners</HD>
<DH>Before fee increases are approved, officials want to know
where the money has gone. The higher permit charge is already in
question.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors on Friday demanded explanations for the
Planning Department's abrupt decision to lay off 20% of its staff and
seek sharp hikes in permit fees, saying they were caught off guard by
the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Planning Director Thomas B. Mathews said the emergency steps are
needed to stem a growing deficit that he blamed on an unanticipated
drop in building activity.</LD>
<LD>   But a key element of his recovery plan, raising building permit
fees by 58%, was already in trouble Friday.</LD>
<TE>   A special master appointed by a Superior Court judge to review the
county's handling of building fees warned that the court may want a
say in whether fees can be boosted. Robert P. Mosier of Costa Mesa
said in a memo that he would ask a judge Monday for direction unless
the board postpones a vote on the fee increase request.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they were unaware of the special master's memo
and expected to discuss it with Mathews and county Executive Officer
Michael Schumacher. They also were dismayed by the $2.5-million
deficit in a department they said should have kept better track of
building activity and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The fee increase request is the second time in four months that
the Planning Department has asked supervisors for help.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the board approved up to $8 million in emergency loans
from the general fund after planning officials said their reserve
fund was empty.</TE>
<TE>   The department's budget chief and assistant in charge of tracking
the fund were put on administrative leave while an audit was
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith said Friday that he wants answers from
Mathews.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I see some answers from his shop, I don't have any
confidence in what's going on," Smith said. "There are two people
still out on administrative leave, and [department officials] haven't
given us any report. They have to give us some answers before I
approve anything."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said the board should consider postponing
the fee increase until the judge deems it proper. The county needs to
confront the drop in permit revenue and the fact that "planning got
caught flat-footed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Mathews] came to us [in August] and said he needed $8
million, [the department was] confident it was temporary and that it
would be paid back. It's not coming together the way they said. I
need a real thorough financial analysis for me to say yes again,"
Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning officials have blamed the deficit on a plunge in building
permits. During boom years, the department oversaw the transformation
of miles of lima bean fields and orange groves into master-planned
communities. But development has slowed, with more raw land now
incorporated into cities.</TE>
<TE>   "There had never been that kind of a drop in five years," county
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. The planning department's status is
"an economy-driven situation about which thoughtful business
decisions are being made and the necessary steps are being taken."</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 lawsuit challenging how the county was charging for permits
added to the budget woes. Shortly after the suit was filed, a county
audit determined that builders might have been overcharged as much as
$10 million in fees.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors voted then to reduce fees by nearly 30% and, in the
process, to draw down a reserve fund that had grown as high as $18
million. The court hearing the lawsuit appointed the special master
to monitor the fee issue.</TE>
<TE>   The reserve fund had been drawn down to about $7 million by June
30, 2001. A year later, the fund should have contained about $2.5
million. A year-end audit discovered, however, that there was nothing
left, prompting Mathews to ask supervisors for help.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they want to know what happened to the $18
million and why the department wasn't streamlined, particularly with
the threat that a court could order further reductions in fees if the
county loses the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, who will replace Coad next month,
said he also wants to know what happened to the money. "If there was
a question of overcharging for permits and the fees were reduced, we
just can't start overcharging again," he said.</TE>

<HD>Angels Have Taken Sanctuary in a Former Church</HD>
<DH>A Wisconsin woman is up to her wing tips in a museum with
more than 7,500 statues and figurines depicting the heavenly
creatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELOIT, Wis.</DL>
<LD>A small museum that sits on the banks of the Rock River in southern
Wisconsin is a heavenly spot for angel lovers.</LD>
<LD>   The Beloit Angel Museum features more than 7,500 angel statues
displayed wing to wing in a former Roman Catholic church that was
spared destruction so it could house the figures.</LD>
<LD>   There are angels made of resin, porcelain, drinking straws, pasta,
coal, tin, ceramic, wood, papier-mache, stained glass, pine cones,
cornhusks, wax, clothes pins and seal skin. One was made from a dried
apple.</LD>
<TE>   There's a firefighter angel, a hunter, nurse, pilot, doctor, bride
and groom. One angel is tipsy; another is a bobble-head doll. Some
pose with devils.</TE>
<TE>   Others double as bells, candles, candle holders, vases, smoke
alarms, coasters, lipstick holders, pencil sharpeners, and salt and
pepper shakers.</TE>
<TE>   The display has made the Guinness Book of Records and includes
angels from around the globe: Oprah Winfrey donated a collection of
black angels.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the angels saved the 98-year-old building where they
are housed from being demolished.</TE>
<TE>   "What I believe in my heart is the collection happened, the museum
happened, and it was something that was supposed to happen," said
Joyce Berg, 71, who started the collection with her husband, Lowell,
in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Their first two angels came from a Florida antiques store.</TE>
<TE>   "As we got involved, it snowballed. They just were so sweet, and
we got caught up in the many, many different kinds there were," Joyce
Berg said. "It became a passion, and it became our hobby."</TE>
<TE>   The couple used to take about three vacations a year and would buy
angels as souvenirs from angel conventions, antiques malls or flea
markets. They once came home with 165 angels.</TE>
<TE>   The entire collection originally was displayed in their
four-bedroom ranch house in Beloit, about 65 miles southwest of
Milwaukee, but eventually the Bergs had to remove doors and install
shelves to display all the figures.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1994, while out driving, they noticed St. Paul Catholic
Church along the Rock River.</TE>
<TE>   "When we drove past, the doors were open.... The sun was shining
right on them. It was like they jumped right out because they were so
noticeable," Joyce Berg said.</TE>
<TE>   The parish had been closed in 1988 after the death of its longtime
pastor, and the Bergs learned that the church was scheduled to be
demolished in eight months if it wasn't put to good use. The Bergs
contacted former parishioners, and submitted a museum plan to city
officials, who approved it.</TE>
<TE>   The church, now a historical landmark, was renovated with
community development block grants, fund-raisers and volunteer help.
The city owns the church and charges the museum $1 a year for rent.</TE>
<TE>   The museum opened May 1, 1998, and more than 54,000 visitors have
passed through its doors since.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Berg said she didn't start collecting angels because of
religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "What I hope [people] get out of it is the pleasure and the
peaceful feeling and the enjoyment," Berg said. "But I do know ...
for a lot of people it is a religious experience."</TE>

<HD>600-Year-Old Jewish Manuscript Displayed</HD>

<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>It survived the Spanish Inquisition, the Bosnian war and the ravages
of time. Now a 600-year-old Jewish manuscript, one of Bosnia's most
prized artifacts, is on public display.</LD>
<LD>   Handwritten on calfskin, the 109-page Passover ritual text, or
haggada, was a 14th century wedding present in Spain, which then had
a thriving Jewish community. When Spain expelled its Jews in 1492, a
refugee took the manuscript to Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually it ended up in Bosnia and was sold to Sarajevo's
National Museum.</LD>
<TE>   During World War II, a Roman Catholic museum director and his
Muslim colleague spirited the prized manuscript away from Nazis who
wanted to confiscate it. In 1992, during the Bosnian war, a museum
official braved Serbian sniper fire to rescue the text.</TE>
<TE>   Now, through efforts of the United Nations Trust Fund, it is on
permanent display in the National Museum alongside Orthodox Christian
and Muslim manuscripts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's proof that, here, not only we can live together, but we
used to live together for centuries and hope to continue to live
together," said Jakob Finci, head of Bosnia's Jewish community.</TE>

<LD>The Vatican's top theologian, German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, has
been chosen dean of the College of Cardinals, replacing Cardinal
Bernardin Gantin, 80, who wants to return to Benin, his homeland.</LD>
<LD>   The title, mainly honorary, makes Ratzinger, 75, a kind of first
among equals in the group that elects the pope. Ratzinger continues
as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the
Vatican office that protects doctrinal orthodoxy.</LD>
<LD>   The dean, at one time chosen by seniority, was selected by several
leading cardinals, Ratzinger among them, and confirmed by the pope.</LD>

<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, in a message for next year's observances of the
World Day of Migrants and Refugees, urged Christians to fight "all
racism, xenophobia and exaggerated nationalism."</LD>
<LD>   "The path to true acceptance of immigrants in their cultural
diversity is actually a difficult one, in some cases a real Way of
the Cross," the pontiff said. He urged Christians to use their faith
to help meet "the daily challenge of turning from egoism to altruism,
from fear to openness, from rejection to solidarity."</LD>
<LD>   John Paul expressed concern for undocumented migrants, refugees,
asylum seekers and those displaced by violent conflicts. He called
human trafficking a "terrible crime" and said ethnic cleansing grows
out of "sinful intentions and actions."</LD>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The theft of a 14th century stone font from the chapel of Usk Castle
in south Wales, coming a month after the theft of a 15th century
statue of the Virgin Mary from Prinknash Abbey just 30 miles to the
east in England, has aroused fears that a gang of thieves may be at
work stealing ecclesiastical antiques to order for foreign
collectors.</LD>
<LD>   It is "very unusual" for a font to be stolen, said Nick Tolson,
director of Churchwatch, an organization that advises churches and
congregations on how to keep their treasures safe.</LD>
<LD>   "It is usually property that can't be identified as
ecclesiastical," he told Religion News Service.</LD>
<TE>   Tolson estimated that churches lost about 2,000 items last year to
thieves, compared with the theft of only 42 from the country's
museums.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tolson, the best way for churches to protect property
is to photograph and record items and to put identifying microdots on
them.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who has acknowledged
ordaining a practicing homosexual while serving in Wales, says he
probably won't do it again.</LD>
<LD>   He told a church newspaper that he sees no theological objection
to women bishops, but said that if any are consecrated in England,
the church might need a separate jurisdiction for dissenting
traditionalists.</LD>
<LD>   The archbishop took office this week as leader of the Church of
England and 77 million Anglicans and Episcopalians worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   Anglican bodies in Canada, the United States and New Zealand have
women bishops, and that step has been approved in principle by
Anglicans elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   On homosexuality, Williams abstained when a 1998 international
conference of Anglican bishops strongly endorsed a resolution stating
that active gay relationships are "incompatible with Scripture."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the resolution "says what the mind of the church is. I
feel, in my public position, that I am bound to live with that."</TE>
<TE>   However, Williams said, "I think the question is worth asking"
whether those who say the Bible condemns all homosexual behavior are
properly interpreting Scripture.</TE>

<HD>Churches Act to Buttress the Family</HD>
<DH>Pastors once thought just being Christians would save
marriages. Now they're offering counseling, before and after the
nuptials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a third of "born-again" Christians reporting that they have gone
through at least one divorce, Christian ministers, psychologists, and
marriage and family counselors say churches need to be much more open
and direct about dealing with their members' relationships, mate
selection, marriage preparation and marriage enhancement.</LD>
<LD>   "Churches should take a leading role because they have a moral
position in the importance of commitment people make to one another,"
said James L. Furrow, professor of marital and family therapy at
Fuller Theological Seminary's School of Psychology.</LD>
<LD>   Many church leaders had believed that active church members would
have a lower divorce rate than others because of Christian teachings
about the permanence of marriage. But that does not appear to be the
case.</LD>
<TE>   Several studies, including a recent survey by the Barna Research
Group, which is well known for its church-related polls, have shown
that religious Christians have divorce rates the same as the general
population, with approximately one-third of adults having been
through at least one divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done a good job of helping people to know how to
integrate their faith into every dimension of their life," said
pollster George Barna.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Survival of Fittest'</TE>
<TE>   "What we wind up with are people who know some of the principles
and stories and platitudes, but when push comes to shove, it's
survival of the fittest."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Gordon Kirk, senior pastor of Lake Avenue Church in
Pasadena, says his congregation took Barna's "truth telling" to
heart, and has initiated deliberate actions to counter what he sees
as a divorce "crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Every couple that wishes to marry at Lake Avenue must take a
10-week premarital course. They are then matched with a mentor
couple, who are available to work with them from the first marriage
preparation class through the wedding and the first year of marriage.
Couples also must take mandatory counseling, from six to 10 sessions.</TE>
<TE>   To help increase "contentment in marriage and decrease divorce
rates," the church has also launched a joint program with Fuller
Theological Seminary.</TE>
<TE>   The project aims to use the church's racially and ethnically
diverse members as a "laboratory" to assess the effectiveness of
counseling and similar programs.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders attribute the discrepancy between belief and
behavior in Christian marriages to the pervasive influence of the
culture of individualism, narcissism and consumerism.</TE>
<TE>   "Tragically, the church is getting conformed to the mold of the
world," said the Rev. David W. Miller, senior pastor of the Church at
the Rocky Peak in Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Postmodern Age</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the philosophical mood that underlies all of our
basic media, our entertainment, our novels, our thought forms," said
David Augsburger, professor of pastoral care at Fuller and author of
20 books on marriage, human relations and pastoral counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "We've moved into a postmodern age, where we respect each person's
frame of reference, and believe that universals -- like commitments
that marriage is not to be broken -- are no longer binding."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for religious couples, a faith that the marriage covenant is
"not just between you and me, but it's between you, me and God," can
be a resource to help through difficult times, said Furrow.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts on marriage, however, say pastors are mistaken to
believe that spiritual compatibility alone is enough to sustain a
marriage, said Neil Clark Warren, a clinical psychologist and
minister who has written eight books on marriage and relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "In the church, they're sick about all this marital decay, but
they continue to addictively hold on to the idea [that ] if you just
get spiritual compatibility right and you get chemistry right, that's
all you need," said Warren.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't get intelligence right, if you don't get energy
right, if you don't get values right, if one of you is financially
irresponsible, if one of you has an anger management problem -- any
one of these can cause a major chaos in marriage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem that particularly affects couples in evangelical
Christian churches is a tendency to bury marital difficulties out of
fear or shame, Furrow said. Fellow church members often are surprised
when these relationships end.</TE>
<TE>   "A typical couple won't go to therapy until it's too late," said
Jack Orville Balswick, professor of sociology and family development
at Fuller.</TE>

<HD>Truck Crash Spills 4,000 Gallons of Jet Fuel</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tanker truck carrying aviation fuel to John Wayne Airport spilled
4,000 gallons of the fuel in Costa Mesa early Friday after being
broadsided by a sport utility vehicle, police reported.</LD>
<LD>   No serious injuries were reported and the spilled fuel was
contained in a concrete gutter running parallel to the Costa Mesa
Freeway, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, Rolando Aguilar, 27, of Orange exited the
northbound 55 Freeway at Baker Street in a Chevy Tahoe. He ran a red
light and collided with the tanker, which was eastbound on Paularino
Avenue at 2:02 a.m., police said. The tanker driver's name was not
released.</LD>
<TE>   The collision forced the tanker onto its side and one of its two
containers ruptured. The aviation fuel spilled onto the street and
headed for what appeared to be a storm drain leading to the ocean.
Fortunately, according to Costa Mesa Fire Dept. Battalion Chief Gregg
Steward, the drain instead diverted the fuel to a wide gutter filled
with dirt and debris, which soaked up a large amount of the fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Both drivers were taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in
Newport Beach, where they were treated for minor injuries. Aguilar
was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The offramp and surrounding streets remained closed until about
noon.</TE>
<TE>   Hazardous materials units from the Huntington Beach and Santa Ana
fire departments responded to the incident as a precaution, as did an
Orange County Fire Authority crew with fire retardant foam.</TE>
<TE>   A private firm cleaned the streets and removed the fuel-soaked
debris from the gutter, Steward said.</TE>

<LD>Sunny Blonsky could have invested in some nice municipal bonds but
decided to go for a more significant return -- the smiles of children
she doesn't even know.</LD>
<LD>   That is why Blonsky spent more than $7,800 early Friday morning on
cart after shopping cart brimming with toys. And it's also why she is
going back for more.</LD>
<LD>   Schlepping through a Rite-Aid store in Thousand Oaks, she gathered
Barbie outfits and battery-operated bulldozers, crayon sets and
kiddie microwaves, scrutinizing her finds with a shrewd shopper's eye
before pulling them off the shelves by the stack.</LD>
<TE>   "I get a lot of joy out of picking them out and I want them to be
something nice," she said. "No guns or anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   A travel agent, Blonsky, 58, works from her home in nearby
Westlake Village. Her husband, Jerry, works for a local heating and
air conditioning business.</TE>
<TE>   Childless, they aren't fabulously wealthy. But they want for
nothing, Blonsky said, and look for opportunities to share what they
have.</TE>
<TE>   Each holiday season for the last nine years, the couple have
bought hundreds of toys for charities. Since 2000, their generosity
has benefited the "Spark of Love" drive of the Ventura County Fire
Department, which dispatches a truck to pick up the booty.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I encountered her, she called and asked where she
could donate toys," said county Fire Department spokesman Joe Luna.
"I told her, 'Just drop by a fire station.' But when she asked if we
could send a truck, it turned out to be an understatement. She just
opens up her heart."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, that meant a quick trip to the Rite-Aid storeroom,
where store manager Ferdie Sevillano showed Blonsky the vast piles of
toys, dolls, games and festive what-nots brought in for the occasion
from other stores in the chain. Loading a dolly for the first of many
trips to the cash register, he instantly summed up the moment:
"There's gonna' be a lot of happy kids."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Blonsky hit the aisles, shadowed by a reporter and
photographer. She said she never has sought publicity but agreed to
it last year only to spur donations.</TE>
<TE>   A brisk, no-nonsense woman, she knew how to say no to toys. She
passed on the 37-note battery-operated keyboard. "Those things can
drive a parent crazy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And she grimaced at the "World Peacekeepers Military Motorbike
With Fully Posable Action Figure" in its khaki camouflage box.</TE>
<TE>   But it was yes to the Etch-a-Sketch, and yes to Peek-a-boo Peggy,
yes to the mini-monster truck that flips itself over, yes to the doll
that trills "Mary Had a Little Lamb," yes to the Wild Quest
Endangered Animal Rescue Patrol, complete with majestic plastic
elephant and a plastic ecologist called Wildboar Max. In general, it
was a yes from Blonsky to the good karma that comes from doing good.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you give, you get back tenfold," Blonsky said, deciding
to forgo a Barbie Pizza Hut Playset. "Kids get too much fast food
anyway," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of hours, the toy shelves looked like a gap-toothed
smile, with Army tanks and fighter planes setting off the empty
spaces where teddy bears and dolls had until recently resided.
Blonsky said she would be back next week, ready to spend another
$1,500 or so when the store can restock her preferred toys.</TE>
<TE>   "They know what I like," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The toys, which Rite-Aid sold at a 10% discount, were hauled to a
Ventura storefront, where volunteers sorted them for some 3,000
foster kids, children in group homes and others in need.</TE>
<TE>   Blonsky is just one of many contributors, said Ventura County
community services coordinator Pam Waldron, who directs the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a man who for many years bought $5,000 or $10,000 worth of
bicycles because he never had one as a child," Waldron said. "We've
got volunteers working full time for weeks before the holidays. We've
got Girl Scouts making teddy bears and retired people on fixed
incomes giving what they can.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day," she said, "I'm reminded of what the season is all
about."</TE>

<HD>Last SLA Fugitive Agrees to Return to California</HD>
<DH>Former radical James Kilgore will face trial in a 1975 bank
robbery and murder. Four others have pleaded guilty in the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Fugitive U.S. radical activist James Kilgore agreed in a Cape Town
court Friday to return to the United States to face charges over the
murder of a woman in a 1975 bank robbery in Carmichael, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Kilgore, 55, is the last fugitive member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army, a radical gang that kidnapped American heiress
Patricia Hearst in 1974. He was arrested last month in Cape Town,
where he had lived for years as an academic under a false name.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers told the court that the United States had filed for
extradition requesting the listing of charges linked to illegal
explosives and the bank robbery in which a fellow SLA member shot
dead Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four who was depositing church
collections.</LD>
<TE>   Four of Kilgore's former SLA comrades pleaded guilty in Sacramento
last month to charges stemming from the same robbery and murder and
were sent to prison for between six and eight years under a plea
bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore's lawyers said in November that he would accept the same
deal and was prepared to serve a similar jail term, as long as no
additional charges were brought.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore's lawyer, Anton Katz, said his client would not oppose
extradition, which will proceed after South African Justice Minister
Penuell Maduna signs the necessary documents.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow lawyer Michael Evans said Kilgore probably will return to
the United States this month.</TE>
<TE>   Maduna could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Kilgore will first face the explosives charges, said
Matt Jacobs, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San
Francisco. Aside from that, "there's nothing else I can say
publicly," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Lana Wyant, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento district attorney,
had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said Kilgore plans to serve his time, then return to South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The SLA surfaced in 1973 when the group claimed responsibility for
the murder of Oakland's first black superintendent of schools, Marcus
Foster.</TE>
<TE>   The small band of political extremists made worldwide headlines
when they kidnapped Hearst, the heiress to the Hearst newspaper
empire.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst then briefly joined the gang before she was captured and
jailed, despite her insistence that she had been brainwashed.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst was later pardoned by President Clinton.</TE>

<HD>Philip Berrigan, 79; Led Catholic Anti-War Movement</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Philip Berrigan, the patriarch of the Roman Catholic anti-war
movement, died Friday night of liver and kidney cancer, his family
said. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Berrigan led a group that staged one of the most dramatic protests
of the 1960s. They doused homemade napalm on a small bonfire of draft
records in a Catonsville, Md., parking lot, an act that ignited a
generation of anti-war dissent. More recently, he helped found the
Plowshares movement, whose members have attacked federal military
property in anti-war and anti-nuclear protests.</LD>
<LD>   Berrigan's family said he was diagnosed with cancer two months ago
and decided to stop chemotherapy a month ago. His brother, the Rev.
Daniel Berrigan, officiated over last rites ceremonies Nov. 30
attended by friends and peace activists, family members said.</LD>
<TE>   A complete obituary will appear in Sunday's edition.</TE>

<HD>State Census Sampling Shows Huge Undercount</HD>
<DH>Revised figures indicate 509,000 Californians uncounted,
half in the Southland. The bureau, however, says it lacks confidence
in new tally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Fields</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Census 2000 failed to count 509,012 Californians, more than half of
them in the Southland, according to a set of much-debated,
statistically revised figures released Friday by the U.S. Census
Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   Almost 300,000 of those overlooked were Latino, the agency said.
More than 25% were children.</LD>
<LD>   Census Bureau officials say they do not have confidence in the
accuracy of the adjusted numbers, which use sampling to account for
people who may have been missed or recorded twice in the conventional
mail-in and door-to-door count. They released the figures under a
court order.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the new figures revived complaints by Los Angeles and
other large cities that the official 2000 head count, frozen early
last year for election redistricting purposes, cost them billions in
federal and state funds, which are allocated mostly on the basis of
population.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials say the city will be shortchanged by $186
million over the next 10 years, for everything from school lunches to
aid for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are not just theoretical stuff," Assistant City Atty.
Jessica Heinz said. "They really translate into services in the
community."</TE>
<TE>   The adjusted count gave five Southern California counties -- Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura -- an
additional 261,518 residents, cumulatively. On paper, Los Angeles'
population grew by 2%, adding another 75,000 people, two-thirds of
them Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "The census needs to utilize this information to identify the
areas that are hard to count," said Leo Estrada, a professor in
UCLA's urban planning department. "Everything they've tried in the
past probably did make a difference, but some parts of major urban
areas need to be approached differently."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, affluent older whites have been most likely to be
double-counted, in part because of vacation homes and other dual
residences. By contrast, Latinos and African Americans have been most
likely to be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   The adjusted 2000 counts affirm the pattern: California's
uncounted white population amounted to just 0.6%, while 2.7% of
Latinos and 2.8% of African Americans were missed, according to the
sampling. Those differences worry some population analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though some people don't like to talk about this, race and
ethnicity can often be proxies for greater need in some areas," said
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant on the census and federal
statistical issues. "We know that a greater proportion of African
American children are poor. If we are missing larger numbers of
African American kids in the census, clearly there may be a greater
need for certain programs, like free or reduced[-cost] school
lunches, than the official census figures reflect."</TE>
<TE>   Such issues have put a political charge into the debate over which
census snapshot should be official, with Republicans favoring the
original and Democrats the adjusted version. Though the Census Bureau
tabulated the adjusted totals early last year, the Bush
administration had resisted releasing them, saying they were highly
inaccurate. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by 16 federal
lawmakers led to the court order compelling the adjusted data's
release.</TE>

<HD>Suspected Robbers Take Their Infant on a Wild Ride</HD>

<LD>Two suspected bank robbers led Brea police on a high-speed chase
along city streets and a freeway Friday with their 7-month-old
daughter unbuckled in the back seat, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "We arrested them with money and a gun in the car," Brea Police
spokesman Lt. Martin Needham said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 4:45 p.m., when a 34-year-old man walked
into the Wells Fargo bank on North Brea Boulevard and held up a
teller with a gun, Needham said. After being given an unspecified
amount of money, the man got into a rented sport utility vehicle
driven by his 21-year-old wife, who led police on a 10-minute chase
through Brea, Fullerton and Placentia at speeds up to 95 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The chase ended at an apartment complex in Brea, where the couple
-- identified as Robert Lewis Bandy and Teffany Tanee Crain of Garden
Grove -- were arrested without incident.</TE>
<TE>   Only then did officers discover the baby, who was not in a car
seat.</TE>
<TE>   The couple also is suspected in a La Habra bank robbery earlier
Friday, Needham said. Their daughter, who was not injured, was placed
in protective custody at Orange County's emergency shelter for
children.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 15, Fatally Shot Near Church; Suspect Is Held</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old boy shot in front of a San Bernardino church as he
headed there for youth night died early Friday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Tory Lynch was about to go into Temple Missionary Baptist Church
about 6:30 p.m. Thursday when a man walked up and began arguing with
him, said San Bernardino Police Sgt. Jess Hernandez.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Billy Edward Johnson, 24, allegedly pulled out a
handgun and shot Lynch several times in front of other teenagers and
church employees.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson ran, but was arrested minutes later in an apartment
building in Colton, Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch was placed on life support at Arrowhead Regional Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The motive for the argument and shooting has not been detailed by
police. Johnson is being held at the West Valley Detention Center.</TE>
<TE>   At the church, Pastor Jeffrey Wiggins said about 30 teenagers
typically show up Thursday nights for choir practice or youth night.
They are taught lessons about life through the Bible and are given
advice about avoiding gangs, abstaining from sex before marriage,
doing well in school and other challenges they might face, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't at-risk kids. They're not gang members. They're just
sons and daughters of members of the church who want to stay on the
straight road," Wiggins said. "They're good kids."</TE>
<TE>   A vigil for Lynch was held Friday night, he said.</TE>

<HD>Air Panel Bans Chemical for Dry Cleaning</HD>
<DH>In nation's first such action, officials bar all
perchloroethylene use by 2020, despite protests from small
businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California air quality officials on Friday enacted the
nation's first ban on perchloroethylene, or "perc," a chemical widely
used by dry cleaners.</LD>
<LD>   By 2020, no more dry-cleaning machines that require the chemical
will be permitted in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside or San Bernardino
counties. That is one year later than originally proposed and the
longest lead time for any air pollution control regulation in the Los
Angeles region.</LD>
<LD>   The regulation approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District board applies to 2,086 neighborhood dry cleaners. Industry
representatives, health officials and activists from across the
country paid close attention to the matter because other cities could
follow suit. Chicago officials, for example, are considering a
similar measure.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the death knell for 'perc' dry cleaning in this area. It's
the first place in the nation to do this, and it will cause a ripple
effect across the country," said Martin Schlageter of the Santa
Monica-based Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   Perchloroethylene is a sweet-smelling solvent that is tough on
stains, but it can be bad for human health. Blouses, jackets and
slacks are immersed in a solvent bath, and each time a dollop of
gravy or splash of mud is removed, a puff of toxic pollution is
released.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials estimate that 850 tons of the chemical are
released in the Los Angeles region annually, ranking it as one of the
most abundant airborne toxic substances and posing an unacceptably
high cancer risk, although industry officials dispute that assertion.</TE>
<TE>   The air board's unanimous decision culminates two years of
contentious negotiations with dry cleaners and pilot programs that
persuaded officials that other cleaning methods are ready for use.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came one month after the board postponed action on
the matter after a raucous, six-hour public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of dry cleaners, many of them Korean American, shouted
and marched in protest outside the AQMD's headquarters in Diamond Bar
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality board members, most of whom are local elected
officials, clearly were uncomfortable regulating mom-and-pop cleaning
shops in their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 12-member board gave environmentalists the solvent
ban they wanted, it sought to reduce the impact on dry cleaners with
incentives and flexible compliance methods to smooth the transition
to solvent-free cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   "This allows the industry to move forward in a manner with a
noneconomic impact and allows the environmental goals to move
forward," said board member William Burke.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, more restrictions are scheduled for
cleaning machines that use the chemical to reduce toxic emissions and
nudge dry cleaners toward alternative technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Jan. 1, new dry cleaners must install machines that do
not use the chemical and existing cleaners cannot add such machines.</TE>
<TE>   After November 2007, dry cleaners will be permitted just one such
machine in their shop, provided that it is fitted with advanced
controls that cut emissions by about 80% over current models and
complies with a toxic risk-based guideline that applies to other
polluters, such as oil refiners and metal-plating shops.</TE>
<TE>   However, 18 dry cleaners now using old, high-polluting equipment
are required to switch to alternative technologies or advanced
machines by July 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the AQMD will provide $2 million to help small businesses
pay for clean, new machines.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them use water-based cleansers, carbon dioxide or
low-polluting solvents, and can cost more than current technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sinsheimer, director of the Pollution Prevention, Education
and Research Center at Occidental College, has successfully tested
those technologies and said that the regulation approved Friday will
expedite their use.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good for the industry, good for the environment and good
for workers," Sinsheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry representatives opposed any ban on the chemical and
remain skeptical about some of the new technologies.</TE>
<TE>   They hope to revisit the matter in two years, when a report due to
the AQMD board will describe the state-of-the-art technology in the
dry-cleaning industry.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents included chemical makers Dow Chemical and PPG
Industries, as well as the International Fabricare Institute, which
represents dry cleaners worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bad for the dry cleaners," said Kee Whan Ha, president of
the Korean American Federation of Los Angeles. "It was not
reasonable. I'm very disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   But Sandra Giarde of the California Cleaners Assn. praised the
decision and predicted that dry cleaners will find ways to comply
without undue burden.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the fairness we asked for," she said. "Your clothes are
still going to be cleaned in the same solvent they were before, and
consumers will still be able to go to the neighborhood dry cleaners."</TE>

<HD>Trashed Frat House Puts Owners' Hopes on Hold</HD>
<DH>Brothers sold their homes to buy a fourplex near Cal State
Fullerton for retirement income. Then came the party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento and Jorge Restrepo came to the United States from their
native Colombia a quarter-century ago, about the time the Sigma Pi
fraternity brothers began renting a fourplex a few blocks from the
Cal State Fullerton campus.</LD>
<LD>   After a lifetime of working as welders, the Santa Ana brothers
sold their homes about 18 months ago and used the money to buy that
frat house -- a rental investment they hoped would fund their
retirements.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, they were still picking through the rubble after police
say the house was vandalized when the fraternity was evicted for
falling three months' behind on their $4,100-a-month rent.</LD>
<TE>   "Where they come from, young men don't act this way -- especially
university students. They have more respect for themselves and
others," said Edgar Restrepo, Sacramento's 27-year-old son. "My dad
worked two, three shifts a day all his life to acquire what he has
gotten. To have this done to him ... there are no excuses for this."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton police continue to investigate the incident, which
occurred late Monday or early Tuesday after a final party at the
house.</TE>
<TE>   More than $100,000 in damage was done. Bathroom fixtures and
windows were smashed. Holes were punched in walls and paint
splattered inside and out. A balcony was torn off the building and
broken furniture was dumped in a courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty bad -- totally trashed," said Fullerton Police Lt.
Doug Cave, who said the investigation is focusing on 14 men who
reportedly were recently expelled from Sigma Pi. "There was a strong
intent to do as much damage as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   University officials also are investigating and could punish those
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've ever had anything like this happen," said
Shari Scott, coordinator for Greek life on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Other fraternities have reached out to the Restrepo brothers,
offering to help clean up and make repairs to the former Sigma Pi
house. At a meeting Friday, they also agreed to raise money for the
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Restrepo said his father and uncle appreciate the offers,
but will let their insurance company handle the mess.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to rent the fourplex again, but "definitely not to
another frat," Edgar Restrepo said. "And not to college students."</TE>

<HD>Glenn Quinn, 32; Actor Was in TV Series 'Roseanne' and
'Angel'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn Quinn, best known for his recurring role on the sitcom
"Roseanne" and a former co-star of the supernatural drama "Angel,"
died Tuesday in North Hollywood. He was 32.</LD>
<LD>   The Dublin-born Quinn was found dead from a possible drug overdose
at a friend's home, Los Angeles police said Friday. Detectives said
the case will remain open pending the completion of toxicology tests,
but no foul play was suspected.</LD>
<LD>   Quinn joined the cast of "Roseanne" in its third season, playing
Becky Connor's not-so-bright, yet sincere boyfriend and then husband,
Mark, from 1990 to 1997.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a phenomenal training ground, and I learned things that
cannot be taught in any acting class," the untrained Quinn told
London's Sunday Mirror.</TE>
<TE>   He also co-starred as the half-demon Doyle on "Angel," a spinoff
of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," during its 1999 premiere season.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of his roles required him to hide his Irish accent,
"Angel" was his first role in an American series in which he could
speak naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get to speak Irish, you become more at one with
yourself, you kind of have a spark when you use it, and I think it's
a great dialect," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn was born in 1970. He played in local bands before moving to
the United States in 1988 with his mother and two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   He made his feature film debut with a supporting role as a drummer
in the 1991 John Travolta rock musical "Shout," in which he shared an
on-screen kiss with Gwyneth Paltrow. He went on to appear in the
films "Dr. Giggles," "Live Nude Girls" and "Campfire Tales."</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared in the TV movies "Call Me Anna" and "Silhouette"
and co-starred in "Covington Cross," a short-lived,
historical-fantasy series, which aired in the United Kingdom and on
ABC in 1992. Most recently, he co-starred in "At Any Cost," a 2000
VH1 movie.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his mother, Bernadette, and two sisters, Sonya
and Louisa.</TE>

at 76. The cause of death was not known.</LD>
<LD>   Illich's numerous books and articles earned him a reputation as a
crank and a visionary whose first allegiance was to the past. He saw
modern technology as oppressive, claiming, for example, that cars
enslaved society and that bicycles were a faster way to travel.</LD>
<LD>   A teacher for more than 50 years, he was wary of his own
profession. In his 1971 book "De-Schooling Society," he argued that
children learn best at home or in casual situations rather than
through formal education.</LD>
<TE>   He became a familiar name in religious and education circles after
he founded a training center in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in 1961. Part
language program, part think tank, the Intercultural Center of
Documentation prepared missionaries to work in Mexico and Latin
America and attracted priests, nuns and lay Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   When he opened the center, Illich was a Catholic monsignor, but
from the first he challenged his students' existing assumptions about
Western superiority and religious patriarchy, which soon embroiled
him in ecclesiastical controversy.</TE>
<TE>   His view that the Catholic Church should dissolve its bureaucracy
did not help his standing with the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968 Illich was called to Rome to explain, but he refused to
answer his interrogators' questions.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of dollars in church funds were withdrawn from his
center and he severed ties between the center and religious
institutions. A year later he resigned from the priesthood. By then
he had chosen the social causes that occupied him for the rest of his
life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vienna in 1926, Illich was the son of a Catholic Croatian
civil engineer. His mother was a Sephardic Jew and, in 1941, his
family was expelled from Croatia because of her Jewish heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Illich completed his education in Salzburg, Austria; Florence,
Italy; and Rome, where he entered a seminary. As a new priest in
1952, he moved to New York City to work in a parish made up mainly of
Puerto Ricans. Four years later he was named vice rector of the
Catholic University of Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   There, he complained that fellow clergy arriving from the mainland
did not speak adequate Spanish nor did they know very much about
Latino culture.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960 he disputed the local bishop, James McManus, who forbade
local Catholics to vote for a gubernatorial candidate who was a
proponent of state-funded birth control.</TE>
<TE>   Illich defended their right to exercise their freedom of
conscience, a fundamental teaching of Catholic ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Denounced by the bishop, he returned to New York to work as a
research assistant at Fordham University. He also founded an early
version of the center he later established in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1961, four months after Illich opened his center in
Cuernavaca, Time magazine reported on the training program, whose
highlights included 5 1/2-hour drills in Spanish and group therapy
sessions that tore down ethnocentric beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the inmates are not sure themselves what they have got
into, or what manner of wild man is this dark, cadaverous Ivan Illich
who yells at them and lectures them, plays and prays with them,
insults them and drinks with them," Time reported.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, two years before he left the priesthood, Illich
recommended that the Catholic Church radically reorganize itself for
the future. He envisioned a time when small groups of Christians met
for supper in private homes and the laity took a greater role in
church leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The declining number of priests was in his estimation a good sign.
"We welcome the disappearance of institutional bureaucracy in a
spirit of deep joy," he wrote in an article for Critic magazine.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 15 years his books met with mixed reviews by critics,
who praised his keen intelligence but complained that his research
was selective and one-sided and that he rarely offered alternatives
to the social situations he decried.</TE>
<TE>   His most important book, "De-Schooling Society" (1971), prompted
reviewer Anatole Broyard to compare it to a speech that gives you
goose bumps. But he rejected a number of Illich's arguments. "Schools
aren't as bad as he maintains, most learning isn't acquired casually,
as he says ... schools are not entirely self-perpetuating, as he
says," Broyard wrote for the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Illich's "Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health" in 1975
contended that the medical establishment is a hazard to people's
health. "Shadow Work" in 1981 criticized modern technology.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Berger, the noted sociologist, reviewed the latter. "Its
weaknesses are those of his earlier books," Berger wrote for the New
York Times. "Mr. Illich seems incapable of perceiving the liberating
and humanizing effects of modernity."</TE>
<TE>   From 1979 until his death, Illich worked as a professor on
university faculties in Europe and the United States teaching
political science, medieval history, architecture and sociology,
among other subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Writing about him for America, the Jesuit magazine, in 1967,
Fordham University colleague Father Joseph P. Fitzpatrick noted that
Illich believed in conflict if it helped bring about change.</TE>
<TE>   "He is therefore and always will be a sign of contradiction and a
focus of controversy," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Illich never married and had no children.</TE>

<HD>Date-Rape Suspect Says Officers Terrorized Him During
Questioning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking the stand during a pretrial hearing, millionaire date-rape
suspect Andrew Luster told a judge Friday that arresting officers
terrorized and intimidated him during a police interrogation two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   One detective threatened to push him down a flight of concrete
stairs if he was uncooperative, Luster testified. He also said other
deputies with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department kept him locked
in a hot patrol car for an hour after his arrest.</LD>
<LD>   "They locked me in and let me suffer," Luster, 38, testified. "I
was having a difficult time breathing."</LD>
<TE>   Referring to the alleged threat to push him down stairs, which the
detective denies, Luster said, "It was terrorizing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contend Luster's statements during a July 18,
2000, tape-recorded interview should be excluded from his trial next
week because, they said, investigators violated his rights and
altered portions of the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's sudden appearance on the stand was one of several
dramatic developments Friday in the Ventura County rape case.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Superior Court Judge Ken Riley denied a
defense motion to disqualify the Ventura County district attorney
from the case because of alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said he found no evidence of police or prosecutor
malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling strikes at the heart of the defense case. For months
attorneys have argued prosecutors have lied, falsified evidence and
concealed items that could exonerate Luster -- allegations
prosecutors have denied.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's lawyer, Roger Jon Diamond, urged Riley to allow evidence
of an overzealous prosecution, calling it critical to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   But Riley, assigned to the case for more than a year, said, "I
find no evidence that there has been purposeful police
misconduct....This is not going to be a police misconduct case."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers are under a gag order and could not comment on the
rulings.</TE>
<TE>   While striking a blow to the defense case, Riley also denied a key
prosecution motion Friday. He ruled that seven women who have accused
Luster of drugging them at bars, parties, and, in one case, at a Las
Vegas strip club, may not testify.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with raping three women after knocking them out with the
date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Clear Businessman in Brutal Attack on His Ex-Wife</HD>
<DH>Citing a lack of physical evidence, the panel votes 11 to 1
in favor of Lee Mannheimer in the beating of Linda Morrisset in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors voted Friday in favor of a Westlake Village businessman whose
wife had accused him in a civil trial of smashing her skull during an
attack that left her partially paralyzed and brain damaged.</LD>
<LD>   Following two days of deliberations, jurors concluded 11 to 1 that
lawyers for 51-year-old Linda Morrisset had not shown that her
ex-husband, Lee Mannheimer, 59, was responsible for the attack in
1999. However, one of the panelists said some members on the panel
believed the defendant was involved in the attack with a metal
flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of us had a gut feeling he may have been responsible," said
juror Jerry Landis of Port Hueneme, "but there just wasn't enough
solid evidence to comfortably pin it on one person."</LD>
<TE>   The lone holdout, a man on active duty in the military, left the
courthouse without talking to reporters after the 5:30 p.m. verdict
in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, Sandy Kueny of Moorpark, said deliberations were
highly charged at times as the panel tried to sort through three
weeks of testimony in what one attorney described as a "he-said,
she-said" case.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just one thing," Kueny said. "It was several things
that we had to go over again and again."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they were swayed by the absence of physical evidence
linking Mannheimer to the Sept. 11, 1999, beating of his wife, a
Newbury Park accountant.</TE>
<TE>   They also said a key factor was the testimony of the couple's
12-year-old son, Maxx, who said his father was at his home in
Westlake Village the night his mother was attacked in her home near
Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Mannheimer nor Morrisset was in court when the verdict was
read.</TE>
<TE>   But in a telephone interview Friday night, Mannheimer said he was
elated but confused as to why it took jurors "so long" to reach a
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy," Mannheimer said, noting that he was sitting
next to his son in their home. "My son is a first-class Boy Scout who
doesn't lie.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of what was said by the plaintiff were things that never
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer said that what happened to Morrisset was a tragedy, but
that he didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   The person who did, he said, was likely a jewel thief who broke
into the house and then attacked Morrisset when she surprised him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty of justice that the Sheriff's Department hasn't
brought this person to justice," he said. "Linda is the mother of my
son, and I have tried to help her."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have joint custody of Maxx, but Mannheimer said
Morrisset is unable to care for the boy because of her injuries. She
had been seeking $2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's attorney, Allen Ball, called the verdict a great
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   He said he believes the evidence shows that Mannheimer was
responsible for his ex-wife's injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Linda is going to be the only one in a wheelchair this
Christmas," Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   Ball said Morrisset may appeal on the grounds that the jury was
not allowed to consider whether Mannheimer masterminded the attack by
directing someone else to carry it out.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez, called the verdict a relief
but a tragedy for his client's entire family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long four years for him," Ramirez said. "It's a shame
these disputes end up in court."</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset filed a lawsuit two years ago after prosecutors declined
to charge Mannheimer in the near-fatal attack.</TE>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
family housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   After waking from a 16-day coma, Morrisset identified Mannheimer
as her attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested him, but he was released after prosecutors
decided there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that the biggest stumbling block was
Morrisset's inability to fully recall the attack.</TE>

<LD>   The accident occurred about 9:20 p.m. at the intersection of
Savanna Street and Knott Avenue just north of Ball Road, when the
Chevy S10 pickup collided with a late-model Ford Explorer, Martinez
said.</LD>
<TE>   "Both vehicles were going southbound on Knott approaching Savanna
when somehow they collided and the Chevy rolled over," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   The names of those involved were not immediately available and the

<HD>Jean-Pierre Perreault, 55; Choreographer Known for 'Joe'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Pierre Perreault, 55, an award-winning Canadian choreographer
who once described his approach to creating dances as that of "a
drowning man who fights for survival," died Tuesday of cancer at
Notre Dame Hospital in Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Perreault is best-known for his 65-minute, unaccompanied 1983
modern dance spectacle "Joe," which reached Los Angeles in 1996.
Jennifer Fisher described it that year in The Times as involving "32
dancers of all sizes, dressed in ditch-colored overcoats, fedora hats
and black army boots, marching, massing, and crashing stylishly and
relentlessly."</LD>
<LD>   Perreault was born in Montreal in 1947, and started dance training
at 16. In 1967, he joined La Groupe de la Place Royale, one of the
city's first permanent contemporary dance companies. By 1971, he had
become the company's co-artistic director.</LD>
<TE>   In 1976, the company moved to Ottawa, and Perreault stopped
dancing.</TE>
<TE>   He formed his own company in 1984 and also freelanced for Sweden's
Cullberg Ballet and National Ballet of Canada.</TE>
<TE>   He also earned a reputation as a powerful painter and graphic
artist.</TE>
<TE>   James Kudelka, artistic director of National Ballet of Canada,
called Perreault "a cultural icon" and said his death "represents a
huge loss for the Canadian dance community."</TE>

<LD>John L. McLucas, 82, former secretary of the Air Force and head of
the Federal Aviation Administration during the 1970s, died Sunday in
Alexandria, Va., after a prolonged battle with heart problems.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed undersecretary of the Air Force in 1969, McLucas served
under Presidents Nixon and Ford as Air Force secretary from 1973 to
1975, and then as FAA administrator until 1977. He previously worked
at the Defense Department and was assistant secretary general for
scientific affairs at NATO headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   McLucas, a native of Fayetteville, N.C., graduated from Davidson
College in 1941. He received a master's degree in physics from Tulane
University in 1943, then was a Navy officer during World War II. He
earned his doctorate in physics from Penn State in 1950.</LD>
<TE>   Most recently, McLucas was board chairman of the Arthur C. Clarke
Foundation, which develops communications projects and awards grants
to scholars in space-related sciences.</TE>

<HD>Fee Hikes, Planning Staff Cuts Need Explanation, O.C.
Supervisors Insist</HD>
<DH>Before increases are approved, officials want to know where
the money has gone. The higher permit charge is already in question.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors on Friday demanded explanations for the
Planning Department's abrupt decision to lay off 20% of its staff and
seek sharp hikes in permit fees, saying they were caught off guard by
the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Planning Director Thomas B. Mathews said the emergency steps are
needed to stem a growing deficit that he blamed on an unanticipated
drop in building activity.</LD>
<LD>   But a key element of his recovery plan, raising building permit
fees by 58%, was already in trouble Friday.</LD>
<TE>   A special master appointed by a Superior Court judge to review the
county's handling of building fees warned that the court may want a
say in whether fees can be boosted. Robert P. Mosier of Costa Mesa
said in a memo that he would ask a judge Monday for direction unless
the board postpones a vote on the fee increase request.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they were unaware of the special master's memo
and expected to discuss it with Mathews and county Executive Officer
Michael Schumacher. They also were dismayed by the $2.5-million
deficit in a department they said should have kept better track of
building activity and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The fee increase request is the second time in four months that
the Planning Department has asked supervisors for help. In August,
the board approved up to $8 million in emergency loans from the
general fund after planning officials said their reserve fund was
empty. The department's budget chief and assistant in charge of
tracking the fund were put on administrative leave while an audit was
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith said Friday that he wants answers from
Mathews.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I see some answers from his shop, I don't have any
confidence in what's going on," Smith said. "There are two people
still out on administrative leave, and [department officials] haven't
given us any report. They have to give us some answers before I
approve anything."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said the board should consider postponing
the fee increase until the judge deems it proper. The county needs to
confront the drop in permit revenue and the fact that "planning got
caught flat-footed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Mathews] came to us [in August] and said he needed $8
million, [the department was] confident it was temporary and that it
would be paid back. It's not coming together the way they said. I
need a real thorough financial analysis for me to say yes again,"
Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning officials have blamed the deficit on a plunge in building
permits in the past year. During boom years, the department oversaw
the transformation of miles of lima bean fields and orange groves
into master-planned communities. But development has slowed, with
more raw land now incorporated into cities.</TE>
<TE>   "There had never been that kind of a drop in five years," county
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. The planning department's status is
"an economy-driven situation about which thoughtful business
decisions are being made and the necessary steps are being taken."</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 lawsuit challenging how the county was charging for permits
added to the budget woes.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the suit was filed, a county audit determined that
builders might have been overcharged as much as $10 million in fees.
Supervisors voted then to reduce fees by nearly 30% and, in the
process, to draw down a reserve fund that had grown as high as $18
million. The court hearing the lawsuit appointed the special master
to monitor the fee issue.</TE>
<TE>   The reserve fund had been drawn down to about $7 million by June
30, 2001. A year later, the fund should have contained about $2.5
million. A fiscal year-end audit discovered, however, that there was
nothing left, prompting Mathews to ask supervisors for help.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors said they want to know what happened to the $18
million and why the department wasn't streamlined, particularly with
the threat that a court could order further cuts in fees if the
county loses the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not voting on any fee increases until I know why the $18
million went into a deficit and how much it really costs to process
these permits," Smith said. "We can't charge more than the cost of
the service. If we do, that's a hidden tax."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, who will replace Coad next month,
said he also wants to know what happened to the money. "If there was
a question of overcharging for permits and the fees were reduced, we
just can't start overcharging again," he said.</TE>

<HD>Port of Hueneme Begins Cargo Project</HD>
<DH>The $7.1-million expansion will allow the facility to
handle more goods. Officials say it will increase profits and may add
jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marking its second expansion in two weeks, the Port of Hueneme is set
to begin renovating an 11 1/2-acre parcel adjacent to its south
terminal.</LD>
<LD>   The land will become a short-term storage area for imported
automobiles and other "roll on-roll off" cargo, such as tractors,
heavy machinery and other items with wheels or mounted on trailers.
The project, including $3.9 million paid for the property in
September 2000, will cost $7.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Port of Hueneme specializes in non-containerized cargo --
items such as automobiles, fresh fruit and produce -- and cars
represent 22% of its imports. Michael A. Plisky, president of the
Board of Harbor Commissioners, said the added space will mean more
revenue as the port creates additional cargo-handling capacity.</LD>
<TE>   "We're already short of parking space," Plisky said. "This gives
us the ability to bring on additional business. We can bring in more
ships and more cars per ship."</TE>
<TE>   Along with increased profits, the expansion at the eastern edge of
the port will generate extra jobs at the only deep-water port between
Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be employing more longshoremen along the way, and they'll
be working more hours," said Plisky, adding that more efficient auto
handling allows the port to attract other customers that could use
some space that is now used to accommodate imported cars.</TE>
<TE>   The project's groundbreaking ceremony Friday comes during one of
the busiest months for vehicle arrivals. In the next two weeks, more
than 9,000 automobiles are due to be unloaded in the Port of Hueneme;
in December 2001, nearly 23,000 vehicles arrived at the facility.</TE>
<TE>   When the expanded terminal opens next summer, every auto importer
at the port will have access. Pacific Vehicle Processors -- which
handles Jaguars, Land Rovers, Mitsubishis, Suzukis and Volvos -- is
expected to be the primary user.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a land swap that consolidated the deal, the city of
Port Hueneme picked up an easement along a nearby sea wall, which
will allow a public trail leading to the Hueneme Lighthouse to be
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the harbor district signed a 30-year deal with the
U.S. Navy for joint use of a 1,000-foot-long Navy wharf next to the
port's north terminal and 25 acres of adjacent land.</TE>
<TE>   That deal adds a sixth berth to the port and also has the
potential of increasing district operating revenue by nearly 30%.</TE>

<LD>A settlement was reached Friday in U.S. District Court in Fresno that
will allow the U.S. government to purchase 33,000 acres of
salt-poisoned farmland from growers in the Westlands Water District.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement settled a 15-year-old lawsuit against the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation for failing to complete a drainage system in
the district. That led to the buildup of salt and other minerals in
some fields, according to allegations in the lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement also paves the way for a larger 200,000-acre
retirement plan in the works between the U.S. and Westlands.</LD>

<HD>Violent Crime Rising in State, Lockyer Says</HD>
<DH>Attorney general cites big city gang violence for 16%
increase in homicides in first half of the year. Property crimes up
nearly 10%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising gang violence, heavy drug use, and growing economic and social
frustrations in California's largest cities are part of the reason
for an upswing in violent crime throughout the state, officials said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, announcing the increases Thursday,
reported that homicides increased 16% throughout the state during the
first six months of 2002, compared with the same period the previous
year.</LD>
<LD>   While crime actually dropped in many areas of the state, violent
crime increases were heaviest in some of the state's largest cities
coping with a higher incidence of gang violence.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department reported 81 more homicides
during the first half of this year compared with the same period last
year. The total in Fresno doubled, from 14 to 28, in the same period.
Homicides in Oakland jumped from 36 to 49. And Long Beach reported 31
compared with 21 during the first six months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   While Lockyer and other law enforcement officials stressed that it
can be dangerous to read too much into statistical shifts from year
to year, the attorney general made it clear that big city gang
problems are among the chief contributing factors to the overall rise
in killings.</TE>
<TE>   "Local law enforcement agencies and city officials are working
hard to find ways to battle violence in their streets," Lockyer said.
"While curbing crime always is a daunting task, it is made especially
difficult when gang activity is up and the economy is down."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 16% increase in homicides in areas that report
crime statistics to the state, there was a 3.3% overall increase in
violent crimes and a nearly 10% jump in property crimes. San
Francisco, San Jose, Stockton and Fremont did not report figures on
time and were not included in the state compilation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, there were dramatic contrasts from county
to county. Orange County reported violent crimes down 21% and
property crimes down by 31%, but the Riverside County Sheriff's
Department said violent crimes increased 15.7% and property crimes
were up 10%.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, areas covered by the Sheriff's Department
saw an increase of 4.9% in violent crimes and 8.9% in property
crimes. The LAPD reported a 5.4% increase in violent crimes and a
5.7% climb in property crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Violent crime was down in San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties, but up in San Bernardino County. Property crime increased
in all four of them.</TE>
<TE>   Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office,
called the statistics "a snapshot" that helps officials understand
crime trends.</TE>
<TE>   "These are only preliminary figures, but it does help us gauge
what's going on there," she said. "Gang violence is definitely part
of this, especially in certain areas. Much of the crime can be traced
back to gang activity."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said Lockyer believes that the statistics reinforce the
need for preventive community programs "helping families to be safe
and strong."</TE>
<TE>   But the reasons for crime increases or decreases defy any simple
answers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Local police officials generally agreed with Lockyer that the
rising crime figures suggest that law enforcement budgets must be
protected despite government budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   But others saw rising crime as a sign of deep social problems
beyond law enforcement's control.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Silbert, president of the Delancy Street Foundation in San
Francisco, one of the country's leading programs for drug addicts and
ex-convicts, said she has seen an increasingly violent and angry
population even in her own program in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "The underclass is getting more and more trapped and angry, and
revenge is permeating the social mentality," she said. "It's
horrifying. Gangs are getting stronger and stronger, and revenge and
hatred are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Some look at the world situation and say, 'Everybody is taking
revenge; why shouldn't I?' It's absolutely worse than I have ever
seen it in over 30-something years in this field.</TE>
<TE>   "Duh! Yeah, murder is up. There is no one I know who is not going
absolutely nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Van Winkle, a spokesman for the state Department of Justice,
said the six-month preliminary figures have proven to be a good
indicator of yearly crime trends in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "After steady decreases throughout the '90s, it started up again
in 2000," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all talk about the growing gang problem, but I'm not sure
anybody has the ability to really pinpoint the causes. The big cities
clearly lead the trend. If you eliminate them, homicides would be
just about even in the rest of the state."</TE>
<TE>   The overall crime increase for those areas that reported, about
two-thirds of the state, was 7.5%, Lockyer said.</TE>

<HD>Bella Stumbo, 59; Times Writer Known for Incisive Profiles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bella Stumbo, a gifted writer whose dogged reporting, grace with
words and ability to make the most obstinate subjects reveal
themselves led to some of the most memorable profiles and features
published in The Times, has died. She was 59.</LD>
<LD>   An inveterate smoker, Stumbo died Thursday at her Highland Park
home after battling throat cancer for more than two years, said her
friend and attorney Bernard Kamine.</LD>
<LD>   Her pieces appeared in The Times for 22 years, beginning in 1971.
A master of the personality profile, she wrote about many of the most
colorful and controversial figures in public life, from former
Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry to Playboy magazine founder Hugh
Hefner.</LD>
<TE>   She was extraordinarily adept at capturing aspects of her subjects
that they rarely showed in public and almost certainly never intended
to share with a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time she quoted industrialist Justin Dart calling
former President Gerald Ford "a nice man, but not very smart." Or the
time B.T. Collins, chief of staff for Gov. Jerry Brown in the early
1980s, let loose with his opinions about his boss, from Brown's
hair-grooming habits ("disgusting") to his intellectual
preoccupations ("out in Uranus half the time ... ").</TE>
<TE>   "Each [story] caused a squall," Newsweek's Jonathan Alter wrote in
1990, "but none of the subjects, however embarrassed, complained
publicly."</TE>
<TE>   None, at least, until she wrote about Washington's Mayor Barry in
1990. Over the course of 18 hours with Stumbo, the flamboyant and
controversial politician was quoted as saying that Jesse Jackson
would be "the laughingstock of America" if he ran against him for
mayor and that "Jesse don't wanna run nothin' but his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Barry later denied making the comments and accused Stumbo of
"Barry-bashing" and racism. But Stumbo's editors stood behind her
during the headline-making storm that ensued. Collins acknowledged
that Stumbo's piece about him was damaging; he offered his
resignation, but Brown declined it. Unlike Barry, however, Collins
did not dispute Stumbo's savagely accurate portrayal of him, and he
confessed he had only himself to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "She totally destroyed me," he told the Washington Post a few
years before he died in 1993. "But it was nobody's fault but my
own.... She's an incredibly charming person. People like me and
Marion Barry, with egos the size of a room, she knows how to play
that. And that's your own fault, if you're a grown man."</TE>
<TE>   After a while, those in the journalism trade had a word for what
it meant to be profiled by the tall, pretty woman: You were Stumboed.</TE>
<TE>   Around The Times, her habits were legendary. She gently coaxed
reluctant subjects into an interview, often after submitting a
previous story for examination, or after a mutual friend vouched for
her character. Then she trailed her subjects for as long as they
tolerated her -- sometimes months on end. "There was a very fine
line," Tim Rutten, one of her last editors, said somewhat teasingly,
"between her reporting technique and stalking."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to write, she would hole up at her house, not to
emerge for days, during which she did not eat or sleep but
chain-smoked a storm. When she was done, "she would look haggard,
like someone who had spent six nights on a Greyhound bus," said
another former colleague, Robert A. Jones. "There was nothing pretty
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the story came out, and it was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   She offered exquisite, often damning detail, which came in part
from spending so much time with a person that he would forget she was
a reporter. The revelations also came, as Collins suggested, because
she was beguilingly unassuming, affecting a somewhat helpless air
that belied her toughness and education.</TE>
<TE>   Born into a blue-collar family in Pikeville, Ky., she grew up in
Colorado and went to Denver University. She earned two master's
degrees, one in journalism from Northwestern University and the other
in government from UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Before landing at The Times, she worked at UPI, Bangkok World, The
Los Angeles Evening Citizen News and KABC-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her years away from her roots, her voice always carried a
hint of Kentucky hill country drawl, which was part of her allure.
Interview subjects "would just bend over backwards to help this poor
girl from the 'hollers' of Kentucky," a former colleague said.</TE>
<TE>   This may explain how, for instance, she captured Barry browsing
through women's lingerie in a boutique near the White House. Or his
speaking in earthy terms about everyone from Jackson to his former
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Or how she got the bit that put kingmaker Dart in boiling water
with fellow Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   She accompanied Dart on a flight from Palm Desert, where he had
just spent New Year's with Ronald and Nancy Reagan, to New York. When
they were boarding, he noticed that former President Ford was also a
passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Dart turned toward his personal aide and grimaced.</TE>
<TE>   Then, his expression benevolent, Dart made his way toward Ford. A
frail, white-haired old man, he moved slowly, limping, clinging to
the aisle seats for support. Several narrow-eyed Secret Service
agents scrutinized his every move. Reaching Ford, Dart playfully
poked him in the shoulder from behind. Startled, Ford whirled around,
then immediately broke into a broad smile.</TE>
<TE>   The two men exchanged warm greetings and chatted briefly, mainly
about football and golf.</TE>
<TE>   Dart returned to his seat. "Jerry's a nice man, but he's not very
smart," he remarked.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to understate his case, refine his language or temper
his judgments, Dart amended himself. "Actually our seatmate is a dumb
bastard," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Justin naturally caught hell from everybody," recalled Bill
Thomas, then the editor of The Times. "He said, 'She got the quote
right; I said it. I never should have, but I did.'</TE>
<TE>   "She got inside the skin of everybody she wrote about."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone she wrote about was rich and famous.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her most powerful pieces concerned Yvonne and Yvette
Jones, Siamese twins who were born at County-USC Medical Center in
1949. Treating them as people who just happened to be joined at the
head, she described their attempts to lose weight, how they liked to
comb their hair, their fondness for cigarettes, caffeine and soft
drinks, their dreams of romance. She unflinchingly tackled some of
the most delicate practical challenges their bodies posed.</TE>
<TE>   Only once, the twins say, have they had any serious problems
navigating themselves. They got stuck in a toilet on an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that stewardess would never get her wits together
enough to let me out," said Yvette, smiling at the ignominious
memory. The twins have tried to avoid small toilets ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "Where was I going on that trip, anyway?" Yvonne asked her sister.
"I can't remember," said Yvette, frowning. Both twins have poor
memories and they are continually consulting each other ...</TE>
<TE>   Many of her subjects maintained a relationship with her long after
the pieces about them were published. This did not always please her.
"She would so totally immerse herself in her subjects and their life
that very often she just couldn't shut it off," recalled Noel
Greenwood, who was her editor when she wrote for the old Metro
section, and was briefly married to her.</TE>
<TE>   She had many personal demons, which drove her to experiment with
drugs and alcohol from the time she was a teenager. When she died,
she was writing a memoir that Greenwood described as a black-humored
but serious examination of her "quest for a chemical that would make
her happy."</TE>
<TE>   She left The Times in 1993 when it offered buyouts to a number of
staff members in an attempt to cut costs. She published a book about
the Betty Broderick murder case that sold very well, and freelanced
for publications such as Esquire and Vanity Fair.</TE>
<TE>   She stopped working on the memoir when she was diagnosed with
cancer. Radiation therapy quelled it for a while, but when it
returned recently, she decided not to seek other treatments, which
could have caused her to lose her voice.</TE>
<TE>   In her last months, she proselytized against smoking before high
school students and support groups for people who were trying to give
up cigarettes. She took with her the cage that went over her head and
kept her from moving during the weeks of grueling radiation
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who had defiantly lighted up in the newsroom long after
the paper banned smoking finally gave up smoking. She gave up
drinking, too, complaining to friends that she had no vices left.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a sister, Linda, of Denver.</TE>

<HD>John D. Weaver, 90; Author Righted a Racial Injustice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John D. Weaver, who wrote extensively about the history of Los
Angeles and was a prominent figure on the Los Angeles literary scene
for nearly half a century, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver, who had Alzheimer's disease, died Wednesday at an
assisted-care home in Las Vegas, where he had lived in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   During his 65-year writing career, the onetime Kansas City Star
reporter served stints as West Coast editor of Holiday, and Travel
and Leisure magazines and wrote hundreds of short stories, articles
and book reviews for Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Saturday Evening
Post, New West and other magazines.</LD>
<TE>   He also wrote two novels and eight nonfiction books, including one
that helped change history: "The Brownsville Raid," a 1970 book that
led to the exoneration of 167 black soldiers who had been discharged
without honor 64 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Los Angeles from the 1940s to the early 1990s,
Weaver wrote the entry on Los Angeles for the 1974 edition of the
Encyclopedia Britannica, as well as the books "Los Angeles: El Pueblo
Grande" (1973) and "Los Angeles: The Enormous Village" (1980) -- an
expansive look at the growth of the city during its different eras.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the first person to really give a true historical
sensibility to everyday Los Angelenos," said Digby Diehl, book editor
of the Los Angeles Times from 1969 to 1978 and a friend of Weaver.
"Until his book came out, there was really nothing that made the
history of Los Angeles comprehensible to the guy on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "John clearly loved the city and imbued that particular book with
his love, but he did so many things as a citizen and as a writer. He
was a passionate partisan for the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, Diehl said, "was probably the most important advocate of
his era of the Los Angeles Public Library."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Diehl recalled, there was a battle over how downtown
Los Angeles should be redeveloped.</TE>
<TE>   One of the arguments, Diehl said, was that the Cental Library
should be torn down and a new library incorporated into a skyscraper
to be built on the library site.</TE>
<TE>   "John was very strongly in defense of maintaining the library and
its beautiful architecture," said Diehl. "I'd say present-day
experience proves him right. It's the cornerstone of one of the most
lovely areas downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Carolyn See, another longtime friend, remembers another
side of Weaver, "a man of perfect kindness and gentility."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a natural teacher," See said. "Back in the days before MFA
[writing] programs, he was like a walking MFA program. He would spend
incredible amounts of time with young writers, explaining what it is
they had to do in order to not just get published but to keep their
self-respect."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, who once served as president of the Friends of the UCLA
Library, donated more than 400 boxes of his research notes, working
manuscripts and other papers to the university library's Department
of Special Collections, as well as a collection of Los Angeles
ephemera.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Washington, Weaver received a bachelor's degree
from the College of William and Mary and a master's from George
Washington University.</TE>
<TE>   After college in 1933, he worked for the National Recovery
Administration and other federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, he was hired by the Kansas City Star, where he worked the
next five years and met his future wife, Harriett, a Star
correspondent, who died at the age of 75 in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   After Weaver served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II,
the couple moved to Los Angeles to freelance, settling into a
hillside home above the Sunset Strip in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, after turning to nonfiction, Weaver began
digging into a story he had heard from his parents as a child.</TE>
<TE>   During the early years of his parents' marriage, they had made a
trip to the Mexican border town of Brownsville, Texas, where Weaver's
father served as the official reporter for a 1910 government court of
inquiry into the Brownsville raid four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 13, 1906, shots were heard near Ft. Brown, which housed
three companies of the 1st Battalion, 25th Infantry, an all-black
unit.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers, according to facts uncovered during Weaver's lengthy
search of official records, assumed they were being attacked by a
local mob inflamed by rumors of the attempted rape of a white woman
who had identified her assailant as a black man in an Army uniform.</TE>
<TE>   The townspeople thought the black soldiers were attacking the town
because some of the soldiers had been assaulted by white men.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 10-minute shooting rampage by 10 to 20 armed
men, one of the townspeople was dead and a police officer was
wounded. An armed white mob began shouting for vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Although blame fell on the black soldiers, the only evidence was
spent cartridges found in the street that were said to have come from
Army rifles.</TE>
<TE>   The 1910 inquiry confirmed the black soldiers' guilt.</TE>
<TE>   But, Weaver told The Times in 1972, "all the evidence showed the
[black] soldiers couldn't possibly have done it. I'm positive the
cartridges were planted there."</TE>
<TE>   The black soldiers denied knowledge of the shooting, which the
military regarded as simply refusing to inform on one another.</TE>
<TE>   President Theodore Roosevelt ordered all 167 discharged without
honor because of their conspiracy of silence.</TE>
<TE>   After Weaver reopened the case with his book, Rep. Augustus F.
Hawkins (D-Calif.) introduced legislation calling for the exoneration
of the soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the Army, calling the soldiers' discharge the only
documented case of mass punishment in history, exonerated all 167 of
them. Secretary of the Army Robert F. Froehlke ordered the discharges
changed to honorable, declaring that the mass discharge without honor
in 1906 was a gross injustice.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, only one of the 167 black soldiers surfaced -- Dorsie
Willis, who had been shining shoes in the same Minneapolis barbershop
for 59 years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his honorable discharge, Willis was given a
tax-free government check for $25,000. Each of a dozen surviving
widows also received $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   " 'The Brownsville Raid' was always the one book he was most proud
of," Weaver's second wife, Chica, told The Times this week.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 13 years, Weaver is survived by a
brother, William, of New York City; and two sisters, Jane Poulton of
Durham, N.C., and Ann Naylor of Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   No services will be held.</TE>

<HD>Preliminary Hearing for Blake Postponed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County judge delayed a preliminary hearing for Robert
Blake until Feb. 26, giving the actor's new attorneys more time to
prepare to defend their client against charges that he killed his
wife.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash rejected criminal defense
attorney Jennifer L. Keller's plea to begin the hearing a month
later.</LD>
<LD>   "I am concerned about Mr. Blake sitting in jail," the judge said.
"In good conscience, I cannot allow that."</LD>
<TE>   Keller and Thomas A. Mesereau Jr. were retained by Blake last week
to replace Harland W. Braun, who had represented the actor since his
wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was shot to death May 4, 2001, in Studio
City.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 69, has been held without bail since his April 19 arrest.
He pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy, and denied an allegation that he ambushed Bakley, who was
44. He faces life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Nash had said he would consider setting bail for Blake after
hearing the evidence at the preliminary hearing, until recently set
for Wednesday in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Blake's entertainment attorney, Barry Felsen, said
his client is doing as well as can be expected. "You can see that he
is deteriorating," Felsen said. "Jail is not a health spa.... He
can't lift weights or jog.... He is thinning out."</TE>
<TE>   Nash also ordered Blake to be transported to County-USC Medical
Center for unspecified dental treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in a Burbank courtroom, Superior Court Judge David M.
Schacter ordered Blake to appear for a deposition in the wrongful
death suit filed against him by Bakley's four children.</TE>
<TE>   Schacter said Blake must appear, even if he plans to evoke his 5th
Amendment right against self-incrimination and not answer any
questions.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ordered the parties to set firm dates to depose
Blake and Bakley's two adult children, Paul and Holly Gawron of
Memphis, Tenn., and return to court Friday for his approval.</TE>

<LD>The condition of a Los Angeles Police Department officer injured in a
fiery crash in Van Nuys has improved, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Creighton Dawson, 28, was driving his motorcycle Thursday on
Balboa Boulevard when a van made a left turn in front of him. The
crash broke a fuel line on Dawson's motorcycle and ignited the
gasoline, causing serious burns.</LD>
<LD>   Dawson had second- and third-degree burns on about 30% of his
body. He underwent surgery Friday and is in stable condition, a
hospital spokesman said.</LD>

<LD>A woman was sentenced to 12 years in state prison Friday and her
stepfather was given five years' probation for operating an elaborate
pyramid scheme that stole more than $2.5 million from working-class
Latino families throughout Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Joan Frederick, 30, and Felix Navarrete, 70, were found guilty in
October of grand theft and operating an "endless chain scheme" for
nearly two years through a telecommunications company called La Luz
de Oro (or, Light of Gold).</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police say as many as 16,000 people may have paid for
memberships with the Panorama City-based company, lured by the

<HD>Leniency Urged on Business Tax Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After fielding thousands of frantic and angry calls over the last two
weeks, city lawmakers are considering granting a reprieve to people
who received a letter from the Los Angeles Department of Finance
demanding back business taxes and fees.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel sent a letter to department Director
Antoinette Christovale requesting that City Hall accountants forgive
hefty late fees against business owners, freelancers and independent
contractors who didn't know they owed the city money.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel is also asking that the city give letter recipients more
time to file paperwork seeking to prove that they are exempt from
city taxes.</LD>
<TE>   That would be welcome news to Elizabeth Ginsburg, a retired
teacher who works as a researcher for an author to supplement her
fixed income. She said she showed up at City Hall at 8 a.m. the day
after she received her notice to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I collided with umpteen others waiting for their opportunity to
complain," she said, adding that only two clerks were on duty to
handle the rush.</TE>
<TE>   Ginsburg said she was told that she owed the city $381 plus a late
fee for the last three years, for a grand total of $500. She filed a
request to have the late fee waived and paid the balance of the bill
with a credit card.</TE>
<TE>   "As I left the office, I was joined by an elderly couple who take
clippings from plants, pot them and sell them occasionally at street
fairs," Ginsburg said. "They were pathetically fearful and frightened
of what could happen. What kind of society are we turning into?"</TE>
<TE>   Ginsburg said she went home and wrote a letter to Mayor James K.
Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, she received a response that read, in part,
"Your correspondence is greatly appreciated and will be forwarded to
the appropriate staff member and considered in all related matters."</TE>
<TE>   The whole thing is an "outrageous debacle," Ginsburg said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Hahn said Friday that the letters were sent out
with the mayor's blessing because Hahn believes it is important for
the city to crack down on businesses that don't pay their taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need business-tax enforcement to make sure that law-abiding
businesses do not carry the burden for scofflaws," said Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   He added that people doing business in the city were given plenty
of notice over the last few years that Los Angeles was planning to
crack down on people who do not pay their civic taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Under city codes, any individual, business or corporation earning
at least $5,000 annually as an independent contractor is required to
obtain a city business license and pay taxes on revenue. The tax
liability ranges from $1 to $5 per $1,000 earned. Those who don't pay
their bills are required to pay late fees of up to 40% of taxes owed.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the city had no ability to identify small businesses
operating in Los Angeles. But a new state law that took effect in
January changed that. Now California cities can request access to
information that residents include on their state tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if a person files a state tax return claiming more
than $5,000 in income as an independent contractor -- even if it's
for baby-sitting, freelance writing or piano lessons -- the city can
demand its share. Recently, Los Angeles officials went to the state
Franchise Tax Board, requesting information on anyone who filed a
1099 form for "independent contract" work in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The state complied, handing over names, addresses and types of
business -- but no income information. Unsure of whether the people
on the list earned $5,000 or $500,000, city bookkeepers sent out
151,000 letters warning recipients that they "may owe business taxes
for conducting business within the city."</TE>
<TE>   "No person shall engage in any business or occupation subject to
tax without obtaining a registration certificate and paying the
applicable tax due," Christovale wrote in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   She went on: "Failure to respond to this notice may result in
further enforcement action, which may include the filing of a
criminal or civil complaint by the city attorney's office."</TE>
<TE>   Christovale listed a phone number for residents to call if they
had questions. The phone lines quickly became jammed. More than
12,000 calls were logged from people who were lucky enough to get
through. For days, people lined up outside the Finance Department's
office seeking answers.</TE>
<TE>   One man who received a letter said he was recently laid off from a
staff position as a video editor and brought back on a part-time
freelance basis, working four days a week with no benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the city wants to take its turn," he said. "It's really a
cheap shot."</TE>
<TE>   Another man complained that a letter was sent to his deceased
father.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gaines, chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.,
said his organization has received so many complaints from its
members that the group launched an "ax the tax" campaign, with a Web
site where people can share their concerns. Greuel is scheduled to
bring her proposal to the City Council next week.</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman said she also plans to summon Christovale and her
staff to the council chambers to discuss the letter, which warned
residents to pay up or face charges.</TE>
<TE>   Christovale, who was out of the office Friday, could not be
reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>EIDC Lawyers Quit; Cluff's Ouster Likely</HD>
<DH>The film agency has begun searching for a replacement for
its president, who is on leave during a probe of alleged misuse of
funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Entertainment Industry Development Corp. on Friday ended its
strained relationship with its lawyers and has launched a search for
a temporary replacement for embattled president Cody Cluff.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, Cluff's permanent departure seemed imminent Friday,
pending the outcome of negotiations on a severance package and
whether the EIDC would help foot his legal bills, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   When reached for comment, Cluff said that he and the organization
"have the same objectives in mind, which is for the EIDC to move
forward, and I think we are not too far away from an agreement that
will allow that to happen. I think the EIDC needs to find a way to
move forward and so do I."</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the EIDC's executive committee unanimously accepted the
resignations of Los Angeles attorneys George Newhouse and Tom Brown,
leaving Cluff, who was put on paid leave two weeks ago, without
representation during negotiations over his status with the film
agency.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky described the attorneys'
resignations as a key step toward restoring stability to an
organization that has been in turmoil since the Los Angeles district
attorney's investigation into Cluff's alleged misuse of corporate
funds became public three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, EIDC consultant Keith Comrie said he is working
with industry representatives, such as the Motion Picture Assn. of
America, to find a temporary replacement for Cluff. He said the
replacement "would work three to six months at minimum."</TE>
<TE>   Comrie has been involved in negotiations with Cluff over his
status since Nov. 22, when EIDC lawyers said Cluff would defy the
executive committee decision to put him on administrative leave.
Later that day, Newhouse said Cluff would not report to work, but
would take a vacation instead of a leave of absence.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers' actions angered several executive committee members,
including City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel and Yaroslavsky. Greuel
noted that the committee has the power to fire its lawyers, and
Yaroslavsky threatened to urge the Board of Supervisors and the City
Council to cancel their EIDC contracts, which are the foundation of
the agency's existence, if Cluff defied the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The two contracts give the EIDC the power to coordinate issuance
of permits to companies filming movies, TV shows and commercials in
Los Angeles County and to promote the county to the entertainment
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she believes the committee is close to resolving the
turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Newhouse said they resigned because of differences of
opinion with the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse declined to spell out those differences. He angered some
executive committee members last month when he said Mayor James K.
Hahn, Yaroslavsky and Greuel had violated their responsibility as
EIDC board members when they publicly urged Cluff to take a paid
leave.</TE>
<TE>   Newhouse and Brown have also argued that the committee exceeded
its power by voting to put Cluff on leave. The attorneys said agency
bylaws stipulate that only the full board has the authority to remove
the president. After the vote, Brown said Cluff would defy the
committee and report to work.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members began to publicly question whether Newhouse and
Brown were adequately representing the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Comrie has been negotiating with Newhouse and Cluff on
Cluff's status.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie said he is working directly with Cluff, and that
negotiations probably will be completed in time for the committee's
next meeting in about a week. He has declined to reveal details.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Outlines His Vision for Port</HD>
<DH>Mayor says he hopes to make the region cleaner, safer and
more financially successful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first "state of the harbor" address, Los Angeles Mayor James
K. Hahn on Friday touted a series of proposals designed to bridge the
historical divide between the Port of Los Angeles and surrounding
communities long burdened by its truck traffic, diesel emissions and
expansion projects.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference held at the water's edge outside the
Banning's Landing Community Center in Wilmington, Hahn said, "My
commitment is to make the port more user-friendly by moving all
industrial uses from the west channel to other locations in the port
complex, such as Terminal Island.</LD>
<LD>   "This will make room for a waterfront promenade that stretches
from the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the breakwater," Hahn said, drawing
applause from many of the 300 port officials, dockworkers and local
residents who turned out for a glimpse of his vision for the port.</LD>
<TE>   Even some of Hahn's toughest critics expressed cautious optimism
about his outline for making the region cleaner, safer and more
financially successful.</TE>
<TE>   Improvement projects include plans to decorate the Vincent Thomas
Bridge with blue lights, and to remove above-ground storage tanks
belonging to the Ultramar Inc.-Valero Wilmington Refinery near
downtown Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   The port also is in the process of implementing new, strict
environmental standards with a goal of no net increase in air
emissions. About 35% of the port's own fleet of vehicles and
equipment soon will be replaced with lower-emissions alternatives,
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the city is "working with international
vessels to voluntarily reduce speeds as they arrive and depart,
retrofitting all of our tugs to alternative fuels, providing electric
cranes and dredges, and using low-sulfur diesel fuels."</TE>
<TE>   While in Asia last month during his first major overseas mission,
Hahn forged plans for the alternative maritime power program, which
would provide container ships with electricity while docked in port,
and generate up to $30 million for the Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The reduction in pollutants released into the air could be
substantial, Hahn said, given that each ship burns more than 7 tons
of fuel each day while idling its engines for power. So far, he said,
four of Asia's major steamship lines have tentatively agreed to
participate in the program.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Hahn signed another such agreement with P&amp;O Nedlloyd of
New Jersey, one of the world's largest shipping companies.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Mardesich, former leader of the failed harbor secession
movement, said: "Mayor Hahn is on the right road. But we can't forget
that these are still just plans and promises. It's going to take at
least a year to see whether or not he follows through."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Marquez of the Wilmington Coalition for a Safe Environment
also perceived a better relationship between the port and his
community taking root. He pointed out, however, that "if they really
want to improve Wilmington, which has some of the highest rates of
homicide, gang violence and poverty in the city, they'll have to
include improvements for our downtown, not just the waterfront."</TE>

<HD>County Art Museum Defers New Building</HD>
<DH>Trustees cite the weak economic climate for problems with
fund-raising, but insist that the ambitious project is only on hold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison and Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, citing the gloomy
economy, voted this week to put on hold plans for a new building, a
massive structure on stilts designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas.
It was intended to replace virtually every building on the museum
campus.</LD>
<LD>   "It is not dead. It is on hold. That's a long way from dead," said
Walter Weisman, chairman of the board. "I think there's been a
growing recognition, not just on our board, that philanthropic
institutions have to take into consideration the changes in the
economic circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not going to put the museum in financial jeopardy," he
added.</LD>
<TE>   Trustees said Friday that the board voted this week to study
alternatives to the Koolhaas design, which was estimated would cost
$200 million to $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Camilla Chandler Frost noted that Koolhaas has been paid
to date.</TE>
<TE>   The expensive nuts-and-bolts design work has not yet been done for
the project, with its billowing tent-like roof, open-air plazas, and
horizontal layers of exhibition space and offices. The next step
would be creating schematic drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Several trustees stressed that the Koolhaas plan, hailed as a
potential monument and piece of the city's cultural legacy, is still
something they favor if money can be found.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be wonderful, because we believe in the Koolhaas
design," Weisman said. "But whether we go in that direction or we go
some other direction, that's what we're studying. All the options are
on the table, including Koolhaas."</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials have been warning for weeks that fund-raising for
the project has been stalled by the dark economic picture.</TE>
<TE>   Another blow came when voters failed to approve a $250-million
bond measure for improvements at county museums. That could have
given LACMA $98 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Annenberg Foundation recently gave the museum $10
million as a special endowment, that money will be used for buying
art and supporting educational programs and exhibitions, not for
building.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, Museum Director Andrea L. Rich cited the economy
and the difficulty of fund-raising as reasons the institution could
not move forward responsibly with its plans, said spokesman Jim
Rawitsch. Rich could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   George N. Boone, a senior trustee who attended the meeting, said
the project "may go forward in the future. But right now, they're
assessing how they're going to get the money."</TE>

<HD>Officer Is Shot in Koreatown</HD>
<DH>Police had trailed man carrying shotgun for blocks when he
turned and fired. Victim is expected to live.</DH>

<LD>A Los Angeles police officer was shot at close range and seriously
wounded Friday by a man brandishing a shotgun on a Koreatown street
crowded with lunchtime pedestrians.</LD>
<LD>   Officers had been trailing the suspect as he walked down city
streets holding the gun in his duffel bag, when he turned and fired,
police said. They tackled him to the ground a half-block before he
reached busy Western Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The wounded officer, Victor Alvarez, 29, a 6 1/2-year veteran of
the force, was struck in the shoulder, with the blast shredding a
portion of his bulletproof vest, police officials said. He was rushed
to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and was
listed in serious but stable condition by day's end.</LD>
<TE>   Before the shooting, the suspect, identified as David Roland
Young, 47, had walked nearly seven blocks carrying a Mossberg
12-gauge pump action shotgun in a black bag, police said, trailed by
more than a half-dozen officers ordering him to drop the weapon. When
he fired instead, none of those officers shot back.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Gary Brennan, who briefed reporters at the scene, called the
actions of the eight officers "extremely heroic."</TE>
<TE>   "The officers put themselves at risk rather than put pedestrians
at risk," Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief William J. Bratton was attending the funeral of Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David Powell, killed last week in the
line of duty, when word came that Alvarez had been shot. He flew by
helicopter from the funeral to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who was then briefed by investigators at the scene, said
there was every indication that the officers followed policy and took
extraordinary caution in protecting the lives of bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about aggressive cops," Bratton said. "I'm
concerned about an individual who is surrounded by eight police
officers who chooses to use his shotgun."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when homicides in the city are reaching numbers not seen
since the mid-1990s, Bratton said he was extremely troubled by the
spectacle of someone "walking around with a shotgun in hand."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a clear indication that there are too many guns in this
city and too many people willing to use them," said Bratton, who has
been on the job less than two months.</TE>
<TE>   Young has a history of problems with authority, according to law
enforcement officials and social service workers who had tried to
help him find a job. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal
threats, battery and making a bomb threat in October 2000, although
district attorney officials said those charges were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Young's confrontation with police began near the corner of
Wilshire Boulevard and Kingsley Drive after residents spotted his
shotgun and flagged down a squad car.</TE>
<TE>   Despite noontime temperatures in the 70s, Young was wearing an
overcoat and fatigues, his long hair matted in dreadlocks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, muttering words about Jesus and carrying the duffel bag
that later proved to contain the shotgun, Young had gone to a nearby
nonprofit job bank. But employees at the fifth-floor offices of
Community Career Development Inc. had been warned by building
security to be on the lookout for a man matching Young's description
because there had been petty thefts in the building during times he
had been there.</TE>
<TE>   Receptionist Teresita Loria said that when Young showed up about
11 a.m., he seemed agitated. During past visits, Loria said, he was
"never aggressive or mean, always smiling." Because of the request
from building security, he was told Friday that he couldn't use the
firm's equipment any more.</TE>
<TE>   Employees also called security, as they had been instructed to do,
to inform them that Young was in their offices. By the time building
guards and police officers on bicycles responded, Young was gone,
according to Alton Williams, the guard on duty at Paramount Plaza at
the time of Young's visit.</TE>
<TE>   His trail was picked up on the street below, with officers from
Wilshire and nearby Rampart divisions quickly responding. Not far
from the office building, Jarel Carillo, 10, heard the suspect tell
officers to "stand back," and then watched him walk away with the
officers a short distance behind.</TE>
<TE>   From inside his car at 8th Street and Oxford Avenue, David Choi
looked up to see the slow-speed foot pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspect was walking leisurely," Choi said. "He didn't look
like he was being chased by cops. It looked like he was carrying a
musical instrument in a black bag."</TE>
<TE>   As Choi tried to park his car to make deliveries for his print
shop, he heard a single shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why the cops did not jump on him from behind,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting stunned local residents and business owners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frightening that someone would shoot in broad daylight,"
said a woman on her way to a doctor's appointment, who declined to
give her name. Standing behind the yellow police line at 8th Street
and Western Avenue, she said, "Things are going from bad to worse.
How can we walk around here anymore?"</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, detectives searched a storage facility less
than a block away when it was discovered that Young, who has lived in
the Los Angeles area for about a decade, rented several small storage
lockers, police officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At Cedars-Sinai, Alvarez, whose parents rushed to be by his side,
underwent several hours of surgery. Police officials said he lost a
substantial amount of blood. Bratton said the bulletproof vest
Alvarez was wearing probably prevented an even more serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   As word got around that Alvarez would survive, many officers left
the hospital to get back to work.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear he's going to be fine," said Capt. Doug Shur, patrol
division commanding officer for Rampart, where Alvarez is assigned.
"Something like that is our worst nightmare."</TE>

<HD>Forest Plan Seeks to Expand Logging</HD>
<DH>Proposals affecting 800,000 acres in the Sierra sidestep
protections for wildlife habitats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Forest Service unveiled proposals this week that would allow
the extensive cutting of old-growth trees in the Giant Sequoia
National Monument east of Bakersfield and two other national forests
in Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The plans, affecting more than 800,000 acres of public land in the
Sierra Nevada, sidestep logging restrictions set recently to protect
wildlife habitat and watersheds in all national forests in the
mountain range.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the plans, Forest Service officials said they are
intended for the reduction of fire hazards and scientific study, but
environmental groups dismissed that claim as a barely disguised
rollback of forest protections instituted under the Clinton
administration.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the Forest Service is courting and going to get a
vigorous backlash from this kind of nonsense," said Nathaniel
Lawrence, director of the forestry project at the Natural Resources
Defense Council. "It's what the Forest Service has been doing for 80
years and why these forests are in such bad shape."</TE>
<TE>   In an environmental impact statement released Thursday for the
329,000-acre Giant Sequoia National Monument, Forest Service
officials are recommending the most permissive of six alternative
management plans studied. It would provide for commercial removal of
trees up to 30 inches in diameter, including some young giant
sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   The monument was created in 2000 to protect the oldest, largest
trees, and they would be spared under the current plan. However,
critics of past logging have argued that by removing surrounding
trees, the shallow-rooted ancient giants are more vulnerable to wind.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the Sierra Framework, adopted by the Forest Service
last December as the guide for forest management throughout the
Sierra Nevada, severely restricted cutting of trees up to 30 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the provision for commercial logging is inconsistent
with the purpose of the monument, created by President Clinton in a
proclamation withdrawing about one-fourth of Sequoia National Forest
from logging and mining.</TE>
<TE>   The monument contains 38 of California's 75 groves of the majestic
giant sequoia that live several thousand years.</TE>
<TE>   The proclamation said: "Removal of trees, except for personal-use
fuel wood, from within the monument area may take place only if
clearly needed for ecological restoration and maintenance or public
safety."</TE>
<TE>   Sequoia Forest Supervisor Art Gaffrey said in a telephone
conference call Friday that the proposal gives the Forest Service the
maximum latitude for managing the monument to remove the most
flammable trees and brush and restore forest health by thinning dense
stands.</TE>
<TE>   The largest forest fire in California this year burned across
150,000 acres of the Sequoia National Forest, including a small
portion of the monument. Firefighters were able to keep it out of the
groves of ancient trees.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing that could happen in the Sierra Nevada is to do
nothing," Gaffrey said in the conference call. "If you chose only one
method to try to manage this, you may not be doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   But the new proposal goes too far, said Jay Watson, California
director of the Wilderness Society. "We're not opposed to appropriate
hazardous-fuel reduction inside the monument," Watson said. "But by
the sound of things, what's being proposed is overly aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, the logging that would be conducted as
part of a study in the Lassen and Plumas forests has incensed some
members of the Quincy Library Group, a collection of local residents
whose plan for the management of the northern forests was enacted
into a law hailed by many Republicans as a model of forest
stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   The law called for pilot projects to clear out small areas to
prevent the spread of fires, said Linda Blum, a member of the group.
Blum said the study has hijacked the group's work, which never
contemplated the removal of large trees, which spotted owls need for
nesting.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody in the Forest Service has it in their head that finding
loopholes to cut big trees is what the forest industry and the public
still wants," Blum said.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service plan, announced Wednesday in the Federal
Register, would involve logging on 493,000 acres of Plumas and Lassen
national forests north of Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   The study would be broken into three sections with different
intensities of timber removal on each. It did not specify a volume,
but said that in the most intensive areas trees up to 34 inches could
be cut.</TE>
<TE>   Watson of the Wilderness Society said the proposed study was a
good idea that has gotten out of control.</TE>
<TE>   David Stone, forest ecosystem staff officer for Plumas National
Forest, disputed that assertion.</TE>
<TE>   He said the study was designed by scientists to test the effects
of different treatment methods.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent is if you don't depart, if you just go down the road
of the framework you're not going to learn anything," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to see what the owls will do?" said Blum of the Quincy
group. "I know what they are going to do. They are going to fly away
and not come back."</TE>

<LD>Substitute teacher Val Rodriguez of Signal Hill reports that he
recently worked at a middle school that "played the sounds of the
'William Tell Overture' in the halls between classes, encouraging the
pupils to avoid a tardy."</LD>
<LD>   The result? The theme from TV's "The Lone Ranger" inspired every
one of Rodriguez's kids to be on time the entire week.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if that composition would help the Harvey children rise
in the morning.</LD>

<TE>   From the Lone Ranger to the Naked Cowboy: A few years ago, a
reader reported a sighting of a guitar-holding hitchhiker, clad only
in undershorts, boots and a cowboy hat, on the Simi Valley Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   I would have been skeptical had I not also received a phone
message that began: "This is John Robert Burck, the Naked Cowboy...."</TE>
<TE>   I guess the sidewalk singer is still hoping for that big break. He
was snapped in Times Square the other day, showing he'll belt out a
tune under any conditions (see photo). You'd think he'd at least get
an endorsement from Fruit of the Loom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Will Anaheim be saying goodbye to Mickey? As if Disney didn't have
enough problems with the failure of "Treasure Planet" and all, a
village in Austria now says it is the true home of Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The creature recently was found on a medieval church fresco in
Malta (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   "The similarity to Mickey Mouse is so astounding that Disney could
lose its world copyright," tourism guru Siggi Neuschitzer was quoted
as saying in the London Telegraph. He added the town would consult
with lawyers, presumably to begin construction of Maltaland.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has always contended that the mouse was first sketched by
founder Walt in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th century version is kneeling at the feet of St.
Christopher, the patron saint of travelers. An art historian said the
large ears on the creature could be explained by a myth that it gave
birth from its ears.</TE>
<TE>   Which might also explain why Mickey has such a high-pitched voice.</TE>

<TE>   Just another hot time on the old campus: Cal Poly Pomona's

smoking bag of burnt popcorn."</TE>

stew recipe that begins, 'First you steal a chicken.... ' "</TE>

<HD>Widowed Swan Soldiers On in Troubled Water</HD>
<DH>Rupert, a black swan and a 20-year Newport Bay resident, is
at loose ends since his mate died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mira Tweti</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rupert swims slowly and gracefully with his head down along the
embankment. Above him loom the luxury waterfront homes of Carnation
Cove in Newport Bay.</LD>
<LD>   He may be looking for eelgrass to eat, or he may be searching for
his lost mate. After three years of inseparable companionship with
another Australian black swan named Pearl, Rupert is alone again.</LD>
<LD>   Rupert is a velvety-rich black except for the white crests on his
wings -- which look like two small, snowcapped Mt. Fujis -- and a
bright red beak. He has been swimming in Newport harbor for at least
20 years. No one knows how he got here.</LD>
<TE>   For most of that time, the entire bay was his domain, though he
often would hold court on the beach in front of Gay Wasson Kelly's
house -- announcing his arrival with three honks -- where he would
feed and preen, sun and sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few weeks his routine has changed. Now he sticks
to the small area of the bay that he and his mate scouted to make
their first nest, perhaps hoping she will swim up beside him once
more. And he arrives at Wasson Kelly's beach only to bed down after
dark, calling out just once to let her know he's there.</TE>
<TE>   Wasson Kelly, 63, is editor of the local newspaper, the Balboa
Beacon. She has been Rupert's friend and biographer since he first
walked up on her beach 10 years ago, tapped her granddaughter on the
shoulder and then posed for a photo with her.</TE>
<TE>   She has documented his rambunctious behavior, describing his
fixation on all things red and how he chased junior lifeguards in red
suits and people in red canoes. One pair of canoeists, terrified by
Rupert's wide-winged attack, capsized.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Wasson Kelly, who has red hair, has tried to draw Rupert
back by wearing a red sweater. But neither that nor the sight of her
familiar face brings him in.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor master, Marty Kasules, and members of the Orange County
Harbor Patrol say that protecting Rupert is part of their job. Over
the years they have untangled him from fishing line and rescued him
from a variety of human-caused trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But like Wasson Kelly, they are finding it harder to attract
Rupert. He has been ignoring their boat even though they try to
entice him with a pail of fresh drinking water. In the past, the swan
would come to their bucket right away (he preferred bottled water),
biting hands that fed him. His bite feels like a clothespin pinch.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, people who knew him well decided that Rupert
acted cranky because he was longing for a mate.</TE>
<TE>   Australian black swans are not easy to come by. They cost $10,000
to $12,000, when you can find one. Wasson Kelly started fund-raising
to buy Rupert a girlfriend, but Rupert kept getting into scrapes, and
the money was spent on veterinary bills.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he was snared by fishhooks. Another time, a pair of
teenagers poured marine fuel over his head for fun. He lay drowning
in it, and was almost dead when the Harbor Patrol scooped him up and
cleaned him with fresh water.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was bred in Corona and donated by a local resident three
years ago. She was as sweet as Rupert was grouchy. After she arrived
she was kept in a large cage on the beach to familiarize her with
saltwater living and acclimate her to rising tides. A sign on the
cage identified her as "Rupert's New Mate." But "It wasn't love at
first sight," Wasson Kelly said. "He chased her around."</TE>
<TE>   A few days after they released her, she swam out of the safety of
the bay to the ocean. After that, Rupert always made sure he knew
where she was. "He'd start out and realize she wasn't behind him,"
Wasson Kelly said. "Then she'd hurry up as if to say 'OK, I'm coming.
I was just getting my makeup on.' " After they bonded, the two swans
were inseparable. "They slept together on the beach and talked all
night long," said Wasson Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   They were a celebrity couple, making the rounds of elite
waterfront homes, stopping long enough for a quick drink, never
overstaying their welcome. Their likenesses adorned note cards,
paintings and other souvenirs made by local artists.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl died in October. "Someone let their dog run after the swans
for fun," said Debbie McGuire, director of the Wetlands and Wildlife
Care Center in Huntington Beach, where the injured Pearl was brought
for care. For the two weeks she was there, Rupert swam around the
harbor day and night endlessly calling for her.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that Rupert would never stop calling, the staff of the
center showed him her body. "At first he was happy to see her,"
McGuire said. "He spoke to her and nudged her." After four hours, he
finally left her side and ate some food. "We all cried," said
McGuire, "It was so sad."</TE>
<TE>   When people at the center tried to put Pearl's body in a plastic
bag, Rupert attacked them, so they had to take him away first.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert's neighbors worry that losing Pearl will be especially hard
on him because she's the only female he's ever known. But Wasson
Kelly is optimistic. Her weekly newspaper has a section reserved for
Rupert news.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, it reported that despite his general melancholy, Rupert
was back to pulling pranks. Kasules was on the deck of the patrol
boat trying to tie his shoes when Rupert swam over and yanked his
laces and then pulled his hair.</TE>
<TE>   There was talk of getting him another mate, but Pearl's necropsy
showed something alarming that put those plans on indefinite hold.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the dog that killed the swan. It was kidney damage and
liver failure caused by toxic marine fuel, McGuire said. The fuel
leaks into Newport Bay from spills, from harbor fueling stations and
from boats when boaters forget to turn off their fuel pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert has been through a number of spills, but no one knows how
it's affected him internally. He seems healthy, but that doesn't mean
anything, McGuire said. "Typically, birds mask their symptoms and
won't show signs of illness until they're very sick. Any sign of
weakness makes them a target for predators."</TE>
<TE>   Rupert's neighbors hope his adopted home won't prove fatal to him
as it did to Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic," said McGuire, "Swans mate for life, and these two
were so happy together."</TE>

<HD>Mourners Recall a Fallen Deputy</HD>
<DH>Slain lawman David Powell is remembered as playful, good-
natured and devoted to his patrol job. His service draws 3,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Hall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Images of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David Powell washed
over the 3,000 mourners at Calvary Chapel in Downey on Friday
morning:</LD>
<LD>   The good-natured man who married a woman with three teenage
daughters and a one-bathroom house....</LD>
<LD>   The playful deputy who watched a speeding driver spot his patrol
car, slam on the brakes and screech five feet past the crosswalk line
at a stoplight. Powell couldn't resist barking over the car's
loudspeaker: "Safe!" Powell still pulled him over....</LD>
<TE>   The worried son who insisted on accompanying his mother on her
predawn walks and pointed out the constellations in the sky....</TE>
<TE>   The risk-taker who saved an elderly man from killing himself by
wresting a knife out of his hands. It won him a Medal of Valor award.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave died believing he was going to save another person's life --
not knowing that his life would be given," Sheriff Lee Baca, his
voice pinched with pain, told the hushed crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, 42, was responding to a report of gunfire Saturday morning
when he and several other deputies went to the front door of an
Artesia home where it was believed that a man was holding a woman
hostage. After trying to kick in the door, Powell was shot in the
right shoulder by the man. The bullet traveled through an armhole in
his protective vest into his chest. The woman who authorities thought
was being held hostage had escaped earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, the second L.A. County sheriff's deputy killed in the line
of duty this year, was eulogized Friday by friends, family and
officials who recounted funny stories, then minutes later struggled
to keep talking through their tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not apologize for crying," Powell's twin brother, John,
told the mourners. "I loved David too deeply."</TE>
<TE>   Among the speakers was Gov. Gray Davis, who said that "Dave has
surrendered all of his tomorrows so we can enjoy our tomorrows."</TE>
<TE>   Also attending were Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton,
county Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Don Knabe, Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley and rows of Powell's friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   Powell met his wife, Emma, at the Lawndale Christian Church. He
sang in the choir. The couple, who lived in Torrance, would have
celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary next month. Besides
Powell's wife and his brother, other family members present included
their 7-year-old daughter, Brianna; Emma's adult children, Amanda,
Alicia and Monique; Powell's parents, William and Joanne; and
Amanda's husband, Shawn Alvira.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly the church was packed with uniformed men and women, not
just from the Sheriff's Department but from almost every law
enforcement agency in every county in Southern California, their
faces somber, their backs straight, their hands encased in white
dress gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a fallen brother," said Long Beach Police Park Ranger Mario
Camacho as he walked into the church.</TE>
<TE>   Powell was born in Torrance, and once dreamed of being a doctor.
While attending Loyola Marymount University, majoring in chemistry,
he volunteered at hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   But meeting police officers and firefighters through his hospital
work showed him that "his true passion and love was for law
enforcement," said Capt. Dave Fender, commander of the Lakewood
station, where Powell was assigned.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy spent his last 12 years there, working in a patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   Powell loved his radio car. Every morning, after the briefing in
the station, he would walk around the car, checking the tires,
recalled Lu Ann Ferraro -- who was his traffic citation secretary for
14 years -- after the service.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just, like, the biggest dork," she chuckled, adding
quickly that she meant that only with the greatest affection. "We'd
say, 'Dave, what the heck are you looking for?' He just laughed at
us."</TE>
<TE>   When she heard he had been shot, she assumed he would be fine. "He
was Mr. Safety," she said. "He always wore his vest." He even hung
his helmet over the passenger side of the car, giving the appearance
of another deputy, Ferraro said.</TE>
<TE>   During the service, Baca had told the mourners, "There is no more
difficult job in law enforcement than working in a radio car." To
recognize that diligence, the Sheriff's Department will award special
pins for deputies who work 10 years in a patrol car. "Dave Powell
will get the first pin, and it will be No. 1," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies and staff at the Lakewood station have made their own
special memorial to their fallen colleague. They have been signing
the door of his locker. There are so many tributes on the outside
that people will have to start writing on the inside, said Michael
Calderon, a jailer at the station.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon wrote his own goodbye: "Take care. Miss you, brother."</TE>

<HD>5 Russian Immigrants Jailed on Sex Charges</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say they ran a prostitution ring with up to 50
women and took in $8 million.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Five Russian immigrants were arrested Friday on charges of running a
prostitution ring that prosecutors say involved as many as 50 women
and earned up to $8 million over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The ringleaders allegedly operated a business called Russian
Fortuna. Posing as travel agents, they provided limousine service and
escorts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Daniels said.</LD>
<LD>   They employed Russian women throughout Los Angeles, West Hollywood
and Beverly Hills, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The business was advertised in the Yellow Pages of phone books, in
newspapers and on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested were Rimma Fetissova, 42, of Ukraine; Lev Levas, 55, and
his son, Mark Levas, 38, both naturalized citizens of the U.S. and
originally from Latvia; Elena Piyanzina, 24, of Magnitagorsk, Russia;
and Iryna Kovalenko, 37, of Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   Indictments charge those five, along with Elena Fetissova, 22, of
Ukraine, with conspiracy, pimping, pandering and money laundering.
Fetissova remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   At an arraignment in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, the
five pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were the results of a two-year investigation by the
Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The next court date was scheduled for Friday, with bail set for
the five in amounts ranging from $100,000 to $500,000.</TE>

<CX>   Prostitution ring -- An article in Saturday's California section
about the arrest of five Russian immigrants on charges of running a
prostitution ring incorrectly reported that they were providing
limousine and escort services. Although they were posing as travel
agents that provided limousine and escort services, they did not
actually offer those services, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia
Daniel.</CX>

<HD>Rose Bowl, Parade, Tourism Riding on UCLA Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews and Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this most Balkanized of metropolises, today offers that rarest of
opportunities: the chance for all of Greater Los Angeles to speak
with one voice.</LD>
<LD>   And that voice is saying: Go UCLA!</LD>
<LD>   Far more than a football game is at stake when the Washington
State Cougars and the UCLA Bruins meet in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
Better and more important games have been played there, but few have
mattered so much to people who are not fans of either team playing.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the oddities of the process by which football bowl
matchups are determined, the outcome of today's game could bear on
the future of the Rose Bowl, the receipts of the local tourist
industry, the bank accounts of the region's two best-known
universities, and even the long-term health of the Rose Parade, which
is heavily subsidized by money made on the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Just as in the 2000 presidential election, it is a series of
little-known rules -- and a shadowy group of decision-makers in South
Florida -- that are causing trouble for everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Today's game involves a local team at a local place, but the
object of much of the excitement -- and worry -- are two schools that
aren't playing: USC and the University of Iowa. They would almost
certainly meet in the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl if UCLA wins.</TE>
<TE>   USC wants to play in the Rose Bowl, so this week has seen the
strange sight of its coach, Pete Carroll, publicly urging Trojan fans
to pack the Rose Bowl to root on their archrival UCLA. (They are
expected to comply).</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa, fans are pulling for UCLA for even more practical
reasons. Thousands of Iowans have purchased plane tickets, travel
packages, even Rose Parade seats -- not all are refundable -- in
expectation that their team is headed to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot on the line Saturday," says Ron Okum, past
president of the Tournament of Roses and current chairman of the
Tournament's football committee. Okum, like other Rose Bowl
officials, is officially neutral in today's contest, but he also
concedes that the game would prefer a traditional Big Ten team, in
this case Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "The only statement we can make is that the traditions of the
Tournament of Roses are important for more than just football, and
we'd like to see those traditions continued."</TE>
<TE>   As a champion of the Big Ten, a Rose Bowl berth for Iowa is
traditional. But unfortunately for Angelenos and Iowans, tradition
may not hold.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility comes at a particularly anxious moment for big
events such as the Tournament of Roses. The clamor among sports fans
and TV executives for a college football playoff have led to
questions about the future of the Rose Bowl game when the current TV
contract expires in 2006. And with changes in public taste and the
recent demise of the Orange Bowl parade, some Tournament members have
expressed concern about the long-term health of the Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Times are changing. I used to say there will always be a Rose
Parade, or at least a Rose Parade like the one we have now," said
Bill Lofthouse, the leading builder of Rose Parade floats. "I still
believe that, but I'm not so sure."</TE>
<TE>   The Tournament of Roses first held a first Rose Bowl game in 1902.
The game was one of many entertainments (chariot races were tried) to
supplement the floral parade that runs down Colorado Boulevard on New
Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1947, the Rose Bowl has pitted, first by tradition and later
by contract, the champions of the Pacific 10 Conference, which
includes schools from Arizona to Washington, and the Big Ten
Conference, which consists of 10 universities across the central and
upper Midwest, plus Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Rose Bowl has been the most consistently
popular and financially successful of the college postseason bowl
games. The game earns $27 million in TV rights. Much of that money is
passed on to the Pac-10 and Big Ten conferences.</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, die-hard college football fans -- and the TV
networks that market to them -- loudly demanded a true national
championship game, drawing the two best college teams regardless of
conference championships. Facing that pressure, the Tournament of
Roses entered into a contract with the Bowl Championship Series.</TE>
<TE>   When the contract was signed, the Tournament said the Rose Bowl
would maintain the Pac-10 versus Big Ten format for three out of
every four years. In the fourth year, the Rose Bowl itself would be
the national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   But the BCS contract had a lesser-known rule: If the Pac-10 or Big
Ten champion qualified for the national championship game, the Rose
Bowl would lose that team to the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl officials figured they would merely pick up a
second-place team. This fall, Tournament President Gary Thomas has
said repeatedly in public appearances that this year's game would pit
a Big Ten school against a Pac-10 school.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and his colleagues acknowledge that they did not fully
comprehend the fine print. This year, the Big Ten has co-champions:
Ohio State and Iowa. Ohio State has qualified for the national
championship game, in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. Iowa looked
like the clear and desirable backup for the Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   But under rules too complex for anyone other than the most
die-hard football trivia buffs, the Miami-based Orange Bowl committee
might be able to grab Iowa when officials selections are made Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl has declined to make an official announcement. And
another game taking place today, pitting the heavily favored
University of Miami against Virginia Tech, could play a role in
determining whether the Orange Bowl is allowed to pick Iowa before
the Rose Bowl can.</TE>
<TE>   The worst scenario for the Rose Bowl would be if Miami wins, as
expected, and UCLA loses. In that case, according to strong hints
that have been dropped in college football circles, the Orange Bowl
will pluck Iowa from the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave the Rose Bowl with a game pitting Washington
State -- which would win the Pac-10 championship by beating UCLA --
against any number of schools, none of them from the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten schools are highly valued by Tournament officials who love
the tens of thousands of fans who fill the Rose Bowl and by people in
the tourism industry, which counts on the spending of Midwesterners
who escape winter for a week of visiting Southern California tourist
attractions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say there have been surprises in how all of this
works out that we didn't anticipate," says Mitch Dorger, chief
executive of the Tournament of Roses. "I think some things surfaced
this year in the rules and the application of the rules that were
different than what we expected."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the state of Iowa also is disappointed at the turn of
events. Chris Bavolack, vice president of the University of Iowa's
alumni association, said the Rose Bowl was more appealing than the
Orange Bowl to Iowa fans. The alumni association has sold nearly all
of its 3,000 available Rose Bowl packages, including nearly 1,000
deluxe deals for $2,199.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Bowl is a Big Ten tradition, it's where the Big Ten fans
want to be," he said. "Right now we're in the process of contacting
our Rose Bowl tour participants so they can tell us if they're
interested in going to a game other than the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Alice Loff, manager of group travel services for the Automobile
Club of Iowa, said her customers mostly just hope UCLA wins today.
"We've had to book clients on a tentative basis, so that no matter
what happens Sunday, our backs will be covered. It's really a lot of
wasted time and effort. Ask me if I'm a fan of the BCS. I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   Tour operators say their packages are refundable. But Ken Bruce,
executive vice president for Dodds Athletic Tours, said many Iowa
fans booked travel individually and will not be so lucky. Rose Parade
seats are nonrefundable after Nov. 1. And tighter airline
restrictions mean an Orange Bowl bid could cost Iowa fans hundreds of
dollars in switch fees.</TE>
<TE>   One Iowa group headed to Pasadena no matter what happens today is
the 203-member Pella Community High School band, which received an
invitation to participate in the Tournament of Roses parade in
November 2001. Band director Guy Blair said an additional 200 friends
and family members have arranged to join the band.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm planning on going to the game," Pella band member Jonathan
Vermeer said. "I've already got my tickets; so do a lot of my
friends. If Iowa's in it, it'll be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
We need UCLA to beat Washington State."</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, concerns run deeper than tickets that can't be used.
Losing Iowa would be a blow to the identity of the Rose Bowl. And the
Rose Bowl is the golden goose that makes possible the weeklong
Pasadena festival that culminates with the Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the TV revenues from the game go to the conferences of the
teams that play, but the Tournament of Roses takes enough to give
itself critical financial room.</TE>
<TE>   The Tournament, for example, does not have to charge TV networks
and stations a fee to broadcast the parade. As a result, NBC, CBS,
and ABC and local TV stations all broadcast the parade. That
extraordinary exposure is a critical reason for the parade's quality.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations will sponsor expensive floats, high school bands will
raise $500,000 to play in the parade, top-notch equestrians will ship
their horses to Pasadena -- all because of that huge TV audience.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena taxpayers also benefit indirectly but from game revenues.
Though New Year's festivals such as the Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl
receive direct public subsidies, the largess from the Rose Bowl helps
the Tournament pay for all the costs of putting on the Rose Parade:
from police overtime to street repairs to rents for use of the
city-owned Rose Bowl stadium and city-owned warehouses where floats
are built.</TE>
<TE>   Under its contract with the city, the Tournament pays Pasadena
more than $1 million annually -- plus 25% of any overall profits.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, Tournament officials worry that this year's episode
could cost the Rose Bowl -- and thus the entire Tournament -- in the
long term. But publicly, Tournament leaders say they aren't too
worried.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, the only Southern Californians who stand to lose
from a UCLA victory today are UCLA fans.</TE>
<TE>   By beating Washington State, UCLA would push its archrival USC
into the Rose Bowl. That would give USC a boost in recruiting better
players to beat UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Warning, Probation for Ryder</HD>
<DH>Actress also must do 480 hours of community service and get
mental health counseling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warning "if you steal again, you will go to jail," a Los Angeles
County judge on Friday sentenced film star Winona Ryder to three
years' probation, mental health counseling and 480 hours of community
service for shoplifting designer merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue
in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "You have disappointed many people inspired and entertained by
your talents," Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox told the two-time
Oscar nominee, who nodded sheepishly as he spoke sternly. "You have
refused to accept personal responsibility."</LD>
<LD>   Ryder, 31, also was ordered to pay more than $10,000 in fines,
including $6,355.40 to Saks for stolen and damaged goods from her
infamous shopping trip last December.</LD>
<TE>   The actress faced up to three years in state prison on her
conviction last month on felony grand theft and vandalism charges.</TE>
<TE>   During the acrimonious, one-hour sentencing hearing in a Beverly
Hills courtroom, Ryder -- who starred in "Girl, Interrupted," "Little
Women" and "The Age of Innocence" -- declined to make a statement.</TE>
<TE>   She did, however, express herself with body language.</TE>
<TE>   When a Saks supervisor, addressing the court as the victim of the
crime, called her a "movie star thief," Ryder's brown eyes widened
with a look of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   And when Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle accused Ryder and her
attorney of "trot[ting] out the body of a dead child," Polly Klaas,
to deflect from her criminal acts, Ryder jumped out of her seat,
gasping as she glared at the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle's remarks were directed to repeated court references to
Ryder's work on behalf of the Polly Klaas Foundation, which deals
with missing children such as the youngster who was kidnapped and
murdered nine years ago in Petaluma, where Ryder once lived.</TE>
<TE>   " ... That is just so outrageous, judge," Ryder's attorney, Mark
Geragos, said as he tried to comfort his glowering client.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle snapped back: "I've had to listen to this for a year."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos called the exchange inappropriate, citing it as one of
many examples of how Ryder, who has no prior convictions, has been
unfairly accused of committing "heinous acts."</TE>
<TE>   "To try and tar and feather her, I think, is revolting," Geragos
said before highlighting Ryder's "generous" monetary donations and
volunteer time to good causes.</TE>
<TE>   Besides helping the Klaas Foundation, he said, Ryder also has
assisted college students on an Indian reservation.</TE>
<TE>   In issuing his sentence Friday, Judge Fox ordered Ryder to
volunteer at the City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, the Foundation
for the Junior Blind, and Caring for Children and Families With AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ordered Ryder to undergo court-approved drug and
psychological counseling programs.</TE>
<TE>   According to a county probation report made public over Geragos'
objection after Friday's sentencing, police discovered a hypodermic
needle along with eight types of prescription drugs in Ryder's
possession when she was booked at the Beverly Hills jail.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said Ryder deceived them about the drugs in her purse.
When they found a bottle marked Aleve, Ryder told police it was the
nonprescription painkiller. Instead, the officer discovered 40
tablets of Vicoprofen and two Vicoden pills inside the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder told county probation officers that she took those and other
drugs to treat a herniated disk she suffered while rehearsing for a
movie. Days before shopping at Saks, Ryder said, she also injured her
arm when she fell off a skateboard.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said in court Friday that Ryder had "more pain medication
in her purse than someone with a terminal disease."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, from January 1996 to December 1998, Ryder
had 37 prescriptions filled by 30 doctors. She obtained the
medications from a Rite-Aid drugstore on Sunset Boulevard as well as
pharmacies in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Board investigated one of the doctors who
prescribed Ryder's medication and discovered that he had written
several prescriptions to her under an alias, Emily Thompson,
according to the probation report.</TE>
<TE>   "If the defendant was under 'pain management guidance,' then the
procedures that are recognized to effect pain were certainly not
followed by this doctor," the report states. "Apparently, he was a
popular doctor because he made house calls and hotel calls."</TE>
<TE>   The state board revoked the doctor's license Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The state and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration told
investigating officers for the probation report that the doctor had
been "kicked out of South Africa for overmedicating people. He came
to California and apparently is listed as a tattoo and hair removal
doctor but at one time he was a licensed therapist. Apparently he is
the doctor to many celebrity people."</TE>
<TE>   In the report, a Beverly Hills police detective states that he
believes Ryder has a drug problem. "We don't want to find her slumped
over in a car with a needle in her arm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, however, told police that she has always been terrified of
nonprescription drugs and had not used any, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   She told police that a doctor prescribed Clonopin for her at age
19 when she was in the midst of a romantic breakup.</TE>
<TE>   She stopped taking the drug after a year, she said, when she
realized it was "too much," the report states. She also occasionally
took the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.</TE>
<TE>   At Saks, Ryder stole $5,560 worth of merchandise, including five
purses, four hairpieces, two hats and a blouse by top fashion
designers such as Calvin Klein, Donna Karen, Yves St. Laurent and
Dolce and Gabanna.</TE>
<TE>   The merchandise also included a white Gucci dress valued at
$1,595.</TE>
<TE>   During her trial, Saks security agents testified that the actress
said she took the items as research for a movie role. She also told
security agents that she thought her assistant had paid for the
goods.</TE>
<TE>   A security tape that was a key piece of evidence during the trial
showed no assistant with her as she walked through the store laden
with merchandise and shopping bags.</TE>
<TE>   During the sentencing hearing, a Saks vice president said
shoplifting cost his store more than $7 million last year, money that
could have gone toward employee raises, health care and pension
benefits, or the creation of new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "When shoplifters steal from stores," Kenneth Metzner said, "they
are picking the pockets of the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Ryder's "aberrant behavior" last year, her attorney,
Geragos, said she is "the classiest woman I have ever met."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the sentence, the attorney said, Ryder will have to
"carry this with her, a scarlet letter of an 'S' wherever she goes."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder is due to return to court on April 7 for a status report. By
that time, she must complete her community service.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Beverly Hills courthouse, Geragos told a swarm of
reporters from around the world that Ryder "has her work cut out for
her," but is committed to serving her probation sentence without
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to the attorney, Marc Klaas praised Ryder's
"unsolicited acts of benevolence.... She may be a double felon, but
she's a double felon with a very big heart and a generous spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos was coy when asked whether he would file an appeal. "I
have 60 days," he said, as he dashed past dozens of cameras and
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Geragos indicated that he would seek to have the conviction
reduced to a misdemeanor once Ryder completes her probation.</TE>
<TE>   A statement released Friday by Ryder's publicist said the actress
"accepts responsibility for what happened on Dec. 12, 2001, and ...
is relieved to finally put this behind her and is hopeful that she
will be able to restore some modicum of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Judge Fox told Ryder that he hopes she
"reflects on" and "confronts" the problems that caused her to
shoplift. "I have a 16-year-old son named Ryan who asked, 'Why would
Winona Ryder steal from Saks Fifth Avenue when she has enough money
to buy anything?' "</TE>
<TE>   Fox stared at Ryder. "You're the only person who can answer that."</TE>

<HD>Manhunt Ends as Suspect in Boy's Killing Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Antwaine Butler, 17, denies that he gunned down Clive
Jackson, 14, two weeks ago. The case became a rallying cry against
gang killings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nationwide hunt for the alleged killer of 14-year-old Clive Jackson
Jr. ended quietly Friday afternoon outside Parker Center when
17-year-old Antwaine Butler, flanked by his tearful family,
surrendered to Los Angeles police.</LD>
<LD>   Declaring his innocence, Butler turned himself in to homicide
detectives shortly before 3 p.m., two weeks after Jackson was gunned
down following a fight outside MacGee's Donut Shop on South Western
Avenue near Vernon Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The death of the college-bound Crenshaw High School student has
become a rallying cry for city officials and community leaders
outraged by a recent rise in gang killings that has helped make Los
Angeles the nation's homicide capital. More than a month ago, the
number of killings in Los Angeles -- 587 -- surpassed the total
number in all of last year.</LD>
<TE>   "Thank God," Alice Barnes, Jackson's aunt, said when told Butler
had turned himself in. "I am just glad he is off the street."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Smith, the mother of the slain teenager, voiced similar
relief. "I knew sooner or later they would get him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the Nov. 21 shooting, authorities said that they
were looking for Butler and that he was a known member of the Rollin'
40s Crips.</TE>
<TE>   But before he was led away by detectives Friday, Butler and his
attorney Mark Werksman insisted that the teenager was a victim of
mistaken identity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they're doing this," Butler said in a brief
interview. "They got the wrong guy."</TE>
<TE>   Disavowing any gang affiliations, Butler claimed he had "never
seen" Jackson before authorities came looking for him in connection
with the boy's killing.</TE>
<TE>   "The police say there are eyewitnesses at the doughnut shop who
identify him as the shooter. But Antwaine says it was not him,"
Werksman said. "He was not there and he doesn't understand why he is
being accused of this."</TE>
<TE>   Added Werksman: "I want to make sure the public understands that
he is turning himself in and intends to fight these charges."</TE>
<TE>   When Butler arrived at police headquarters with Werksman, he was
met by his mother, stepfather and two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting his 2-year-old nephew Dorien, the teenager walked with his
family to meet two detectives.</TE>
<TE>   After several embraces, he was led away as his mother and sisters
broke down crying.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do it," said his mother, Melanie, wiping away tears as
her son was driven to Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the shooting, she said, she and the family had just
learned that Butler had passed his high school equivalency test at
the Westside Academy High School. "Only two students at his school
passed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday, she said, her son had never been arrested. His only
brush with the law, she said, was five years ago when he was caught
with marijuana in junior high school. "He was given a ticket ... and
they let him go," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Antwaine is no gang member," said Butler's stepfather,
Rosharn Matta. "They talk about his gang affiliation and his tattoos.
The only tattoos he has are of his momma and the cross."</TE>
<TE>   Det. Rudy Lemos said the LAPD has linked Butler to a street gang
and the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the information we have, there is no doubt in my mind
that he is the person responsible for the death of Clive Jackson,"
said Lemos, homicide coordinator for the 77th Division, where nearly
half of this year's 600-plus killings have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Since shortly after the shooting, Lemos said, detectives had
focused on Butler and tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a previous
surrender by the teenager. "We told him the first day to come in and
he procrastinated," said Lemos.</TE>
<TE>   Werksman said Butler agreed to turn himself in Friday when LAPD
detectives threatened to launch a search that also would include more
than 100 federal agents unless he surrendered by 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Though that warning could not be verified, the LAPD's Lemos said
detectives had already received plenty of assistance from other law
enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone, including the Border Patrol, had been notified and they
were assisting," Lemos said.</TE>

<HD>Making Their Presents Felt</HD>
<DH>Couple spend thousands on toys for underprivileged
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunny Blonsky could have invested in some nice municipal bonds but
decided to go for a more significant return -- the smiles of children
she doesn't even know.</LD>
<LD>   That is why Blonsky spent more than $7,800 early Friday morning on
cart after shopping cart brimming with toys. And it's also why she is
going back for more.</LD>
<LD>   Schlepping through a Rite-Aid store in Thousand Oaks, she gathered
Barbie outfits and battery-operated bulldozers, crayon sets and
kiddie microwaves, scrutinizing her finds with a shrewd shopper's eye
before pulling them off the shelves by the stack.</LD>
<TE>   "I get a lot of joy out of picking them out, and I want them to be
something nice," she said. "No guns or anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   A travel agent, Blonsky, 58, works from her home in nearby
Westlake Village. Her husband, Jerry, works for a local heating and
air conditioning business. Childless, they aren't fabulously wealthy.
But they want for nothing, Blonsky said, and look for opportunities
to share what they have.</TE>
<TE>   Each holiday season for the last nine years, the couple have
bought hundreds of toys for charities. Since 2000, their generosity
has benefited the "Spark of Love" drive of the Ventura County Fire
Department, which dispatches a truck to pick up the booty.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I encountered her, she called and asked where she
could donate toys," said Fire Department spokesman Joe Luna. "I told
her, 'Just drop by a fire station.' But when she asked if we could
send a truck, it turned out to be an understatement. She just opens
up her heart."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, that meant a quick trip to the Rite-Aid storeroom,
where store manager Ferdie Sevillano showed Blonsky the vast piles of
toys, dolls, games and festive what-nots brought in for the occasion
from other stores in the chain. Loading a dolly for the first of many
trips to the cash register, he instantly summed up the moment:
"There's gonna' be a lot of happy kids."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Blonsky hit the aisles, shadowed by a reporter and
photographer. She said she never has sought publicity but agreed to
it last year only to spur donations.</TE>
<TE>   A brisk, no-nonsense woman, she knew how to say no to toys. She
passed on the 37-note battery-operated keyboard. "Those things can
drive a parent crazy," she said. And she grimaced at the "World
Peacekeepers Military Motorbike With Fully Posable Action Figure" in
its camouflage box.</TE>
<TE>   But it was yes to the Etch-a-Sketch, and yes to Peek-a-boo Peggy,
yes to the mini-monster truck that flips itself over, yes to the doll
that trills "Mary Had a Little Lamb," yes to the Wild Quest
Endangered Animal Rescue Patrol, complete with majestic plastic
elephant and a plastic ecologist called Wildboar Max. In general, it
was a yes from Blonsky to the good karma that comes from doing good.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you give, you get back tenfold," Blonsky said, deciding
to forgo a Barbie Pizza Hut Playset. "Kids get too much fast food
anyway," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of hours, the toy shelves looked like a gap-toothed
smile, with Army tanks and fighter planes setting off the empty
spaces where teddy bears and dolls had until recently resided.
Blonsky said she would be back next week, ready to spend another
$1,500 or so when the store can restock her preferred toys.</TE>
<TE>   "They know what I like," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The toys, which Rite-Aid sold at a 10% discount, were hauled to a
Ventura storefront, where volunteers sorted them for some 3,000
foster kids, children in group homes and others in need.</TE>
<TE>   Blonsky is just one of many contributors, said Ventura County
community services coordinator Pam Waldron, who directs the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a man who for many years bought $5,000 or $10,000 worth of
bicycles because he never had one as a child," Waldron said. "We've
got volunteers working full time for weeks before the holidays. We've
got Girl Scouts making teddy bears and retired people on fixed
incomes giving what they can.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day," she said, "I'm reminded of what the season is all
about."</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Gun-wielding attackers opened fire late Friday on a crowded square
that has become the heart of the movement opposing President Hugo
Chavez, killing three people and bringing chaos and terror to
Venezuela's weeklong protest against the controversial leader.</LD>
<LD>   Only moments after opposition leaders announced on nationwide
television that they were prolonging a strike that on Friday shut
down oil exports in the world's fifth-largest petroleum producer,
shots rang out in Plaza Altamira in an upscale neighborhood of the
capital.</LD>
<LD>   At least two men -- and as many as four -- ran up to the square
with pistols drawn and began firing indiscriminately into the crowd
of men, women and children, witnesses said. People in the square also
said they had seen firing from nearby rooftops and men on motorcycles
shooting as they raced by the square.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the night, chaos reigned. Sirens filled the air. Men,
women and children carrying Venezuelan flags they had once waved in
protest ran away with them fluttering in retreat. Four-wheel-drive
vehicles, taxis and cars raced down mostly empty streets.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere was electric and dangerous. A mob attacked and beat
at least one man, who apparently was apprehended as he tried to steal
someone's cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks plunged the country into its worst political crisis
since April, when a coup briefly ousted Chavez. The coup was preceded
by a protest march that also turned violent, leaving 19 people dead.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela appeared on the brink of a political collapse Friday
night as protesters blamed Chavez supporters for the attack and
demanded that the president immediately resign. Worries also
immediately surged about the possibility of a second coup attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The protests in Venezuela pit Chavez against a fragmented but
broad-based opposition movement that consists of businesses, unions,
media groups and ordinary Venezuelans.</TE>
<TE>   The dead in Friday night's shooting included a 17-year-old girl as
well as a 67-year-old man, whose body was covered with a Venezuelan
flag. City officials said 28 people were injured. Among the wounded
were children ages 10 to 14.</TE>
<TE>   One of the gunmen was arrested and two 9-millimeter pistols were
confiscated, officials said. Six other people were detained for
questioning, authorities said. Of the seven detainees, one was
Portuguese and one was British.</TE>
<TE>   The detained gunman, identified as Joao Goveia, a Portuguese
national, was shown on TV admitting to the crime during an interview
with reporters. Later, news programs began airing a videotape that
seemed to show Goveia participating in a pro-Chavez rally a day
earlier, lending strength to the claim that a Chavez supporter was
responsible for the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said one of the attackers emptied his magazine, then
reloaded and continued firing as the crowd dived for the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "A big man, tall and light-skinned, pulled out a gun and started
shooting," said Luis Leon Jiminez, who was manning a protest stand at
the square and said he had just served coffee to the two victims.
"The man fell down slowly. The girl said, 'Help me, help me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Plaza Altamira has been the center of protests since October, when
a group of dissident generals opposed to Chavez took over the space
and declared it "liberated territory."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the number of officers who have joined the protest has
grown to more than 100, and the square has become a daily gathering
place for those opposed to the left-leaning Chavez, who they say has
driven the country into financial ruin and political chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Panic broke out Friday night as the shots echoed through the
plaza, which is ringed by office buildings, tony stores and a
shuttered four-star hotel.</TE>
<TE>   People in the crowd threw themselves to the ground as some of the
dissident military officers rushed out on the square with
9-millimeter pistols drawn, using them to gesture to bystanders to
stay down.</TE>
<TE>   The two dead fell on the edge of the plaza, bleeding profusely. As
they were being loaded into an ambulance, a single shot rang out,
once again sending the screaming crowd to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard at least 20 shots -- pow, pow, pow," said Rafael Leon, a
42-year-old doctor who had come to the square to listen to a protest
speech. "Then I saw a big police officer grab one of the men."</TE>
<TE>   As the night wore on, rumors flew and crowds ran back and forth.
The apparent backfiring of a car caused more panic, and the remaining
protesters again flung themselves on the ground. As the protesters
stood back up, someone grabbed a microphone and began hoarsely
screaming: "We are not afraid! We are not afraid!"</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Felipe Rodriguez, one of the dissenting officers, walked
through the crowd, running into a woman who then hugged him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're staying. We're staying," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pools of blood marked where the dead and wounded fell. Television
showed images of bloodstained men and women being treated at local
hospitals and in ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very, very, very serious," said Leopoldo Lopez, mayor of
the Caracas borough where Plaza Altamira is located. "I don't know
the consequences, but what it has made clear is that the streets are
dangerous and you can't protest peacefully."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides were planning large demonstrations today.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez addressed the nation early this morning. He condemned the
attacks but seemed to suggest that some blame lay with opposition
members for mounting a "show" at the plaza that created a climate of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   He also urged caution and said it was too early to implicate
Goveia in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask all the country -- the opposition, the media, all the
population -- we can't ... insist on more vengeance, insist on more
violence," Chavez said. "We're making a call for calm. We're making a
call for nonviolence."</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organization of American
States, also called for calm. Gaviria has been in the country for
more than a month to mediate ongoing negotiations between Chavez and
the opposition, which is seeking an early referendum on his rule.</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria said both sides had pledged to immediately begin
negotiations, which were suspended shortly before the strike began
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "These acts happened at a time of maximum tension," Gaviria said.
"It's urgent that the negotiating table comes together as soon as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks rocketed tensions in a country already deep in the
midst of a white-hot political crisis. Only eight months ago, Chavez
was ousted in a coup, only to be returned to power 48 hours later by
loyal military officers and his supporters, mostly the poor and
powerless, who back his social reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, the country has been riven, with the opposition
holding marches, protests and strikes to force Chavez to hold a
nonbinding referendum on his rule in February.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has consistently blocked a vote on his rule, saying that
the Venezuelan Constitution doesn't permit one until August.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff led to this week's strike, which began Monday and
gathered force when oil workers from the state petroleum company,
PDVSA, joined the protest.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, PDVSA President Ali Rodriguez said that the workers'
strike had led the company to warn international clients -- including
the United States -- that oil deliveries might be affected.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, has caused worry on international markets of a
possible disruption in oil supplies just as the United States
approaches a cold winter and a possible war with Iraq. Venezuela is
the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez issued a dire warning, pleading for oil workers to come
back to work before internal gas shortages cripple the country's
industry and economy. He accused the striking workers of "sabotage."</TE>
<TE>   "They have caused damage to the company," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere, the
Panaguana Refining Center, on a desert peninsula about 240 miles west
of Caracas, demonstrated one of the principal problems: paralyzed
shipping.</TE>
<TE>   At least six tankers sat anchored on sparkling seas just off the
loading docks of the refinery, which produces nearly 1 million
barrels a day, about a third of the country's total capacity.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of them, the Ambrosio, was a state-owned tanker that
had joined 12 other tankers -- the entire state-owned fleet -- in
participating in the strike, crippling transport capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We see our obligation," said Jose Grosso, the second in command,
speaking by radio to local media Thursday night. "This ship has
joined the strike."</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's killings, however, there seemed little hope of a
quick end to the strike, or to the country's political crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ortega, the leader of the country's largest union,
Confederated Venezuelan Workers, said that the strike would continue
indefinitely. He called Chavez a killer.</TE>
<TE>   And negotiators, already emboldened by the strike's success in
affecting oil production, made it clear that a referendum would no
longer be enough and that they would immediately begin seeking an
early presidential election.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Prepared to Claim Iraq Is Lying About Arms</HD>
<DH>Instead of using force, Washington will first seek tougher
inspections and focus on scientists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Even before Iraq hands over the long-awaited declaration of its
weapons and missile programs in Baghdad today, the Bush
administration is preparing to declare the nation in "material
breach" of a tough U.N. resolution for expected omissions in the
report, U.S. officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The White House claims to have evidence -- which it hasn't
released to inspectors or other countries -- that Iraq has weapons of
mass destruction, despite Baghdad's repeated denials.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of pushing immediately for military action, the
administration will use the anticipated gaps to argue for more
aggressive inspections and the spiriting away of Iraqi scientists who
could lead inspectors to "a smoking gun." It would be the first step
in providing the evidence needed to convince the international
community that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must go, the officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a moment to declare war but to determine the task
ahead," a senior State Department official said. "We see this as part
of an overall process of determining whether Iraq will cooperate and
disarm."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's weapons inventory -- expected to be more than 10,000 pages
long and written partly in Arabic -- will be given to U.N. officials
in Baghdad at 8 p.m. local time today and delivered to the offices of
the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and U.N.
headquarters in New York on Sunday night. U.N. experts will screen
the document before any member of the Security Council -- including
the United States -- sees it, a process that could take several days.</TE>
<TE>   Resolution 1441 not only requires Baghdad to list information on
past and present weapons programs but also to detail any materials in
its civilian industries that could be used for military purposes.
Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix has said that the burden of proof
is on Iraq and that if Baghdad claims it has destroyed weapons
materials, it must offer "convincing evidence."</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq is found to have violated the resolution -- a "material
breach" -- the response could include military action.</TE>
<TE>   Before turning the declaration over to the Security Council's 15
members, U.N. experts will study it for sensitive information, such
as instructions for making weapons, in order to abide by
nonproliferation conventions.</TE>
<TE>   It may take experts weeks to translate and analyze the report and,
at least initially, it may raise more questions than it will answer,
U.S. and U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   And so, U.S. officials are pressing inspectors to concentrate on
what has been their most valuable source of information in the past:
Iraqi scientists. The U.S. wants to create the equivalent of a
witness protection program for specialists and their families who can
help inspectors unearth the kind of evidence that would convince the
international community of the need to topple the Iraqi regime.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis themselves are the key to finding the holes and giving
us the smoking gun," said a well-placed U.S. official who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Washington will push for the weapons inspectors to press some of
the 500 Iraqi scientists, engineers and technicians identified by
previous U.N. teams as having a role in the production of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the inspectors should
take advantage of all methods as they look for clues on whether Iraq
has developed weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Given Iraq's history of brutal witness intimidation -- including
imprisonment, torture and murder -- this is a key tool for inspectors
to make certain that Saddam Hussein disarms," Fleischer said. "By
providing for such interviews in its resolution, the Security Council
expects inspectors to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   But Blix is reluctant to remove scientists from the country,
saying there are "practical difficulties" in taking people who might
not want to leave Iraq or who might not be able to return. Hussein's
regime reportedly has tortured and executed people who have offered
help to inspectors in the past, and Blix is acutely aware of what is
at stake if his team should ask anyone for a private interview.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said the inspectors have an extensive list of Iraqi weapons
specialists they would like to speak with but haven't asked for any
interviews yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to abduct anyone," Blix said Friday after
meeting with the Security Council. "The U.N. is not a defection
agency."</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. has evidence that Iraq has weapons material,
Washington should give it to the inspectors to investigate, Blix said
somewhat testily Friday after a week of criticism from both Baghdad
and Washington about the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "Any country is too big for inspectors to comb through every
square centimeter. You need to have information," he said. "They may
be listening to what's going on in the ether, and they may have a lot
of other sources of information, but we can go to the sites
legitimately and legally."</TE>
<TE>   The United States pressed hard for a provision in the new
resolution that would allow the U.N. to take Iraqi weapons
specialists out of the country so that inspectors could tap into the
vital and most direct source of intelligence on Baghdad's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   At least half of the specialists are believed to have worked on
Iraq's nuclear program, the area of greatest concern to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that Baghdad has worked hardest to conceal
whatever remains of its nuclear program and that the scientists are a
treasure trove with information, particularly about what has happened
to weapons programs since previous inspectors left in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, problems with relying heavily on scientists
and engineers, warn former inspectors and U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of people who come forward and say, 'I am a
key member,' and they are. But you do have to be careful you don't
let in [to the U.S.] every Baghdad taxi driver who claims to be a
nuclear scientist," said David Kay, a former weapons inspector who is
now at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past 11 years, there have been a number of people who
have called who claimed to have important information who turned out
not to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One danger with specialists is that they might not actually know
the current status of their work or the location of any hidden
evidence, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "They may give you information, but then still you have to prove
it -- the same problem you started with," Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Friday that the handling of scientists who
might be willing to defect would be the United Nations'
responsibility but that the United States and "much of the world
stands ready to help."</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan congressional effort to lure Iraqi scientists by
providing U.S. residency in exchange for information collapsed last
month when Congress adjourned without voting on the bill.</TE>

<HD>The Secret to This Wine's Popularity Is the Grapevine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Corie Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The morning after a friend served Anna McNeal a glass of Charles Shaw
Merlot, she made a beeline to the Mid-Wilshire Trader Joe's to stock
up on the wine selling at an astonishing $1.99 a bottle. "I had to
come and get a case," she said in a checkout line with half a dozen
other shoppers who had somehow heard of the mysterious "Napa" wine.</LD>
<LD>   Since it was introduced in February, Charles Shaw wine has gained
a cult-like following in Southern California, with wine drinkers
backing their cars up to the loading dock of the Los Angeles-based
discounter to lay in a supply of the Trader Joe's exclusive.</LD>
<LD>   It is selling furiously, said Jon Fredrikson, a wine consultant
based in San Mateo County. "A great story for consumers."</LD>
<TE>   As its fame has grown, so have the tales about the wine's origin.
One persistent urban legend holds that the wine is being dumped on
the market by an airline that, post-Sept. 11, could no longer use
corkscrews. Others say financially strapped United Airlines is
selling its food service wine stocks to raise cash. Then there's the
theory that it's a fire sale sparked by "the Shaws' " nasty divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Trader Joe's chief wine buyer, Chris Condit, rather likes
the rumors -- he refuses to reveal who is actually bottling his wine --
but he acknowledges that the myths are far from true. The fact is
there is a worldwide glut of wine, and Charles Shaw is just an
extreme example of a swelling wave of impossibly cheap, plentiful
bottles.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly is in those bottles, how can they be so cheap and
who is Charles Shaw, anyway?</TE>
<TE>   It turns out Shaw -- Chuck, to his friends -- was a Stanford
business school grad who caught the wine bug while working as a
banker in Paris. He moved to the Napa Valley in 1974 to fulfill his
dream of producing award-winning Gamay Beaujolais.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Americans turned their noses up at his light red wine,
and old friends in Napa say he moved back East in the mid-1990s, just
missing the meteoric rise in the value of vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his $8 wine had a good reputation within the industry, said
Harvey Posert, a veteran wine industry publicist. And so Bronco Wine
Co., a giant Central Valley wine conglomerate, bought the Napa label
in a distress sale, said Posert, who has worked for Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Franzia, the head of Bronco, is one of the world's leading
growers of varietal grapes and one of the state's largest winemakers,
with headquarters in the Central Valley town of Ceres.</TE>
<TE>   Like Condit, he refuses to discuss Charles Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   But wine industry experts say that despite the classy Napa label,
there probably isn't a hint of those pricey grapes in a bottle of
Charles Shaw Merlot, Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the depressed market, grapes from Napa sell for around
$2,000 a ton, said Brian Sudano of Beverage Marketing Corp. To make
money on a $2 bottle, he added, a vintner would have to buy grapes
for around $200 a ton -- the price of less desirable Central Valley
grapes.</TE>
<TE>   This summer the market price for those grapes hit a low of $60 a
ton. Swimming in excess wine, Franzia revived the Charles Shaw label,
believing it would be more cost-effective to dump his wine on the
consumer market than to pour it on the ground. Taking advantage of
the depressed wine grape market, he also bought up excess stock from
other Central Valley vintners, according to several wine industry
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "Franzia was able to take advantage of distress sales by other
vineyards," said Fredrikson. "And he's got the high-speed production
lines to do it and still make money."</TE>
<TE>   Franzia's bottom-fishing approach is working, in part, because the
state's overall wine quality is improving, even wine from Central
Valley grapes, according to Jim Wolpert, chair of the department of
viticulture and enology at UC Davis. For the last decade, the
California wine industry has been investing heavily in new technology
and facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Franzia, for one, built a new Bronco winery in Napa last year,
which could process Charles Shaw wine -- and allow the company to put
Napa on the label, even though the grapes are being trucked in from
all across the state, said Posert.</TE>
<TE>   In a blind taste test by the trade magazine Wine &amp; Vine, Charles
Shaw's 2000 Chardonnay beat out a $67 Chardonnay that -- par for the
course -- the publication declined to name.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that's a result even Charles Shaw devotees may find hard to
swallow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely drinkable cheap house wine," said Tracy Hackney
of Los Angeles, who has gone through three cases of the stuff. "The
Cabernet is sharp right out of the bottle, then gets thicker in the
glass, but I've drunk so much that it's hard to be objective."</TE>
<TE>   After quickly running through the initial release, the winery
bought more bulk wine. In nine months, it released three batches of
Charles Shaw wine, the 1999, 2000 and 2001 vintages. Expect a 2002
vintage to hit stores early next year, according to Trader Joe's.
"We'll have more as long as the glut lasts," said Condit.</TE>
<TE>   To wine industry insiders, it comes as no surprise that Franzia is
leading the price slashing. "He knows the market," said one industry
source. "In the last downturn 10 years ago, [Bronco] bought up land
and brands and facilities when everyone else was selling."</TE>
<TE>   According to Fredrikson, Bronco could be paying as little as $7 a
case for the glass bottles and corks he uses to bottle Charles Shaw
wine.</TE>
<TE>   With Trader Joe's rumored to have bought the wine for $19 a case,
Franzia would have to be making and bottling the wine for less than
$1 a bottle to turn any profit.</TE>
<TE>   Franzia, whose father was a California vintner, started Bronco in
1973 with his brothers John and Joe. With 20,000 acres of vineyards
(almost all in the Central Valley), a wine storage capacity of 62
million gallons and the capability of crushing up to 60,000 tons of
grapes a day, Bronco is one of the industry's highest-volume
producers.</TE>
<TE>   The gambit of packaging up the Central Valley's excess wine to
siphon off at rock-bottom prices allowed Franzia to continue charging
$5 to $10 a bottle for the wine it sells under its 31 other brands,
including Forest Glen, Rutherford Vintners, Hacienda, Cedar Brook,
Forestville, Estrella, Grand Cru, Montpellier, Silver Ridge, Laurier,
Bear's Lair, Douglas Hill, FoxHollow, Salmon Creek, Domaine Napa,
Napa Creek, Napa Ridge, Gibson Winery, Antares Cellar, Albertoni
Vineyards, JJJ, CC Vineyard, the California Winery, J.W. Morris,
Black Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   And its success with Charles Shaw is already being imitated by
other vintners. The Benziger winery, for example, is doing the same
thing. "They had 20,000 cases available, a label we could use,
Wildwater Creek, and we took it all. It's the same product as the
rest of Benziger's wine," Condit said, noting he sells it for $4.99 a
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Denying that this is the same quality wine, Benziger Family Winery
President Tim Wallace said the wine he sold to Trader Joe's was
excess inventory that didn't make the grade for Benziger's regular
labels.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the winery would have sold it on the commodity wine
market, he said. But with the glut, those prices were so low that it
made more sense to bottle it themselves and sell as a loss leader.</TE>
<TE>   "We hoped to stimulate demand for wine by dropping the price,"
said Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   The glut is not just a boon for Trader Joe's. Costco Wholesale
Corp. is seeing the prices drop even on the brand-name wines it
carries. "We're seeing a lot of good premium $10 wines that would
have sold for $15" a year ago, said Costco Chief Executive James
Sinegal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just starting to see the downward push," said Linda
Bisson, a wine production professor at UC Davis, who, like others in
the business, says the pressure that started at the bottom of the
market has begun to creep up the price scale.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in wine was making plenty of dough in the 1990s, and
they plowed it back into producing more grapes," Condit said. "Lo and
behold, four years later, there are lots and lots of grapes. An ocean
of wine."</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just California. Australia, Chile, South Africa, as
well as Italy, France and the rest of Europe over-planted.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of wine to sell," said Joe Ciatti, one of
California's leading wine grape brokers. "There will be excesses
going into next year and a few more years after that."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's great news for wine drinkers, said Karen Ross,
president of the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer," she said, "is absolutely in the driver's seat."</TE>

<HD>Davis Outlines Deep Midyear Cuts in Education, Health</HD>
<DH>The $10.2 billion in proposed reductions would hit schools
hardest. More than 200,000 residents could lose health benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis proposed slashing spending from hundreds of state
programs Friday, outlining deep cuts in public education, health care
and other areas as part of a $10.2-billion package of midyear budget
reductions and other savings.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement unleashed a fierce debate over California's
priorities in the face of a projected deficit of more than $21
billion.</LD>
<LD>   "These budget reductions are severe by any measure," Davis said.
"Enacting these cuts in midyear will be an extraordinarily difficult
task, but we face an extraordinary challenge. No program will be held
harmless, and it will not be possible for us to meet this fiscal
challenge if decisions are driven by politics, fear or rigid
ideology."</LD>
<TE>   The Legislature is set to convene Monday in a special session to
discuss the governor's proposals and other possible solutions to the
looming budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The deliberations promise to be intense: Majority Democrats say
they will fight to preserve services to needy Californians, while
Republicans say they will oppose any tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has described education as his top priority as
governor, delivered the biggest blow to public schools. He
recommended cutting spending on kindergarten through community
college by $3.1 billion this year and in the 2003-04 budget year,
which begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also proposed cuts and savings of $2 billion in
health and human services, $1.9 billion in government operations and
$1.7 billion in transportation and housing.</TE>
<TE>   If all those cuts were adopted, more than 200,000 Californians
would lose health benefits, and some school districts would have to
lay off employees -- just two snapshots of the human suffering the
cuts would inflict, state officials conceded.</TE>
<TE>   State employees, a favorite target of Republicans demanding cuts
in the size of state government, face an uncertain year. Davis said
the state could save $470 million in employment costs through pay
cuts, furloughs, layoffs and other means.</TE>
<TE>   As promised, the governor didn't propose a tax increase. But he
did recommend an increase in state park user fees to raise an
estimated $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' proposed cuts provoked swift and sharp reaction from
potential targets, offering a preview of the extraordinary pressure
legislators will face as powerful interests try to protect their
share of the budget.</TE>
<TE>   "A cut of this magnitude in the current fiscal year will
absolutely undermine our core mission to educate kids," said Kevin
Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School Business
Officials. "There will almost certainly be an increase in class size
and massive layoffs of support staff if we are forced to implement
these kinds of cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Many school district leaders were scrambling Friday for
information about Davis' proposed cuts. Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy
Romer learned details when a reporter called and recited the list of
reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Romer was not happy with what he heard. He openly fretted about
making additional cuts in a district that already has slashed more
than $400 million from its budget this year -- in part by raising
class sizes in most grades. "It's going to be very painful and
tough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The second-largest chunk of the state general fund budget --
health care -- faces about $1.2 billion in cuts, most of which were
recommended by Davis this summer but rejected by legislative
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The governor proposed $167.4 million in reductions to Medi-Cal,
the health-care program for low-income Californians. That includes a
10% cut in payments to doctors, nursing homes and other providers of
Medi-Cal services, which would save about $90.4 million. Hospitals
and federally qualified health centers are exempted from the
reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spared Medi-Cal services for children and Healthy Families,
the health insurance program for the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the cuts will be devastating, said Beth Capell, a
Sacramento lobbyist whose clients include health-care consumers and
workers. Up to 1 million people, five times more than state officials
earlier estimated, could lose health coverage, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The poorest people will have the most difficulty in getting
health care," said Capell. "The optional [Medi-Cal] benefits sound
abstract, but these are people making $1,000 or $1,500 a month, and
we're asking them to pay out of pocket for diabetes supplies. These
are people like diabetics in danger of losing their toes for not
being able to go to a podiatrist."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also proposed eliminating child care for former clients of
the CalWORKS program to save about $98 million.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Tim Gage said the state was prepared to
renegotiate labor contracts with state employees in an effort to
achieve needed savings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to ask [state employees] to recognize the fact that
the state is in a dire economic circumstance," said Gage, who fielded
questions from reporters in Sacramento after Davis announced the cuts
by telephone in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The governor hopes the Legislature will act on the package by the
end of January, Gage said.</TE>
<TE>   As the size of the budget dilemma has come into grim focus in
recent weeks, legislators on both sides of the aisle have waited for
Davis to take the lead in proposing painful cuts. Friday, some were
quick to criticize the package he presented.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the governor prior to the press conference that I thought
Senate Republicans would be supportive of many if not most of his
proposals," Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte said from Hawaii. "I
said for three years if we didn't get spending under control, we
would have nothing but a series of very, very bad options. We now
have a series of very, very bad options."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the state's four legislative leaders are in Hawaii:
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City); Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks. They
and several other legislators are attending a gathering sponsored by
one of the state's most powerful lobbies, the prison guards union.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, some Democratic legislators criticized Davis for
failing to put tax increases on the table for discussion, even though
many independent experts say those will have to be part of the
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, for example, did not propose raising vehicle license fees,
an increase widely supported by legislative Democrats and expected to
be presented in next week's special session. Restoring the fees to
1998 levels could raise about $3.8 billion a year. Many Democrats
also support an increase in the upper-end personal income tax
brackets, but any general tax increase will require two-thirds
approval in the Legislature -- and thus the support of some
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Davis must win the votes of at least two Republicans in the Senate
and six in the Assembly for final passage of the 2003-04 budget next
summer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to elementary- school cuts, Davis' proposals would
slash nearly $350 million from the state's community college and
four-year college systems. Those mid-school-year reductions are
expected to translate into the first fee increases in eight years,
along with class cutbacks and other reductions.</TE>
<TE>   The boards of the 23-campus California State University system and
the nine-campus University of California system will hold special
meetings Dec. 16 to consider cuts and fee increases. The fee boosts
would take effect in time for the January term.</TE>
<TE>   CSU undergraduates who are California residents currently pay an
average of $1,926 in annual fees, including systemwide and individual
campus charges.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Board of Regents will be asked to approve a $135 fee
increase for the spring term. Currently, in-state undergraduates pay
an average of $4,408 in fees, including health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   That boost, is expected to yield $19 million. Still, the governor
proposed an additional $74-million in midyear cuts to such areas as
UC's libraries, student services, outreach, cooperative extension and
administrative operations, and some research.</TE>

<HD>President Makes Move to Avoid His Father's Fate</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush's overriding aim in dismissing his Treasury secretary
and top economic aide Friday is to dodge the fate of his father,
whose success at war foundered on a weak economy and a sense among
ordinary Americans their workaday concerns had been overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   In an almost eerie fashion, the arc of Bush's career in the White
House has followed that of the elder President Bush from tepid voter
endorsement to towering popularity for military and foreign policy
successes.</LD>
<LD>   And that's precisely where the current president wants the
parallel to stop, because the elder Bush was never able to translate
battlefield victory into ballot box triumph. He was forced to look on
helplessly as his economic advisors squabbled while a sinking economy
demolished his reelection chances.</LD>
<TE>   A bad economy is the current president's "only vulnerability,"
conservative activist Stephen Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   The abruptness of the president's decision to demand the
resignations of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and economic
advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey conveyed Bush's intent to try to start
anew on economic and domestic policy issues even as the country
appears headed for another war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been grumbling about both men since the
earliest days of the administration and a recent flurry of rumors
that one or the other might go, White House officials such as Bush
political advisor Karl Rove had gone out of their way to squelch talk
of a shake-up. As a result, even administration allies were caught
off-guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told this wasn't going to happen," fumed Grover Norquist,
president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative lobbying group.
"I was working with these guys just a few days ago."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say I am truly mystified why this happened," added
Moore, the president of Club for Growth, a conservative campaign
organization.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery was all the deeper because the White House was thought
to be on the verge of rolling out a new round of tax cuts aimed at
boosting the economy -- a move that it seems will be delayed until
the administration can name replacements for O'Neill and Lindsey.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the aim of the personnel and policy actions is the
same, to get the economy to grow strongly before the 2004 campaign
or, failing that, to make sure the public sees that the president is
making an effort. The White House faces formidable odds on both
counts.</TE>
<TE>   On the policy side, almost every element of the administration's
proposal to surface in recent weeks has involved tax cuts that are
touted as helping businesses and investors, but that many analysts
believe would be ineffective and costly.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, White House officials including R. Glenn Hubbard,
chief of the president's Council of Economic Advisors, have said that
the administration would like to eliminate the so-called "double
taxation" of dividends, the portion of profits firms pay to their
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Tax-cut advocates have long advocated the move, arguing that the
current arrangement unfairly permits the government to take two bites
of the same apple, taxing profits at the corporate level and again
when they are received as dividends by shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has added to the list of benefits, arguing that
the end of double taxation would attract investors back to the stock
market, help push up depressed share prices, revive business
investment and boost growth. Hubbard has gone so far as to suggest
the move would produce a supply-side effect similar to that claimed
by tax-cutters of the early Reagan administration and allow the
government to recoup as much as half the $25-billion cost of the
change.</TE>
<TE>   But independent analysts say that there are two big difficulties
with the administration's case.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that Corporate America's most immediate problem is
not over-taxation, but overcapacity. Companies in a wide swath of
industries have bought more plants and equipment than they know what
to do with, and they are unlikely to buy even more, even with a tax
break. The second is that Washington has already swung from mammoth
surpluses to mammoth deficits at least in part because the
president's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut, and any further tax cuts
would only feed to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   On the personnel side, the departure of O'Neill and Lindsey adds
to the disarray among key economic and regulatory officials in the
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's point man on this year's corporate scandals,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, was
forced to resign after failing to tell the White House or fellow
commissioners that his choice to head a new oversight panel had been
accused of some of the very unsavory practices he was supposed to
root out.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's choice for the accounting oversight panel, former FBI and
CIA Director William H. Webster, also resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Those two departures, plus Friday's resignations, leave Hubbard as
the only prominent member of the Bush economic team still in place.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these problems, Bush appears determined to avoid the
mistakes of his father and push a broad economic agenda even as he
pursues the war on terrorism and on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the big picture," Moore said. "You have an enormously
popular president who's just won a fabulous election against the odds
and is about to fight a war that, if it goes well, will add to his
luster.</TE>
<TE>   "A recession is the only thing that could derail the Bush
locomotive," he added, and the president has signaled he will to do
everything in his power to ensure one does not come between him and
his reelection.</TE>

<HD>Bush Fires His Top Economic Advisors</HD>
<DH>In a clear signal of a more aggressive approach to a

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, President
Bush's two top economic advisors, were forced from their jobs Friday,
the administration's first major shake-up and a clear signal of a
more aggressive White House approach toward a struggling economy.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissals were disclosed just as the stock market was reeling
from the government's announcement that the nation's unemployment
rate took an unexpected jump to 6% in November, up from 5.7% in
October.</LD>
<LD>   With word that O'Neill and Lindsey, head of the White House's
National Economic Council, had been asked to resign, the market
staged a comeback. By day's end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
gained 22.49 points.</LD>
<TE>   But worries about the economy -- and the administration's handling
of it -- were hardly expected to be alleviated by the departures.
Indeed, the resignations underscored long-standing concerns that the
administration's key economic advisors had failed to effectively
grapple with sluggish growth rates and rising joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is keenly aware that economic woes -- and the perception of a
lackadaisical White House response to it -- cost his father
reelection in 1992. He repeatedly has vowed to avoid the same fate.
Overhauling the economic team is seen as a key step to avoid such
criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really the beginning of the focus on the 2004 election,
and [White House officials] felt they needed to burnish their image
as an administration concerned about the economy," said Robert
Hormats, a former senior economic aide in Democratic and Republican
administrations.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, 67, and Lindsey, 48, became "sacrificial lambs," said
Mickey Kantor, Commerce secretary and trade representative in the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also is expected to soon unveil an economic
stimulus package that officials and others have said will call for
accelerating income tax cuts that were to be phased in later this
decade. Another expected proposal would reduce taxes on dividends.</TE>
<TE>   But as he pushes this plan, Bush faces the task of rebuilding
virtually his entire economic team. The White House has yet to
replace Harvey L. Pitt, who resigned recently as chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, O'Neill's hand-picked
deputy secretary, Kenneth Dam, was considered likely to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Secretary Don Evans, a close friend of Bush, was
considered one of the most likely choices to replace O'Neill. Others
whose names surfaced Friday were former Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas),
U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, and R. Glenn Hubbard,
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of the Goldman Sachs
investment firm, is the favored candidate for Lindsey's job at the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   While Republicans quietly applauded the changes, Democrats took
advantage of the moves to criticize the administration's economic
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Firing its economic team is an overdue admission by the Bush
administration that its economic policies have failed," said outgoing
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). "However, the
fundamental problem is that this administration has no comprehensive
plan to get the economy back on track." The centerpiece of Bush's
economic policy in his first months in office was the $1.35-trillion,
10-year tax cut that became law in mid-2001. Bush and his GOP
congressional allies have argued that the measure lessened the
effects of a recession that was already underway.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats, pointing to the return of a
multibillion-dollar federal deficit since Bush took office, accuse
the administration of a one-note approach to economic policy. Rep.
Charles B. Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Ways and
Means Committee, echoed that criticism Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just foundering in the darkness of economic deficits that
are getting worse, and we're just talking about [additional] tax
cuts," he said. "They never talk about working people."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, who will replace Daschle as Senate
majority leader when the GOP takes control of the chamber in January,
praised the work of O'Neill and Lindsey. But like most Republicans,
he did not decry their departures.</TE>
<TE>   The dismissals will give the White House "the opportunity to build
a new team that will focus on economic growth and creating American
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The White House had been signaling its displeasure with O'Neill
and Lindsey for several weeks, but neither took the hints that had
been sent their ways. Indeed, O'Neill told a visitor three weeks ago
that he was working on a proposal to overhaul tax laws during the
coming year. And he had said he planned to remain in his post for the
rest of Bush's current term.</TE>
<TE>   But he was told Thursday by Vice President Dick Cheney to hand in
his resignation, said a well-placed Republican with ties to the
administration. Cheney, who worked with O'Neill in the Ford
administration, had been his primary supporter when Bush formed his
Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
added that White House chief of staff Andrew H. Card Jr. reinforced
Cheney's message late Thursday, demanding O'Neill announce his
departure Friday.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill followed through with a terse resignation letter released
Friday morning by the Treasury Department.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, Lindsey's resignation was announced by the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in a written statement, said he appreciated O'Neill's and
Lindsey's contributions to the crafting and implementation of "an
economic agenda that helped to lead the nation out of recession and
back into a period of growth."</TE>
<TE>   He also sent them personal notes, White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said, but did not speak with them.</TE>
<TE>   Bush prides himself on showing his staff the loyalty that he
demands of them -- and his administration has largely exhibited
little of the public backbiting and infighting that scarred his
predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   But loyalty goes only so far.</TE>
<TE>   "This is yet another demonstration that sentiment is not going to
get in the way of their doing what they feel the need to do," both to
govern and to win reelection, a source close to the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   For an administration that since Sept. 11, 2001, has been focused
primarily on national security and foreign policy issues, the
nation's lingering economic woes -- and the political traps they can
present -- have been a troublesome shadow.</TE>
<TE>   The economic team, even before last year's terrorist attacks, has
been considered the administration's weakest element. And O'Neill, a
former CEO of Alcoa, the giant aluminum manufacturer, quickly became
a lightning rod for detractors.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's critics said he lacked the academic depth and political
savvy of his two predecessors in the Clinton administration, Robert
E. Rubin and Lawrence Summers.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't come from the Wall Street-Treasury complex," said Mark
Weisbrot, an economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research, a
liberal think tank. "That made him a bit of an outsider."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill also created more unwanted controversy than any member of
Bush's Cabinet. He angered Congress, spooked Wall Street and
alienated foreign leaders with his blunt and often off-key comments.</TE>
<TE>   When House Republicans assembled their own package of proposed tax
cuts, O'Neill dismissed the effort as legislative "show business."
When securities traders questioned his familiarity with financial
markets, O'Neill said he could master their jobs in about two weeks.
When the government of Brazil was seeking international financial
aid, he said he was afraid much of the money would wind up in Swiss
bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after taking office, he indicated a distaste for
programs that have become politically sacrosanct, such as Social
Security. "Able-bodied adults should save enough on a regular basis
so that they can provide for their own retirement and, for that
matter, for their health and medical needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And, in a moment of supremely unfortunate timing, he was on a
lengthy trip to Africa in May, accompanied by rock singer Bono, as
corporate integrity issues reached scandal proportions and shook the
confidence of U.S. investors.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey had been Bush's chief economic policy advisor during the
2000 presidential campaign and, before that, a member of the Federal
Reserve Board during much of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   With an office in the White House, he was less in the public eye
than O'Neill. But he drew complaints within the administration for
not mastering the demands of running a staff dealing with sensitive
and politically crucial issues.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, said a Republican close to the current White House
staff, Lindsey had been largely pushed aside, and much of his role
was being performed by deputy White House chief of staff Joshua
Bolton.</TE>
<TE>   Suggestions that changes were due for Bush's economic team have
circulated in Washington and on Wall Street since summer, but the
autumn political campaign dictated delay.</TE>
<TE>   "These kinds of things normally do not happen prior to an
election. But once an election is held, you have a housecleaning and
prepare yourself for the next two years," said Leon E. Panetta, one
of President Clinton's chiefs of staff.</TE>

<HD>Far-Right Party Faces Ban as Its Message Resonates</HD>
<DH>Schroeder sees extinction of the extremist group as
'political hygiene.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>On the shabby fringes of this city, a police officer guards a yellow
house. A charred, firebombed car sits in the yard and, as the front
door opens, buzzers moan and metal gates click. Security is tight.
This makes the husky man inside feel safe as he ponders the future of
Germany's far-right political voice for skinheads, old Nazis and
angry working-class men.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had problems," said Udo Voigt, president of the National
Democratic Party, formed in the 1960s from the ideological ruins of
the Third Reich.</LD>
<LD>   Vandals and arsonists are constant threats. But the most pressing
dilemma for the 6,500-member party, known as the NPD, is a lawsuit
filed by the federal government to disband it. Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Parliament want to silence what they regard as
NPD-inspired hate and violence that target foreigners and stain
Germany's troubled quest to atone for the Holocaust.</LD>
<TE>   Filed two years ago in the Constitutional Court, the suit should
have been decided this summer. But the Interior Ministry's bungling
use of paid informants within the ranks of the NPD could jeopardize
the case.</TE>
<TE>   The NPD says the informers were manipulated by government agents
to exaggerate the party's threat. The court is expected to rule soon
on whether a fair trial is possible without disclosing informers'
identities and how they operated.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become a real struggle," said one government official,
who asked not to be identified. "Most people believe there's a 50-50
chance we'll lose this case. It's an irony of this society that NPD
offices have police out front and so do Jewish synagogues."</TE>
<TE>   Losing the case, which has been criticized by some as a
heavy-handed attack on free speech and democracy, would embarrass
Schroeder. After a spate of right-wing violence and immigrant murders
in 1999 and 2000, the chancellor called for an "uprising of the
upright." He said outlawing the NPD, which had gradually allied
itself with a younger generation of skinheads and neo-Nazis from
eastern Germany, would be an act of "political hygiene."</TE>
<TE>   As the case sits unresolved, recent polls suggest that this nation
of 83 million is again witnessing strong and, on some issues, growing
anti-Semitism and prejudice against immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   To an increasing degree, anti-Semitism is rooted in disdain for
Israeli military crackdowns on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. During Germany's federal election campaign in September,
Juergen Moellemann, former deputy chairman of the Free Democratic
Party, tried to attract far-right voters by making what were widely
seen as veiled anti-Semitic comments. He also supported a fellow
politician who characterized Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as
using "Nazi methods" to battle Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Moellemann's tactics troubled the establishment because they
emerged from a mainstream organization. Some, however, believe he and
others expressing similar views were turned into scapegoats for
raising legitimate criticisms of Israeli policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always the Jews," said Horst Mahler, a longtime leftist
turned right-wing sympathizer and lawyer for the NPD. "They define
who is an anti-Semite. If they say when you criticize Sharon and
what's going on in Palestine, you're an anti-Semite, then I say, 'Yes
I am.' But what does it mean?"</TE>
<TE>   The wider problem of anti-Semitism and xenophobia emanates from
German fears of unemployment, a collapsed economy and the perceptions
that foreigners are exploiting the welfare state and that Germany's
pride and identity are melting away in a world of increased
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   These elements have been around for years, but they have acquired
an urgency as neo-Nazis and nationalists confront a government they
view as too apologetic for sins of the past.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll published last month, 22% of respondents said Jews have
too much influence on society, 17% said they are partly responsible
for anti-Semitism and 52% said they take advantage of Germany's guilt
over World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, by the Institute of Conflict Research at Bielefeld
University, also found that 52% of men and 58% of women said the
nation has too many foreigners, and 24% of men and 31% of women
believed foreigners should be deported in times of high unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   During the naming recently of a Berlin street in honor of Jews, a
small crowd began chanting, "Jews go home!" Hate mail to prominent
Jews is on the rise, according to Jewish groups. Calling it a
"document of hate," the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung refused to
publish excerpts of Martin Walser's popular German novel "Death of a
Critic," in which a writer fantasizes about the demise of his Jewish
nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no thresholds of restraint anymore," Wolfgang Benz, a
scholar on anti-Semitism, wrote recently in the Berliner Zeitung.
Many Germans are "reaching into the box of prejudice.... People used
to privately degrade Jews in the back rooms of pubs. Today, they
defame them in public with no inhibitions."</TE>
<TE>   "People feel more emboldened to express anti-Semitic attitudes,"
said Deidre Berger, managing director of the American Jewish
Committee office in Berlin. "It has to do with the repositioning of
Germany within Europe. Without the Cold War, a lot of mental barriers
have fallen."</TE>
<TE>   Parliament is attempting to diffuse hate. In May, it issued a
tough report designed to curb discrimination and anti-Semitism. The
government last month awarded the Central Council of German Jews the
same legal status as Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. This
will triple the amount of funding to Jewish schools and institutions
to $3 million a year. It is a recognition of Germany's growing Jewish
population, which has jumped from 30,000 in 1990 to about 100,000
today.</TE>
<TE>   The harsh denunciations of Moellemann's comments also show,
according to politicians and sociologists, that although
anti-Semitism might creep into discourse, it will quickly be
rejected. For the last decade, German leaders have kept the country
mindful of its past but have not allowed that to become an impediment
to the nation's ascension on the world stage.</TE>
<TE>   "A political party that uses the anti-Semitic ticket cannot
survive," said Hajo Funke, author of "Paranoia and Politics:
Right-Wing Extremism in the Berlin Republic." "The majority of
mainstream Germans don't want anything to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   The NPD, however, occupies the angry edges of politics. The party,
which in 1969 received its best electoral showing with 4.3% of the
vote, has been searching for regeneration as its old guard dies out.
In recent years, the party has mastered the Internet. It has embraced
young, often violent neo-Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   "The young feel hopeless," said Voigt, the party president,
speaking methodically over coffee amid binders of court documents.
"We tell them you don't have to accept this fate. They are the
victims of capitalism, and our present government is in collaboration
with Western allies. Our government bows to the U.S. We have a huge
foreign population. We are against interracial marriage. Our genes
will be changed. Our German virtues will be destroyed. We have to
repair the reeducation done to our people after the war. They tried
to strip us of our dignity. They told the young they were children of
criminals."</TE>
<TE>   The attempt to ban the NPD, Voigt said, reveals the government's
fear that the party's beliefs are held -- even if privately -- by a
growing number of Germans. In recent elections in two states, the NPD
received more than 20% of the ballots from first-time voters.
Nationwide, however, the party received about 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Voigt's dual strategy is to gain in the polls and to "fight to win
the street" in a bid to benefit from the dozens of demonstrations
held each year by neo-Nazis and skinheads.</TE>
<TE>   The NPD's platform -- including a plan to deport foreigners --
coincided with two shifts in society: the rising anger of unemployed,
xenophobic youths from eastern Germany and debates over anti-Semitism
and the nation's atonement for crimes against Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing violence also increased, especially in the east, where
unemployment is 20%. In 1998, according to Germany's Office to
Protect the Constitution, police investigated 708 violent hate
crimes. That figure rose to 746 in 1999 and jumped to 998 in 2000.
One of the most shocking cases occurred in Guben in 1999, when thugs
drove an Algerian asylum-seeker through a glass door and drank beer
while he bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   Public pressure reduced the number of cases to more than 700 last
year, but the Interior Ministry said it was disturbed by a sharp rise
in hard-core neo-Nazi groups' membership from 2,200 to 2,800.
Violence figures are expected to rise this year.</TE>
<TE>   Voigt estimates that the government has at least 30 informers
working in party offices across the country. He said the government
pressures its "spies" to exacerbate violence and anti-Semitism in a
bid to win public support for outlawing the party. The Interior
Ministry denies the allegation. But the government often quotes the
writings and cites the actions of NPD members doubling as informers.</TE>
<TE>   One is Wolfgang Frenz, whose 1998 book included lines such as "If
there would not have been an Auschwitz, it should be invented for the
Jews of today."</TE>
<TE>   Voigt said he doesn't preach violence or hate.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell the young ones that any baseball bat against a foreigner
is a kick against Germany," he said. "There are tens of thousands of
skinheads in Germany. We can't ignore them. We didn't make the
skinheads; this country produced them."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DUEKOUE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>French troops have discovered a mass grave in rebel-held territory in
central Ivory Coast, a French army spokesman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The grave -- 30 yards by 2 yards -- was found Thursday afternoon
northwest of the town of Daloa, French Lt. Col. Ange-Antoine Leccia
said.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not know how many bodies are there, who killed these people
or when," he said. "It is not our mission to exhume the bodies, and
we are simply reporting what we have found."</LD>
<TE>   The site is near the scene of clashes recently between rebels and
loyalist forces. Government helicopter gunships have strafed villages
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for President Laurent Gbagbo said he had few details
about the grave but blamed the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has been informed, and he is profoundly shocked by
this macabre discovery," Toussaint Alain said. "This can only be a
crime committed by the rebellion."</TE>
<TE>   France has sent a 1,000-strong force to its former colony to
protect foreigners.</TE>

<DL>QUITO, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>Ecuador has arrested a U.S. Embassy attache in the fatal shooting of
a motorist and asked Washington to revoke his diplomatic immunity
from prosecution, government officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Peter Karmilowicz, identified as a civil attache by the
U.S. Embassy in Quito, the capital, is accused of killing Ecuadorean
Pablo Vicente Jaramillo in a road-rage incident early Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Karmilowicz's car lightly collided with a taxi
carrying Jaramillo.</LD>
<TE>   The Ecuadorean apparently got out of the taxicab to protest the
crash, and Karmilowicz allegedly shot him in the chest.</TE>

<HD>Raid on Gaza Camp Leaves Anger Behind</HD>
<DH>Israel says nearly all 10 killed in firefight were
militants. Palestinians contend most were bystanders. A teacher was
among them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BUREIJ REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip -- The simple home where elementary
school teacher Ahlam Kandeel lived with her husband and three
children was a house of mourning Friday, filled with women weeping
over her death in an Israeli army raid on this crowded Palestinian
refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   Kandeel, 31, who taught mathematics in a United
Nations-administered school, was one of 10 Palestinians killed when
the camp became a battleground before dawn Friday, in a three-hour
confrontation that pitted Israeli troops, tanks and helicopter
gunships against Palestinian gunmen who poured withering fire on the
Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 24 hours later, the two sides were locked in bitter
argument over the nature of the casualties in the Bureij camp, an
enclave of rutted, sandy streets and close-packed cinderblock houses
in the central Gaza Strip that is home to about 30,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli army said that nearly all those killed were
gun-wielding combatants; Palestinian officials insisted that most
were innocents caught in the cross-fire.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case in the ongoing conflict here, the truth
probably lies somewhere between the two versions of events.</TE>
<TE>   Kandeel was the only woman among the dead. The others were all men
in their 20s and 30s. One of them, Osama Tahrawi, worked for the U.N.
refugee agency as a janitor.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, the militant group Hamas claimed six of
the dead as its own, and a list later carried by Lebanon's Al-Manara
TV station included the names of Kandeel and Tahrawi. However, Hamas
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority are
feuding, and Hamas might have wished to enhance its prestige by
claiming an affiliation with more of the confrontation's victims.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the men killed were identified by the Palestinians as
policemen. Ten other people were injured, including an 11-year-old
girl.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the raid typified the grinding urban warfare that
has become a routine feature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in
recent months.</TE>
<TE>   All over the West Bank and Gaza, Israel has been mounting
lightning strikes, usually carried out in the dead of night, on
Palestinian cities, towns and refugee camps, generally targeting only
a few fugitive militants, or even a lone wanted man.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army describes the operations as "pinpoint" strikes,
and sometimes soldiers do manage to capture or kill their quarry
without encountering resistance or harming anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened in Bureij was a graphic illustration of how
difficult it is for Palestinian civilians living in crowded
neighborhoods to stay out of harm's way when fighting breaks out on
their doorsteps, with both sides using weapons designed for the
battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said that in Friday's firefight, Palestinians employed
antitank missiles and assault rifles; the army used tank shells and
helicopter-fired missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Coming as it did on the first morning of the celebratory feast of
Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan,
the raid provoked an outpouring of Palestinian fury. Arafat, speaking
to journalists in the West Bank city of Ramallah, called it a
massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army spokeswoman Capt. Sharon Feingold defended the timing
of the strike.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't respect our holidays," she said, referring to attacks
on Jewish holy days by Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have the intelligence we need to move, we do so."</TE>
<TE>   As is always the case when Palestinians die in confrontations with
Israeli soldiers, funeral observances  had martial overtones.</TE>
<TE>   Large contingents of armed, masked militants marched among tens of
thousands of mourners who packed the camp's narrow streets, waving
green Hamas flags, hailing the dead as martyrs to the Palestinian
cause and vowing revenge on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Displays of private and personal grief were reserved for later, at
family gatherings. At Kandeel's house, men congregated in a mourning
tent set up outside, while the women were sequestered indoors,
according to tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a kind and friendly person, loved by everyone," said the
dead woman's tearful mother-in-law, Fatima Kandeel. Weeping sisters
described how Kandeel had been a surrogate mother to her own siblings
after their mother died.</TE>
<TE>   Kandeel, her husband, Mohammed, and their three children -- two
boys, 4 and 2, and a 7-month-old girl -- lived on the top floor of
the four-story family home.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, 33-year-old Mohammed Kandeel walked through the
apartment for the first time since the chaotic hours before dawn,
sobbing as he saw a trail of bloody footprints on the  tile floor,
left by his wife after bullets shattered a window and struck her in
the head and chest.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't clean them up, these footprints," Kandeel begged the women
of his family. "They are all that I have left of her."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli troops had been hunting Palestinian militant Ayman
Shasniyeh, who the army said had helped engineer a roadside bomb that
blew up an Israeli Merkava battle tank in March, killing three
soldiers. They failed to find him but demolished his home with
explosives after ordering his wife and three children outside.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Gives N. Korea Provisos on Food Aid</HD>
<DH>Continued assistance, Washington says, will depend on
monitors' viewing restricted areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States is imposing restrictions on food aid to North Korea
for the first time since deliveries began during the famine that
struck the country in the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement Friday came two months after North Korea informed
the United States that it was developing uranium-based nuclear
weapons, despite a 1994 U.S.-North Korean agreement that it would
halt atomic arms programs.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials insisted that the North Korean disclosure
did not influence the decision to impose conditions on food
deliveries.</LD>
<TE>   The United States has been the largest food donor to North Korea
this year, delivering 170,000 tons.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokeswoman Jo-Anne Prokopowicz said the United
States has informed North Korea that any additional food aid this
year will depend on its improving access by international monitors to
areas where donated food is delivered.</TE>
<TE>   She said the North had not responded to the U.S. request. She
added that the United States would consider a World Food Program
appeal for food donations in 2003 based on the availability of U.S.
food stocks, need, competing needs elsewhere and ability to monitor
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said a major U.S. concern is the lack of
access by World Food Program monitors to large swaths of North Korean
territory. This prevents monitors from ensuring that the assistance
is delivered to the intended recipients.</TE>
<TE>   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said
nongovernmental organizations based in Pyongyang, the capital, have
become increasingly disillusioned with the restrictions they face.</TE>
<TE>   Some have left the country. Others complain that the North Koreans
have charged them tens of thousands of dollars to set up offices, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They added that the North's food needs remain substantial but are
about half what they were during the famine of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Other donors, including Japan, are cutting back on food assistance
to North Korea. Japan is seeking concessions from North Korea in its
conflict with Pyongyang over Japanese citizens kidnapped decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Corsino, WFP country director for North Korea, said this week
that there has been a sharp drop-off in food donations since
September.</TE>
<TE>   He said the WFP is urging the international community to
contribute $201 million in food deliveries to North Korea in 2003.</TE>

<HD>Iranian Oil Vessel Rams Intercepting U.S. Destroyer</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An Iranian oil vessel collided with a U.S. Navy destroyer Friday in
the northern Persian Gulf, punching a 2-foot hole in the destroyer's
side but causing no injuries, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The destroyer Paul Hamilton was in no danger and continued
operating afterward, the officials said. The gash in the hull was
above the water line.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. ship was attempting to conduct a maritime intercept of
the Iranian ship when the collision occurred. In such an intercept,
the U.S. ship would have approached the targeted ship to communicate
with and possibly to board it. Details in this case were sketchy, but
officials said no hostile intent was apparent.</LD>
<TE>   There was no immediate word on the condition of the Iranian ship,
which was described as an oil vessel but not a tanker.</TE>

<HD>Witness ID'd as Ex-Ally of Milosevic</HD>
<DH>Former Croatian Serb leader has spent three weeks
testifying at old crony's war crimes trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Judges at Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes trial revealed Friday that
a secret witness testifying against the former Yugoslav president is
Milan Babic, once one of his key allies.</LD>
<LD>   Babic allowed his name to be released after three weeks on the
witness stand. His lawyer said he had decided to contribute to
reconciliation in the Balkans.</LD>
<LD>   Before Friday, the court had referred to Babic as Witness C-61 and
forbidden publication of his name, though his identity was widely
known in the Balkans. Most of his evidence was given behind closed
doors, and his voice and image were distorted.</LD>
<TE>   Babic, 46, trained as a dentist, was a ranking Croatian Serb
leader when the Serbian minority revolted after Croatia broke away
from Yugoslavia in 1991. He served as president of Croatia's
self-declared rebel Serb republic of Krajina.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is accused of providing Krajina Serbs with money and
military support in a campaign to remove non-Serbs from Croatia's
coast. Babic was later ousted as Krajina's leader, at Milosevic's
urging.</TE>
<TE>   During a war that lasted until 1995, Croatian Serb forces seized
parts of the country with the backing of the Yugoslav army.</TE>
<TE>   Babic testified earlier that Milosevic, who was president of
Serbia in the early 1990s, played a key political and military role
behind the scenes in Croatia, despite Milosevic's denials.</TE>
<TE>   The two crossed swords during cross-examination Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Milosevic, in 1991 you waged a horrific war," Babic said in
response to Milosevic's questioning. "You dragged the Serbian people
into that war.... You brought misfortune on the Croatian people, upon
the Muslim people."</TE>

<HD>EU Agrees to Ban on Tankers</HD>
<DH>Single-hull vessels with dangerous cargos are to be kept
out of union's waters by 'safety zones.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>European Union nations agreed Friday to ban single-hull tankers
carrying heavy fuel oil in their waters, in an effort to prevent
disasters like the devastating oil spill off the coast of Spain last
month.</LD>
<LD>   The ban will come into force in January as part of a package of
measures rushed through by EU transport ministers after the Prestige
oil tanker cracked, spilling millions of gallons of fuel oil onto
Spain's beaches. It then broke into two pieces and sank.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to avoid these ecological bombs being able to sail in our
waters," EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio of Spain said.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to heavy fuel oil, the immediate ban covers
single-hull carriers of tar, bitumen and heavy crude. The 15 EU
nations also plan a total ban on single-hull vessels more than 15
years old. That ban is likely to come into force in 2010, De Palacio
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the EU plans to set up "safety zones" aimed at
keeping out dangerous ships and to introduce a $1-billion fund to
help areas stricken by oil slicks.</TE>
<TE>   The EU also declared its ports immediately off limits to 66 ships
listed as particularly dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known how effective that will be. A Spanish research
institute, Home of the Employed Foundation, said that more than 50
blacklisted cargo ships had entered Spanish ports over the previous
10 days despite pledges to keep them out.</TE>
<TE>   De Palacio brushed aside fears from the Netherlands that the ban
on single-hull vessels could jeopardize fuel supplies, saying 50% of
tankers worldwide already have double hulls and that the percentage
is growing.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Independent Tanker Owners said the ban
would distort shipping markets but would not cause widespread
disruption, as any shortfall would be made up by modern double-hull
vessels.</TE>
<TE>   The Prestige spill has tarred about 180 beaches on Spain's coast.
It also threatens the Portuguese and French coastlines.</TE>

<HD>Torture Common in Uzbekistan's Prisons, U.N. Envoy Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TASHKENT, Uzbekistan</DL>
<LD>A U.N. envoy wrapped up a two-week inspection of Uzbekistan's prisons
Friday by saying he found widespread signs of torture, even though he
was denied full access to two of the country's most notorious jails.</LD>
<LD>   "Torture, as far as I can see, it is my impression, is not just
incidental but ... is systemic," Theo van Boven told a news briefing.
There was no immediate reaction from President Islam Karimov's
government.</LD>
<LD>   Van Boven, who was allowed to visit Uzbekistan only after intense
Western pressure, was denied access to the jail at the National
Security Service, the country's intelligence agency, and was given
only two hours for his visit to remote Zhaslyk prison in northwestern
Uzbekistan -- far shorter than the six he had requested.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he visited six facilities and interviewed dozens of
torture victims, members of their families and other relatives. He
said the forms of torture used by authorities included beatings,
electric shocks, immersion of the victim's head in water and
suffocation with plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   Van Boven said he found that families and relatives of those
arrested often were threatened with torture and rape.</TE>

<DH>Cloning has produced five copies of a prize bull. Owners of
elite livestock foresee major profit, and the FDA may approve the
enterprise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CANUTE, Okla.</DL>
<LD>In the world of big-money cattle exhibitions, Full Flush is a
celebrity.</LD>
<LD>   He has the wide rump, the meaty back and long neck that send
cattle judges swooning. Like a bovine teen idol, his jowly face
stares out from the catalogs studied by 4-H kids and professional
breeders. Many of his 35,000 calves have won state fairs and national
stock shows.</LD>
<LD>   But in one important way, Full Flush is not living up to his
potential. When it comes to producing semen for sale, the big bull
"doesn't have much of a drive in him," says his owner, Dean Kephart.
"He's just not that romantic."</LD>
<TE>   Kephart has sold nearly $2 million in Full Flush semen since 1995,
mostly to farm families hoping to breed the next show champion. But
he could sell much more. So last year he turned to the latest in
cattle technology: He had Full Flush cloned.</TE>
<TE>   Today, five genetic copies of Full Flush trot around Kephart's
dusty Oklahoma pasture. As only the latest of 300 cloned cattle
worldwide, their birth last fall was not big news. And yet, these
clones now grazing here, on a working farm far from any high-tech
laboratory, may be groundbreaking: They may soon be able to make
money.</TE>
<TE>   Created for $50,000, the young bulls are an unmistakable sign that
cloning is no longer a scientific oddity, instead poised to become a
real business.</TE>
<TE>   "To us, a $50,000 cloning bill looks pretty reasonable," said Don
Coover, a Kansas semen broker who hopes to market semen from the
clones. "We ... sure intend to turn a profit."</TE>
<TE>   Across the Farm Belt, cloning is steadily drawing interest as a
way to preserve the traits of elite animals. Already in the pen are
copies of Starlight, a Texas Longhorn with world-record horns; of
Zita, once the top milk producer among Holsteins; and KC, born in
essence from a piece of meat -- a cow that was slaughtered before its
cells were culled for cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Now two sets of players are grappling with decisions that could
determine whether cloning goes beyond the small circle of champion
animals.</TE>
<TE>   One is the Food and Drug Administration, which bars the sale of
meat, milk and other products from cloned animals while it studies
effects on the food supply. Because even top show livestock wind up
on dinner plates, the agency has so far stopped Kephart and others
from selling cloned animals' semen.</TE>
<TE>   But the FDA could start to approve cloned products for sale within
months. In theory, the agency says, cloned foods should be identical
to non-cloned products, and equally safe to eat. By Jan. 1, the FDA
hopes to tell producers what data they must supply for each cloned
product to win marketing approval.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, cloning has touched off a roiling debate among
the breed associations and clubs that control animal shows and
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Many breeders consider themselves artists, working with genes
instead of paints. Their goal is to produce something beautiful, an
animal that looks or behaves better than anything seen before. Some
argue that cloning reduces the art to mere photocopying.</TE>
<TE>   "You're filled with anticipation when you put two animals
together," said Kenneth Downing of Tonganoxie, Kan., president of the
German Shepherd Dog Club of America Inc. "You hope you've made the
right match ... and you've used all the knowledge that you've
gathered over the years about what lines work together.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning takes all that away," he said. "You know what you're
going to get: an almost identical copy."</TE>
<TE>   "How can you allow these animals in a show?" asked Fred Nessler, a
Springfield, Ill., lawyer and board president of the Maine-Anjou
cattle breed association. "I mean, they aren't a bred animal. They're
a copied animal."</TE>
<TE>   But if a champion animal is built from champion genes, why not let
everyone work with the best materials? That's where cloning can come
in, advocates say, not necessarily to produce cloned animals for
show, but to make the semen and eggs of top animals more widely
available to breeders, who would continue to combine them in new
ways.</TE>
<TE>   Kephart says cloning will allow him to cut the price of Full Flush
semen in half and sell it more widely. Mixing it with eggs, breeders
would still spin the genetic roulette wheel each time they produced a
new animal.</TE>
<TE>   So far, clubs devoted to companion animals have rejected this
reasoning. Even before the first cloned horse or dog arrives, the
Jockey Club has barred cloned thoroughbreds from racing, and the
American Kennel Club has excluded cloned dogs from its shows.</TE>
<TE>   The first cat was cloned this year, but Cat Fanciers' Assn., the
largest cat registry, says the copied kitten would not be welcome in
its most elite competitions.</TE>
<TE>   The picture is far different in the livestock world. At least
eight of the 20 or so associations of cattle breeds have agreed to
register clones.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are pretty open-minded about this stuff, because it's
not completely new to them," said Tyrone Hullinger, a Harris, Mo.,
breeder. He said ranchers already routinely use artificial
insemination to breed cattle.</TE>
<TE>   The big hurdle, he said, is that people still want proof that a
cloned offspring is truly identical to its parent. "I remain a little
bit skeptical," Hullinger said.</TE>
<TE>   At Kephart's ranch, a flat and treeless expanse west of Oklahoma
City, cloning appears to live up to its billing as the breeders
copying machine.</TE>
<TE>   Five jet-black bulls, handily named Full Flush 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5,
frolicked one recent day like overgrown sheep, nosing each other
aside for the chance to chew on Kephart's beefy hand.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's incredible that every one of them has the same face
and head," said Kephart, 45, a tank of a man in a baseball cap, worn
T-shirt and ratty tennis shoes. "Their tail sets into the butt in the
same way. Their bones are all the same." The only difference among
the clones, Kephart claimed, is that one is somewhat smaller because
of an illness shortly after birth.</TE>
<TE>   Kephart grew up in Canute (population 524), on a ranch that
produced cattle for the beef industry. Like many farm kids, he got
into cattle breeding as part of the "club calf" circuit, a series of
events run by 4-H and other organizations that aim to teach good
animal care.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Kephart's office is full of photographs and trophies from
years of exhibitions as he talks about breeding. What if we put
Heatseeker into that cow from last year? Should we use some of that
old Jetliner semen?</TE>
<TE>   "People started following what he was doing, because he was
winning everything," said Christy Collins, a livestock marketer from
Oklahoma City. "Today, a lot of people are still trying to follow his
breeding program because he is so successful."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just something where you get a feeling," Kephart said
modestly. "We take long necks and big butts and put them together to
get something better than the past was."</TE>
<TE>   During Kephart's career, the club calf circuit became big
business, though it is still a tiny part of the beef industry. Just
as some parents hire private Little League coaches for their kids,
farm families are increasingly willing to pay high prices so that
their children have a solid calf to raise as part of a 4-H project.</TE>
<TE>   Cattlemen and adult hobbyists have also gotten more aggressive in
competing at the biggest stock shows.  "When you have champion steers
selling for $50,000 and $60,000 -- the champion at Houston has sold
for $500,000 -- then it gets very competitive," said J. Willard
Lemaster, an animal education specialist at the University of
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the cattle exhibition world has its stars -- animals who have
a proven record of making winners. Bulls such as Draft Pick, Sugar
Ray and Full Flush command top dollar. U.S. semen sales top $200
million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Don Coover, of Galesburg, Kan., had that demand in mind when he
learned about cattle cloning at a lecture three years ago. A West
Point graduate and veterinarian, Coover markets semen for a variety
of breeders through his company, SEK Genetics/Genetic Horizons. He
started to research cloning and eventually brought an idea to
Kephart: They would clone Full Flush to boost their supply.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, build me 10 of them," Kephart said. He did not believe it
would work.</TE>
<TE>   Coover took some skin cells from Full Flush's ear and gave them to
Cyagra of Worcester, Mass., one of several small companies that offer
commercial cloning services.</TE>
<TE>   Full Flush's cells, which carried the bull's DNA, were inserted
into cow eggs that had been stripped of their own genetic material.
Then, the eggs were induced to divide. The resulting embryos had
genes only from Full Flush, instead of from the traditional cow and
bull.</TE>
<TE>   By transferring the embryos to surrogate mothers, Cyagra produced
five clones for $10,000 apiece. "We'd like to think we can get more
efficient, to where in five years it will be $5,000," said Ron
Gillespie, a Cyagra vice president.</TE>
<TE>   If the price drops enough, Coover and Gillespie say, cloning could
have a big impact in the beef industry, a far larger business than
the club calf circuit. They say cloning would offer two advantages.</TE>
<TE>   First, it would bring more uniformity to a cattle herd. Today,
variations from one animal to the next create problems for feed-lot
operators and slaughterhouses. One animal might need six months of
grazing and four months of grain feeding to reach slaughtering
weight, while the next might need five months of each.</TE>
<TE>   In the poultry industry, by contrast, centralized breeding by a
few large companies has created birds that grow at more uniform
rates.</TE>
<TE>   A flock destined for fast-food outlets will consist entirely of
5-pound birds, with only a few ounces of variation, said Richard Lobb
of the National Chicken Council. That makes it easy to automate the
equipment that kills and cleans the birds. And the end product is
consistent in weight and quality, something that grocers and
fast-food outlets demand.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning, its advocates say, could create more consistent cattle
herds by producing genetically identical bulls to service a rancher's
cows.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning might also make the work of the rancher easier.</TE>
<TE>   Breeding season, which comes twice a year, is exhausting for
Kephart. Full Flush can service some of his 700 cows, but the rancher
uses artificial insemination so that the rest produce good calves.</TE>
<TE>   Riding horses or all-terrain vehicles, Kephart and his two helpers
patrol the 7,500-acre ranch to find out which cows are in heat. Then
they have to pen the cows, thaw the straws of semen and inseminate
the animals with a catheter. Afterward, they have to monitor the cows
so they can try again with those that failed to become pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   The process takes more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   "This is seven days a week, and a person wants to take off once in
a while," Kephart said. "I love what I do, but the hours can really
catch you."</TE>
<TE>   With a few more versions of Full Flush, Kephart would merely turn
the bulls out to pasture and let them handle all the cows. "That
would be a pretty big deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have a more disturbing vision. A herd of identical
bulls mating with identical cows, they say, would leave the breed
without the diversity needed to withstand disease.</TE>
<TE>   Some also believe consumers are squeamish about cloning and might
be scared off the beef.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, I think it would sound the death knell for the family
ranch," the Maine-Anjou group's Nessler said. "It isn't a very hard
stretch to believe that large industries would say, 'Why do I need to
buy a bull from rancher Jones? I'll simply clone as many of these as
I need.' "</TE>
<TE>   But some ranchers are eager to try cloning, even before the FDA
allows them to sell what they create. Others are preserving cells
from their most valuable animals, at about $1,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, saving cells is a kind of insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Buck White learned that the hard way. The Sterling, Okla.,
cattleman and a partner owned a bull named Icepick, who was a popular
sire of club calves. "He was selling real good," White said. "It was
like winning the lottery in the cattle business."</TE>
<TE>   Coover tried to persuade White to save some cells from the bull,
but White never did. Then in August, disaster struck while Icepick

<TE>   "The neighbor's bull broke through the fence and whooped him mean,
tore him up pretty good," White recalled. "We took him to the vet to
try to save him, but they couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Icepick was dead when the veterinarian culled some cells from the
animal's ear. Today, those cells have been passed to Cyagra, and
White and his partner hope to be selling semen one day from an
Icepick clone. They have already established several pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just a little old cowboy in the cow trade in the middle of
nowhere, and look at all this," White mused.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's crazy, really. It's almost unreal."</TE>

<HD>Chechen Rebel Envoy Posts Bail</HD>
<DH>Britain had arrested Ahmed Zakayev at Moscow's request.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain released a Chechen rebel envoy from police custody Friday,
drawing sharp criticism from Russia, which compared the man to Osama
bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Acting on a request from Moscow, which is waging a lengthy war
against separatists in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya,
British police arrested Ahmed Zakayev when he arrived at London's
Heathrow Airport from Denmark on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   British police freed Zakayev on $78,500 bail early Friday,
ordering him to attend an extradition hearing Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Moscow was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "What if another terrorist had come to London -- Bin Laden, who,
like Zakayev, is under an international search?" asked Russian
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, who was in Portugal for a meeting of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "And if Bin Laden had said new terrorist acts were being prepared
against civilian targets in the U.S., how would he be dealt with?"
Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   Zakayev has said the only way to prevent militant attacks in
Russia is to hold political talks with rebels on reaching a
settlement to the war in Chechnya. Russian officials say this shows
that rebel leaders are preparing such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But actress Vanessa Redgrave, who posted his bail, said Zakayev --
an aide to Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov and once a key
peace negotiator -- is not a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of those few men that exist on the planet who are
leaders and live for the truth and live to work for peace," she said.</TE>

<HD>EU Is Urged to Move Up Talks on Turkey's Membership Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amberin Zaman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The leader of Turkey's ruling party called on the European Union on
Friday to set early talks on the country's admission to the EU,
instead of the 2005 date proposed by European leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- chairman of the Justice and Development
Party, which won national elections Nov. 3 -- said Turkey has been
"waiting for more than 40 years at Europe's door.... History will not
forgive you. You will have failed the test, and Europe will lose."</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has been courting Turkey, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's sole Muslim member, which is expected
to play a key role if there is a U.S.-led war against Iraq. On
Friday, the State Department backed Turkey's bid for an earlier date
to start talks than the July 2005 plan advanced by France and Germany
the day before.</LD>
<TE>   This week, Turkey tentatively agreed to limited support for action
against Iraq, including opening bases and ports to U.S. forces.
Erdogan is expected to travel to Washington next week to discuss with
President Bush details of Turkey's contribution and whether the U.S.
will supply the country with more financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plan hammered out by French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, EU leaders would meet at the end
of 2004 to evaluate Turkey's progress on democratic and economic
reforms and then start membership talks the following year if the
country was deemed to have performed satisfactorily.</TE>
<TE>   France and Germany have expressed reservations about admitting
Turkey to the EU, where it would become the first Muslim member
nation. The EU's failure to include Turkey on a list of applicants it
has agreed to take in as full members has prompted accusations here
that the union is a Christian club. Last month, former French
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing declared that Turkey's accession
to the EU would "spell the end of Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of Turkey's admission, including Britain, Spain, Italy
and Portugal, argue that in opening its doors to Turkey, Europe would
prove to the broader Muslim world that the West does not consider
Islam and democracy incompatible.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's efforts to join the EU date from the early 1960s, but the
country formally applied for membership only in 1987. It was anointed
as an official candidate by EU leaders 12 years later. An EU summit
in Copenhagen next week will take up the question of a date for
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of his party's landslide at the polls in November,
Erdogan said the new government's priority would be to secure
Turkey's membership in the EU. This week, the government approved a
set of proposed constitutional reforms, including ending the death
penalty and easing bans on teaching and broadcasting in the Kurdish
language. Should the new law be enacted, it would also enable Erdogan
to become prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   A former mayor of Istanbul, Erdogan was barred from running for
parliament because of a prior conviction on charges of seeking to
incite religious hatred when he recited an Islamic poem at a rally.
Under Turkish law, only elected lawmakers can become prime minister.
Abdullah Gul, the deputy chairman of the Justice and Development
Party, assumed the post instead.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it is Erdogan who over the last month has been touring
European capitals, where he has been arguing that Turkey is closer to
meeting the criteria for membership in the EU than the other
candidate countries. He also has declared support for a recently
floated U.N. peace plan to reunite the divided island of Cyprus,
where Turkish forces invaded in 1974 and subsequently set up a
breakaway state in the north. EU leaders had earlier hinted that
Turkey's cooperation in resolving that issue would boost its chances
of getting a firm date for starting membership talks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not the EU takes us in, we are meeting the Copenhagen
criteria to elevate the living standards of our people. That is our
real aim," a defiant Erdogan said Thursday. "We won't stop because
they don't admit us."</TE>

<HD>'Ageless' Annenberg Is Memorialized</HD>
<DH>Philanthropist who died recently is fondly remembered by
former President Ford and Secretary of State Powell, among others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Walter H. Annenberg, the billionaire publishing magnate who died in
October, was remembered Friday as a philanthropist, statesman and a
spontaneous and honest man.</LD>
<LD>   "Walter was ageless," former President Gerald R. Ford said at a
memorial service. "The calendar said Walter Annenberg was 94 when he
passed away. The truth is that Walter was the youngest person I ever
knew."</LD>
<LD>   About 1,000 people crowded Philadelphia's opera house to honor
Annenberg, who donated more than $2 billion to schools, museums,
media groups and other organizations.</LD>
<TE>   People attending the service included former first ladies Barbara
Bush and Nancy Reagan, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, New York
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and broadcaster Barbara Walters.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg died from complications of pneumonia Oct. 1 at his home
in suburban Wynnewood.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg made much of his fortune by introducing TV Guide to
America's living rooms during television's golden age.</TE>
<TE>   He was ambassador to Britain under President Nixon, a noted art
collector and a silent power broker in the Republican Party, as well
as one of its biggest contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg endowed two leading communication schools at USC and the
University of Pennsylvania, and he made massive donations to public
education, including a $500-million program launched in 1993 to
benefit schools nationwide. That year, he also gave $100 million to
the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J., where he was a student from
1920 to 1927.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon's daughter, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, recalled Annenberg as a
compassionate man who brought solace to her father after he resigned
the presidency in August 1974. Annenberg called and told Nixon that
"life is 99 rounds," Eisenhower said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he referred to Walter and Lee Annenberg as "Mom and
Dad," thanking Walter and his wife for their kindness and generosity.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter, I know you're here somewhere," Powell told the packed
auditorium. "I can't tell what seat you're in, but we love you and
thank you."</TE>

<LD>A former U.S. Forest Service employee pleaded guilty Friday to
starting the biggest wildfire in Colorado history, which destroyed
133 homes and cost more than $29 million to contain.</LD>
<LD>   Terry Barton, 38, admitted setting fire to federal land and making
false statements to investigators, in a plea agreement that calls for
a sentence of six years in federal prison, according to court
documents. She would serve five years and one month with time off for
good behavior. Sentencing was set for Feb. 21.</LD>
<LD>   There was no decision on how much Barton should pay in fines or
restitution. Prosecutors claim $38 million in property damage to
federal land, not including private homes and other structures.</LD>
<TE>   Barton, whose job included watching for fires, told investigators
she accidentally started the blaze in June while burning a letter
from her estranged husband in a campfire ring. Authorities believed
she started the fire deliberately.</TE>

<LD>A man who served 16 years of a life sentence for rape was released
from prison after a second DNA test showed he didn't commit the
crime.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great," Gene Bibbins said in New Orleans. "After 16 years,
I feel good."</LD>
<LD>   The conviction of Bibbins remains in place because the test
results are classified as preliminary. Once they are official, the

<LD>A man was found guilty in the weeklong kidnapping and rape of a
teenager he and a female friend had met over the Internet. James
Warren, 42, was convicted on all but two counts in a 65-count
indictment.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Gregg Turkin said he would likely seek consecutive
sentences on all the charges, meaning Warren could face "well into
the 300 years to life range."</LD>
<LD>   Warren and a friend, Beth Loschin, befriended the teenager via the
Internet, then traveled to a mall in Wrentham, Mass., kidnapped her
and took her to Long Island, authorities said.</LD>

<HD>Bulger Silent on His Mobster Brother</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>University of Massachusetts President William Bulger on Friday
refused to tell a congressional panel whether he's been in contact
with his fugitive mobster brother or knows his whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   Bulger, a colorful and influential powerbroker, invoked his 5th
Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer
questions, bringing an abrupt halt to two days of hearings by the
committee investigating the FBI's ties to its mob informants.</LD>
<LD>   "The 5th Amendment's basic function is to protect innocent men who
might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances," Bulger said. "I find
myself in such circumstances."</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the House Committee on
Government Reform, asked Bulger if he had spoken to his brother --
mobster James "Whitey" Bulger -- since 1995, the year Bulger fled
before being indicted on federal corruption charges. Burton also
asked William Bulger if he knew where his brother is.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, who has been implicated in 21 murders, disappeared in
January 1995 after former FBI agent John J. Connolly Jr. told him he
was about to be indicted. Connolly, who grew up in the same
neighborhood as the Bulger brothers, was convicted this year for
tipping off Bulger and other mobsters about indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, 68, testified before a grand jury last year that he talked
with his brother in a prearranged call at a friend's house shortly
after Bulger fled, but maintains he hasn't had contact with him
since.</TE>
<TE>   "If they cannot have one Bulger, we fear they will have another,"
said William Bulger's lawyer, Thomas R. Kiley.</TE>

<HD>Priests May Seek Law's Resignation</HD>
<DH>Angered by more abuse disclosures, the group discusses
whether to ask the Boston cardinal to resign. The move would be
unprecedented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEWTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Dozens of priests from the Archdiocese of Boston discussed Friday
whether to take the unprecedented step of calling for Cardinal
Bernard Law's resignation over his handling of clergy sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The talk capped a week that has seen more disclosures of sexual
abuse by priests in the archdiocese, and of church leaders' attempts
to squelch potential scandal by shuttling clergymen accused of sexual
misconduct from parish to parish.</LD>
<LD>   The public anger over the revelations took on added intensity as
the archdiocese threatened to declare bankruptcy as a way of dealing
with the estimated 450 lawsuits it faces from alleged clergy sexual
abuse victims.</LD>
<TE>   Several individual priests have come forward in recent days urging
Law to resign over his handling of accused pedophile priests. But so
far, no group of priests has publicly asked the senior U.S. prelate
to step down.</TE>
<TE>   That may change in the coming weeks as rank-and-file clergymen,
exasperated by the scandal and its effect on their communities,
openly talk of defying their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a strong feeling among many priests, not just
here, that we need new leadership in the diocese," said Father Walter
Cuenin, pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians Parish in the Boston
suburb of Newton.</TE>
<TE>   At least 35 priests gathered at Cuenin's parish Friday to discuss
the scandal and its effect on a diocesan fund-raising campaign. The
gathering evolved into a discussion about Law's future in the
archdiocese, participants said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of discussion about [Law's future], but there's
no statement or consensus at this point," Cuenin said. "That wasn't
the main issue of the meeting, actually. The main issue was about the
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, which was closed to the press, went ahead despite a
warning from Law earlier in the week banning archdiocesan gatherings
at Cuenin's parish.</TE>
<TE>   Cuenin argued that he and the other priests were not defying Law's
ban because the meeting was not an official archdiocesan gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a meeting among priests. We do whatever we want," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cuenin said the priests decided to draft a statement, which they
plan to send to Law in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   He and other participants declined to specify what the statement
will say.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Pope, chair of the Theology Department at Boston College,
said it would be unprecedented for a group of priests to call for
Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "That would signal open revolt," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Pope noted that several priests had publicly called for a
leadership change at the archdiocese, but so far no group of priests
has formally urged the cardinal to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be understandable if one or two priests did so, but it
would be very interesting if a group did. Priests as a group are
inherently conservative, to say the least," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Father Robert Bullock, who chairs the Boston Priests Forum, the
largest group of priests in the archdiocese, would not rule out the
possibility that his organization may soon call on Law to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is done, it will be done with great deliberation, prayer
and involvement of the membership. It will not be done in a
thoughtless, irresponsible way," Bullock, pastor of Our Lady of
Sorrows Church in Sharon, Mass., said.</TE>
<TE>   "We here in the American Catholic Church are enduring the greatest
crisis American Catholicism has ever known, and the Boston
Archdiocese is at the epicenter of that crisis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Law has not publicly commented on the new revelations since they
were revealed this week. He was expected to take the pulpit at his
weekly Mass on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Energy Papers Suit Put on Hold</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration succeeded Friday in temporarily stopping a
lawsuit seeking documents about Vice President Dick Cheney's energy
task force and its meetings with industry representatives. A federal
appeals court indefinitely delayed Monday's deadline for the White
House to produce the documents or provide a detailed list of evidence
it is withholding.</LD>
<LD>   The two-page order said the court will schedule a date for
arguments in the case. Two private groups, Judicial Watch and the
Sierra Club, have sued, demanding the task force reveal documents
about its meetings with industry representatives in formulating a
plan that calls for expanded oil and gas drilling on public land and
easing regulatory barriers to building nuclear power plants.</LD>
<LD>   The administration has been trying to persuade U.S. District Judge
Emmet G. Sullivan to allow it to appeal an earlier order to produce
the documents. But Sullivan has said the administration has not shown
adequate reason why he should turn the case over to the appeals court
before a final judgment. The government is asking the appeals court
for a writ of mandamus to consider the case.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the General Accounting Office is asking the task force
to publicly release information about its meetings. U.S. District
Judge John Bates is considering the administration's motion to
dismiss the GAO lawsuit as well.</TE>

<HD>Judge Reduces Award in Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday reduced by $1 billion the damage award against
Exxon Mobil Corp. for spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound 13 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Russel Holland reduced the original $5-billion
punitive damages award to $4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   An Alaska jury in 1994 approved the original award in the Exxon
Valdez spill, but the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found it
excessive and sent the case back to Holland.</LD>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil says it will appeal the new figure. "Our position is
no punitive damages are really warranted in this case," said company
spokesman Tom Cirigliano.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Oesting, lead counsel for the roughly 32,000 plaintiffs --
including fishermen, communities, businesses and landowners -- said
he was pleased with the judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He believes $4 billion is an appropriate number, nothing less,"
Oesting said.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil argued that the company was effectively punished and
deterred by the billions it had paid out in cleanup costs,
compensation to hundreds of claimants and government fines.</TE>
<TE>   Holland heard arguments in the case in October. Exxon Mobil
attorneys said "a huge reduction" was required -- under criteria laid
out by the appeals court, no more than $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling flies in the face of the guidelines set by the
appeals court when they sent this case back to Judge Holland," said
Charles Matthews, Exxon Mobil vice president and general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff's liaison attorney said the judge noted the event's
enormity and the company's recklessness, which could have led to
greater damages.</TE>

<HD>$100-Million Gift for JFK Center Expansion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A $100-million gift to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts, the largest in its history, will help build an education center
and a new eight-acre plaza designed to improve access to the center
from downtown Washington, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The plaza, to be built over several freeways that now cut the
Kennedy Center off from downtown, also will contain a new museum of
performing arts. The project is expected to be completed over the
next decade.</LD>
<LD>   The gift from the Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation is the first
major donation to go toward the $650-million project.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the foundation withdrew an offer of $38 million
to the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History. The
Smithsonian's staff complained that Reynolds would have too much
power over a 10,000-square-foot exhibit to have been called "Spirit
of America."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the latest gift, Reynolds called the Kennedy Center
a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy -- a man, she said,
who "believed that the arts are the highest achievements of the
individual and an enduring source of national greatness."</TE>
<TE>   A businesswoman, Reynolds started a financial services company,
then sold it to a bank and set up a charitable foundation valued at
$500 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kennedy Center Plaza Project will forever change the
landscape of Washington, D.C., and of the arts in America," said
James A. Johnson, chairman of the center, in a statement. "And it
takes a donor with courage and foresight to make the initial major
donation for a project of this large a scale."</TE>
<TE>   Last December, the Reynolds foundation gave the Kennedy Center $10
million to finance a 10-year series of programs, starting with
performances by the Russia's Bolshoi Ballet and Opera. This year,
programs included a version of Oscar Hammerstein's "Carmen Jones."</TE>
<TE>   The Kennedy Center stretches along the Potomac River on the edge
of the historic Georgetown neighborhood. It includes an opera house,
concert hall and theaters for drama and film.</TE>

<HD>No Shortage of Candidates, Scenarios</HD>
<DH>New Treasury secretary will not only have to navigate the
political waters of Washington but deliver on Bush's goal of
stimulating the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Thomas Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Who will succeed Paul H. O'Neill and take command of President Bush's
economic program?</LD>
<LD>   Phil Gramm, the recently retired Texas senator and champion of
unfettered free markets? Robert B. Zoellick, Bush's trade
representative and a respected political strategist? Commerce
Secretary Don Evans, an old friend of the president?</LD>
<LD>   With no front-runner emerging, these were among the names floated
Friday in Washington and on Wall Street.</LD>
<TE>   Others tossed out by business and political leaders were those of
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisors; former Texas Rep. Bill Archer; Carla Hills, trade
representative in the first Bush White House; and Gerald Parsky, an
L.A. businessman and Bush's top political operative in California.</TE>
<TE>   Some suggested that Bush may turn to Wall Street, as President
Clinton did in 1994 in tapping Robert E. Rubin, a longtime Goldman
Sachs executive, to replace Lloyd Bentsen when the stock market was
having a down year.</TE>
<TE>   "Trading Bentsen for Rubin was picking somebody with the explicit
backing of Wall Street, and Wall Street loved it," said Vincent
Boberski, strategist and chief economist for RBC Dain Rauscher in
Chicago. After a flat year in 1994, the stock market enjoyed its
strongest five-year rally in history.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst David Gergen, who has advised four presidents and now
teaches at Harvard University, said Bush now must pick someone who
can command the confidence of Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the financial houses knew very little about George W.
Bush and his people," Gergen noted, as Bush did not court Wall Street
as assiduously as most GOP presidential candidates because he was
already flush with private contributions during his 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he reached out to a maverick CEO and an academic," Gergen
said, alluding to O'Neill's past job as chief executive of Alcoa and
former Harvard professor Larry Lindsey, who also resigned Friday as
Bush's economic advisor. "Now he will turn to someone gold-plated."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of the Goldman Sachs
investment firm, is the favored candidate for Lindsey's job at the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   For the O'Neil job, figures from the investment world whose names
were circulating included John M. Hennessy, former CEO of CS First
Boston Inc.; Joseph J. Grano Jr., head of UBS Paine Webber in New
York; and investment counselor Charles Schwab.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard economists Martin S. Feldstein and N. Gregory Mankiw also
were mentioned. Feldstein, President Reagan's top economic advisor,
has long espoused using tax cuts to stimulate the economy, a view
that sits well with the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   White House political director Karl Rove contributed to
speculation that Evans would get the job by making calls last week
suggesting the former Texas oil executive was preparing to move up in
stature, said a source who had talked with Rove.</TE>
<TE>   Other sources advised against putting too much stock in Evans. And
a spokesman for Evans said that his boss "loves his job as secretary
of Commerce."</TE>
<TE>   The new Treasury secretary will not only have to navigate the
politically treacherous waters of Washington but deliver on Bush's
goal of stimulating the economy while cutting taxes and reducing the
government's burgeoning budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The government's chief financial officer also must restore
confidence in the markets shaken by scandals at Enron, WorldCom and
other big companies, while going about the more mundane business of
the Treasury Department, such as manufacturing coins and currency.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to look for people who are expert in the
marketplace, in financial matters, that have the confidence of the
marketplace, a knowledge of government service, and are well versed
in both fields," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Valliere, chief strategist for Schwab Washington Research
Group, said O'Neill's successor needs to be able to "spin the
administration story better than O'Neill did, needs to have a better
feel for global and domestic markets than O'Neill did, and needs to
have solid Republican support on Capitol Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Some suggested that the next secretary should avoid O'Neill's
penchant for off-the-cuff remarks, while others regarded his candor
as refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   "More of his unreserved honesty is needed inside the Beltway,"
said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), new chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Roberts, an economist at Washington University in St.
Louis, said Bush needs to name someone "who's identified with an
idea."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to have skilled people," he said. "You've got to
have people with ideas and who are passionate about those ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Epstein, an economics professor and co-director of the
Political Economy Research Institute at the University of
Massachusetts, said the Bush administration will want a "good bond
salesman: someone who can sell the enormous U.S. debt that will
accumulate as they fight a war against Iraq ... while at the same
time cutting taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said Bush should pick
"someone who can hit the ground running, who's studied the problems
we face."</TE>
<TE>   Rangel said he had no confidence that the administration would
choose a candidate Democrats could embrace. "We haven't heard
anything except, 'Cut corporate taxes,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zoellick, who was among those most prominently mentioned, was a
Treasury Department official during the Reagan administration. He
helped the Bush administration win congressional approval this year
of legislation expanding the White House's authority to negotiate
trade pacts.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm, a onetime economics professor and former chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, recently went to work as vice chairman of
UBS Warburg. He declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said the president needs
"somebody who has a pragmatic grasp about what to do about the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Retiring House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) put to rest
any notion that he was interested in the job. "I'm just leaving the
best job in Washington," he said. "I gave it up for something better:
my wife."</TE>

<DL>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>John Latko, 84, knows this may be the final journey he will make from
his home in Indiana to the place where his ship was sunk by Japanese
fighter planes in 1941.</LD>
<LD>   The 61st anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor was expected to
be a subdued commemoration today. Last year, the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks helped create a flurry of interest that drew thousands to
Hawaii and Pearl Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Latko, a former Marine private, may be one of just 50 Pearl Harbor
survivors who attend today's services. Last year, about 2,500
survivors attended, officials at the USS Arizona Memorial said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm getting old and I move slowly," said Latko of Hammond, Ind.
"I thought I'd come this last time to pay my respects to my fallen
shipmates."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 7, 1941, Latko and his shipmates aboard the West Virginia
were getting ready to enjoy a picnic and a baseball game at the naval
ammunition dump when the surprise attack began.</TE>
<TE>   "As we're waiting on deck, we see a plane coming over,
dive-bombing," he said. "We noticed the red circle on it and then we
realized that there's something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Then, his ship -- about 40 yards from the doomed battleship
Arizona -- was hit; 213 were killed. The attacks killed 2,390 people,
including 1,177 men aboard the Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   A more reserved observance of the anniversary will not diminish
the significance of the day, said Daniel Martinez, a historian for
the USS Arizona Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the type of attack that was so savage that it's just etched
into the memories of Americans," Martinez said. "It's a stain in the
American fabric that's difficult to wash away."</TE>

<HD>Terror Investigators Search Software Firm</HD>
<DH>An alleged Al Qaeda financier invests in the Massachusetts
firm, a government contractor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano and Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>QUINCY, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Federal agents searched a computer software company here that has
contracted with numerous government agencies, seeking to determine
whether any classified material made it into the hands of one of the
firm's major investors, an alleged Al Qaeda financier, authorities
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in Washington said no arrests were made and, so far, it
appears no national security material was compromised. But an
investigation was continuing into Yasin al Qadi's role with the firm,
Ptech Inc., which holds contracts with government agencies, including
the departments of Energy, Education and Veterans Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   "This was done out of an abundance of caution," said a Justice
Department official. "It was due diligence to check this firm out."</LD>
<TE>   The search is part of a widening operation by federal agents to
ferret out any potential inroads that terrorists may be making into
government operations. Authorities said they want to make sure that
items such as nuclear power plant blueprints, school programs or
Veterans Affairs hospital designs do not end up with terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Qadi, a member of one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest families, has
been officially identified by the Treasury Department as a major
bankroller of terrorism, primarily by using his Islamic charity group
to funnel millions of dollars to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   But Ptech officials said they would be surprised to learn that
anyone in the small,  9-year-old firm was involved in terrorism, and
they noted that after FBI agents began searching their offices
Thursday night, they eventually left without taking any material or
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be shocked to find out that something like that was going on
in this company," said Joe Johnson, the firm's executive in charge of
professional services.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Treasury Department
released a list of 39 names and groups of terrorism financiers,
including Qadi. According to Treasury officials, he and five other
wealthy Saudis ran several Muslim charities. One of them was set up
to raise money for the hungry and people displaced by war but,
according to the government, sent about $3 million to Bin Laden and
Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Qadi has denied raising money for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Ptech's Web site notes that it has done contract work with many
government entities, including the Air Force and the House of
Representatives, as well as Southern California Edison. Spokesmen for
several of the agencies said they believe the company may have
actually done subcontract work.</TE>
<TE>   "The products that were supplied by this company to the government
all fell in the nonclassified area," said White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer. "The material has been reviewed by the appropriate
government agencies, and they have detected absolutely nothing in the
reports to the White House that would lead to any concern about any
of the products purchased from this company."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan of the District of
Massachusetts said the search and a review of the firm's computer
system was conducted by agents from the Customs Service, FBI, IRS,
Secret Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service, along with
Massachusetts state police.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to believe that the software has any secondary
purpose or malicious code, or that there has been a breach of any
kind," Sullivan said. "There have been no vulnerabilities identified
.... There is also no evidence to suggest that the system is
susceptible to compromise or poses any security risk."</TE>
<TE>   The door to Ptech was locked tight Friday morning. Outside, Ptech
executive Johnson said 75% of the firm's contracts go to commercial
clients, often for graphic software that maps the locations of a
company's high-tech equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The company has revenue of $10 million a year, Johnson said. In
the last six months, the firm has downsized by a third, leaving it
with about 20 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Of the company's four executives, one has family members in
Lebanon and another has relatives in Egypt, Johnson said. He said all

<HD>Tough Sledding for Reindeer</HD>
<DH>Santas Wing It as Fear of Disease Grounds Rental Herds,
Frustrates Business Owners</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>REDMOND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Even Rudolph can't help out in this jam.</LD>
<LD>   A half-dozen reindeer herds that usually spend the Christmas
season prancing in parades and around shopping malls have been
grounded this year not by bad weather at the North Pole, but by
government officials who fear the animals could spread chronic
wasting disease.</LD>
<LD>   Here at Operation Santa Claus, one of the nation's largest
reindeer herds, Cindy and Mike Gillaspie are keeping nearly all 90 of
their animals home after they couldn't get permits in 28 states to
show their reindeer.</LD>
<TE>   For the Gillaspies, idle reindeer are like idle factory space:
Neither makes any money.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what we're going to do," said Cindy Gillaspie.
"Maybe we'll turn them all into sausage."</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting, a fatal illness attacking deer and elk, is caused
by a mutant protein, or prion, that attacks brain tissue. Experts
don't know whether reindeer run the same infection risk as their
cousins, but to be safe, most Central and Eastern states have banned
out-of-state animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Some states, like Virginia, had a complete lockdown and wouldn't
let people move animals even in their own state," said Pat Lavery of
Mayfield, N.Y., president of the 100-member Reindeer Owners and
Breeders Assn. Virginia has since relented, he said, and local owners
can display their animals but out-of-state herds are barred.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, the ban threatens tradition. Officials at
Uniontown Mall in Uniontown, Pa., learned in July that for the first
time in 15 years their annual Christmas parade wouldn't have its
showpiece: Santa in a sleigh pulled by the Gillaspies' reindeer.</TE>
<TE>   And a Christmas parade without Santa in a sleigh doesn't have much
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Santa come down a chimney instead," said Debbie Julian,
senior marketing director for the mall. "It was really tough to come
up with something different."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all the members of the reindeer owners group raise the
animals for money, mostly renting them out for holiday shows and
displays. The Gillaspies are among the few to have made the leap from
hobby to full-time business, one of only a half-dozen herd owners who
send their reindeer to other states.</TE>
<TE>   The Gillaspies focus on the East Coast, Cindy Gillaspie said,
because malls and other businesses there will pay three times as much
-- up to $4,500 a day for four reindeer and a sleigh -- as their
counterparts on the largely snow-less West Coast. Reindeer are a more
integral part of Christmas traditions on the East Coast, she said,
and on the West Coast animal-rights activists are more prevalent.</TE>
<TE>   "On the West Coast, it's more like, 'Oh, those poor animals,' "
Gillaspie said. "You don't even want to go into Marin County."</TE>
<TE>   The Gillaspies took over as managers of Operation Santa Claus in
1984. Two years ago, they bought the business and 10-acre ranch on
the outskirts of Redmond.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Gillaspie said, every state she called about permits was
allowing reindeer in. By June, the Plains states, from Montana to New
Mexico, began closing. By September, the few became the many.</TE>
<TE>   Gillaspie tracked the closures on a map that hangs over the desk
in her home office, a small, overcrowded room off the ranch's
kitchen. Nearly 30 states are marked with round red stickers to
signal closed borders. A half-dozen stickers also have black Xs,
meaning chronic wasting had been found there.</TE>
<TE>   "And those are just the ones I've called," Gillaspie says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Operation Santa Claus took in about $250,000, not quite
breaking even after the mortgage and business loans were factored in.
Gillaspie had booked more than 60 shows for this season before the
borders began closing. She canceled them all.</TE>
<TE>   So this week, normally prime reindeer rental season, four of the
Gillaspies' reindeer were on display at the Los Angeles Zoo. Eight
more were making the rounds of Christmas tree lots in Las Vegas with
her husband. The rest were in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Reindeer are friendly but occasionally aggressive animals, and
Gillaspie has the scars to prove it. No. 908 -- the Gillaspies name
their reindeer for shows but on the ranch identify them by number --
pinned Gillaspie against a fence, puncturing her arms with his antler
points.</TE>
<TE>   Gillaspie hopes the chronic wasting fears will subside over the
winter and that she can start making arrangements in the spring for
next winter's shows. If not, she said, they'll likely winnow the herd
to 30 or so to cut back on feed bills that can run up to $1,300 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the couple sold three reindeer that were made into
sausage. More may go that route, she said, although she hopes to find
other solutions. Except, maybe, for No. 908: "He's our next sausage
candidate."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Suspect Kills Girl, 13, Self</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A 47-year-old man from suburban La Mesa is suspected of kidnapping,
sexually assaulting and killing a 13-year-old Arkansas girl that he
contacted while posing as a teenager in an Internet chat room, police
in Arkansas said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in Conway, Ark., a suburb of Little Rock, said that
David Fuller fatally shot Kacie Rene Woody and then himself as police
arrived at a storage facility in search of the girl. The two bodies
were found in a space rented by Fuller, a former car salesman.</LD>
<LD>   The girl, the daughter of a police officer, was reported missing
Tuesday from the family home. The home showed signs of forced entry
and a struggle, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl had left without her shoes, another sign of abduction,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried desperately to get Miss Woody back to her family but we
were unable," Faulkner County Sheriff Marty Montgomery said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, FBI agents searched Fuller's home and seized several
boxes of items, including a computer.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokeswoman said agents are trying to determine if Fuller
is linked to other crimes involving children.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Fuller's wife filed for divorce in July
and asked that he attend anger management classes. He was fired from
a car dealership after he was discovered looking at pornography on a
company computer, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He was once arrested on suspicion of domestic violence but the
case was dropped for lack of evidence, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said that Fuller left home last week without giving a
reason or location. Conway Police Maj. Mark Elsinger said Fuller went
to Arkansas "on a scouting mission. There appeared to be a lot of
planning in this. You don't just arrive from San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   In Arkansas, Fuller contacted the girl by telephone and continued
to pretend that he was a teenager, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Many in Carolinas Still Lack Power</HD>
<DH>Aftermath proves worse than the storm, as icy branches down
lines and cause outages. Nearly 1.8 million are without electricity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Despite round-the-clock repair efforts, nearly 1.8 million customers
remained without electricity Friday in the Carolinas as ice-laden
branches continued to fell power lines.</LD>
<LD>   The icy aftermath of the storm Wednesday and Thursday -- which
many in the Carolinas compared to a major hurricane for its scale of
destruction -- proved worse than the storm itself. And across the
East Coast, snow and ice snarled air travel and kept children home
from school.</LD>
<LD>   Repair workers who have poured in from across the South were
working against the clock and the ice, which continued to send tree
limbs crashing onto power lines, some of which had already been
repaired.</LD>
<TE>   Frustrated utilities pushed back earlier promises and acknowledged
that most customers won't have power back until Wednesday night, a
week after the storm hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree limbs are still falling and getting tangled up in our
power lines," said Mike McCracken, a spokesman for Carolina Power &amp;
Light. "We've made ground in some areas, but in other locations,
we've lost ground."</TE>
<TE>   Ten thousand utility workers were working in the Carolinas, which
took the brunt of the storm that coated everything with a heavy icy
glaze. Forests and yards popped with the sound of crashing branches,
roofs and cars were crushed and streets were littered with debris and
downed lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We come up here, work a little overtime, help the folks get the
lights back on before Christmas," said Bobby Brinkman of Sarasota,
Fla.-based Pike Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Raleigh-area CP&amp;L's outages increased to 411,000 from 350,000 a
day earlier. Charlotte-based Duke Power also lost ground, as 993,000
North Carolina customers were without electricity Friday, compared
with 930,000 earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 290,000 were powerless in South Carolina, up from 276,000.
The North Carolina Assn. of Electric Cooperatives reported 105,000
outages.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's temperatures climbed into the 40s, melting some of the
ice.</TE>
<TE>   At least 26 deaths had been blamed on the storm since it blew
across the Southern Plains, sending snow and ice from New Mexico to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   A Virginia woman froze to death after her car slid off the road,
and a North Carolina man's car was hit by a falling tree as he
returned from delivering blood supplies.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 travelers were stranded at North Carolina's
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Travelers faced
cancellations and long flight delays at the New York City area's
LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark, N.J., airports.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, highway traffic slowed to a crawl or stalled behind
wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   Buses ran behind schedule, and commuter railroads in the New York
City region added trains to cope with an increase in riders.</TE>
<TE>   The steady snowfall in New York turned avenues and sidewalks
treacherously slick, but tourists busily snapped photos.</TE>
<TE>   "This just seems like the way New York should be, you know?" said
Jennifer McDaniel of Detroit. "The snow and the lights and
decorations -- it just seems right."</TE>

<HD>Elections Panel Gets Democrat Appointee</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday placed Democratic attorney Ellen Weintraub
on the Federal Election Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The recess appointment -- made when Congress is out of session,
and thereby bypassing Senate confirmation proceedings -- lasts only
until the end of the next Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) recommended Weintraub
for the spot in May.</LD>
<TE>   Bush made the nomination Nov. 19, but the full Senate did not act
on it, White House spokeswoman Ashley Snee said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had secured Bush's promise to place
Weintraub on the commission earlier this year, and an agreement was
reached to name her by recess appointment after the inaction in the
Senate, Snee said.</TE>
<TE>   The only delay in making that appointment came from Weintraub
herself, who notified the White House of possible conflicts of
interest that proved to be groundless, Snee said.</TE>
<TE>   McCain and other proponents of the new campaign finance law had
been pressing for Weintraub to replace Democratic Commissioner Karl
Sandstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Sandstrom has joined three Republican commissioners on several
controversial 4-2 votes that critics said opened loopholes in the new
law.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans contend they are simply exercising the latitude
Congress gave them to interpret the law and trying to prevent the new
rules from going further than Congress intended.</TE>
<TE>   Weintraub is a lawyer with the Perkins Coie law firm in
Washington, where her clients have included the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee and its House counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   Weintraub previously served as counsel to the House Ethics
Committee.</TE>

<LD>Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have been able to more
precisely measure the mass of a planet circling a distant red dwarf
star.</LD>
<LD>   Previous estimates of the extrasolar planet ranged from 1.9 to 100
times the size of Jupiter. New measurements show the planet is from
1.89 to 2.4 times the mass of Jupiter. The University of Texas team
determined the planet's mass by measuring wobbles it caused in its
home star's orbit.</LD>

<LD>Like a teenager hoping his car stereo will attract the attention of
girls, male tree frogs in Borneo appear to take advantage of
acoustics to attract mates.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers have found that males of a species of inch-long tree
hole frogs tune their high-pitched mating calls to take maximum
advantage of the acoustics of the holes in which they live and sing
to fe- males.</LD>
<LD>   Frogs placed in artificial holes changed the pitch of their
singing to sound attractive to females, according to the study
published in this week's issue of Nature.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers say that global warming may be
changing the shape of the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Because it spins and is flattened by huge ice caps at the poles,
the Earth is not round but oblate, like a slightly flattened soccer
ball.</LD>
<LD>   This thickening around the middle had been expected to decrease
because the polar ice caps have thinned since the last ice age. But
the Earth is more flattened than ever, reports JPL's Jean O. Dickey.</LD>
<TE>   A possible explanation is that glaciers in the mid-latitudes are
melting and much of the world's ocean water is being transferred
toward the equator.</TE>

<HD>Mars Only Briefly Wet, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study is throwing cold water on the idea that Mars was once a
warm, wet planet.</LD>
<LD>   Because Mars' surface is carved by major river channels and
covered by huge lake or ocean shores, many scientists have long
believed that the Red Planet was once warmer and wetter, and basked
in Earth-like conditions that could have allowed the evolution of
life.</LD>
<LD>   But an analysis suggests that water occurred for only a short time
in the early history of Mars, when the planet was being bombarded by
asteroids and comets.</LD>
<TE>   These impacts, which occurred about 3.5 billion years ago,
probably brought with them scalding rains and higher temperatures
that melted some of the ice at the planet's poles. Such activity
could have created temporary lakes and rivers. The new work,
published in this week's issue of Science, shows that Mars' river
channels are about the same age as the craters.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that through most of its history, Mars has been a
cold, dry planet," said Teresa Segura, a scientist at the University
of Colorado at Boulder who conducted the study with scientists from
NASA Ames Research Center. The team describes the planet's weather as
"an almost endless winter broken by episodes of scalding rains
followed by flash floods."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thursday's publication of a draft mouse genome was heralded with joy,
but another rodent is only a whisker behind.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists of the International Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium
announced on Nov. 25 a completed draft of the rat genome.</LD>
<LD>   "The vast majority of all the therapeutics that we take have been
tested and developed using rats," said Howard Jacob, director of the
human and molecular genetics center at Medical College of Wisconsin
in Milwaukee.</LD>
<TE>   "I love the mouse," he said, but rats are better suited for
studies on behavior, addiction, diabetes, kidney disease and
hypertension, helped along by inbred strains such as the
"spontaneously hypertensive rat" and the "salt-sensitive rat."</TE>
<TE>   The rat genome hasn't been analyzed, but it is larger than the
mouse genome and smaller than the human one, said Richard Gibbs,
professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</TE>

<HD>Arledge Always Was Picture Perfect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every sports fan owes a huge debt to Roone Arledge, who created and
developed "Wide World of Sports" and "Monday Night Football" for ABC.</LD>
<LD>   But Arledge, who died Thursday, might not have had the chance to
revolutionize TV sports if he hadn't been hired to produce NCAA
football games for Sports Programs, Inc., which was later bought by
ABC and became ABC Sports. The man who hired him, Edgar Scherick,
died Monday.</LD>
<LD>   As Bert Randolph Sugar wrote in his book, "The Thrill of Victory:
The inside story of ABC Sports," Scherick had been impressed with
Arledge's work at NBC and invited Arledge to come to his office,
which Scherick had decorated with dozens of pictures of athletes.</LD>
<TE>   "Scherick had already decided that Arledge had the skill to
produce the NCAA games," Sugar wrote. "However, before hiring him, he
wanted to put Arledge to the supreme test.</TE>
<TE>   'Do you know anything about sports?' Arledge told him that he was
a sports fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   " 'All right,' " said Scherick, jumping up. " 'Here's the test.'
And with that, he began waving at the pictures on his walls with all
the gusto of a traffic cop in Rome. 'Who's that?' demanded Scherick.
And Arledge would answer. 'Who's that?' And again, Arledge had the
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "This rapid fire game of 'Show and Tell' continued until every
picture on the wall was pointed out. Arledge correctly identified
each and every one. Scherick sat back in his seat and said, 'I think
you can produce these games.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What were the first events televised by "Wide World
of Sports"?</TE>
<TE>   Soft sell: "Wide World of Sports" almost didn't make it to the
air. In an interview with ABC Sports online last year, Arledge said
ABC executives warned that if half the ads weren't sold it wouldn't
air, meaning he would lose the rights to work events such as the
British Open golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wanted Wide World of Sports. They'd never heard of it.
They didn't know what it was," Arledge said. "In fact, I'm not even
sure if we had a name at that point, but they loved NCAA football.
And they set up this thing where in order to get [ads] into NCAA
football, you had to buy part of Wide World ... .</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, R.J. Reynolds called at five minutes to five. End of
business on that day, that Friday, and said they would take it,
reluctantly. They had no real interest in it but they would take it
just to get into NCAA football. And so a program whose 40th
anniversary we're celebrating came within five minutes of not getting
on."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Penn Relays, hosted by Jim McKay, and the Drake
Relays, hosted by Bill Fleming, on April 29, 1961.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Remember Vinko Bogataj? He's the ski jumper whose
spectacular fall illustrated the "agony of defeat" in the
introduction to "Wide World of Sports."</TE>
<TE>   "When I was covering a ski jumping competition in Slovenia some
years ago, I had the opportunity to meet Vinko Bogataj, who is alive
and well," ABC commentator Terry Gannon said last year on abc.com.
"But on the way to his meeting with us, he had a fender-bender with
four old ladies in a compact car, who chased him furiously to the
parking lot of our hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Vinko was quick-witted enough to say upon arriving, 'Every time
I'm on ABC, I crash.' He survived that one just fine, too."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So the lesson to be learned from this game is the same thing the
Lakers have been saying all along.</LD>
<LD>   Just wait. Do what Phil Jackson says and Robert Horry exemplifies
and chill out.</LD>
<LD>   Everything that has been wrong with the Lakers through the first
20 games of this season showed up for cameo appearances in the first
three quarters of Friday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks.
It was so bad at halftime, when the Lakers trailed, 64-36, that two
longtime season-ticket holders came by and basically wrote off the
rest of the season and started making plans for what to do with their
tickets and free time come springtime.</LD>
<TE>   "Grim," one said. "Bleeping grim."</TE>
<TE>   Then all of the moxie, magic and star power that led them to the
last three NBA championships came back in the fourth -- and so did
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   They wiped away a Maverick lead that was 30 points early in the
third quarter and 27 at the start of the fourth and somehow won,
105-103.</TE>
<TE>   And after all that, their record stands at 8-13.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional wisdom says you shouldn't make too much of an NBA
game played before the Christmas presents are unwrapped -- especially
before the gifts are even bought.</TE>
<TE>   But the way the Lakers came back -- even if they had lost --
bought them some more time to get things right. It adds a little more
fuel to the notion that the Lakers have it in them to return to their
championship ways, like those tales of lost dogs finding their way
home across hundreds of miles.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us the confidence that we still got it," Kobe Bryant
said. "Other teams watching us tonight probably expected us to fold.
But tonight we showed why we won three times in a row."</TE>
<TE>   "This shows what we have built here," added Rick Fox. "We're used
to being thought of as the best team in the league and now we're
playing the team that has the best record, and it was important for
us to show everything we stand for."</TE>
<TE>   There were other reasons to take this game seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had their full complement of players, the group they
expected to take them to a fourth consecutive championship, for the
first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal has been back for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   They had every reason to be motivated as the Mavericks brought the
NBA's best record -- 17-1 -- into town.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Lakers' own play had dragged expectations down so far
that Jackson wasn't even talking about victory beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at it in the long term for a basketball team,"
he said. "[Dallas] is a team that's playing at a high level. Can we
reach up and meet that level? In reality, I'm not saying I expect
[the team] to right now jump up to that level. We haven't been
playing at that level. But we need to see improvement as a basketball
team."</TE>
<TE>   They jumped, all right. A quantum leap up -- and back. Back to the
Western Conference finals and Game 4. Back to all of the drama and
emotion and memories that haven't been seen at a Laker game since --
and rarely at any regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how badly the Sacramento Kings took apart the Lakers in
the first half of that game? Dallas dismantled them even worse.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just that the Mavericks made a ridiculous 71% of their
three-pointers in the first half (10 for 14) and scored 64 points.
But holding an opponent to 36 points -- as Dallas did to the Lakers
-- will give you a halftime lead in 99% of the games no matter how
well you're shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas stifled the Lakers with a zone defense that featured a
floating player (usually Michael Finley) ready to help whenever
Bryant tried to drive or the Lakers passed the ball to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Take away Shaq's low-posting and Kobe's slashing and what was
left? The same thing we've been seeing: a bunch of guys who can't hit
open shots and can't create shots of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Finley's shot was off, but Nick Van Exel was torching the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers came back by utilizing that missing element of the
first 20 games: defense. They fought through screens and helped each
other out. Devean George even skied to block a dunk by 7-foot-6 Shawn
Bradley, but was called for a foul.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bryant took over. He didn't care how many Mavericks
were in front of him or how tall they were, he was going to the hoop.
He scored 21 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter, making all eight
of his shots.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Mavericks became the sixth team to score 100 points
against the Lakers. But they scored only 15 in the fourth quarter,
while the Lakers put up a double quatro: 44.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmmmm. Four. All of a sudden, that number felt appropriate again
when talking about the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They got the momentum and we gave it to them with some costly
turnovers," Dallas Coach Don Nelson said. "Being the world champs,
they took advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Said Van Exel, who finished with 25 points: "We just choked,
flat-out choked. They played like the world champions and we played
scared. We got tentative and just choked."</TE>
<TE>   Now you have to wonder if there will be long-term ramifications.
The Mavericks have lost 24 consecutive games to the Lakers in
Southern California, from the Forum to Staples. And if a 27-point
fourth-quarter lead isn't enough to end the streak, they have to
question if anything they've got will get it done.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their great start, the Mavericks had been waiting for
validation.</TE>
<TE>   "They know it doesn't mean anything," owner Mark Cuban said before
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban compared it to the initial public stock offering for his
company Broadcom. Sure the stock price zoomed right away, but then it
meant they had to live up to it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he later sold his stake to Yahoo and pocketed $2.2
billion, so I'd say that turned out pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   Good starts do matter, especially for teams that have never
accomplished anything and need to discover something about
themselves. The last two seasons, the Philadelphia 76ers and New
Jersey Nets turned great Novembers into trips to the NBA Finals. The
confidence that builds never disappears -- deep inside teams know
they're capable of doing what they did early in the season, and they
can get back to it.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two seasons, the Lakers have drawn on memories of
June heroics to get them through the tough times. This game was a
classic, no matter what the month.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't help but think of June. Maybe even next June.</TE>

<HD>Grissom Leaves for the Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger makeover continued Friday as free-agent outfielder Marquis
Grissom became the latest player to leave in a week of big changes,
agreeing to a multiyear contract with the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Grissom, the Dodgers' most productive backup last season, accepted
a two-year offer for about $4.5 million, a baseball official said,
becoming the third key veteran to move on. On Wednesday, first
baseman Eric Karros and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek were traded
to the Chicago Cubs, and $2 million in cash, for catcher Todd Hundley
and outfielder Chad Hermansen.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most popular players in the clubhouse, Grissom played
in 111 games, batting .277 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Dodgers will not offer salary arbitration to their
other free agents by today's deadline, meaning left-hander Omar Daal
and infielders Dave Hansen and Tyler Houston probably won't return
next season. The club also sold the contracts of right-hander Kevin
Beirne and left-hander Jeff Williams to Japanese teams for about $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans declined comment, but sources said the
Dodgers had already decided to let Hansen and Houston leave, and a
clause in Daal's contract prohibits them from offering arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers could re-sign Daal, Hansen and Houston in May, but
Evans is exploring other options to improve the club and develop more
roster and payroll flexibility. If the Dodgers had offered
arbitration, they would have only received draft picks as
compensation for Daal and Houston because of how free agents are
classified under the collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, acquired in November 2001 from Philadelphia, was 11-9 with a
3.90 earned-run average while splitting time in the rotation and
bullpen. Hansen, the Dodgers' career leader in pinch-hits, batted
.292, but only .185 as a pinch-hitter. Houston, acquired from
Milwaukee in July, batted .200 for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels all but severed ties with reserve outfielders Orlando
Palmeiro and Alex Ochoa, announcing the team would forfeit
negotiating rights to the players by not offering them salary
arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman said he has offered Palmeiro a
contract but neither he nor Barry Praver, the agent for Palmeiro,
would say whether it included a pay cut from his $1-million salary
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to fill one of the backup outfield spots with an
inexpensive free agent and have rookies Robb Quinlan, Barry Wesson
and Nathan Haynes compete for the other.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Scott Boras, who represents pitcher Scott Schoeneweis,
confirmed that he has asked the Angels for a trade so the left-hander
can resume his career as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels do not plan to honor that request. Schoeneweis is their
only proven left-handed reliever and the cost of replacing him could
be prohibitive. Schoeneweis, who made $325,000 last season, is
eligible for salary arbitration but not free agency.</TE>
<TE>   -- Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Burden, a minor league pitcher for the Angels, died in his
sleep Thursday night . He was 23. Burden, who pitched for the team's
rookie league team in Provo, Utah, was found dead at his home in
Suffolk, Va. The cause of death was not determined.</TE>

<LD>UC Santa Barbara (3-2) at Pepperdine (2-2), 6 p.m., Fox Sports Net 2,
KPLS (830), KEYT (1250) -- Pepperdine completes a four-game stretch
against Big West teams, having defeated Cal State Fullerton and Long
Beach State this week after losing to UC Irvine. The Waves,
struggling in the low post because of a personnel shortage, have been
outrebounded in every game. Forward Jimmy Miggins averages 16 points.
Branduinn Fullove (17.8 points per game) leads Santa Barbara, which
beat USC, 69-53, Tuesday, its third win in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Fullerton (1-3) at Loyola Marymount (3-3), 7 p.m.,
KXLU-FM (88.9) -- Loyola, outrebounded in each of its losses, could
have problems matching up with 6-foot-10 Fullerton center Pape Sow,
who is averaging 13.2 points and 8.8 rebounds. Seven-foot Adam Parada
scorched the Lions for 28 points Wednesday in UC Irvine's 81-66
victory. Fullerton is shooting 20.6% (14 of 68) from three-point
range. Titan guard Ralphy Holmes averages 19 points. Freshman guard
Brandon Worthy leads Loyola with a 12-point average coming off the
bench.</LD>
<LD>   -- Rob Fernas</LD>
<TE>   Bethany (3-4) at Cal State Northridge (3-2), 7 p.m. -- Northridge
Coach Bobby Braswell's 100th coaching victory, 64-61 at San Diego on
Wednesday, also put the Matadors over .500 for the first time in two
seasons. Gene Myvett, a 6-4 sophomore swingman who played in 26 of 28
games last season but has received little playing time this season,
has left the Matadors, according to Braswell.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona-Pitzer (1-3) at UC Irvine (2-2), 7 p.m., KUCI-FM (88.9) --
The Sagehens have only two seniors and are on a three-game losing
streak in which they have averaged only 51 points. Freshman forward
Edward Wexler-Beron (11.5 points) leads the NCAA Division III team in
scoring. Because of final exams, Irvine doesn't play again until Dec.
19 at Stanford.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Fight Left in Mayweather</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>There he was, standing on a stage in the Coral Reef Lounge of the
Mandalay Bay Hotel after Friday's weigh-in, dancing to the rhythmic
taunts of defiant, flag-waving Mexican fans, a smile on his face,
seemingly not a care in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Yet only one day earlier, World Boxing Council lightweight
champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. was so angry that he'd refused to
attend a news conference to promote tonight's title fight against
Jose Luis Castillo at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to do negative interviews," Mayweather said Friday,
unwilling to revisit Thursday's absence. "I'm just looking to be
around positive people and doing positive things."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, however, Mayweather, who weighed 134 to Castillo's 135,
is frustrated because he has not achieved the prominence once
predicted, he has never made the astronomical sums routinely earned
by Oscar De La Hoya, financial king of the non-heavyweights.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather's first fight against Castillo, last April, produced
yet more frustration, even though Mayweather took Castillo's title.
Mayweather, after struggling at times, won a unanimous decision. He
later said he had torn his rotator cuff on the last day of training
camp, but kept that secret. So Mayweather (28-0, 20 knockouts) wanted
another shot at Castillo (46-5-1, 42). Then the rematch, originally
scheduled for October, was postponed because of tendinitis in
Castillo's left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   More frustration for Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   Now, more of the same for the man who calls himself the best
pound-for-pound fighter in the world. HBO has decided Mayweather's
fight is not even the main event. His will be the semi-main, to be
foIlowed by a heavyweight bout between Wladimir Klitschko and Jameel
McCline.</TE>
<TE>   HBO, though, has made the right call. The Klitschko-McCline fight
is more intriguing. Wladimir and his brother, Vitali, are poised to
burst into the top of the heavyweight division, but they haven't
fought the level of opposition that would prove they belong there.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian natives who had been living in Germany for seven years
before moving to the United States, the Klitschkos have 72 fights
between them and have won 70 of those.</TE>
<TE>   Wladimir is 39-1 with 36 knockouts, his lone defeat coming on an
11th-round technical knockout by Ross Puritty in 1998. Vitali is 31-1
with 30 knockouts. He lost to Chris Byrd in 2000 on a ninth-round
TKO.</TE>
<TE>   Vitali will get his big test next spring when he fights
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Wladimir's test tonight looms as his biggest. In the last 18
months, McCline (28-2-3, 16) has beaten Michael Grant, Lance Whitaker
and Shannon Briggs.</TE>
<TE>   McCline weighed in at 263 for tonight's match, Wladimir at 240.</TE>
<TE>   Worth the Weight?</TE>
<TE>   Roy Jones, who seems to enjoy sparring with the media almost as
much as he enjoys sparring with opponents, appeared delighted to
prove the skeptics wrong, participating in an announcement that he
would be stepping up from light-heavyweight to heavyweight, after
all, to take on World Boxing Assn. titleholder John Ruiz March 1 at
Las Vegas' Thomas &amp; Mack Center.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the media had doubted Jones would move up, perhaps because
he has been talking about it for years without following through.</TE>
<TE>   Even this time, talks with promoter Don King dragged on and on
before a tentative agreement was reached earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to make sure I was being treated fair," Jones said
in explaining the delay.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz isn't convinced he and Jones will actually step into the
ring.</TE>
<TE>   "There's now a 60% chance it will happen," he said. "Before, there
was a 0% chance."</TE>
<TE>   Comeback of the Week</TE>
<TE>   When De La Hoya tossed out the name of International Boxing
Federation junior-middleweight champion Winky Wright as a possible
opponent, Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, erupted.</TE>
<TE>   "Belt, shmelt, Forget Winky," Arum said. "A fight against Oscar
would be totally and completely unsalable."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Sternburg, Wright's publicist, responded in a release
heralding, for some unknown reason, the celebration of Wright's 31st
birthday with the following phony quote attributed to Arum:
"Birthday, shmirthday. Winky's birthday is just now unsalable."</TE>
<TE>   Now We Know</TE>
<TE>   Last month's Arturo Gatti-Micky Ward rematch was a disappointment
to all but those in the Gatti camp because it failed to equal the
first fight in terms of fury and intensity. Gatti won decisively,
after having lost the first fight last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The Ward camp, hoping for a rubber match, says the reason Ward
faded as the fight progressed was because of a blow behind his left
ear, delivered by Gatti in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   "There was quite an impact to the inside of Micky's ear," said Dr.
Stephen Margles after examining Ward. "It upset his equilibrium and
made it much harder for him to be balanced. It's like coming off an
amusement ride. You get dizzy and stagger around like a drunk."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gatti-Ward II got an 8.6 rating on HBO, 18% higher than the
7.3 for Gatti-Ward I.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jab</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya will be appearing today from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at
the Stevenson Middle School, 725 S. Indiana, East Los Angeles, to
hand out Christmas toys to 4,400 needy kids.</TE>

<HD>Miller Says Bad Ankle Won't Sideline Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Miller vowed to play today against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's going to take a good deal more than a sprained
left ankle to keep him from playing. He has sat out two games in his
three-plus NBA seasons, one Sunday because of his ankle and one last
season while with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   "I ran into Kenny Thomas and my shoulder popped out," Miller said,
referring to a collision with the burly Houston Rocket forward. "I
had no choice. I had to sit out. But I'm going to play [today]."</LD>
<TE>   Jasen Powell, Clipper athletic trainer, said Miller's
participation would be a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was injured Nov. 29, when he collided with Bobby Jackson of
the Sacramento Kings. He sat out the Clippers' loss Sunday against
the Indiana Pacers, but played 32 minutes and scored 13 points with
seven assists in a victory Wednesday over the Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an old school player like Mo Cheeks," Coach Alvin Gentry
said, comparing Miller to the former Philadelphia 76er point guard
and current Portland Trail Blazer coach. "There's not a lot of fancy
stuff. He doesn't go behind his back or through his legs with the
ball unless there's a good reason. He gets the job done. There's no
flash, but a lot of substance. I don't think I've seen him do
anything flashy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said he would move Marko Jaric to a reserve role today,
giving Tremaine Fowlkes a rare start at small forward against the
Timberwolves. Fowlkes is better suited to defend Minnesota's Kevin
Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unfair to ask Marko to guard Kevin Garnett," Gentry
said. "Tremaine has guarded him before. He's tough for anyone to
guard."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry would prefer to have Lamar Odom on Garnett, but Odom hasn't
made enough progress to come off the injured list from a sprained
right ankle. He practiced with his teammates Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Lamar would be a great matchup for us," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Gentry put Darius Miles on Garnett and the teams
split four games, with Miles leading the Clippers in scoring twice.
The Clippers traded Miles to get Miller from Cleveland during the
off-season.</TE>

<LD>To say the Pepperdine women's volleyball team has problems against
UCLA is to say a ball is round, a court is box-shaped, an ace is
better than a service error.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins are 25-3 against the Waves in the 20 years before this
season, winning three national titles along the way while the
less-fortunate teams in Malibu often struggled to get past the first
round of the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   But programs evolve, gaps get closed, underdogs become favorites.</LD>
<TE>   Such was the case Friday, when Pepperdine defeated UCLA, 30-26,
23-30, 30-26, 30-26, in a second-round match of the NCAA tournament
before 1,178 fans at Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Lyndsey Hache' had 17 kills, Katie Wilkins had 16, and the Waves
(25-6) defeated the Bruins (20-14) for the second time in less than a
month.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had upset Long Beach State in the first round and was looking
to reassert its dominance over Pepperdine after getting swept by the
Waves in a nonconference match Nov. 12 at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But the Waves didn't break. They had more aces, more kills and
another victory against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves play the winner of tonight's California-UC Santa Barbara
match Thursday or Friday at a site to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins erased the possibility of a sweep by winning the second
game, Lauren Fendrick delivering five of her 20 kills to help tie the
match at a game each.</TE>
<TE>   But Pepperdine won the third game with little trouble and turned a
19-17 deficit in the fourth game into victory as UCLA dissolved amid
a slew of hitting errors and passing gaffes.</TE>
<TE>   "We could see it in their eyes that they were starting to question
themselves," said Hache', a junior middle blocker. "I think we stayed
steady and stable. We knew how to win. We've been doing it all
season."</TE>
<TE>   In 14 previous NCAA tournament appearances, the Waves have never
advanced past the third round.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready," Coach Pepperdine Coach Nina Matthies said. "In my
20 years, this is the best group of athletes and volleyball players
that I've ever had. That's why I think we have the ability to go
farther."</TE>
<TE>   Heather Cullen had 15 kills for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "They're big, they're rangy, they hit with a lot of power," UCLA
Coach Andy Banachowski said. "They're a very strong attacking team."</TE>

<HD>Can't Sell Ducks Short-Handed</HD>
<DH>Rucchin deflects Carney's shot into net with Blackhawks on
power play in third period to give Anaheim a 4-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>With the score tied and the Chicago Blackhawks on a power play with
less than eight minutes remaining in the third period, the stage was
set for another Mighty Duck collapse.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of giving up a late game-winning goal, the Ducks
scored one of their own when Steve Rucchin deflected in a long-range
shot by Keith Carney to give the Ducks a 4-3 victory in front of
14,616 at United Center.</LD>
<LD>   "Keith just put the puck in the perfect spot," Rucchin said of
Carney's shot from the left point. "If it was anywhere else, I don't
think it would have found the back of the net. He put it on the far
end side of the net and there wasn't too much [Chicago goaltender
Jocelyn] Thibault could have done."</LD>
<TE>   Rucchin's short-handed goal gave the Ducks their lone victory in a
three-game trip that concluded with the Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   The win spoiled Theo Fleury's return from suspension for the
Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   What made the victory so special to the Ducks was how they held on
to the lead, something they've failed to do in several games this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring a goal on the PK [penalty kill] gave us a huge momentum
builder," said goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who finished with
17 saves. "It came late in the period, and we kept playing on that
momentum. We didn't give them anything. We kept working hard and were
not afraid of making any mistakes. This was a good experience for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Ducks and Blackhawks are two of the NHL's
lowest-scoring teams, they had their offenses clicking in a
high-scoring first period, which featured four goals.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, who missed the first 25 games of the season for violating
the NHL's substance abuse aftercare program, got things going when he
scored his first goal as a Blackhawk on a rebound shot from the slot
at 10:15.</TE>
<TE>   Andy McDonald ended a five-game scoreless streak with his sixth
goal this season to pull the Ducks even, 1-1. McDonald went around
defenseman Nathan Dempsey in the neutral zone and then slipped the
puck under Thibault at 13:49.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago needed only 40 seconds to regain the lead on a goal by
Mark Bell, but the Ducks' Jason Krog followed with a goal at 15:36 to
tie the score at 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, the Ducks took their first lead when Petr
Sykora scored a five-on-three power play at 11:09.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the score was Adam Oates' cross-ice pass that went
between Dempsey's legs directly to Sykora, who scored easily from
outside the right post.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks controlled play the rest of the period until 14.2
seconds remained when they gave up a goal to Alexei Zhamnov, who had
a shot by teammate Eric Daze bounce off his pants and go into the net
to tie the score, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a real tough goal to give up ... especially when you
didn't really do anything wrong," said Duck Coach Mike Babcock, who
gave his team Thursday off so they could rest. "It was just a lucky
break by them."</TE>

<HD>Stress Test for Harrick</HD>
<DH>Off-court problems involving player transgressions produce
tough start for Georgia and its coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It hasn't been a very pretty year for Jim Harrick and Georgia
basketball, and that has nothing to do with the 2-3 record the
Bulldogs bring to the Wooden Classic today at the Arrowhead Pond of
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   For a moment Friday, Harrick succumbed to his old penchant for
hyperbole as his team prepared to play Cal today in the first game of
a doubleheader with USC and Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   "Probably harder than any I've experienced," he said, before being
reminded of the aftermath of his firing at UCLA in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   "No, nothing like that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the string of trouble at Georgia in the last year almost
seems enough to make the falsified expense report that got Harrick
fired at UCLA for lying to school officials look insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   There is a trail of academic shortcomings among Georgia players
and recruits, and an increasing sense that Harrick -- who since
winning the 1995 title at UCLA has taken Rhode Island and Georgia to
the NCAA tournament -- is willing to take considerable risks on
players.</TE>
<TE>   By far, the most serious news broke last winter when two
basketball players and a Georgia football player were charged in
connection with the alleged rape of a female student in a dorm. The
charges against Tony Cole and Steve Thomas were dismissed in August
after a jury had acquitted football player Brandon Williams,
convincing prosecutors they were unlikely to convict the other
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick refused to reinstate Cole, despite the dismissal of the
case, citing a list of transgressions that included altercations with
teammates, abuse of phone privileges and threatening assistant coach
Jim Harrick Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a mistake with Cole," Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I went 42 years of teaching and coaching and never had
a guy's name in the paper for social misconduct. I guess if you coach
long enough, sometime something will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, suspended for the first three games of the season, was
found not guilty of violating the school's honor code by a student
judiciary panel this week. He will be allowed to return if he regains
his academic eligibility at the semester -- a crucial issue for the
future of a Bulldog team playing without a center.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the turmoil, if Thomas returns, Georgia will again be
worthy of a top-25 ranking, and almost certainly an NCAA tournament
bid for the third year since Harrick arrived from Rhode Island four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "With Thomas out, we've kind of been disoriented," Harrick said.
"But it's early. We'll be fine if we get him back."</TE>
<TE>   The 2-3 start is far from impressive, but Georgia has had the sort
of unrelenting schedule that helped the 2001 team make the NCAA field
at 16-14. Even with two starters out -- forward Chris Daniels was
suspended for one game for playing in an unsanctioned summer charity
game -- Georgia played Texas, now ranked second in the nation, to a
77-71 loss in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   The other losses were to instate rival Georgia Tech and to No. 20
Minnesota on a shot at the buzzer. The Bulldogs beat Belmont and
Colorado, in another game decided at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis Hayes, a 6-foot-7 swingman, is the Bulldogs' best player.
But the most intriguing might be Damien Wilkins, a transfer from
North Carolina State. He's the son of former NBA player Gerald
Wilkins and the nephew of Dominique Wilkins, the former NBA star who
is the only player in Georgia history whose jersey has been retired.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins clashed with Coach Herb Sendek at North Carolina State but
has fit in fine at Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   He is only the latest player Harrick has been willing to take a
risk on. The others are far better known.</TE>
<TE>   He took in Lamar Odom at Rhode Island, after Nevada Las Vegas had
shunned Odom when the NCAA questioned his test score.</TE>
<TE>   Odom established his eligibility at Rhode Island and steered clear
of trouble while starring for the Rams for one season before the
Clippers made him the fourth pick overall in the 1999 NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps encouraged by Odom's success, Harrick tried to bring
troubled Kenny Brunner -- the onetime Georgetown player involved in a
notorious swordplay incident after transferring to Fresno State -- to
Georgia two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   University President Michael Adams, a friend of Harrick from the
days both were at Pepperdine, at first supported him, then quashed
the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Odom, Brunner, were all OK'd by the president and the athletic
director at the university," Harrick said. "I went and sat down with
them and asked them what they thought, 'Give me your opinion.' "</TE>
<TE>   Adams later put a stop to it, and the Brunner courtship was over.
"I'll just say the responsibility belongs to me and I accept it,"
Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Harrick was criticized when three of four recruits
for this season failed to qualify for admission.</TE>
<TE>   Harrick claims he was caught off-guard by the number of players
from the state of Georgia who fail to reach NCAA-minimum test scores.
(The state ranks near the bottom of the nation in average SAT
scores.)</TE>
<TE>   He also cites the familiar "opportunity" theory.</TE>
<TE>   "You're also trying to help young guys, you're trying to educate
young people, pick the right group," Harrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "And there's no parent, no player, no high school coach that you
deal with who'll ever say, 'My guy won't make it.' They all tell you,
'Aw, he'll make it, don't worry. We've got everything covered.' You
come down to it, they don't make it.</TE>
<TE>   "It does make you look bad. It's not something you wish on
yourself. You do the best you can.</TE>
<TE>   "You have good recruiting years and some years aren't so good. We
came back, we've had a great recruiting year. We signed five guys and
all of them are qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Harrick feels a bit beleaguered, but truth be told, basketball is
a bit under the radar at Georgia, especially during football season.
He has traded a basketball school with a football program at UCLA for
a football school with a basketball program at Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   But as always, scrutiny and Harrick seem to go hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you ask any coach, even John Wooden, 'Have you ever
made any mistakes?' they have," Harrick said. "Yeah, you try, and you
make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden it becomes, 'Harrick's a good coach, but ... '
But what? I don't know what the 'but' is."</TE>

<LD>Ziggy Palffy escaped the wrath of the NHL, which won't suspend the
King winger for spearing Martin Erat of the Nashville Predators in
the first period of Thursday night's 3-2 loss. But Palffy didn't
escape Coach Andy Murray.</LD>
<LD>   Palffy was ejected after taking a retaliatory shot at Erat, who a
moment earlier had apparently tried to kick Palffy's legs out from
under him.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a stupid thing for Ziggy to do," Murray said Friday. "It
was unnecessary and he was chastised for it by us because it hurt our
team, not having him."</LD>
<TE>   Having said that, Murray disagreed with the call, saying Palffy
should have been called for slashing.</TE>

<LD>   Bryant injured his groin in the third quarter, and trainer Gary
Vitti approached him to wrap it and perhaps end his evening.</LD>
<LD>   "I twisted his arm," Bryant said. "I said, 'It's all right, I want
to go back in the game, don't snitch on me."</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Coach Phil Jackson viewed Bryant's condition -- a
pulled groin that will be examined today -- as both admirable and
worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he'll be [today], he was pretty hobbled out
there," Jackson said. "But he played through it."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he was surprised that everyone was so shocked by their
30-point comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done this before, guys," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Um, no, you haven't, it was the largest comeback in Laker history.</TE>
<TE>   "But we've done things like this before," said Bryant. "That's the
character of us. I tell you what, you'll never leave our games early
again.</TE>
<TE>   "All the ones who stayed tonight, it was like they were saying,
'We know you have the heart of a champion, and we're sticking
around.' I'm glad they did."</TE>
<TE>   One player who checked out early was Maverick guard Steve Nash,
who left the game early in the fourth quarter with his team leading
by 21.</TE>
<TE>   He promptly dressed in all of his warmup gear and sat down on the
bench ... and less than two minutes later, he was peeling off all the
layers and rushing back into the game after the Lakers had scored
eight consecutive points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Lakers activated power forward Samaki Walker
and waived center Soumaila Samake. Walker had been sidelined six
games.</TE>

<DH>Bryant scores 21 points in fourth quarter and makes winning
shot as L.A. overcomes 30-point deficit to defeat Mavericks, 105-103.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a night they played to show who was who in a league -- and a town
-- beginning to wonder, the Lakers defended what they're still
reasonably sure is theirs.</LD>
<LD>   Their three championships, maybe. Their dignity, without question.</LD>
<LD>   From 30 points behind, and by scoring 44 points in the fourth
quarter, the Lakers defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 105-103, Friday
night at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of the largest comeback in Laker history, after Kobe
Bryant's 14-foot jumper with 8.4 seconds left broke a 103-103 tie,
and then after Michael Finley's shot near the buzzer bounded away,
Bryant shook his fists joyously for the crowd that booed them all off
the floor at halftime, when they trailed, 64-36.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes things happen for you when you play hard," he said.
"And it did."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, docile for three quarters and standing on a sore groin,
had scored 21 points on eight-of-eight shooting in the fourth
quarter, and 27 points in all. The Lakers had made 16 of 18 shots,
had found the commitment in their legs and minds to defend the
Mavericks, and then were swept up in a moment no one saw coming.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers began the fourth quarter 27 points back, their hair
blown back by the Mavericks, who hardly missed on their way to an
88-61 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I just told them not to look at the score because it won't do any
good," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Barely six minutes later, the Maverick lead was eight. The jumpers
that fell for them in the first three quarters now were a half-step
out of their range.</TE>
<TE>   Swept away by the momentum they generated, by the re-gathering of
the crowd behind them, the Lakers were within three points with three
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   From the perspective of the floor, of the Laker bench, time
stopped. It was only the Lakers, in a vacuum, working unknowingly
toward overcoming the second-largest deficit to begin the fourth
quarter in NBA history. The Milwaukee Bucks came back to beat the
Atlanta Hawks from 28 points 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The clock crawled," Rick Fox recalled. "It was like a time warp.
I kept turning to guys, saying, 'Can you believe the clock? Look at
the clock. It's not moving.' "</TE>
<TE>   They tied the score, 100-100, on Brian Shaw's three-pointer with
1:28 remaining. They took their first lead, 101-100, 10 seconds
later, on Robert Horry's free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel made a three-pointer to give the Mavericks the lead
back, but Shaw made another clutch basket from the corner to tie it,
setting up Bryant's heroics.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw was three for three in the final quarter. Devean George was
two for two. Shaquille O'Neal was three for three.</TE>
<TE>   "We just kept playing, kept fighting, kept shooting," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks, who haven't won a game in Los Angeles against the
Lakers in 24 games over 12 years, had collapsed, utterly. They scored
15 points in the fourth quarter, and then traipsed from the floor as
purple and gold streamers fell over their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "We choked," Van Exel said. "Just flat-out choked."</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers wouldn't remember it that way.</TE>
<TE>   Standing uncomfortably at 7-13 while the Mavericks had run out to
17-1, the Lakers found their game, and their spirit.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 26 points. The bench scored 34, 14 in the last
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have a team that believes it has the ability to
overcome insurmountable odds," Jackson said. "I think tonight was
looking like an insurmountable odd."</TE>
<TE>   They are again after another title, and taking their time about
it, but this might have been a start, after more than a dozen
missteps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about believing in yourself," Jackson said. "This is a
team that's played under the duress of ridicule. It's a big win."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks' run was 33-6 at the end of the first half. Boos
poured from the top deck as the Lakers ducked into the tunnel at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   They had been outscored, 35-12, in the second quarter. They had
given up 15 points in the final five possessions of the half, even
after Jackson had begged them to finish quarters with greater
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks before, the Lakers lost by 26 points in Dallas, a game
they agreed was humbling at best. Now, they were down 28 with still
half-a-game to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really hard for them in the locker room," Jackson said.
"They had their heads in their hands. I had to get them rooted and
ready."</TE>
<TE>   They scored 69 points in the second half. They pushed through all
manners of ugliness, through three Mavericks -- Van Exel, Steve Nash
and Dirk Nowitzki -- with at least 21 points, through 15
three-pointers in 25 attempts for the Mavericks, through an arena
that began to empty even as they started their comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Don Nelson had ordered the Mavericks into a zone defense, which
surrounded O'Neal and limited Bryant's penetration. That meant jump
shots for the Lakers, no hands in their faces, and they missed most
of them.</TE>
<TE>   But, in the first quarter, O'Neal might have set the mood for
their refusal to quit when he refused to come out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker stood at the scorer's table. The horn sounded.
Walker started in.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neal refused to come out.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson waved at him. O'Neal waved back. "No. I ain't coming."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson laughed. But O'Neal was serious.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the first player I've ever had do that to me," Jackson said.</TE>

<LD>Just when my non-USC friends were beginning to get comfortable with
SC as a serious academic institution and not being the formidable
football foe it used to be, we're getting discussed in Heisman and
national-championship conversations and they all remember how much
they hate the song and the horse!</LD>

<TE>   If a Ted Tollner or Larry Smith Trojan team had suffered a blocked
punt for a touchdown by the Irish just before the half, you'd have
seen that deer-in-the-headlights, here-we-go-again panic on the USC
sideline. But the Pete Carroll Trojans calmly marched 75 yards down
the field in one minute to score a touchdown and retake the lead.
Then Carroll ran off the field smiling and proclaiming to the TV
sideline reporter that he was having a great time.</TE>
<TE>   So was I.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mitchell</TE>

<TE>   What's a lifetime bleeder of Bruin blue to do? If we beat
Washington State, we end up with a decent record and go to a little
better bowl game, but we put USC in the Rose Bowl. If we lose, we
ship SC out of town, get a better payday for the Pac-10, put Bob
Toledo a step nearer unemployment and, best of all, leave the BCS
landscape in disarray. It will take a lot of self-control not to root
for the Cougars.</TE>

<TE>   Fontana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It should now be obvious that any team with the No. 1-rated
schedule will never play for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   If USC had played Podunk U. instead of Kansas State, the Trojans
would have been only one conversion kick from the Fiesta Bowl. USC
has played only one team with a losing record (Stanford). No other
team in the nation can match that kind of pressure. The same holds
true for the Heisman Trophy selection.</TE>
<TE>   Many candidates have run up large numbers against poor teams, but
Carson Palmer has had to play against rated teams every week. I hope
that will be taken into consideration.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I used to think that T.J. Simers was just a bad writer with a bad
attitude. But USC's annihilation of the Bruins and the Irish has
apparently driven him over the edge.</TE>
<TE>   First he scolds local sportswriters and broadcasters for being
"homers." Does he ever read the papers in other cities? Then he
advises the Trojans to be happy with a short trip down the freeway to
the Holiday Bowl instead of a trip to the Orange Bowl or Sugar Bowl.
Why? Trojan fans can drive to the game and have great tailgate
parties. Sure, and he might be happy working for a small paper
somewhere in the Midwest. I suggest one close to the Menninger
Clinic, where he might get some help between the ears.</TE>
<TE>   David Rankin</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The arguments Diane Pucin gives for USC instead of Ohio State
playing Miami are so ridiculous they aren't worth printing in a major
publication. It seems as if the Buckeyes' domination of Washington
State and quarterback Jason Gesser slips her mind. By the way, the
very same Cougar team did beat USC. And Ohio State has beaten three
teams ranked in the top 11. Wake up and smell the roses, Diane. The
Buckeyes proved they belong and USC needs others to help them get
there because they failed to do it on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Berardinelli</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After USC's rout of the Irish, should we call for Coach Willingham
to be fired? After all, wasn't Notre Dame's offense really pretty
pathetic? Why not give the Trojans credit instead of calling for
coaches like Bob Toledo to be let go? Both the Irish and Bruins will
finish their seasons with better records than the experts predicted
at the start to the season.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sick and tired of fans blaming coaches for unrealistic
expectations of their teams.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Newhard</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to evading pressure from frustrated UCLA alumni, how
does Bob Toledo spell relief? L-A-V-I-N.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Rose</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the "Who Would Have Thought?" Department:</TE>
<TE>   Here we are, four years after UCLA's eighth consecutive (and last)
victory over USC, and Cade McNown is out of a job, while Bob Toledo
still has his.</TE>
<TE>   Nunzio Tringali</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, Mike Garrett is pounding his chest, claiming USC is No. 1,
Pete Carroll seems convinced he's the second coming of John McKay,
and every Trojan fan believes Carson Palmer should be given the
Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   The only question remaining is whether Dr. Sample is answering
phone calls from T.J. Simers.</TE>

because Augusta won't jump a woman over those men in line waiting to

<LD>Wait a minute -- Todd Hundley? The king of the meaningless solo
homer? The same catcher whose defensive inadequacies spooked the
entire Dodger pitching staff in 1999 and 2000? The same Todd Hundley
who was so useless the last two seasons that he was openly despised
by Cubs' fans, even though his father is a living Cub legend? Karros
and Grudzielanek are certainly part of what has ailed the Dodgers
these last several years, but trading them for Hundley is like
trading indigestion for irritable bowel syndrome.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was trying to think of a player in the major leagues who can't
run, can't hit, can't throw and can't stand Los Angeles. So were the
Dodgers. Guess who the Dodgers traded for Tuesday?</TE>
<TE>   Geno Apicella</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some time back, The Times slipped the business section in front of
the sports section and while reading J.A. Adande's column ["Deal for
Dollars May Make Sense"] I felt so confused. You see, trading
lifelong Dodger Eric Karros does make business sense, but I thought I
was reading the sports section.</TE>
<TE>   Adande's rationale makes perfect sense in the world of "off-shore
partnerships" and the practice of laying off thousands of employees
while companies are still raking in billions of dollars of profit.
Freeing up dollars to purchase free agents, improving the bottom line
... it makes me sick to my stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros has spent his entire career with the Dodgers and has
always been "a company man." He has never embarrassed the team or its
management, although they damn well deserved it. Look up "sports" in
the dictionary, Mr. Adande, and you may well decide that you are
writing for the wrong section.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Wright</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's the deal here? The Dodgers trade Gary Sheffield away and
the clubhouse rejoices at getting rid of a malcontent, finally
achieving harmony and the chemistry to win a championship. What do we
get? A third-place finish. Now Eric Karros is described as another
malcontent and management rejoices at getting rid of him, no doubt to
encourage us this coming spring that the team has the harmony and
chemistry to win a championship. Does this mean get ready for another
third-place finish?</TE>
<TE>   Another smooth move is getting Todd Hundley back, another
complainer and malcontent who can't hit. I can't wait to hear the
excuses next year.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Mervis</TE>

<LD>How nice of the Lakers to handicap themselves at power forward in
order to give the other Western Conference teams a shot at the title.
With the West neck deep in power-forward talent, our Lakers show up
with a "Buss" load of stiffs.</LD>
<LD>   * Samaki Walker: How many blocked dunks or dropped passes can we
stomach a game? Remember that he couldn't get off the bench with San
Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   * Mark Madsen: Accept the fact he's the mascot, give him a yellow
jumpsuit and have him sing and dance at halftime; do not let him on
the court. The guy's worth four fouls, one rebound and one point a
game!</LD>
<TE>   * Soumaila Samake: Manute Bol can out-bench-press him. Given that
he's 150 pounds at best, he still got suspended for steroids?</TE>
<TE>   * Slava Medvedenko: He led the team with 17 shots, during Shaq's
return game against Chicago. Hey, Slava, stop shooting and play
defense for once!</TE>
<TE>   * Finally the only man who bought himself a pass because of his
clutch playoff performances, Robert Horry. Just remember that he
admits taking regular-season games off.</TE>
<TE>   Place an ad in The Times. There has to be something better.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Kwasniewski</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the Clippers not securing a full television contract, like
many other viewers, I have switched over to a Spanish-speaking
station for my Clipper telecasts. It has been a very positive
experience in my efforts to learn Spanish. I have learned words for
"turnover," "another miss," and "heartbreaking loss."</TE>
<TE>   At the rate I'm learning, I should be able to watch Laker games
within a few days.</TE>

<LD>Can you see it happening?</LD>
<LD>   The NFL wants the Chargers in L.A. and there's nothing we can do

collective football throat with stories planted by the NFL in our
local news and radio. Channel 2 is now televising Charger games
weekly. It's so obvious that even T.J. Simers has it figured out.</LD>
<LD>   Has anyone considered how the L.A. football fan might feel about
this proposed move?</LD>

<LD>It seems everyone is talking about the way Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp
blindsided Green Bay's Chad Clifton, a hit that ended Clifton's
season. I wanted to speak to the parents of the Packer tackle to get
their perspective. So I looked up the Cliftons, who live in Martin,
Tenn., and gave them a call.</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Clifton answered, and I quickly introduced myself and
explained the nature of my call. I told her I understood it was a
sensitive subject and I promised not to take up too much of her time.
She thanked me for that and in a motherly tone agreed to talk for a
few minutes. Our conversation went something like this:</LD>
<LD>   "When the hit comes on TV, can you watch?" I asked.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't at first," she said. "But I can now."</TE>
<TE>   "Have you forgiven Warren Sapp?"</TE>
<TE>   "That was hard," she said. "I was very angry about it. But I've
found it in my heart to forgive him."</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Clifton, according to the Green Bay media guide, Chad played
in a charity softball game for a paralyzed boy. Do you remember
that?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember that game. He's done a lot for charities in this
area, but I don't know if that's accurate."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't want to bother her any longer. I thanked her for her
time, told her I'd keep Chad in my thoughts, and told her how much I
appreciated her discussing her son with me.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'm not Chad's mother," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," I said, embarrassed. "You're his grandmother?"</TE>
<TE>   "No. I don't know Chad. We have the same last name, and we both
live in Martin, but there's no relation."</TE>
<TE>   Just goes to show you, everyone has an opinion on that hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I finally got ahold of Clifton's father, Harold -- his real father
-- and he told me the whole family has been distraught about the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible, just terrible," Harold said.</TE>
<TE>   Chad is still using a walker to get around, and doctors are
considering implanting a metal plate to stabilize his pelvis.
Although he experienced some numbness in his extremities immediately
after the collision, he has regained feeling in those areas. Doctors
told Clifton his spine moved fractionally to the left, but nothing
was cracked and everything should work itself back into alignment. He
plans to keep playing football, too, even though the Packers put him
on injured reserve this week, meaning his season's over.</TE>
<TE>   As for lingering bitterness, his dad said Chad doesn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   "Chad's such a good kid, he wouldn't say anything bad about Sapp,"
said Harold, who confirmed his son did, indeed, play in that charity
softball game.</TE>
<TE>   Harold and his son, Greg, are still angry at Sapp -- who hasn't
tried to contact Chad or his family -- and the league, which did not
penalize or fine the Tampa Bay star.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to call him, [but] I've thought about it several
times," Harold said of Sapp, who maintains a Web site,
www.qbkilla.com. "I started to get on the Internet to speak my mind
about it. Chad's so low-key, he probably wouldn't want me to say
anything to him."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, if that other Clifton lady can forgive him ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players talk about keeping their head on a swivel when they're
around Sapp. They must be talking about his locker-room routine.
After every game, he packs his lower lip with Copenhagen, lays a
white towel at his feet, and uses it as a makeshift spittoon.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of the red-carpet treatment in reverse.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Buffalo quarterback Drew Bledsoe has lots of good
memories of his years playing for New England. Old Foxboro Stadium
isn't one of them. "I wanted to be the one to push the button to blow
that place up," Bledsoe said this week as he prepared for his first
game at New England as a Bill. "That place was horrible. It rained in
the training room. If I came out after the game and spent too much
time with the media, then I had to take a cold shower. The rooms were
small. The weight room was terrible. The locker room was horrible.
The whole place was bad. The only thing that was good about the old
Foxboro Stadium was that on Sunday, when you were on the field, the
fans were really close to you. That was cool. The rest of it
absolutely [stunk]."</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- The Browns are 2-4 at home this season, and those
victories came against Cincinnati and Houston. Quarterback Tim Couch
hasn't been the same since an Oct. 6 loss to Baltimore, when the home
crowd booed him and "cheered" when he went out with a concussion and
was replaced by Kelly Holcomb. In his four years as a pro, Couch is
6-15 when playing at Cleveland. This season he's 1-3 at home and is
coming off a loss to Carolina in which he lost a fumble and three of
his passes were intercepted. Before that game, Fox analyst Jimmy
Johnson said Couch was too inconsistent to be the Browns' quarterback
of the future. That didn't sit well with Cleveland Coach Butch Davis,
even though he and Johnson are friends from their days coaching the
Miami Hurricanes. "I really don't care what Jimmy Johnson thinks,"
Davis said after being apprised of the Couch comments. "He's an
announcer. Unless he's the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, I
don't care."</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Tony Dungy has done a remarkable job turning around a
once-dismal defense in Indianapolis. The Colts, who were 29th in
total defense and last in points allowed in 2001, are now second in
yards allowed per game and third in scoring defense. They get
stronger as the game goes on and have outscored opponents, 105-42, in
the final quarter. The defense Dungy built in Tampa Bay is the
league's best. Dungy is a perfectionist, so he's not satisfied with
the current ranking. "I was a little bit surprised that we were
ranked No. 2 because on my notepad I have a lot of scratches in
there," he said this week. "We're still, I think, a work in progress.
But we're playing better."</TE>
<TE>   In Tennessee's last two games, Eddie George has been on the
sideline for the offense's final drive. What gives? It seems the
Titans think Robert Holcombe hits the holes quicker as the game wears
on. "As a competitor, you want to be out there battling," George
said. "You make mistakes and I wanted to fight through it. [Coach
Jeff Fisher] says I'm his running back. We'll see. We'll see if I get
the carries. That's all I can say."</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST --  Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon really rattled the
Denver defense last month when he repeatedly audibled at the line of
scrimmage and seemed to be reading the Broncos' minds. "I see a lot
of teams doing what Gannon did, checking off at the line, having
quarterback audibles," linebacker John Mobley told the Denver Post.
"Usually, teams just line up and call the play that they had called."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos have been penalized 32 times during their current 1-3
slide. "Somewhere along the way I really feel we've lost discipline,"
receiver Rod Smith told the Rocky Mountain News. "I don't know where
or when it started ... but it's got to leave if we want to get where
we want to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers play host to the Raiders on Sunday, and the San Diego
players have to like their odds. Coach Marty Schottenheimer's teams
are 20-5 against the Raiders, and when he was with Kansas City there
was a stretch when he absolutely owned them. Schottenheimer preached
to his players to hang with the Raiders for a while, then watch them
crumble under the weight of their own mistakes -- usually turnovers.
Gannon does a good job of protecting the ball, though, and is great
at keeping his teammates focused.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- The Giants surrendered 476 yards to Tennessee last
Sunday, the highest yardage total given up by New York since 1988.
Things are heading in the opposite direction for the Eagles, whose
defense has improved dramatically since it was unable to protect a
big lead against the Titans in the opener. The 9-3 Eagles, off to
their best 12-game start since 1981, have made up for all their
quarterback injuries with outstanding defense. In their last three
games -- victories over the Cardinals, 49ers and Rams -- the Eagles
have yielded only four offensive touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- It's hard to overstate Brett Favre's value to the
Packers. Begin with this: Favre has 112 victories, by far the most
among active quarterbacks. Vinny Testaverde is second with 80; Gannon
and Bledsoe are way back in third with 69 each. Favre also has a 66.3
winning percentage, best in the league among regular starters who
have had their job longer than a season. The mercury is dropping in
Green Bay, and that's not good news for the visiting Vikings. Favre
is 33-0 at Lambeau Field when the temperature at kickoff is 34
degrees or colder.</TE>
<TE>   Looks like Mike Alstott can have his A-Train nickname back. The
erstwhile A-Train, Chicago's Anthony Thomas, had an all-too-human
second season after a marvelous rookie year. A season after he was
chosen NFL offensive rookie of the year, Thomas rushed for 721 yards
at a meager 3.4 yards a pop, which ties him for the league's worst
per-carry average among backs with 600 yards or more. Thomas, whose
season is over because of a broken finger, started 12 games this fall
but was losing playing time to veteran Leon Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Tampa Bay has Coach Chucky but Atlanta has Freddy
Krueger. That's what Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden calls Falcon
quarterback Michael Vick, who strikes fear in the heart of any
opposing defensive coordinator. "This guy is a revolutionary man,"
said Gruden, whose team will face Vick on Sunday. "I used to think
Steve Young revolutionized the system of football that I always study
with his unique scrambling ability. I hate to tell Steve Young this,
but this guy is ... a lot faster. There's not a guy like him that
I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta has 14 sacks in the past two games, as many as the Falcons
had in their first seven games. They have 25 in their last five
games, more than half of those by defensive linemen. Then again,
these guys watch Vick in practice every day, so it must make it look
as if every other quarterback is trudging along in slow motion.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Dolphins, the team pulling hardest for Ricky Williams
is the Saints. Williams needs 216 yards to reach 1,500, which, by
terms of the trade between the teams, would give New Orleans another
first-round pick in the 2003 draft.</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- Two years have passed since San Francisco receiver
Terrell Owens scored a touchdown against the Cowboys, dashed to
midfield and did a dance on the Texas Stadium star. To some Dallas
players, the indignity feels like it happened yesterday. "It was
uncalled for," said Cowboy defensive end Greg Ellis, whose team will
play host to the 49ers on Sunday. "I don't care what the situation
is. You should not go out and do that to anyone. We want to make sure
it doesn't happen again, point blank."</TE>
<TE>   Or, in the case of the signature-happy Owens, ballpoint blank.</TE>

<HD>Faulk Makes More Progress, Could Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marshall Faulk could make his first start in a month Sunday for St.
Louis against Kansas City.</LD>
<LD>   The all-pro running back has been hampered by a sprained right
ankle, playing as a reserve in last week's 10-3 Ram loss to
Philadelphia. He rushed for 29 yards in nine carries and caught four
passes for 22 yards in his first game in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In practice Friday, Faulk divided the work with rookie Lamar
Gordon, who will make his fourth straight start if Faulk isn't ready.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll talk to Marshall. He surprised me. He's made a lot of
progress," Coach Mike Martz said. "We'll see how he's doing and if he
feels like he's ready to, we'll start him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Michael Vick's shoes are headed to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The Hall called Friday to request the shoes Vick wore in a 30-24
overtime victory at Minnesota last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Vick's 173 yards rushing set a single-game record for NFL
quarterbacks. Green Bay's Tobin Rote established the previous mark of
150 yards in a loss to the Chicago Bears on Nov. 18, 1951.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has denied Baltimore Raven receiver Javin Hunter's appeal
of a four-game suspension for using the banned substance ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter will miss the last four regular-season games, but he will
be eligible for the playoffs if the Ravens qualify.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Dolphin quarterback Ray Lucas returned to practice and will
back up Jay Fiedler against the Chicago Bears on Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas returned to practice for the first time since injuring his
shoulder in Sunday's loss to Buffalo. He had sat out the last two
days of practice.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler will make his first start since breaking his right thumb
Oct. 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear linebacker Brian Urlacher sat out practice again, but
his ailing left shoulder has shown signs of improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Urlacher, who hasn't missed a game in his three seasons, hurt his
shoulder two weeks ago against Detroit but still played last Sunday
against Green Bay. He was listed as questionable for Monday night's
game at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "They said he's improved," Bear Coach Dick Jauron said. "We're a
little more hopeful than we were earlier in the week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan end Jevon Kearse practiced with the defense
Friday, but whether he plays against the Indianapolis Colts will be a
game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kearse broke his left foot in the opener, his work on the
practice field had been limited to running on the side or with the
scout team.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Steve McNair missed his third straight day of practice
because of toe and rib injuries. He is expected to play Sunday, as he
did last week in a 32-29 overtime victory over the New York Giants
despite sitting out practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers could be without four starters Sunday night
against Minnesota. Running back Ahman Green, wide receiver Terry
Glenn, defensive tackle Gilbert Brown and cornerback Tyrone Williams
didn't practice the entire week, and Coach Mike Sherman said he
didn't know if they would be ready for the game.</TE>

<HD>Santos at a Disadvantage in Home-Game Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home-field advantage doesn't mean much in Brazil, where it can
sometimes be taken away altogether.</LD>
<LD>   That's what happened to Santos on Friday. The club made famous by
Pele more than three decades ago was told that it cannot play its
home game in the two-game Brazilian championship final in its own
Vila Belmira stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Brazilian soccer federation's often confusing rules state that
title matches can only be in stadiums that hold more than 25,000.
Vila Belmira does not meet that criterion.</LD>
<TE>   Worse yet for Santos, both halves of the final must be played at
the Morumbi stadium in Sao Paulo, which is where its championship
opponent, Corinthians, plays most of its significant matches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our right to play at the Vila," Santos Coach Emerson Leao
angrily told Reuters. "Until now, everything has been difficult, we
have always been underdogs and we have overturned the disadvantage by
winning our match at home."</TE>
<TE>   Toluca Tale</TE>
<TE>   In a strange move, Toluca, one of Mexico's most powerful teams,
asked the Mexican soccer federation on Friday if it could "borrow"
Mexico national team Coach Ricardo Lavolpe for today's playoff
quarterfinal game against Chivas of Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   Lavolpe had coached Toluca until being hired as Mexico's coach in
October, when he was replaced by Wilson Graneolatti.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca lost the first game of the two-game series, 2-1, at
Guadalajara and must win today or be eliminated. Rather than being
angered, Graneolatti said "there won't be a problem" if Lavolpe
returns for the one game.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Backer</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal striker Thierry Henry said last month that he does not
believe Real Madrid's Ronaldo should be chosen as Europe's 2002
player of the year simply because he won the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Henry got support for that stance from an unlikely
source: Alfredo Di Stefano, the former Real Madrid star who is
honorary president of the club. He told the Spanish sports daily As
that Henry deserves the award.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, Arsenal's Henry is playing the best football in
Europe at the moment," Di Stefano said. "I also believe he has been
the best player in Europe for some time now."</TE>
<TE>   Key to the City</TE>
<TE>   Former Southampton and England national team midfielder Matthew Le
Tissier will be honored by the port city today when he is named
"Honorary Freeman of the City of Southampton" for his services to the
local club.</TE>
<TE>   Le Tissier, 34, retired in May after spending his entire 16-year
professional career with Southampton, playing 462 games and scoring
209 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Euro 2004</TE>
<TE>   Gilberto Madail, chairman of the organizing committee for the 2004
European Championship in Portugal, said Friday that all 10 stadiums
to be used in the tournament are on course to have the $550 million
in construction or redevelopment work complete by the September 2003
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, one or two are behind, and one or two ahead of
schedule," Madail said. "But no stadium risks not being ready by the
deadline."</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and El Salvador will play each other today at Estadio
Cuscatlan in San Salvador in the championship game of the XIX Central
American and Caribbean Games.... Nacional of Uruguay needs a tie
against Danubio on Sunday to win the Uruguayan league title for the
third year in a row. Nacional defeated Danubio, 2-1, in the first of
the two-game championship series.</TE>

<HD>Raging Gracefully</HD>
<DH>Stewart's combativeness is a throwback to the good ol'
days, but new Winston Cup champion has a kinder, gentler side too</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Picture this scenario, NASCAR fans:</LD>
<LD>   Late on a steamy summer afternoon in the Carolina sand hills, a
souped-up Pontiac, heavy to the ground with a load of moonshine,
comes blasting through a wooded intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Lying in wait, the revenuers are suddenly jarred from their
lethargy.</LD>
<TE>   "Holy cow, he must be going 100. It's gotta be Tony."</TE>
<TE>   From the speeding car comes a shout, "I'll be back through here,
guys, in a couple of hours."</TE>
<TE>   It's pitch black outside when the same Pontiac comes racing back
in the opposite direction, lights off and never slowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Damn, it's Tony and we missed him again."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart didn't get his start running bootleg whiskey in the
Piedmont, as the early NASCAR champions did. He started on a little
dirt track near his home in Westport, Ind., when he was 7. But the
2002 Winston Cup champion, driver of the orange-and-white No. 20 Home
Depot Pontiac, is the nearest thing to a reincarnation of Junior
Johnson, Little Joe Weatherly or Curtis Turner that the
billion-dollar stock car organization has seen in many a moon.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR has changed as much as its drivers, shedding its "good ol'
boy" image of moonshine haulers to a slick, Madison Avenue corporate
public relations look personified by Jeff Gordon. Part of that has
been to take fighting -- on the track, in the garages and even
verbally on TV sound bites -- out of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Back when the backwoods booze was being hauled into the cities
clandestinely and the drivers met on Sundays to race for bragging
rights, fighting settled the disputes. Even after Big Bill France
organized them into what is now NASCAR, scrapping continued. Drivers
who were cut off on the track, or insulted to their face, did not go
running to the NASCAR truck to lodge a complaint -- they headed
straight for a pit or garage, sometimes with tire iron in hand, to
uphold their ideas of what was right.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, as NASCAR began to shed its Southeastern heritage,
the sport has been sanitized. Now along comes Tony Stewart, a temper
to go with his passion for driving. His dark, brooding eyes and a
perpetual 5 o'clock shadow make him perfect for the Hollywood image
of a bad guy.</TE>
<TE>   When Stewart punched out an Indianapolis Star photographer last
August at the Brickyard 400, the racing media -- which had often
found him adversarial -- had a field day ripping the 31-year-old
Indianan for his behavior, even going so far as to question his being
able to properly "represent NASCAR as its champion."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has a two-pronged answer.</TE>
<TE>   "The smartest decision I made this year was to quit reading
newspapers and magazines and not listen to TV shows about racing," he
said during a whirlwind tour of New York this week before accepting
his champion's check for $4,305,607 at Friday night's NASCAR banquet.
With season earnings and postseason contingency money, he received
checks totaling $9,163,761.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are going to write what they want, no matter what I say.
Some of them I respect, the ones who get out and do their homework in
the garage, but some of the guys don't do a thing but sit in the
media center and take what the publicity guys hand them. I don't have
any respect for them because I know they don't even know what they're
writing about.</TE>
<TE>   "I became disappointed with the media a long time ago. So many of
them thrive on controversy, so I let the media do what it does, and I
do what I do best, and that's drive."</TE>
<TE>   What about representing NASCAR?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't sign up to be a representative of anything. I do what I
came here to do. That's run 36 Winston Cup races, and just because I
came out on top in points, that doesn't give me any other
responsibilities, except to my team. If everybody wants to make it a
lot more complicated than that, I'm going to be pretty disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to change a thing in my response to the public.
It's not an elected office. If you want an ambassador for the sport,
maybe you should go get Richard Petty."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was put to the test this week, scheduled for a media blitz
by NASCAR and Winston Cup personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, he was on "The Today Show," "Best Damn Sports Show
Period" and with talk-show host Greta Van Susteren. On Wednesday, he
had interviews with the New York-area media at lunch, did five-minute
on-air interviews with 20 TV reporters from across the country and
attended a media reception in the evening. On Thursday, he did
morning radio call-in shows and participated in NASCAR's one-on-one
interviews for its 10 top drivers. And Friday he did numerous photo
shoots before the banquet.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight was handing over keys to a new fire engine-red
Corvette to his crew chief, Greg Zipadelli, fulfilling a promise he'd
made a year ago when he off-handedly said that if Zipadelli got him a
Winston Cup championship, he would buy him a hot new car.</TE>
<TE>   When Zipadelli came out of the Waldorf-Astoria lobby to Park
Avenue, the car was parked there, Stewart grinning beside it.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't think I was going to enjoy this week at all,"
Stewart said Friday before the awards ceremony. "You know, dealing
with the media five days in a row. I thought I'd be on suicide watch
by now, but it's been great. I'm having a blast."</TE>
<TE>   For the media, it was a chance to see the other side of Stewart, a
fun-loving practical joker around his friends and racing peers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the fans could see us [Winston Cup drivers] for a half-hour
away from the track, they would have an entirely different picture of
us," he said. "At the track, you have to be intense if you expect to
win. But away from the track, we like having a good time as much as
anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like 43 brothers out there, all one big family, so if a
couple of us don't mix it up once in a while, it means one of us
isn't being very competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Denny Darnell, Winston Cup's chief representative here, has hosted
four champions at the Waldorf -- Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte
and Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as surprised as Tony is at his behavior and his presence with
the media this week," said Darnell. "Gordon sort of set the standard
for this New York tour, but I would say that Tony has handled it as
well as or better than anyone. We really didn't know what to expect
from him."</TE>
<TE>   Quite a contrast from the tempestuous season that concluded two
weeks ago with Stewart's 18th-place finish at Homestead, Fla., giving
him a 38-point margin over veteran Mark Martin for his first Winston
Cup championship -- but his eighth title since his first go-kart race
in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   His collection of championships includes the Indy Racing League in
1997, U.S. Auto Club "triple crown" of sprint cars, midgets and
Silver Crown cars in 1995, the USAC midgets in 1994, World Karting
Assn. in 1987 and International Karting Federation Grand National in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   There is one way a driver like Stewart can survive in today's PR
world -- be so good that he can't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot, his primary sponsor, knows that. When Stewart lost his
temper and hit the photographer after the race in Indianapolis, he
was fined $50,000, but wasn't suspended.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony's an executive, really, with Home Depot and in a lot of ways
he represents them corporately," said Joe Gibbs, Stewart's car owner.
"So Bob Nardelli [Home Depot's chief executive] is probably one of
the greatest Tony Stewart fans and he knows any action by Tony would
obviously have an effect on the Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just a series of serious discussions between us and
them, and then we laid out a plan of what we thought was best. We
were never close to saying, 'Tony, you're fired,' but you obviously
know that any driver here can do things that would cost him his job.
So we kind of sat down and told him this is what the future needs to
be like."</TE>
<TE>   There were other transgressions, but NASCAR did not suspend
Stewart, as it had done with Kevin Harvick earlier. Instead he was
put on "zero tolerance" probation, making him the first champion to
finish his season in that manner.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had been any driver other than Tony, given his history, the
other [incidents] would probably not have been an issue," said NASCAR
Vice President Jim Hunter after a protest of Stewart's actions before
the season's final race.</TE>
<TE>   If he had been forced to miss a race, it would have cost him the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs, who learned about taming raw personalities when he had John
Riggins on one of the three Washington Redskin Super Bowl
championship teams he coached, hired a sports psychologist, Jack
Llewellyn, to work with Stewart on anger management.</TE>
<TE>   Riggins is the former Redskin running back who, during a speech by
then-Vice President George Bush at the National Press Club, leaned
across a banquet table and purportedly said to Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, "Loosen up, Sandy, baby. You're too tight."</TE>
<TE>   "Tony's not really like Riggins," Gibbs said. "Tony's problems
come from an intense personality at the race track where he wears his
emotions on his sleeve and doesn't let others enter his little world.
At times, Tony steps over the line, but one good thing about him,
he's always come right back the next day when something happened and
said, 'Hey, it's my fault.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in interviews this week, Stewart explained, "At Indy, the
cup of frustration [at finishing 12th after starting on the pole]
finally overflowed. It was a negative for the weekend, but a positive
for the rest of my life. I sincerely think it happened for a reason,
and I am better for it."</TE>
<TE>   The team stuck behind Stewart, helping him win on the road course
at Watkins Glen, N.Y., the next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "In Winston Cup, you have a lot of tough weeks and that might have
been our team's toughest week," said Zipadelli. "We all sat and
talked about it, thought long and hard about it, and what got us to
the point where we were at. A great part of that was Tony.</TE>
<TE>   "We know him outside this world and he's honestly, truly one of
the best people I've gotten to know, hang out with and have fun with.
That had to be an extremely mental week for him. Everybody was poking
him, prodding at him for all that had happened the week before. He
handled it well and went on and did what he was supposed to do -- get
in that car, drive it to the best of his ability."</TE>
<TE>   The win moved Stewart from seventh to fourth in points and put the
team in position to claim the lead with a second-place finish at
Talladega, seven races from the end. Once in front, Stewart never
lost the lead.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no letup for Stewart since winning the
championship. He was home "about eight hours" before leaving for San
Diego, where his girlfriend, Jaime Schaffer, lives, and then to
Irwindale Speedway for two USAC races Thanksgiving night.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it set in that I had won the Winston Cup until I
got to Irwindale and all my old USAC buddies starting calling me
Champ," said Stewart, who won a 40-lap sprint car event before
crashing in the Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix, an accident more
serious than he admitted at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was running third when the throttle stuck on A.J. Fike's
car, which rammed Stewart's midget. Both cars hit the wall with a
tremendous impact, totaling Stewart's car, the one he'd won with in
2000 and had pulled out of his museum to run again this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll never race again, I'm sure of that," Stewart said. "It was
a mess and so was I. I took a real lick. The next day I had blurred
vision in one eye and didn't think I could race Saturday at Las
Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   But he did, winning two 30-lap main events, one for sprint cars,
the other for midgets.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs, asked about having a driver who risked serious injuries
running open-wheel races, could only shake his head and say, "I wish
he wouldn't do it. Or I wish I wouldn't hear about it."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great way to relax after the grind of a Winston Cup
season," Stewart countered.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Stewart, Schaffer, Gibbs, Zipadelli and their wives
were guests of President Bush in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an awesome experience to know you were standing next to
the most powerful man in the world," Stewart said. "He showed us all
around the office, explaining about each of the pictures on the wall
and how the presidential desk changed from president to president,
depending on their size, and how it had a flap in front to hide
[Franklin] Roosevelt's [polio-shriveled] legs.</TE>
<TE>   "But the best thing was when a guy opened the door and said, 'OK,
come on in,' and about 100 photogs charged into the room, clicking
off so many pictures it sounded like bees buzzing. Then, in about 15
seconds, he said, 'OK, out,' and they disappeared. I wish NASCAR
could do something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday there was a visit to the NYPD's Midtown precinct, an
experience that gave Stewart a good message.</TE>
<TE>   "I've sat in traffic plenty of times and got so mad at officers
when I got pulled over, but they get such a bad rap, without people
really knowing them as a person. I can relate to them because if you
spend a half-hour with me, I'm not that bad a person, either."</TE>
<TE>   Then it was off to 85th Street and the Engine 22/Ladder 13 NYFD
station.</TE>
<TE>   "We met about 15 firefighters; all of them had been at Ground Zero
on 9/11. One guy was the only one on his truck that survived. Seeing
all those memorials on the wall made a tremendous impression on all
of us. Then ... they got a call for a fire and it really hit us how
these guys put their lives on the line every time they go out.</TE>
<TE>   "They let me slide down the pole and that's when I found out how
much I was hurting from that Irwindale crash. I had aches everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Joe that even if I don't come back here as champion next
year, I'm coming back and visit these guys. They are something
special."</TE>
<TE>   That night, he and Schaffer and some friends saw a Broadway show,
"Mama Mia."</TE>
<TE>   "Now that may be the biggest surprise of the week," he said, "Tony
Stewart dressed up in a coat and tie, going to a Broadway show. I can
hardly wait to hear what the guys back in Rushville [Ind.] say when
they hear about it."</TE>

<HD>Tiger Puts on Breaks With a 65</HD>
<DH>Woods dominates his matchup with Mickelson, gets a
favorable bounce and leads by one shot at Sherwood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He can drive the ball from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard and that makes it
hard enough on everybody else, but what can you do when Tiger Woods
caroms his tee shot off a hill at the back of a par-three green, sees
the ball bounce back and watches it roll 18 inches from the hole?</LD>
<LD>   In other words, what happens when the best player in the world is
lucky too?</LD>
<LD>   Friday at Sherwood Country Club, what happened was a
seven-under-par 65, a seven-birdie, no-bogey round that vaulted him
into a one-shot lead over Padraig Harrington and Davis Love III after
the second round of the Target World Challenge.</LD>
<TE>   Woods laughed at his good fortune at 17.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to hit a soft nine-iron," he said. "I hit a soft
nine-iron flop hook that had delayed spin. It came off the hill with
a left-to-right spin, rolled through the rough and left myself about
a foot and a half for a birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, it was a great shot, wasn't it? I got a great
break."</TE>
<TE>   If he's playing pingpong, Woods wants to win. If he's playing
cards, he wants to win. Roller hockey, pickup basketball, polo,
dominoes, Monopoly, spelling bee, it doesn't matter: Tiger plays to
win.</TE>
<TE>   Even golf ... especially golf, regardless of the stakes, which
means that a $3.8-million special event like this one, with nothing
to lose except the chance to bring home a truckload of money, is not
something Woods is going to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Woods and Phil Mickelson started at four under and played
together, but Woods picked up nine shots on Mickelson, who drove the
ball poorly and finished with a 74.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mickelson, "It's not just my driving. It's every shot."</TE>
<TE>   Woods was sympathetic. "He had a tough day," Tiger said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Woods, who is at 11-under 133, his day was a breeze. He was
the only player in the field of 16 without a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   There are five par-five holes at Sherwood and Woods birdied them
all. As good as that was, Harrington was even better, playing them
six under and making eagle at No. 2 for the second day in a row.</TE>
<TE>   He bogeyed the 18th after driving too far left to risk going for
the green, but Harrington still managed a 69 and is at 10-under 134.
Love, who was in Sun Valley on a snowboarding vacation last week,
still managed to hit some golf balls because there wasn't a lot of
snow. Love eagled the second, birdied two of the last three holes and
signed for a 68.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington played in only nine events that are sanctioned by the
PGA Tour, but only two of them were regular tour events and the rest
were the four majors and three of the World Golf Championship events.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says the Irishman would benefit from playing more PGA Tour
events, and so would the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Padraig is a great player," Woods said. "He's so consistent, week
in and week out. He'd be a great addition.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't hurt him because you're playing against deeper
fields. That's going to enhance your experience."</TE>
<TE>   But Harrington likes his schedule the way it is and says he won't
change it to play more in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still progressing now in Europe," he said. "I do like playing
in the U.S. I like the speed of the greens -- they're a little
quicker, but there's not enough time in the year to play all the
tournaments I want to play. I really like playing around the world
and if I committed to here, it would limit everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Price had a 70 and is two shots behind Woods. Bernhard
Langer's 65 moved him into a tie for fifth with Retief Goosen and
David Toms.</TE>

<HD>Bruins May Have the Swing Vote</HD>
<DH>UCLA can knock Washington State out of return trip to the
Rose Bowl (and maybe save Toledo's job).</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a baseball bromide, it ranks with "Take it one game at a time,"
and "Keep your eye on the ball."</LD>
<LD>   "Stay within yourself," coaches tell players before big games. It
means avoiding the adrenaline-fueled temptation to accomplish more
than is necessary, such as trying to hit a 500-foot home run when a
single will do.</LD>
<LD>   Inevitably, a player who doesn't heed the advice tightens up,
forgets the fundamentals and fails.</LD>
<TE>   The UCLA football team has many players who excelled at baseball
in high school. Quarterback Drew Olson was a pro prospect as a
catcher. His backup, Matt Moore, was a tremendous shortstop. Safety
Jarrad Page turned down a $700,000 big league signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerbacks Ricky Manning Jr. and Matt Ware are, in fact, pro
baseball players, pursuing their careers each summer in the minor
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Yet against USC two weeks ago, nearly all the Bruins got caught up
in the heated-rivalry atmosphere, made a string of fatal mistakes
early and lost, 52-21.</TE>
<TE>   Stayed within themselves? Hardly. They had a full-blown
out-of-body experience.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much emotion that everything is taken out of you,
once there are some mistakes and you fall behind," Olson said. "We
all learned a lesson. You can't try to do too much. It was a huge
lesson and we were all embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (7-4) promise to take a different approach today
against No. 7 Washington State (9-2) in a game with enormous
implications, national and local. The atmosphere, however, should be
conducive to calm nerves. Only about 55,000 are expected at the Rose
Bowl, compared to the 91,000 that jammed the place against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "This game matters to a lot of people, but we are taking it as a
regular game and approaching it like that," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome will have a ripple effect throughout college football,
determining the bowl fortunes of more than a dozen teams, most of
whom want UCLA to win and oust Washington State from the bowl
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   There is a huge financial stake for the Pacific 10 Conference,
which wants UCLA to lose, probably ensuring two BCS teams from the
conference. A UCLA loss sends Washington State to the Rose Bowl and
USC probably to the Orange Bowl or Sugar Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   However, Trojan fans able to stomach the idea are pulling for a
UCLA victory, which would put USC in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It is exciting," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "We have a chance to
knock [Washington State] out of the Rose Bowl race, to change a lot
of the bowl pictures and the BCS."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo has a chance to do something else as well -- save his job.
The second consecutive humiliating loss to USC triggered an
outpouring of venom among Bruin followers, many of whom wield
influence.</TE>
<TE>   Another defeat -- even in a game the Bruins are not favored to win
-- could prompt Athletic Director Dan Guerrero to recommend to
Chancellor Albert Carnesale that Toledo be replaced. Indications are
that Carnesale, who has previously overruled some athletic department
decisions, would sign off on whatever Guerrero decides.</TE>
<TE>   If Toledo does survive another loss, it will be primarily for
financial reasons. UCLA has never paid coaches the going rate, which
in football is skyrocketing. On Thursday, Texas A&amp;M agreed to pay
Dennis Franchione about $2 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Firing Toledo would involve buying out his contract at $1.3
million, then hiring a new coach at more than double Toledo's salary
of $578,000. Even though boosters have pledged to pay for Toledo's
buyout, the powers that be in the UC system might not like the math,
especially when UCLA generally exceeded expectations by posting a
winning record in a rebuilding season.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done some good things and I hope that won't be forgotten,"
Toledo said. "We've got a running start into next year. We've got a
lot of young football players who've played and a lot more who are
redshirting.</TE>
<TE>   "The team, the program, is really looking up. I think we have the
chance to have an excellent team next year."</TE>
<TE>   The clock is still ticking on this year. Beating Washington State
will be difficult, whether or not Cougar quarterback Jason Gesser has
recovered sufficiently from a high ankle sprain to play.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser, when sound, is one of the most dangerous playmakers in the
nation. Backup quarterback Matt Kegel, 6-5 and 239 pounds, is a
prototype drop-back passer in the Carson Palmer mold.</TE>
<TE>   Manning and Ware, the cornerbacks, are considered a Bruin strong
point, but they were burned by USC receivers. What can they do
different today? As baseball players, they know the drill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be another hyped-up game," Ware said. "There's a
lot riding on it. We have to remember to play within ourselves. When
you don't, mistakes are made and they exploit it."</TE>

<HD>Craven Looks for His Soph Touch</HD>
<DH>USC guard struggles to find his freshman form under weight
of expectations, as 2-2 Trojans struggle too.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>This isn't how Errick Craven had envisioned it.</LD>
<LD>   As USC's leading returning scorer, the sophomore shooting guard
had expected to be the most consistent Trojan on an inconsistent
team. But as the struggling Trojans, in search of an identity after
losing three senior starters, head into today's Wooden Classic game
against No. 15 Missouri, the weight of preseason expectations has
caused Craven to buckle a bit.</LD>
<LD>   "I tend to over-analyze things and I think that threw me off my
game," said Craven, who also admitted to forcing shots and playing
outside of the offense. "I felt a little pressure at first but now
it's like we just need to win, do what it takes to get wins.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be down on myself. We lost games but I don't
think it's just because of me. I think I could have produced more to
help the team but the suspensions and just not making baskets messes
up the rhythm of the whole season and the season hasn't gone
smoothly."</TE>
<TE>   Suspensions? The even-tempered Craven? The guy Coach Henry Bibby
referred to as the best freshman he'd ever coached and the most
spectacular freshman at USC since Harold Miner in 1989-90?</TE>
<TE>   It's true.</TE>
<TE>   Craven has already been dinged by Bibby the disciplinarian three
times this season. He couldn't dress for Midnight Madness after
missing a team meeting, was benched for the first 13 minutes of a
season-opening win over UC Riverside after showing up to the arena
five minutes late, and was suspended for the Morris Brown game after
switching roommates on a trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I got away with it a little but this year I can't,"
Craven said. "I was late last year but I wasn't penalized for it.
This year I got made an example of. I have to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's staff has spent the early part of this season trying to
wean Craven and his twin brother, Derrick, from each other. But on
the trip to Rhode Island, Errick, who was rooming with Kostas
Charissis, and Rory O'Neil, who was bunking with Derrick, swapped so
the Cravens could be together.</TE>
<TE>   "We switched rooms and didn't think too much of it, since we share
the same toothpaste and stuff, the same toiletries," Errick said. "I
thought it was a mistake ... but I ended up getting penalized for
it."</TE>
<TE>   As did O'Neil, who was also benched against Morris Brown.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though Craven is playing badly. He is the team's
third-leading scorer with a 12.3 average, incrementally better than
last year's 11.8.</TE>
<TE>   But he's shooting only 35.9%, almost 10 points below last season's
45%, and his rebounding average of 3.7 is down from last season's
4.4.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting for Errick to show up," Bibby said after USC's
69-53 loss at UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure of preseason expectations?</TE>
<TE>   "It could be," Bibby said. "I think he can handle it. He's
super-talented, but this year all eyes are on him. Last year they
were on Sam [Clancy], Dave [Bluthenthal] and Brandon [Granville] and
he could sneak in there and have success. With everybody looking at
him, he can't go hide now."</TE>
<TE>   Derrick agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the same guy, people are just focusing on him now," he said.
"The expectations, he's not used to it because the college hype is a
whole different element from high school."</TE>
<TE>   After making only two of 13 shots against Santa Barbara, Errick
went to a familiar place for advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to my mom [Sonya] about it and she just explained that I
had some bad games and I can't let that get the best of me," Craven
said. "It's frustrating because I look back and I analyze what I'm
doing wrong but I don't think I'm doing much wrong. It's just not
going my way. The ball's going to eventually drop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really concerned about what people think, what people
expect of me. I just have to play hard and try to do the best that I
can."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Trojan senior point guard Robert Hutchinson sat out
practice again Friday with a sprained right ankle and is doubtful for
today's game. Expect Derrick Craven to get the start. As an assistant
at Arizona State in 1984-85, Bibby tried to recruit Missouri Coach
Quin Snyder, who was a McDonald's All-American at Mercer Island
(Wash.) High, but Snyder went to Duke. The Tigers have won their
three games by an average margin of 29.3 points and have three
players averaging more than 16 points in center Arthur Johnson and
guard Ricky Clemons (17 each) and guard Rickey Paulding (16.7). Long
Beach Jordan High alumnus Travon Bryant, a junior forward, is
averaging 8.7 points and 6.3 rebounds.</TE>

<HD>Giants' Fassel Misses the Point in Close Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Coach Jim Fassel of the New York Giants finds himself without a
job next season, he won't have to work hard at figuring what went
wrong.</LD>
<LD>   He can look back on Sunday's must-win game against the Tennessee
Titans, which the Giants lost in overtime, 32-29.</LD>
<LD>   For reasons that remain unexplained, Fassel suffered severe brain
lock. With 14:15 left in the fourth quarter, Tiki Barber scored,
boosting the Giants' lead to 26-14. Fassel checked his two-point
conversion chart, then decided against kicking the extra point.</LD>
<TE>   That decision may haunt him for the rest of his coaching career.
Quarterback Kerry Collins threw incomplete on a sloppy pass play,
leaving the window open for Tennessee's comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Titan quarterback Steve McNair tied the score with nine seconds
left in regulation by running for two after throwing a nine-yard
scoring strike to Frank Wycheck.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants did not lose the game because of that failed two-point
conversion play but Fassel's mental error made things much easier for
the Titans. Matt Bryant kicked a field goal with 2:21 left in the
fourth quarter, which gave the Giants an eight-point, instead of
nine-point, lead, meaning the Titans needed only one possession to
tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had your guys' perspective, then I would say, 'Yeah, I
should have kicked it,' " Fassel told reporters Monday. "Fortunately
or unfortunately, I am not a hindsight person. I am a
decision-maker."</TE>
<TE>   Now you understand why NFL coaches, who never like to be
second-guessed, were against the two-point conversion when it was
adopted in 1994. They didn't want the pressure, which is why so many
rely on the conversion chart.</TE>
<TE>   This season, teams have made 46% -- 34 of 74 -- of their
two-pointers. According to STATS Inc., the rate since the league put
in the rule is 43.2% -- 371 of 858. Teams successful on two-point
attempts have won more than 50% of their games this season -- 18-14-1
-- so going for two is not always a bad thing. But when is the right
time?</TE>
<TE>   When to go for two: Dick Vermeil was the offensive coordinator at
UCLA in 1970 when he and Coach Tommy Prothro came up with a chart to
answer that question. If you're bad at math, the chart works for you.
But you always have to consider the game situation first.</TE>
<TE>   Going for two at any time other than very late in the game usually
is risky, because it is impossible to anticipate how the scoring will
go and a missed point often becomes costly. With a 98% conversion
rate on kicks, it's always smart to take the "automatic" point
instead of taking the chance for two.</TE>
<TE>   But if you have to go for two, the key is to have a play that will
work. Usually it's something that hasn't been used before to catch
the opponent off guard.</TE>
<TE>   It also helps if the offense knows in advance that it will be
going for two. The quicker a team can get in and out of the huddle
after a touchdown, the better. Fassel failed to do that Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters that he normally informs his players they will
be going for two before they start a drive, but ...</TE>
<TE>   That's why there was so much confusion after Barber's touchdown
run had given the Giants a 12-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Fassel's next mistake was not having a solid play to use. Collins
was pressured and threw a poor pass, intended for tight end Jeremy
Shockey, into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   When not to go for two: Coaches sometimes go for two prematurely,
as did Fassel against Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a team has a poor kicker, an offense should never go for
two before the fourth quarter and never when ahead by more than six
points. Coaches tend to lose their players' trust when they coach
scared.</TE>
<TE>   Fassel went for two knowing the Titans would have the wind at
their backs in the fourth quarter. He figured, with nearly a quarter
to go, that a 14-point lead would be better than 13.</TE>
<TE>   Fassel thus showed little confidence in his offense, assuming that
the Giants would not score for the rest of the game because they were
going into the wind.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants had already been successful going in that
direction. They had scored in the second quarter and would score
again in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, New York actually lost the game when it drove to the
Titans' one-yard line late in the quarter. With a five-point lead,
the Giants couldn't get into the end zone on three poorly executed
plays and had to settle for a field goal. The rest is history.</TE>

<LD>Lake Balboa Birmingham took control of its City Section semifinal
Friday night by converting two Gardena turnovers into touchdowns in
the first quarter, then ended the Panthers' comeback bid by doing the
same in the fourth quarter for a 34-20 victory at Pierce College.</LD>
<LD>   The victory advances the sixth-seeded Patriots (10-3) into their
first final since 1961.</LD>
<LD>   Seventh-seeded Gardena (9-4) appeared to have pulled to within two
points when Craig Bastiste returned Ryan Lombardo's punt 70 yards for
an apparent touchdown with two minutes left in third quarter.
However, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal block in the back.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Keyes rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns in 19 carries
for Birmingham. Lombardo completed 11 of 26 passes for 191 yards,
including a 46-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Ravi Gangadean.</TE>
<TE>   Payne accounted for 229 of Gardena's 260 yards, passing for 135
and a touchdown.</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION SEMIFINALS</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Poly (11-1) vs. Santa Ana Mater Dei (9-3) at Edison
Field, 4 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   There is no more significant rivalry in Southern California high
school football than the one between these teams. Each of the last
three meetings decided a Division I championship, with each team
managing a victory and a tie. This is only a semifinal, but the
winner will likely emerge as the favorite for the championship. Mater
Dei did not appear to be a title contender this season after a slow
start, but the Monarchs have steadily improved and now face a Poly
team that hasn't been tested since early games against Kahuku
(Hawaii) and Concord De La Salle. Poly's biggest offensive weapon of
late has been receiver Derrick Jones, who gained more than 200 yards
in each of the first two playoff games. The Monarchs move the ball by
a committee of running backs and the steady play of sophomore
quarterback Jason Forcier.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Loyola (9-3) vs. Los Alamitos (11-0-1) at Edison
Field, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The last game between these teams featured one of the most
memorable finishes in Division I playoff history. Los Alamitos won
the 1999 quarterfinal game in double overtime, 30-23, after tying the
score in regulation on a last-second 60-yard field goal. Loyola won
the only other meeting between the schools, 37-34, in 1995.
Second-seeded Los Alamitos is favored because of a potent passing
game that features quarterback Jeff Kline and receivers Brandon Tripp
and Jeremy Childs. The Cubs advanced to the semifinal by upsetting
third-seeded Bellflower St. John Bosco, 38-8, behind a defense that
limited the Braves to 167 yards. Running back Bo Renaud will be
counted on to lead Loyola's offense.</TE>

<TE>   Claremont (9-2) at Mission Viejo (12-0), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Jamall Floyd is averaging more than nine yards per carry for
offensive-minded Claremont, but it took a goal-line stand for the
Baseline League champions to reach the Division II semifinals. The
Wolfpack held fourth-seeded La Verne Damien four times at the
two-yard line in the final seconds to preserve a 35-27 quarterfinal
victory. Top-seeded Mission Viejo, No. 2 in The Times' rankings, ran
roughshod over Canyon Country Canyon, 48-14, in the quarterfinals.
End Justin Williams had four sacks for the defensive-minded Diablos,
who have won 26 in a row. If quarterback Josh Rodarmel (shoulder)
can't start, look for Coach Bob Johnson to turn again to super sub
Marty Tadman. In the first round of the playoffs, Claremont defeated
Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills, 43-21, a week after Mission Viejo
rallied to beat the Mustangs, 21-14.</TE>

<TE>   Lancaster Antelope Valley (10-2) at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa
(12-0), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley has allowed only 10.9 points a game this season
and Mira Costa has scored more than 40 points nine times, so
something has to give in the Division III semifinal. Mira Costa
running back Michael Okwo has 2,069 yards rushing this season.
Quarterback Peter Dobush adds balance with 1,537 yards and 25
touchdowns passing. Antelope Valley looks to do-it-all quarterback
Johnny Walker, who is expected to play despite a sprained right
thumb. He has close to 2,000 combined yards rushing and passing in
the Antelopes' option offense. Running back Krieg Peters has more
than 1,000 yards rushing for Antelope Valley.</TE>

<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure (11-1) at Moorpark (11-1), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into this Division IV semifinal, top-seeded St.
Bonaventure has won 10 in a row since falling to Division II
semifinalist Newhall Hart, 31-6, in the second week of the season.
Fourth-seeded Moorpark lost its regular-season finale to Westlake
Village Westlake, 20-14, but has beaten Camarillo and Santa Barbara
San Marcos in the playoffs. The Musketeers will be trying for their
second appearance in a championship game; the Seraphs seek their
fourth division final in a row. Whitney Lewis leads St. Bonaventure
with 54 catches for 1,018 yards and 87 rushes for 783 yards.
Moorpark's Cliff Cardwell has rushed for 1,545 yards and Dennis Pitta
has 63 receptions for 904 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Moreno Valley Canyon Springs (10-1-1) at Corona Centennial (10-2),
7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Canyon Springs must rely on its defense in the
Division V semifinal, which means containing the top-seeded Huskies'
balanced attack that averages 44 points a game. Terrell Jackson
rushed for 1,805 yards and 33 touchdowns during the regular season,
averaging more than seven yards a carry, and quarterback Shaun Lewis
completed 62% of his passes for 1,962 yards and 17 touchdowns with
seven interceptions for No. 12 Centennial. Canyon Springs, which
averaged nearly 30 points a game, has running back Ryan Beard, who
rushed for 11 touchdowns and 815 yards during the regular season, and
quarterback Josh Gibson, who threw for 868 yards and four touchdowns,
completing 44.3% of his passes. The teams' common opponent is Moreno
Valley, which lost to Centennial last week, 34-12, and to the
Cougars, 28-6, in Ivy League play in Week 9.</TE>

<TE>   Tustin (7-5) at Hacienda Heights Los Altos (10-2), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos, a Division VII power the last four years, has a chance
to reach its fourth consecutive championship game but first in
Division VI. Since two-way lineman Armando Soto returned from an
injury, Los Altos has outscored four opponents, 152-14. Randall Brown
has scored nine touchdowns, but the Conquerors probably need a solid
effort from quarterback Carlos Ordonez to outscore Tustin, which has
won seven of eight and outscored opponents in that span, 303-119.</TE>

<DH>Foothill's blowout of El Modena evens the longtime rivals'
series</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since 1983, Santa Ana Foothill High will be
playing football for a Southern Section championship.</LD>
<LD>   How sweet is that?</LD>
<LD>   Because of the way they got there, even sweeter than you might
imagine.</LD>
<TE>   Foothill advanced to the Division VI title game by routing its
longtime rival, Orange El Modena, 45-7, Friday night before an
estimated 4,000 at Tustin High. The Knights will play either Hacienda
Heights Los Altos or Tustin, which play tonight at Los Altos, in the
championship game on Friday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   But first Foothill will savor this one. The Knights simply
overwhelmed a team that had allowed only three points in two previous
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Liti did much of the damage, scoring four touchdowns, the
first on a 58-yard run on the game's second play. He rushed for 175
yards and three touchdowns in 15 carries and caught a 10-yard scoring
pass.</TE>
<TE>   And he had plenty of help.</TE>
<TE>   Don Poole completed 15 of 18 passes for 250 yards and two
touchdowns, and receiver Quincy Lever caught five passes for 104
yards.</TE>
<TE>   As for defense, Foothill swarmed El Modena's Daniel Dixon, keeping
him out of the end zone for only the second time this season. The
Vanguard running back, who came in having rushed for 2,378 yards, was
held to 84 yards in 26 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out and pounded us," Dixon said. "I give them all the
credit in the world."</TE>
<TE>   For Liti, it was almost too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "This was our best game of the year, by far," he said. "To play
our biggest rival in the semifinals in my senior year and to blow
them out is just remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Or at least pretty darn surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill and El Modena have been going at it for about 35 years
now, and the series is even, 17 wins apiece with three ties.</TE>
<TE>   Located in an unincorporated area between Tustin and Orange,
Foothill opened in 1964. El Modena, about 2 1/2 miles north, came
along two years later.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill-El Modena rivalry in the early 1980s was among the
most spirited in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Five times in seven years, from 1978-84, El Modena played for a
Southern Section divisional championship. Twice, in '81 and '83, the
opponent was Foothill.</TE>
<TE>   But then, in the mid-'80s, the coaches at both schools, Foothill's
Ted Mullen and El Modena's Bob Lester, retired.</TE>
<TE>   What followed were some years of average teams and new passions.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill's emotions became stirred by Tustin High, which often
competed for the same athletes. El Modena's major rival became Villa
Park, with whom it shares Fred Kelly Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with the teams usually in the same league -- Foothill moved
out of the Century League and into the Sea View this year, marking
only the fourth time they haven't competed for the same championship
-- the football rivalry kept percolating. But just barely.</TE>
<TE>   Dynamic senior classes at both schools this year can be credited
to getting it back to boiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Tustin guys are our friends," David Goto, a two-way lineman for
Foothill, said at a practice leading up to the game this week. "El
Modena guys just make me mad.</TE>
<TE>   "I have respect for them, but that's it."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   El Modena, under Lester, won three section titles from 1978-84,
and a key player on a couple of those teams helped sparked some ill
will with Foothill.</TE>
<TE>   Transfers weren't common in 1979 when linebacker Rex Moore
transferred after his freshman season to El Modena, and became a
starter on the varsity as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "That fueled the rivalry," said Tom Shine, who was offensive
coordinator at El Modena from 1971-84.</TE>
<TE>   "Within [a month] of the transfer, we faced each other in a summer
league game, and there were three or four fights. Everyone was taking
a shot at Moore."</TE>
<TE>   When Mullen, a close friend of Lester's, took over at Foothill in
1981, the rivalry became even more intense.</TE>
<TE>   Though El Modena was the more dominant team, Foothill was no
slouch.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Foothill defeated El Modena in the regular season, 21-17,
because El Modena receiver Jim Fregosi Jr., son of the Angel
shortstop, was ruled to have dropped what would have been a
last-minute, game-winning touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, Foothill won the section's Southern Conference
title in triple overtime, 31-24 -- a result that prompted the section
to eliminate overtime in championship games until this season.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, in 1983, El Modena beat Foothill for the title,
10-7.</TE>
<TE>   "This game was everything," said El Modena line coach Don Gibson,
a sophomore on the Vanguards' 1983 team. "It was always very
anticipated, and it was always to decide who the league champ would
be.</TE>
<TE>   "The game always meant something, not just between players and
friends, but there was always something at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Much like a place in the championship game was on the line Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches and players from both schools point to a freshman-level
game in the fall of 1999 as the flash point of renewed tensions.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing standing between El Modena and an undefeated season
was 8-1 Foothill.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Foothill won the game, spoiled the Vanguards' perfect
season, and claimed the freshman championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember sitting down with the freshmen after they lost at
Foothill and told them to mark that page," El Modena Coach Jason
Hitchens recalled. "I said, 'This is something you want to remember
and try to use as motivation.' It stuck with them. They have not
forgotten that Foothill ruined their perfect season."</TE>
<TE>   The next season, El Modena won the varsity game, 21-14, and last
season the Vanguards won again, coming back from a 24-7 deficit to
win, 27-24.</TE>
<TE>   This season in a nonleague game, El Modena held a 21-0 halftime
lead only to watch Foothill's Poole pass for three touchdowns in the
fourth quarter and engineer a 28-24 comeback victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an ugly rivalry, it's a great rivalry," El Modena
lineman Dylan Story said on a day leading up to the game. "Sure, we
might talk a little smack, but it's out of respect.</TE>
<TE>   "Our entire [student body] understands this rivalry now. Even the
kids in band and choir, the ones who don't follow athletics, have
been asking, 'Are you going to win this week?' "</TE>

<HD>Hart Scores a High Five</HD>
<DH>Indians make it five championship games in a row -- this
one in Division II -- with win over San Clemente.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those four consecutive Southern Section Division III titles were
great and everything, but Newhall Hart is now focused on a bigger
prize.</LD>
<LD>   The Indians are one victory away from a Division II championship
after a 24-17 semifinal triumph over San Clemente before about 6,000
at College of the Canyons on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Still, this game wasn't a laugher like Hart's first two playoff
games, which resulted in 52- and 32-point victories.</LD>
<TE>   Hart had to stave off a late San Clemente drive and run out the
clock on a punt to secure the victory. The second-seeded Indians
(12-0-1) play the winner of tonight's game between top-seeded Mission
Viejo and Claremont next Saturday at Edison Field. It will be Hart's
first Division II title game since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians won behind a strong effort from junior quarterback
Sean Norton, who completed 24 of 32 passes for 275 yards, and a
defense that limited San Clemente running back Cheyne Verhagen to 60
yards in 16 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't able to run the ball," Triton Coach Eric Patton said.
"We need to run Cheyne Verhagen and get first downs and we couldn't
do that."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente (9-4) had a chance to tie the score when it took over
at its 20-yard line with 3 minutes 25 seconds left. But after the
Tritons gained one first down, Verhagen was stopped inches short of
another on fourth and two.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared as if the Tritons might get the ball back with a few
seconds left after they held Hart, but time expired as Will Simons'
punt rolled dead inside the San Clemente five.</TE>
<TE>   The Tritons cut their deficit to 24-17 midway through the fourth
quarter when Verhagen cut around left end and bolted 11 yards into
the end zone, his longest run of the game. Two pass interference
calls and a defensive holding penalty had kept the drive alive.</TE>
<TE>   Hart running back Eric Lafferty, who is used in short-yardage
situations, scored two one-yard touchdowns to give the Indians a 17-7
lead midway through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Miller trimmed San Clemente's deficit to 17-10 with a
44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, but Hart running back
Paxton Howard broke off a 23-yard touchdown run on the Indians' next
drive to make it 24-10.</TE>
<TE>   Norton also hurt the Tritons with his running ability, especially
in the first half as he eluded a series of blitzes to gain 40 of his
63 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When things aren't open, he can move," Hart Coach Mike Herrington
said. "He improvises a little bit and helps us out."</TE>
<TE>   Norton, pausing between hugs and photos after the game, said the
Indians are right where they want to be -- in their fifth consecutive
championship.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Still Perfect</HD>
<DH>There's no stopping the Knights from reaching the title
game this year as Marquez and Puccinelli lead 35-16 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marcel Marquez was magical when he touched the football and defensive
tackle Alex Puccinelli played like a raging bull Friday night as
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame moved to within one victory of its first
unbeaten season in school history by defeating Palmdale, 35-16, in a
Southern Section Division III semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   Marquez rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns in 10 carries and
completed seven of nine passes for 89 yards and two touchdowns.</LD>
<LD>   Puccinelli recorded his 19th sack of the season, forced a fumble,
had one tackle for a loss, deflected a pass and forced Palmdale's
Jacob McCravey to throw incompletions twice on hurried passes.</LD>
<TE>   The victory at Notre Dame ends a series of frustrating playoff
losses that eliminated the Knights (13-0) short of the final. Last
year, they were upset in a quarterfinal by Palmdale. In 2000, they
lost in overtime to Manhattan Beach Mira Costa in a semifinal. In
1999, Valencia eliminated Notre Dame in a quarterfinal on a
desperation pass.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time since 1997 that Notre Dame qualified for the
final, which was Justin Fargas' senior year. Fargas, USC's starting
tailback, was on the sideline rooting for the Knights.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez had a 33-yard touchdown run in which he started right,
then reversed field and ended up in the end zone untouched.</TE>
<TE>   He also broke off runs of 31 and 19 yards. He threw a 25-yard
touchdown pass to Ian McMahon in the first half when the Knights took
a 21-3 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real big step we took tonight," Marquez said.</TE>
<TE>   McCravey completed 14 of 27 passes for 171 yards and one
touchdown. He rarely had time to throw because of Puccinelli, who's
following in the tradition of Travis Johnson (Florida State) and Tim
Volk (Arizona), former Notre Dame defensive tackles who were sack
masters.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale (11-2) closed to within 21-10 with 4:53 left in the third
quarter on a 34-yard run by LaRon McIntyre. But Marquez halted any
hopes of a Falcon comeback with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Collin
Morgan in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has had three consecutive years of unbeaten freshman
teams, and some of those players have begun to distinguish themselves
on varsity. Notre Dame will play Lancaster Antelope Valley or
Manhatta Beach Mira Costa, which play tonight, in the final Friday.</TE>

<HD>Taft Able to Turn It Around</HD>
<DH>Toreadors make it back to City Section championship game by
shutting down Venice in fourth quarter and running away to a 31-13
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the final seconds ticking off the clock and a victory over
Venice secure, Woodland Hills Taft Coach Troy Starr could exhale and
point the way toward the City Section championship game.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got directions to the Coliseum," Starr yelled out to his
coaching staff. "I know how to get to it."</LD>
<LD>   On the strength of three fourth-quarter touchdowns by running back
Ian Bell and five interceptions by their talented secondary, the
Toreadors continued their path toward redemption with a gritty 31-13
semifinal victory Friday night at El Camino Real High.</LD>
<TE>   Taft (13-0) will play Lake Balboa Birmingham on Friday at the
Coliseum for the title in a rematch of the teams' West Valley League
game on Nov. 15, when the Toreadors won, 30-6. It will be the first
championship between San Fernando Valley teams in 32 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors have stayed focused on a mission to avenge a
heartbreaking final-play loss to Dorsey in last year's title game.
That focus was never more apparent Friday as they rallied from a
13-10 deficit and held high-scoring Venice to 24 points under its
average.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some unfinished business to settle," said defensive
back Paul Pratt, who had two of the interceptions off Venice
quarterback Eddie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Taft quarterback Cary Dove didn't have his best game of the season
but he got the job done when the situation required it. On a decisive
13-play, 70-yard drive to end the third quarter, the senior came up
with the game's biggest play.</TE>
<TE>   Facing third down and seven at the Venice 11-yard line, Dove went
back to pass but found a blitzing Carlos Rojas in his face. He
escaped the linebacker's grasp and managed to scramble to the
four-yard line for a first down.</TE>
<TE>   Venice Coach Angelo Gasca said the play changed the momentum.
"That's been [Dove's] biggest improvement ... the ability to create
and escape," he said. "We stop that and its fourth down and, at best,
they tie the game with a field goal."</TE>
<TE>   On the first play of the fourth quarter, Bell squirted through for
a 17-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Gondoliers (10-3)managed one first down and had two passes
intercepted in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Taft made them pay for those mistakes. The Toreadors finally got
their running game going as Bell ran for a 12-yard touchdown with
8:27 left for a 24-13 lead. The junior later capped the scoring with
a five-yard touchdown after Pratt's second interception.</TE>

<HD>Exon Relegates Nelson to Second Place Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Elizabeth Exon of Irvine Woodbridge High won the Southern
Section girls' tennis tournament singles title with a 6-4, 7-6 (6)
victory Friday over No. 2-seeded Lindsey Nelson of Villa Park at
SeaCliff Country Club in Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The match was reminiscent of last year's final, where Nelson lost
to another veritable human backboard, Anaheim Canyon's Tracy Lin, in
straight sets.</LD>
<LD>   "All I can say is, she played a great match," said Nelson, who was
still visibly disappointed nearly half an hour after the match. "I
wanted to win it. I had no doubt that I was going to win it this
year. But I had no doubt I would win it last year too, and the same
thing happened."</LD>
<TE>   The Corona del Mar doubles team of Taylynn Snyder and Brittany
Holland made the most of its second chance at a championship,
cruising past Fullerton Troy sisters Serena and Clare Fermin, 6-1,
6-4.</TE>
<TE>   The victory helped to make up for a three-set loss to Calabasas'
Celia Durkin and Erin Everly in last season's final.</TE>
<TE>   It also gives the Snyder family its third section doubles title.
Taylynn's younger brother, Corona del Mar junior Garret Snyder, has
won boys' titles the last two seasons with different partners.</TE>
<TE>   "We're three out of four [in finals]," Garret said, grinning as he
watched his sister accept the championship trophy. "We go and watch
each other's matches. Hopefully, I've helped her out a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   But neither the Corona del Mar doubles team nor Exon needed any
help.</TE>
<TE>   Exon, a senior left-hander headed to Michigan on a tennis
scholarship, became the first Woodbridge player to win a section
title.</TE>
<TE>   She was the Warriors' second singles finalist, following Susanna
Lingman, who lost in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe myself. I played so good today," said Exon, who
outlasted Durkin, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals earlier Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Against Nelson, she rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the second set
to force the tiebreaker, in which she also came back from 3-0
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Exon began to swing the second set her way when trailing, 5-3, by
winning the ninth game, in which Nelson squandered five set points.
Exon used a cross-court backhand to earn a break point and converted
it when Nelson, betrayed by her two-handed backhand throughout the
match, hit one into the net to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Exon held the next game, then converted the last of three
break-point attempts to win the 11th game to take a 6-5 lead after
Nelson surrendered another game point on a backhand into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, a junior, broke back in the next game to force the
tiebreaker. But Exon earned four of her points there on bad backhands
by Nelson, including three in a row that turned a 6-4 deficit for the
Woodbridge player into a 7-6 lead.</TE>
<TE>   On match point, Nelson sprayed a high forehand wide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so great to end my senior year by winning [the section
title]," said Exon, a semifinalist the last two seasons.</TE>

<LD>Since winning the Vernon O. Underwood more than a year ago, Men's
Exclusive is winless in six starts.</LD>
<LD>   But the nearly 10-year-old gelding always seems to run his best in
the Underwood.</LD>
<LD>   If Men's Exclusive wins the Underwood again today, he will become
only the second horse in the 22-year history of Hollywood Park's fall
meet to win the same stakes three years in a row. Flawlessly, who
swept the Matriarch from 1991-93, is the other.</LD>
<TE>   Men's Exclusive is the 5-1 third choice on the morning line in the
field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Mellow Fellow, the 2-1 favorite, is on a losing streak of his own.
The late-running gelding is winless in four starts since being
purchased privately by owners Sid and Jenny Craig.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, the rest of the field includes Mighty David,
3-1 second choice American System, Debonair Joe, So Urgent, Ride And
Shine, National Saint and F J's Pace.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Sam Houston Park in Houston has the inaugural,
$1.65 million Great State Challenge, consisting of six stakes. Among
the top thoroughbreds competing are Take Charge Lady and Forbidden
Apple.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Corey Lanerie. The jockey won 10 races the first week
of the meet at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Brent Sumja. The trainer had an 0-for-17 start at
Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Pohave, Slippery When Bet
and Infinite Faith in the sixth, Total Limit and Jersey Rebel in the
seventh, singling American System in the eighth and Shuttlin, Jink
Williams, Lunarco, Mt. Tallac and Humming Cat in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/55. Money: Previous day/meet

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With plenty of blocked shots and high-percentage field-goal
opportunities, the San Antonio Spurs ended the second-longest winning
streak of the NBA season.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Duncan scored 29 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked eight
shots at San Antonio to lead the Spurs over the 76ers, 98-93, Friday
night to end Philadelphia's winning streak at eight. Dallas had won
14 in a row to open the season.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio blocked 16 shots and shot 56% in defeating
Philadelphia for the 16th consecutive time at home.</LD>
<TE>   "We did a good job playing defense for 48 minutes," San Antonio
Coach Gregg Popovich said. "The whole team responded defensively and
that's important to do for 48 minutes. If we hadn't shot the way we
did, it would have been a tough game.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Jackson came off the bench to score 24 points and David
Robinson had 13.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia, which hadn't lost since Nov. 16, was led by Allen
Iverson with 21 points, but he shot only nine of 30.</TE>
<TE>   "Give San Antonio credit, they did a great job just shutting us
down," Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown said. "Their blocks really hurt
us, and they got to the foul line a lot tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Portland 88, Miami 69 -- Bonzi Wells scored 17 points and Derek
Anderson had 16 as the Trail Blazers held the Heat to 22 first-half
points at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Portland led 48-22 at the half, holding their opponent to the
fewest points in a half since the Denver Nuggets managed only 22 in
the first half at Portland on April 16, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 98, Denver 77 -- Doug Christie had 23 points and eight
rebounds and Bobby Jackson scored 21 at Sacramento as the
short-handed Kings won for the 10th time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber had 17 points and 11 rebounds as Sacramento remained
unbeaten in 11 home games despite suiting up the NBA-minimum eight
players for the fourth time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 104, Memphis 71 -- Calbert Cheaney scored a season-high 14
points and Karl Malone had 13 points and eight rebounds at Salt Lake
City as the Jazz kept the Grizzlies winless (0-10) on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 102, Indiana 96 -- Stephon Marbury had 19 points and nine
assists and all five Sun starters reached double figures at Phoenix.
The Suns outscored the Pacers 10-3 over the final 3:05 in a tight,
up-and-down game.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 98, Houston 96 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 25, Jamaal
Magloire had 16 points and 17 rebounds as the Hornets improved to
11-0 at home. Magloire had five points and four rebounds in overtime
as the Hornets built a 98-93 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 103, Chicago 89 -- Voshon Lenard returned from a
three-game absence because of a sore back and scored 14 of his 23
points in the fourth quarter at Toronto as the Raptors beat the Bulls
for the 16th straight time.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 88, Washington 78 -- Tracy McGrady had 27 points, nine
assists and seven rebounds at Orlando, Fla., as the Magic held the
Wizards to 11 second-quarter points to build a big lead.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 91, New York 80 -- Antoine Walker scored 25 points and Tony
Delk had 20 at Boston to lead the Celtics to their sixth consecutive

<LD>Heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis won a $1.175 million judgment
Friday, then lashed out against those who didn't support him in his
suit against a lawyer accused of failing to protect his interests.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously they weren't behind me," Lewis said after he emerged
from a federal courtroom in New York. "They profess that they're with
me but they're not."</LD>
<LD>   A jury of seven women and one man awarded the damages after Lewis
accused the lawyer, Milton Chwasky, of letting promoter Panos Eliades
siphon money from the boxer's expense account. Lewis won an $8
million verdict against Eliades for fraud in February.</LD>
<TE>   Jethro Eisenstein, a lawyer for Chwasky, promised to appeal the
latest verdict, saying his client believes "the legal process is not
over."</TE>

<TE>   "Texas A&amp;M has been a place that always has been on a short list
for me," said Franchione, who left Alabama after two years and
accepted a six-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers found a replacement for Ivan Rodriguez before
they even officially let the 10-time All-Star catcher go.</TE>

Drese from the Cleveland Indians for first baseman Travis Hafner and
right-hander Aaron Myette.</TE>

<TE>   Frank Thomas will stay in Chicago after all, agreeing with the
White Sox on a one-year contract with three mutual options that
guarantee the slugger $22.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new contract, Thomas could make more than $36 million if
he becomes a top producer again.</TE>

<LD>NO. 7 WASH. STATE (9-2, 6-1)</LD>

<LD>   Today, 1:30 p.m.,</LD>
<TE>   Rose Bowl</TE>
<TE>   TV -- Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150)</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins often will use two tight ends because flanker Tab Perry
(ankle) is sidelined and because the Cougars will bring intense
pressure against freshman quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore.
Freshman tight end Marcedes Lewis and freshman receiver Junior Taylor
could have breakout games. Washington State has 48 sacks, 13 by
tackle Rien Long. UCLA must complete short passes to Craig Bragg and
Mike Seidman and let them run. Tailback Tyler Ebell should get 20
carries and could be dangerous on screen passes. Washington State
gives up only 85 yards rushing a game, but the statistic is
misleading. Subtract sacks and the number climbs to 114 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN WASHINGTON ST. HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   If the hobbling Jason Gesser is at quarterback, the Cougars will
employ the shotgun. If Matt Kegel starts instead, expect multiple
formations. Both are dangerous passers, but with Gesser's ankle
hurting, his ability to scramble will be compromised. Receivers
Devard Darling (6-feet-2), Mike Bush (6-6) and Jerome Riley (6-3) are
fast and rangy. Darling, a transfer from Florida State, has 10
touchdown catches. Running backs Jermaine Green (129 carries, 672
yards) and John Tippins (100 for 492) share the carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   Pass effectively on first down: Olson and Moore must slow the
potent Cougar pass rush by throwing effectively on running downs and
avoiding second- and third-and-long situations.</TE>
<TE>   Avoid early turnovers: First-quarter mistakes were the Bruins'
undoing against USC. Although UCLA has overcome several deficits this
season, it is very difficult to do that against a quality opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Make sound coaching decisions: Bob Toledo and his staff must
adjust their game plan quickly and intelligently. Moore should
relieve Olson only if the offense is sputtering. And if Gesser plays,
the Bruins must blitz and treat him like any other quarterback with
restricted mobility.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plan hasn't changed. Drew Olson will start at quarterback for the
Bruins. Reserve Matt Moore is expected to play.</LD>
<LD>   The deployment, however, could be vastly different.</LD>
<LD>   Should Olson direct an 89-yard touchdown drive -- as he did
against USC -- he will take the field the next time UCLA gets the
ball, which didn't happen against the Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo stuck with a pregame plan and in the second
quarter inserted Moore, who fumbled two consecutive snaps deep in
Bruin territory. UCLA never recovered, losing, 52-21.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo admitted the move was a mistake he won't repeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll start Olson and see how the game goes," he said. "We'd like
to play them both if we could."</TE>
<TE>   Since senior Cory Paus broke an ankle against California, Moore
went the whole way in a victory over Stanford and Olson started in
victories over Washington and Arizona. Moore came off the bench
against Arizona and played well.</TE>
<TE>   "We think they're both very good young quarterbacks," Toledo said.
"I think they're pretty equal. They've both matured tremendously."</TE>

<TE>   Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser (high ankle sprain)
practiced this week but limped in a special molded boot.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Price said a decision on Gesser's status won't be
announced until game time. If Gesser does play, he'll wear two braces
on his injured leg.</TE>

<LD>USC players know they need help to reach the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   However, after they practiced Friday for the first time since
routing Notre Dame, many members of the fifth-ranked Trojans said
they could not bring themselves to openly root for UCLA today when
the Bruins play Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   If UCLA wins, the Trojans win the Pacific 10 Conference outright
and will play New Year's Day in Pasadena. If Washington State wins,
the Trojans will play in another bowl championship series game.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm never a Bruin fan -- definitely more of a Washington State
Cougar hater," safety Troy Polamalu said.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Melvin Simmons, who transferred to USC from Washington
State, said the Bruins would, grudgingly, have his support.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to cheer them on, but we want help from them,"
Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow, who met with Utah Athletic
Director Chris Hill on Monday, said he was contacted again by Hill
regarding the Utes' head coaching position and probably would
interview in the coming week.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll has spoken to Hill on Chow's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always going to try and help our guys so they can get to the
point where they can make a decision if it's the right thing for
them," Carroll said. "And then I fight to keep them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Omar Nazel was not at practice because of academic
responsibilities, Carroll said.... Redshirt linebacker Frostee Rucker
worked out at defensive end. "Coaches' orders," Rucker said. "It's an
opportunity to show them I can play two positions. I'll do whatever I
have to do." ... The Trojans will practice this morning and then take
a break until Thursday.</TE>
