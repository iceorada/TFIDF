<LD>Perhaps it's the orange paint, or the smiling air vent below the
bumper. Maybe the slightly rounded shape.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe it was just a journalist's fevered imagination at the end
of a day at the auto show.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the cause, the rear view of Mazda's MX Sport Tourer
concept stood out like a beacon at the recent L.A. auto show.</LD>
<TE>   It looks, we decided, as if the designer was inspired by nothing
less than the slightly menacing visage of a Halloween
jack-o'-lantern.</TE>

<HD>Nissan's New 350Z Keeps Under-$30,000 Pledge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We aren't going to become a pricing guide for every new car that
comes down the turnpike, but after bringing you just-announced MSRPs
for the Mini Cooper last week and the Toyota Matrix on Jan. 9, we
couldn't miss one of the year's most anticipated arrivals.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan long has promised that the resurrected Z sports coupe would
start at less than $30,000 and for once that doesn't mean $29,999.99.</LD>
<LD>   Pricing, when the 350Z hits showrooms in August, will start well
below that at $26,629, according to Nissan's announcement at the
Detroit auto show.</LD>
<TE>   That doesn't include the destination charge, so add an additional
$540.</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't include any "you want it badly enough, you'll pay
for it" surcharges that dealers might add just because they can.</TE>
<TE>   We haven't heard yet that Nissan dealers are tacking on a
surcharge to milk the first run of Zs for all they can get, but such
behavior certainly isn't unheard of in the auto world.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, of course, are as much to blame as dealers. After all,
if we won't pay, they can't overcharge.</TE>
<TE>   After a month or so, the cars and trucks would start to stack up
and the supply-demand equation would start to reverse itself.</TE>
<TE>   But we digress.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan says its suggested retail price for the base 350Z includes
the 280-horsepower V-6 and a six-speed manual transmission.</TE>
<TE>   The top-of-the-line "track" model (it's street legal) will peak at
$34,079. Two mid-range models, in touring and sports packages, also
will be available.</TE>

<LD>His fondest memory of Dean Martin has nothing to do with martinis,
cigarettes or women. Rather, Martin's son, Ricci, remembers his
father coming home at night and stopping in the kitchen to slowly
butter a slice of white toast. The crooner would then look at his
son, and, savoring his meal, say: "Now that's living."</LD>
<LD>   Another favorite expression was "What d'ya say, pally?" As Ricci
Martin notes, sitting in his mother's house in Beverly Hills on a
recent afternoon, "there was absolutely no answer to that."</LD>
<LD>   The younger Martin, the youngest son of Dean and Jeanne, is
promoting his new memoir, "That's Amore" (Taylor, $24.95).</LD>
<TE>   Kitty Kelley would be disappointed. Ricci Martin invites readers
into his Beverly Hills childhood home, but "it isn't a 'Mommy
Dearest' type of thing." Rather, "it's a love letter to my father."</TE>
<TE>   Among the myths the younger Martin wants to address is that his
father was a hard-partying womanizer. "My father wasn't the
hell-raising Rat Packer,'' Martin said. In fact, he had no time for
parties. "He always said he didn't care for the chitchat of cocktail
parties. He'd say, 'The chat I don't mind; it's the chit I don't
like.'" At times, Dean Martin would even call the cops on his own
parties, pretending to be an irate neighbor. And the drunken routine
on TV was just that, a routine, his son says. "On stage, the Scotch
was really apple juice."</TE>
<TE>   When his father performed with Frank Sinatra, Martin would bring
the house down. Backstage, after the show, a slightly upstaged
Sinatra would ask that they swap jokes. But even when Martin
performed Sinatra's jokes, he would get the most laughs. "His
delivery was magical."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who also runs a recording studio near Park City, Utah,
occasionally tours, performing his father's hits. Many of his
father's fans show up. "I don't kid myself; many of them are there
because of dad," he says. He's not offended, though, and feels
fortunate having grown up the son of Dean Martin. "He's my hero."</TE>
<TE>   Chief's Journey</TE>
<TE>   Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik shared
with us the intensity of discovering details of his mother's life as
a prostitute and of her violent death. And he spoke of the
paradigm-shifting trauma of the Sept. 11 attacks. We caught up with
him last week at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss his memoir, "The
Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice," released in November
(HarperCollins, $26.50).</TE>
<TE>   With his editor, Judith Regan, and a writing coach, Kerik
completed the 361-page memoir in about four months. He spent weeks
revisiting the neighborhoods of his childhood, searching for clues
about his past.</TE>
<TE>   Kerik grew up in the slums of New Jersey. His alcoholic mother
abandoned him as a toddler, and Kerik spent his childhood in the
homes of relatives and friends until his father won custody. All he
knew about his mother before he started the book was that she died in
1964. "The worst thing was discovering she had been beaten to death
and that her death had not been investigated," he told us.</TE>
<TE>   Kerik said he finished the book in the wee hours of Sept. 11.
Eight hours later, Kerik was on his way to ground zero. "In my
lifetime, I'm pretty confident that nothing will surpass the tragedy,
the devastation, the loss of life," Kerik said. "Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Kerik amended his book, describing that day and
including about 30 police photos of the World Trade Center wreckage.
Later, Kerik was criticized for using city-owned photos in his
private memoir. Kerik said he used the photos because "what I wanted
to do was show what I saw. A lot of them, I'm in."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Kerik said he estimated the cost of the photos and
donated that amount, $7,500, to the Twin Towers Fund "to shut the
critics up."</TE>
<TE>   Give Me an S</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monicans once again are demonstrating on the Third Street
Promenade. This time, actress Michelle Phillips is joining them. At
issue is the new city ban on henna tattoo artists offering their
services on that shopping area's streets. The ban was passed in
December after an artist used permanent hair dye on a patron and the
patron sued the city.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she wants to show her disdain for the city's
decision by getting an S (for boyfriend Steven Zax) drawn on her arm.
Most artists do not use permanent dye, she said. "It is absolutely
absurd to ban this henna art," she told us. "If kids want to get
tattoos, henna art is a great alternative. Two weeks later it'll be
gone."</TE>
<TE>   Honoring Rudy</TE>
<TE>   Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled to receive the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Freedom Award on March 8 at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel. The honor is bestowed by the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation and recognizes individuals who promote freedom around the
world.</TE>

<HD>To Live and Die With Da Bears in L.A.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Right away, I have two beers on top of two cups of coffee. Mistake.
My body is getting a mixed message. Coffee, the stimulant, is telling
me to stand up and cheer for my favorite football team. Beer, the
relaxant, is telling me to sit down and rest.</LD>
<LD>   Quickly, I come to a compromise where the right half of my body
cheers wildly over every play while the left side of my body takes a
brief nap. I've always been sort of Siamese in my allegiances.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd better order a cheeseburger," I tell my friend Shaughnessy.</LD>
<TE>   "You'd better order something," Shaughnessy says.</TE>
<TE>   I am in the best of all possible worlds, in a bar on a Saturday
afternoon watching a Bears playoff game with a guy named Shaughnessy,
who knows all the words to the Bears fight song, one of the finest
pieces of music ever penned, containing the best single lyric of all
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never forget the way you thrilled the nation,</TE>
<TE>   With the T-formation...."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody--not Irving Berlin, not John Lennon--ever wrote a line of
song so on point, so full of patriotism and passion.</TE>
<TE>   They also never wrote a song that sounds best sung at the top of
your lungs while standing on a bar stool, after 10 or more frosty
bottles of happy water.</TE>
<TE>   "Bear down, Chicago Bears,</TE>
<TE>   Let every play clear the way to victory ... "</TE>
<TE>   It's not till we hit age 40 that we really get to know and
understand who we are. This I understand: I will always love
football.</TE>
<TE>   I don't get to spend every minute of every weekend watching games
like I'd like to, but I still love the sport. Love it the way I love
Mel Brooks movies, or a stable national currency. Love it the way I
love happy water (in moderation, of course).</TE>
<TE>   So I'm here in Burbank with Shaughnessy, a guy who's been known to
stand up and sing in public while sober, which is a skill most of us
never master.</TE>
<TE>   "Another round?" he sings.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, why not," I say.</TE>
<TE>   We're in Burbank, Windy City of the West, in a saloon that draws
Bears fans and other assorted Chicago-born scoundrels. Tin Horn
Flats, they call it. An elegant piece of plywood on West Magnolia.</TE>
<TE>   We're in the first day of a wondrous January weekend. There are
four big playoff games over two days, starting with these Bears
against the Philadelphia Eagles, in Soldier Field, football's Mt.
Olympus.</TE>
<TE>   Now, up to this point in the season, I've been all right. I
haven't overdosed on football. I've consumed it in moderation, mixing
it with the kids' soccer and an occasional token chore.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, I've stayed well on the good side of spousal popular
opinion, which is never easy. Except for when she told me to shut up
on Christmas Day, my wife and I have been able to maintain a pleasant
marital truce through the holidays and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Good cup of coffee," she gushed the other morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," I said.</TE>
<TE>   See? I'm on a roll.</TE>
<TE>   So the night before the big game, by candlelight, I tried to
explain the next couple of days to her. Saturday, I'd be watching the
Bears-Eagles game followed by Raiders-Patriots. On Sunday,
Ravens-Steelers, then Packers-Rams.</TE>
<TE>   Over a nice dinner, I explain to my wife how I'm still mostly an
NFC guy and always have been. I'm loyal that way. In all ways.
Decades pass and I still wear the same pair of loafers.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalty this deep gets to a woman. In the candlelight, I see my
wife's eyes moisten. Her fingertips tremble against her wineglass. I
see for a moment what we all crave: unbridled love.</TE>
<TE>   "So that's all you're going to do this weekend?" she asks. "Watch
football?"</TE>
<TE>   No, I say. On Sunday, I'm going to play football, too. Got a
little game of two-hand touch planned with the guys.</TE>
<TE>   "Great," she says. But the subtext is: "Yep, I married an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Now there are things you will see in a wife's moistened eyes that
will bother you in your sleep and your every waking thought. This
isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Because I warned her when we were dating 200 years ago that she
could do better. "Go," I said. "Find your Lancelot. You're way too
good for me."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, my friend Paul used the same psychological
double-reverse on his fiancee. "Go," he said. "You deserve better.
This is as good as I'll ever get." She stayed, of course. Going on 12
years, the two of them.</TE>
<TE>   So my advice to all you young guys thinking of marriage: First,
cast them to the world. Before you marry, offer them their freedom.
They will come screaming back forever, with moistened eyes and
trembling fingertips. Except, of course, when they don't.</TE>
<TE>   But I digress. We're here to discuss the Chicago Bears, who have
special needs of their own. Like an offense, for one.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just like back in the '70s," says Shaughnessy in the
second quarter. "They look awful."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles seem to move the football at will. The Bears respond
with random acts of offense. It is turning into a chilly day for our
hometown team, even here in beautiful Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Shaughnessy has lots of stories. Ever met a
Shaughnessy who didn't?</TE>
<TE>   "Remember the immortal Bobby Douglass?" he asks, recalling the
hapless yet iconic Bears quarterback from a past era. "At least once
a game, he'd try to hand the ball off to the referee."</TE>
<TE>   Man, I love football.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: How to have a touch football game.</TE>

<HD>It's Crunch Time for a New Magazine With a Broad Spin</HD>
<DH>The fitness center chain has come out with a quirky
periodical for the young and urbane.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lose Weight: Watch TV" is not what you'd expect to find on the cover
of a gym's own publication. But almost nothing in Crunch Magazine is.</LD>
<LD>   The new 230-page glossy, published on behalf of the New York-based
Crunch fitness empire (with outposts in cities including Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Miami), hit the company's upscale gyms last month,
a first move in an attempt to transform the gym franchise into a
media presence--television and radio shows are planned. The magazine,
which was scheduled to make its nationwide debut this month, and its
cover displaying Juliette Lewis in terrycloth short shorts will be on
newsstands everywhere. It will be free to Crunch members and carry a
newstand price of $4.99.</LD>
<TE>   Crunch is no abs-obsessed, carb-fueled, spandex-suited magazine.
In fact, you have to look twice before you notice that fitness has
any role in the magazine at all. The publication is a mishmash of
feature stories and columns (including an advice column called "Ask a
Cabbie")."Spin" in the pages of Crunch refers to the new Strokes
album, not a stationary cycling class. To be sure, practically the
closest thing to jocks you'll find here are a throng of cricket
players in Compton (called the Homies and the Popz--for real), and
Team Cold Pint, a group of drinking buddies who decide to run a
marathon ("Why I want to run the marathon: Because I was drunk when I
was asked, and it seemed like a good idea at the time.")</TE>
<TE>   As you may have gleaned, this is a magazine of irreverent
lifestyle rather than fervent fitness. In Crunch magazine terms, this
means it's the "magazine of acceptance," as its spine will tell you.
Just what this means isn't entirely clear from its content. Like any
other thick glossy, the models "accepted" for its fashion spreads are
all suitably gaunt and gamine.</TE>
<TE>   Crunch publisher Aaron Sigmond explains it this way: "Crunch
fitness was founded on their slogan, which is 'no judgments.' We
exploded that philosophy to define our book as the magazine of
acceptance. We don't care if you're gay or straight or black or white
or dropped in from Pluto just because you like the mocha Frappuccinos
at the Starbucks on Madison on 46th Street." Our nation's founding
principles: Liberty and lattes for all.</TE>
<TE>   Editor Eddie Taylor cuts to the quick a little more readily. "This
is not an all-encompassing, huggy, touchy-feely kind of concept.
Listen, people like aspiration. People don't necessarily like to have
their own lives reflected," he says. "If people don't give a staff
about how they look, they wouldn't be joining a gym, now would they?"
And with this new "magazine of acceptance," they can learn what
sweat-proof foundation will keep their pores minimized through step
class.</TE>
<TE>   Included amid the scenester glitz are some remarkably cheeky and
creative stories--cooking with Christopher Walken, a profile of a
"flirting academy"--which certainly give the glossy newsstand set a
run for its money. In fact, when in-the-know Fashion Wire Daily
listed its "ins" and "outs" for 2002, Crunch was crowned "in," while
Tina Brown's Talk was on the way out. Quite a pronouncement for a gym
rag--and testament to how far outside the bounds of fitness custom
publishing this magazine has pushed.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes the magazine quite an oddity. Outside of tiny pieces
and graphics the editors sneaked into corners of the magazine, there
seems to be little relationship between the magazine and the fitness
chain at all. To some readers, that's what makes it  appealing. "I
don't like fitness magazines, and I work out like a fiend," says
Afarain Majidi, an out-of-work magazine editor and avid Crunch-goer.
"I really like the magazine because it's such a mishmash of what
you'd never expect."</TE>
<TE>   This is just what Crunch's publishers are hoping for: a clear-cut
demographic to whom they can target the 70-plus pages of advertising
they've sold for the first issue. That's what makes this launch
possible in the midst of the worst print advertising market since
World War II. That's where the money is, says publisher Sigmond, who
believes that even as magazines are folding all around him, "no
matter how terrible the market, we'll never be without custom titles
and magalogues--now more than ever." He says that it's far easier to
pitch to a tightly targeted demographic, like the urbane and
media-savvy young adults that fill Crunch's gyms every day. And
beyond the Crunch membership, he says, there's a much larger version
of that audience waiting to pick up the title at newsstands.</TE>
<TE>   That targeting turns off Joe Epstein, a media strategic planner
who works out at Crunch almost every day.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it disingenuous. It's all an obvious marketing ploy. And
because of that, I don't find any of it credible," he says. "I
couldn't bear to read it, honestly."</TE>
<TE>   The publishers of the magazine, which was originally planned as a
biannual, are flirting with doubling it to a quarterly. Crunch has
gotten advertisers and gym rats to accept it--now it's time for the
public to make its own judgments.</TE>
<TE>   "Our philosophy separates it from your usual newsstand lifestyle
dreck and fitness fodder," says editor Taylor of the mammoth glossy.
"And if people don't like the magazine, they can use it as an
occasional table. How's that for acceptance?"</TE>

controversy.</DH>

<LD>For sale: Ghetto Kids.</LD>
<LD>   One is a brunet darling with chocolate eyes who has nothing in
this world except her garbage can. Petra Guadalupe Antonia Perez,
a.k.a. East L.A. Lupe, was abandoned by her adolescent mother after
her father, a gangster, was killed in a drive-by shooting.</LD>
<LD>   In the streets of Hollywood, Stephanie Flintclaire, a.k.a. Starlet
Stephanie, is fending for herself because her mother is busy with her
acting career and her father, a well-known movie producer, has lost
everything to drugs. Tammy Jo Norman, nicknamed Confederate Tammy, is
a homeless girl from Nashville who was sold to a lawyer by her
mother, a waitress who became pregnant after a drunken one-night
stand with a truck driver.</LD>
<TE>   The green-eyed redhead and brown-eyed blond also come with their
own garbage cans--a symbol of the gritty upbringing of all the Ghetto
Kids, a new line of dolls suffering from tragic, urban problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dolls these days do almost anything: jump on trampolines, eat and
then soil diapers, even tell secrets. But Ghetto Kids (available only
on the Internet since October at www.ghettokidshood.com) are,
according to their creator, designed to provoke conversation between
parents and their children in the hopes of preventing inner-city
tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   But the dolls so far seem to have provoked mainly controversy. The
Ghetto Kids moniker and the dolls' troubled biographies have been the
subject of criticism on ABC's morning program "The View" and its
late-night "Politically Incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago entrepreneur Tommy Perez says he selected the hot-button
name because "it's an attention-getter." Indeed, the parental bios
received so much negative feedback from Chicago-area shoppers that
Perez has stopped including them.</TE>
<TE>   "The word 'ghetto' basically means a place away from the center of
town, a place where you kept Jews in the Middle Ages," says Perez,
55, who is of Mexican and Native American descent. "When I first put
together the doll, I wasn't referring to the poor people in the U.S.
I was referring to all types of ghettos, ghettos in Europe and
ghettos in your mind," he says. "The doll is there to open the doors
on all these subjects before society closes the doors on children who
live like this." If that sounds like a tough bill for a doll to fill,
consider the rest of the line: Carmen Lydia Julia Gonzalez, known as
San Juan Carmen, was abandoned in a crack house by her drug-dealing
father and heroin-addicted prostitute mother; Mary Margaret
O'Shannon, called Windy City Mary, whose mother is an Irish immigrant
who had an affair with a married politician, was left with a friend
of her mother's; biracial Cynthia Kennedy, called Beantown Cynthia,
was also abandoned by her rich white Bostonian mother; and the only
boy, Sammy Travanti, a.k.a. New York Sammy, whose parents are
Italian, is coping with smoking, teen pregnancy and the use of
Ecstasy on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   With about 700 dolls sold at $39.99 each, Windy City Mary, the
Chicago native, and New York Sammy stand as the most popular.
Latinos, says Perez, have been buying San Juan Carmen and East L.A.
Lupe. Beantown Cynthia is selling the least. But none of the dolls is
a hot seller. Perez recently placed some for sale on the online
auction site Ebay. After a 10-day auction, 18 dolls sold for about
$500, according to Ghetto Kids spokesman Fred Nawrot Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Even as sales have stalled since the holidays, Perez is designing
new dolls. His ghetto, so far, has excluded African Americans but not
for long, he says. Hoping to invigorate his first toy line, Perez
will take his Ghetto Kids to the American International Toy Fair in
New York City next month to seek feedback from industry veterans.
There, he intends to introduce the line's first black doll, which he
declines to discuss until then.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that there are people who are living those lives,"
said Terri Bartlett, vice president of communications for the Toy
Industry Assn. "I'm not defending [Perez's dolls] one way or the
other. But if a doll can bring comfort because a child can identify
with that story, who is to say that it's bad? If someone doesn't like
the doll, they shouldn't buy it, but that doesn't mean the product
shouldn't be on the shelf. There are cartoons about ghetto pets that
live on the street. There's been diversity in toys forever. It could
give people some understanding of certain hardships some people are
living. That's a great way of using toys."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Ghetto Kids are not the first set of diverse toys on the
market nor are they the first dolls to come with personal histories.
In the '90s, Cabbage Patch Dolls came with their adoption papers, but
no doll has included such explicit urban tales of woe.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people who were purchasing the dolls were letting us
know that children were opening these letters, and the parents are
not ready to talk to children at these levels about these problems,"
Nawrot says. "The letters were written for parents to be a
conversation piece with their kids, but for a 6-year-old to read that
her doll's father was killed in a drive-by is harsh, so we got rid of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Parents who wish to tackle these tough issues may still do so on
the comic strip that accompanies the dolls on the Web site. Next on
the chopping block might be the garbage cans, another point of heavy
contention, Perez says. He's considering replacing them with
suitcases or shopping carts.</TE>
<TE>   "The garbage cans are supposed to say, 'Look, where I'm living.
Look at me. Understand me. Learn from me and learn from my
situations,'" Perez says. "If you don't talk about these things, you
take the ostrich position. And when you take your head out of the
ground, you see little Johnny wrapped around a tree because he was
doing 80 mph, after drinking, and the two girls who were passengers
are wrapped around the tree with him. Well, it's too late then."</TE>
<TE>   For Deborah Constance, executive director of a South-Central
community center that mentors children through the arts, the garbage
cans represent the stereotypes she fights through her work every day.
Constance is a doll-maker who handcrafts figures of all ethnicities
to give to the center's donors.</TE>
<TE>   "These children who live below the poverty level right here do not
live like that," said Constance, who founded A Place Called Home in
1993. "When you see them in dance or music class here, they're little
stars. They're angels. You wouldn't know where they're from. Their
parents are doing their best. Of course, there are some crack addicts
out here, but they're in Beverly Hills too. You don't ever associate
children with garbage cans. What are you telling them then?"</TE>
<TE>   The message, say those who defend the Ghetto Kids, is one of
unadulterated reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Protecting our children from the negative aspects of society is
tantamount to creating a 'ghetto,' a wall of ignorance from which
children may emerge without the skills to negotiate the troubled
waters of the real world," said Chicago clinical psychologist and
former kindergarten teacher Marlene Eisen, who has been an informal
consultant on the line. The dolls, manufactured in Mexico, were
created with the help of Chicago public schoolteachers and police
officers.</TE>
<TE>   But how real can the Ghetto Kids be when they don't even look
ghetto? asks 9-year-old Julius Davis, a fourth-grader at Wadsworth
Elementary School. The dolls, in fact, have identical facial features
and vary only slightly in eye color, complexion and hair styles.
Julius and his buddies, all African Americans, are quick to notice
they are not represented in the toy line.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have their pants hanging down, and they should have
their hair in little pony tails like ghetto people. And they should
be screaming at each other!" Julius says as he's reading the East
L.A. Lupe comic strip online. "The ghetto is the projects. That don't
look like projects to me."</TE>
<TE>   But this is a good thing, says Helen Hernandez, president and
founder of the Imagen Foundation, which honors groups that portray
Latinos in a positive light in film, television and advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have teased hair and makeup," Hernandez says. "They're
not wearing their jeans pulled down to their hips. They look like
normal kids. While maybe some of the description is not the way I
would do it, ultimately the message is for the kids to study hard and
value themselves. But the message does get jumbled. It can affect the
way children see themselves and perpetuate the stereotype that people
have of our communities."</TE>
<TE>   Wadsworth Elementary fifth-grader Rebecca Rosa, 10, was drawn to
East L.A. Lupe because the doll's parents are from Mexico, where she
was born. Rebecca approves of Lupe's appearance, noting that "she
does not look like she lives on the streets. But I don't know why
they're called Ghetto. Maybe they're nice people, not bad people. She
doesn't look mean or nothing. But they should change the name because
parents are not going to think it's a good thing for little girls to
play with dolls called Ghetto."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez also questions whether parents will use the dolls the
way Perez intended.</TE>
<TE>   "These are issues that all kids deal with," she says. "That's the
reality. Whether the dolls help parents deal with these issues is the
$64,000 question. ... Besides, who are they marketing to? This is a
niche market. They're targeting the poor and the working poor. Those
are the people who do not have computers and who cannot afford to buy
these dolls."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a father of two who owns one of the largest vending machine
businesses in Chicago, says he is a product of the Chicago ghetto and
views Ghetto Kids as a way to help address common societal ills.</TE>
<TE>   "To everybody who talks up against us, I would like to ask: What
have you done for your fellow man lately?" Perez says. "My last name
is Perez, not Rockefeller. I don't have a ton of money. Yes, it's a
doll. Yes, it's a toy, but it has a social connotation to it."</TE>
<TE>   With a few run-ins with the law behind him, Perez says he now
wants to contribute to the education of children around the nation.
He was sentenced in 1997 to three years' probation, including 10
months in a work release program, for failing to report $330,000 of
income on his 1991 and 1992 federal tax returns. As a boy, he lived
with his father in a hotel surrounded by prostitution and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what living in the ghetto means," he says. "I am not
offended by the word. We have made some changes to the dolls already,
and if I have to change the name, I will. 'Ghetto' got people to open
up their eyes. Now, will they continue to shut them, or will they
carry this forward? If people don't buy the doll, the doll will
disappear, but we've made a statement. As we make this statement in
life, we know nobody else has tried."</TE>

<HD>On the Surface, Los Angeles Is a Different Sort of City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You overhear them occasionally at parties, these people who come from
a distant planet not unlike our own. "Oh, I never take the freeways,"
they say, "I haven't for years." The tone is one of airy insouciance,
occasionally accompanied by a dismissive wave of the hand, or that
quelle horreur closed-eyes shrug. Freeways, my dear, how ghastly.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes one is tempted to call them on it, to widen one's eyes
and say something like: "Really? And how do you get from downtown to
Pasadena/Palos Verdes/Long Beach?" Of course, in many cases the
answer would be simply "Downtown? Well, why on Earth would I be
downtown?" Or anywhere that's not spitting distance from San Vicente.</LD>
<LD>   But often such a proclamation comes from a place of civic pride,
from a person who believes that "freeway" is a misnomer and that a
real Angeleno takes surface streets. (These are often the same people
who cannot pass the Beverly Center without mentioning the long-ago
pony rides of their youth.)</LD>
<TE>   For these folks, there is a bit of braggadocio about being
freeway-free--like those who claim to watch only public television
and "The Sopranos," they are merely carving out for themselves yet
another elite niche.</TE>
<TE>   But in a way, it is just an extreme example of the time-honored
L.A. shortcut wars. You know, those tediously fascinating
conversations that sprout like fungus whenever two or more Angelenos
meet. Like many local customs, it begins with a previously agreed
upon salutation--"How was the traffic?"--and devolves from there,
usually into what sounds like a number-spitting contest between
physicists. "You took the 10 to the Harbor and went through downtown?
What, are you crazy? You take the 405 to the 101 to the 134. Save you
15 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted that every shortcut in Los Angeles saves you at
least 15 minutes. Which is pretty interesting in light of the city's
time-honored 20-minute rule, which states that any trip in L.A., no
matter the starting point or the destination, takes 20 minutes.
Taking shortcuts into account, why, we're only spending about five
minutes on the road per commute. Heaven knows what we're all
complaining about.</TE>
<TE>   For those who eschew the freeway shortcut wars are even more
finely honed. "You took the freeway? What, are you crazy? All you had
to do is take Overland to Palms to Inglewood to Centinela to
Sepulveda to 76th, turn onto Airport, then off at 96th and you're
there. Save you 15 minutes." Undoubtedly, if you can turn the
directions into a mnemonic chant or are blessed with really, really
good peripheral vision.</TE>
<TE>   After driving all over this city for more than a dozen years, I
have learned several things: The worst left-hand turn you'll ever
have to make is onto Fairfax from 3rd, never take the 405 no matter
how tempting it looks, and there are no shortcuts. There is time and
there is distance and there are varying ways of experiencing them.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, when a book called "Freeway Alternatives" came
out, I sampled a few of its suggestions in hopes of finding an
easier, softer way to favored destinations. And though all the
alternatives were legit, at rush hour they took just about as long as
their freeway counterparts. And in non-rush hour, they took longer.</TE>
<TE>   Surface routes may save some time on the short hauls when they are
substitutes for known traffic problems, but in the long haul,
freeways are favored with the law of averages. You may be able to hit
35 or 40 on that boulevard for a few minutes, but you're going to
have to stop and start and stop and start, and that brings your
average speed down to your basic freeway creep-along. And on a
freeway there is inevitably some break when for a mile or two you can
hit 50 or 60, which you really shouldn't do on surface streets, even
if you could, even if it's Sepulveda.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some stick to the streets because they offer at least the
perception of movement--I know a man who will add 20 miles and as
many minutes to a trip just to avoid sitting for a few minutes on the
freeway. He looks like he's about 15 years younger than he is, so it
must be working.</TE>
<TE>   And, certainly, the streets are a more vital part of the city than
those spans of concrete that rise above it.</TE>
<TE>   When the Northridge earthquake split the 10 right around National,
it seemed for a few moments that the Westside would simply disconnect
from the rest of the city and drift away. But it didn't take long for
folks to find the boulevards--Venice and Washington, Santa Monica and
Wilshire--that would take them to the exact same places the 10 did.
According to Caltrans, some folks stuck to the surface streets even
after the freeway was fixed and permanently shifted the traffic
pattern of the 10.</TE>
<TE>   But I'll bet when they're heading for the fairgrounds in Pomona,
the aquarium in Long Beach or even the Civic Center, they take the
freeway.</TE>

<LD>Hunting for Mystery Waves</LD>
<LD>   If you sat at the edge of a small pond and someone dropped objects
into the water, you could tell something about those objects from the
ripples. One small stone dropped into the water would make waves
different from the waves made by two big stones.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists hope to learn about objects in space in a similar way.
By detecting gravitational waves, they'll get clues about large
objects like black holes.</LD>
<TE>   Gravity is what keeps your clothes on the floor where you left
them. It's why the moon stays in orbit around the Earth. We know what
gravity does, but scientists still aren't sure what it is. The
scientist Albert Einstein believed that space curves around objects.
The bigger the object, the more space would curve. Huge things, like
the sun and planets, would curve space so much that other objects
(like the moon) would orbit around them.</TE>
<TE>   According to Einstein, humongous objects, like two suns in orbit
around each other, are like big rocks dropped into a pond. They make
ripples of gravity that spread out into space. With the right
equipment, we may be able to detect these gravitational waves.</TE>
<TE>   The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could let scientists
find and measure these ripples. The "antenna" would actually be three
spacecraft flying 3 million miles apart. Each spacecraft would be a
point in a triangle. Sensitive laser beams would connect them. As
gravitational waves passed through LISA, the distances or positions
between the spacecraft would change.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists could tell the strength and shape of the waves by
measuring those changes. If you put three small boats in your pond
and connected them with string, you could detect tiny ripples by
watching the way the string moved.</TE>
<TE>   If NASA approves LISA, it will be launched in 2009. For more
information about LISA and gravitational waves, visit the Space Place
at spaceplace.nasa.gov/lisa_fact2.htm.</TE>
<TE>   This article was written by Eric Elkins and provided by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, managed by Caltech in Pasadena.</TE>

<TE>   "Listen Buddy"</TE>
<TE>   by Helen Lester</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a bunny that didn't listen to his parents very
well. He brings home potatoes instead of tomatoes. It made me laugh
because bunnies don't really talk or brush their hair. If you like
funny stories, you should read this book.</TE>

<HD>For Some, Muskrat Love Warms Up Winter</HD>
<DH>A few old-timers around Maryland's Eastern Shore still
relish the trapping and eating of marsh critters during the bleak
months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS GUY</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Md.</DL>
<LD>Got a taste for muskrat, a hankering for nutria, maybe a craving for
raccoon? Then Roger Webster is your man.</LD>
<LD>   The third-generation grocer and his family have been making a
living since 1939 catering to customers in the Dorchester County seat
who like things done the old-fashioned way.</LD>
<LD>   And for many of Webster's regulars, this is the time of year when
the mounds of deli meats, hamburger, chops and chicken that fill his
meat case just won't do. The holidays are over, and the best way to
get through a bleak Eastern Shore winter is to make a meal of the
furry critters that frequent the marshes and woods in these parts.</LD>
<TE>   Webster buys the meat from local trappers, who bring in the
crimson carcasses after skinning the pelts, which are sold to fur
buyers from Ohio, New Jersey and other states.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Webster sold about 1,500 muskrats, 70 or so raccoons
and a handful of nutria, the oversized cousins of muskrats that were
imported from Louisiana in the 1940s and whose eating habits are now
blamed for wreaking havoc on Maryland marshes.</TE>
<TE>   The trapping season has  started, but so far, things don't look
good for muskrat lovers, Webster says.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, right this second, I've got muskrats. I don't know
about tomorrow," says Webster, who quickly sold three dozen of the
marsh creatures--his entire first shipment. It was delivered by
Church Creek farmer Ralph Jackson on opening day of the trapping
season, which runs from Jan. 1 through mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Webster and Jackson are two of what state officials say are a
dwindling number of trappers and retailers still involved in the
muskrat trade. "Now what you see is people trapping and selling the
meat to friends, or friends of friends, people who've got a taste for
it," Jackson says.</TE>
<TE>   The state doesn't keep count of how many muskrats are taken each
year, and no special permit beyond a standard hunting license is
required to trap them. But many say that even if the brown-and-black
rodents are as plentiful in the wild as ever, far fewer of them are
making their way to the retail market.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene "Wick" Lowe, who runs a seafood business near the Nanticoke
River in Sharptown, blames the decline on the younger generation of
farmers, watermen and outdoorsmen, who he says just aren't willing to
do the hard work of trapping for the $1.25 to $1.50 they can get per
pelt or the $3 they might be paid for the meat of a big muskrat.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe buys from local trappers when he can, but he says most of the
4,500 rodents he bought wholesale last year came frozen from an
Ohio-based fur company.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger generation just isn't going to get out and walk
through the marsh, get stuck in the mud, get their feet wet in icy
water," says Lowe, 72, who supplies the meat for several traditional
muskrat dinner fund-raisers held by local volunteer fire companies
every winter.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland officials estimate that perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 people in
the state are still involved in the muskrat trade. They believe
that's far fewer than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The muskrats aren't necessarily in short supply, but they're
trapped primarily for fur, and the bottom fell out of the fur market
a few years ago," says John Surrick, a spokesman for the Department
of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's customers prefer the first-name personal service at the
100-year-old grocery--the oldest in Cambridge--where they can run a
tab until payday or have their orders delivered if they can't get
out.  And many have come to expect muskrat meat, along with staples
such as milk and bread.</TE>
<TE>   For muskrat lovers--and the squeamish aren't usually among
them--folks generally divide along two lines: those who cook their
muskrats whole, including the head and the rodents' trademark front
teeth, and those who can't stand that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't eaten one in a long time, but muskrats are
good-tasting," says Adriana Walls, who lives three blocks from
Webster's and stops in almost daily. "I used to parboil them, then
bake them with a mess of onions. I could never cook them with the
heads, not with their blank eyes and their buck teeth looking at me."</TE>
<TE>   For Charles Streeter, who has shopped at Webster's for better than
30 years, it just wouldn't seem like winter without a few muskrat
dinners.</TE>
<TE>   "I draw the line at raccoons, though," 72-year-old Streeter says.
"Muskrats is good eating, but I've never tried coon meat."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Guy is a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, a Tribune company.</TE>

<HD>More Cool Quarters</HD>
<DH>Part 3 Starting in 1999, new quarters began appearing--five
per year--to honor all 50 states. The New York state quarter was the
first coin issued in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA WALSH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 50 State Quarters program allows every state to design its own
quarter. The U.S. Mint contacts the governor of each state 18 months
before the quarter's release date. It is up to the governor to decide
how the coin designs are submitted and chosen.</LD>
<LD>   After a submission and selection process, the governor is allowed
to send three to five favorite designs to the U.S. Mint for review.
The U.S. Mint approves the "coinability" of each design to make sure
that the pictures can be engraved on the space available on the
quarter. The favorite designs are then returned to the governor for
the final selection. The secretary of the Treasury--currently Paul H.
O'Neill--must approve the final design before it is sent to the mint
for production.</LD>
<LD>   The New York</LD>
<TE>   State Quarter</TE>
<TE>   New York became the 11th state on July 26, 1788, and is the first
quarter in the 2001 series. The coin features the Statue of Liberty,
standing tall and proud, with an outline of the state behind her. The
statue, a gift from France in 1886, has welcomed people to New York
and the United States from all over the world. Before the final
design went into production, the governor asked U.S. Mint engravers
to add a route through the state to represent the Hudson River and
the Erie Canal, showing the importance that both waterways played in
the development of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: More 2001 state quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Maura Walsh wrote about the first series of state quarters in the
Kids' Reading Room from Nov. 27-Dec. 1, 2000. This story will be on

<HD>From Faux Pas to Fashion Statement</HD>
<DH>When bad things happen to good celebrities (or energy

<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The T-shirt is so popular that a single store has sold more than 300
in a month. The slogan on it: "Free Winona"--a reference to Winona
Ryder's December arrest on suspicion of shoplifting $4,700 worth of
merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the 30-year-old actress is free (on $20,000
bail)--it's just the items at the posh Beverly Hills department store
that are not. That didn't stop T-shirt creator Billy T from
downloading her image from the Web, mocking up a design, printing it
on a shirt and having it ready for sale the same day the news broke.</LD>
<LD>   Why are the shirts so popular? "It feels like something you can
support politically, even though it's a joke," said Billy Tsangares,
a.k.a. Billy T and owner of Y-Que Trading Post, a novelty store on
Vermont Avenue in Los Feliz that is packed with T-shirts,
transvestite dolls, disco balls, incense and other kitsch
paraphernalia. "I think people like that sense of radicalness against
something that's rather meaningless."</LD>
<TE>   Tsangares has designed hundreds of T-shirts in the 15 years he's
been silk screening. Playing off the news, he said he makes about
three new designs each week. Last week he threw Enron Corp. and
President Bush into the mix with shirts that read "Enron--Evildoer"
and "Chew First," a response to the president's recent pretzel
mishap.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old designer had tried to combine the two by making
the scar on Bush's face into an Enron logo or by twisting the logo
into a pretzel, but he couldn't get either to work. "They seemed to
be separate issues," he conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Tsangares has made a habit of capitalizing on celebrity faux pas.
Building on a tradition of T-shirt protest that began with Huey
Newton in the '60s--"Free Huey!"--Tsangares created a "Free James
Brown" shirt in 1989 when the soul singer was sent to prison for
aggravated assault.</TE>
<TE>   Ditto for Pee-wee Herman after his 1991 arrest for indecent
exposure at a Florida adult theater and, most recently, Adam Ant, who
last week was committed to a psychiatric hospital for waving a fake
pistol at a London pub.</TE>
<TE>   "These people keep getting arrested," said Tsangares, who has fun
creating the shirts but who doesn't make much money selling them
because their popularity is fleeting. His T-shirt fads last about
three months, he estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway toward obsolescence, the "Free Winona" shirt is only now
beginning to turn a profit but is still selling strong.</TE>
<TE>   Amber Phillips, a 26-year-old office manager who lives in Silver
Lake, was buying one for a birthday present last Thursday.  "[My
friend] thought it was a scream," said Phillips, who first spotted
the shirts the day after Ryder was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The version she bought was one of Tsangares' originals--pink with
a red-carpet photo of Ryder clutching a handbag. That's one of about
four versions printed on tank tops, T-shirts and bambis (a
single-strap tank) with either the "Free Winona" or "We Believe You"
slogans.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the image on the most popular version of the shirt
isn't really Ryder but a picture from a wig ad. Tsangares tried to
convince the Los Angeles Police Department to release the actress'
mug shot, but it wouldn't. (Maybe the LAPD knew about the Hugh Grant
mug shot T-shirt he made in 1995 following the actor's indiscretion
with prostitute Divine Brown.) Tsangares, wearing his Enron T-shirt
featuring the failed company's logo with a pointy devil's tail, said
celebrity scandal trumps politics.</TE>
<TE>   At 300 sales and counting, "Free Winona" has been his most
successful shirt. But despite its popularity, no one has shoplifted
one. "We keep our eye out for that kind of thing," said Tsangares. "I
haven't caught anybody yet."</TE>
<TE>   As for the real Winona, she is scheduled to appear in Beverly
Hills Superior Court on Feb. 8. The Los Angeles district attorney's
office is still reviewing evidence in the case to determine whether
to  charge the actress.</TE>

<HD>Exit, With a Flourish</HD>
<DH>Some weep during Yves Saint Laurent's final show, a trip
through fashion history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOELLE DIDERICH</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Legendary French designer Yves Saint Laurent bid adieu to fashion
Tuesday with a haute couture show that charted a glittering chapter
in fashion history and reduced many faithful clients to tears.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the most memorable looks of the 20th century flashed
before the 2,000 guests gathered at the Georges Pompidou Center for
the retrospective of a 40-year career. An army of models filed past
in classics like the see-through blouse, the safari jacket and the
women's tuxedo, which have won icon status and influenced countless
other designers.</LD>
<LD>   Highlights included brilliantly embroidered jackets re-creating
the paintings of Picasso and Van Gogh, which showcased the exquisite
craftsmanship of haute couture's exclusive made-to-measure creations.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the end of an era maybe, but Yves Saint Laurent will
continue beyond the limits of time," said French designer Jean-Paul
Gaultier. "I can only be moved and impressed at what I am going to
see. We have all brought our handkerchiefs."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the audience wiped their eyes during an emotional finale
to the show as French screen diva Catherine Deneuve sang a love song
for Saint Laurent, who took his final bow flanked by 60 models
dressed in his trademark women's tuxedo.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of well-wishers packed the square outside the Pompidou
Center. They watched the show on two giant video screens erected
outside. His retirement at 65, announced two weeks ago, has unleashed
a tide of emotion in France, where he is seen as a national treasure.
It has also triggered a heated debate about the future of the
exclusive world of haute couture, as opposed to the mass market
business of ready-to-wear fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The famously reclusive designer said he was quitting in disgust at
an industry ruled by commerce above art, he told the newspaper Le
Monde.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a world of confusion and decadence. This battle for
elegance and beauty was causing me a lot of sadness," Saint Laurent
told the highbrow daily in an interview published as part of a
special eight-page supplement Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, there is no haute couture. No house can reach the level of
elegance."</TE>
<TE>   Predictions by the Saint Laurent camp that haute couture would die
following his departure have irritated rival designers, including
Karl Lagerfeld, who showed his spring-summer collection for Chanel on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "What a dramatization, this departure! He's overdoing it. I mean,
it's not as if this were a funeral in the presence of the corpse,"
Lagerfeld told the newspaper Journal du Dimanche.</TE>
<TE>   The German designer presented demure outfits in pastel shades to
guests including American actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Capshaw,
wife of Steven Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   Although only two years younger than Saint Laurent, Lagerfeld has
undergone a make-over in the last year, losing 93 pounds and
revamping Chanel for a younger generation.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Saint Laurent trembles in public and has difficulty
speaking following his well-documented struggles with addiction and
depression.</TE>
<TE>   Although many wondered what was in store for the man who once
declared he would die when he stopped designing, another designer,
Christian Lacroix, said it was time to stop the hand-wringing.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last two weeks, it's been like witnessing a national
funeral," Lacroix told France Inter radio Tuesday. "What bothers me
is that he's being remembered as something that's over, as if he were
being buried alive in a mausoleum."</TE>

<HD>DGA Nominees Don't Include Robert Altman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ron Howard lost the Golden Globe for best director on Sunday to
Robert Altman, but the two won't be in competition for the Directors
Guild of America award for outstanding directorial achievement in
feature film for 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Howard, a previous DGA winner for 1995's "Apollo 13," received his
third nomination Tuesday from the organization for "A Beautiful
Mind," his drama that explores mathematical genius John Nash's battle
with schizophrenia. Noticeably absent from the list of five nominees
was the 76-year-old Altman, director of "Gosford Park."</LD>
<LD>   Besides Howard, the other director nominees were Peter Jackson for
the fantasy "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Baz
Luhrmann for the musical "Moulin Rouge," Ridley Scott for the war
epic "Black Hawk Down" and Christopher Nolan for "Memento," the film
noir that unfolds in reverse.</LD>
<TE>   Last year's winner, Ang Lee ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"),
and DGA Vice President Martha Coolidge made the announcement Tuesday
at Directors Guild of America headquarters. The DGA Awards will be
handed out March 9 at the Century Plaza Hotel during the 54th annual
DGA Awards dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Golden Globe, Altman had also received the New York
Film Critics Circle and National Society of Film Critics award for
best director and had been considered a front-runner for a DGA nod.
Other directors missing from the nominees' list included critics'
darlings David Lynch for "Mulholland Dr." and Todd Field for "In the
Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1949, the DGA Award winner has been the most accurate
barometer for who will win the Academy Award for best director. Only
five times have the DGA and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp;
Sciences parted ways in the best director category, including last
year, when Lee won the DGA award but Steven Soderbergh won the Oscar
for "Traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Howard, 47, who began his career as a child actor and has been
making films for more than 20 years, received his first DGA
nomination 16 years ago for the box-office hit "Cocoon." Scott, 64,
also has been nominated twice before by the DGA for 1991's "Thelma &amp;
Louise" and for 2000's "Gladiator." The three other nominees are
first-timers. At 31, Nolan is the youngest nominee.</TE>
<TE>   In a reflection this year of the international scope of cinema,
Howard is the only American nominee. Scott and Nolan are English,
Jackson is from New Zealand and Luhrmann is Australian.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was thrilled with his nomination. "The Directors Guild has
been very supportive over the years, and I really appreciate it," he
said. "It is a peer group and those who vote know [their
profession]."</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann, 39, said, "In a way, it is probably for a director the
trickiest [award]. It is a fantastic thing to be recognized by people
who comment in the media, but your peers, they know the work. They
understand that directing isn't about moving traffic around, it is
the entire complexity of the work," Luhrmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott agreed with Howard and Luhrmann that the DGA Award
nomination is important because it comes from their peers. "So often,
throughout the year, we never meet each other, and it's a great pity.
[The DGA Awards] is the one occasion where you get to come together,
and if you're lucky you get to meet some of the guys who do the same
job you do, you will meet others in the same process. Directing is a
tough process, but that's why we do it. We love it."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, 40, who is deep in post-production on "The Lord of the
Rings: The Two Towers," the second of the "Lord of the Rings"
trilogy, pointed out that fantasy films usually don't receive such
nominations. "It's great that the fantasy genre, that people are
actually looking upon that with new eyes."</TE>

<HD>What a Concept: Taking a Producer Credit Where It's Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone probably has his or her own image of what a producer does,
doubtless influenced by characters like the desperate Max Bialystock
in "The Producers" or Max Fabian in "All About Eve"--stressed-out,
cigar-chomping types with a copy of Variety under one arm and a list
of impressionable ingenues at his fingertips.</LD>
<LD>   "Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?" a young actress,
played by Marilyn Monroe, says with a sigh in the latter movie, to
which the smarmy theater critic portrayed by George Sanders replies,
"Because that's what they are."</LD>
<LD>   These are stereotypes, to be sure, but at least such films gave
you a vague understanding of the term--something you would never gain
from surfing the television dial, where "producers" are more
plentiful than talking-head "security experts" on the Fox News
Channel and MSNBC.</LD>
<TE>   The public's confusion regarding the title was recently
underscored by a message from Rich Varenchik of Valencia, who works
as deputy communications director for the California Air Resources
Board. After watching a prime-time drama, Varenchik found himself
hoping someone could clear the air on what all those names meant.</TE>
<TE>   "Seems that there were executive producers, co-executive
producers, producers, other producers, more producers, my son the
producer, etc.," he wrote. "Then, I started watching the opening
credits for other TV shows and saw pretty much the same thing--all TV
shows seem to be overrun with various types of 'producers' in some
form or another.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are these people? What do they do? Do they get paid? Why do
they need so many of them?"</TE>
<TE>   These are legitimate questions. For while there are thousands of
people roaming the streets of Los Angeles claiming to be producers,
it takes more than a business card and an ugly sports jacket to truly
merit the title. Moreover, even real producers carry less weight now
that a few giant companies have swallowed Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Back in olden times (in television parlance, before the birth of
the Olsen twins), some producers actually financed projects and
cashed in fabulously by owning the rights. Aaron Spelling, to cite
one, furnished a 56,000-square-foot mansion with help from folks like
the cast of "Charlie's Angels" and "Dynasty's" Joan Collins.
Producers found material, assembled talent and oversaw all aspects of
production. They also served as a buffer, theoretically, between
writers and directors on one side and networks and studios on the
other.</TE>
<TE>   Very few people credited as producers in television today do
anything remotely like that. The closest would be the top executive
producer, or "show runner," who supervises the writing staff and
production but is almost invariably employed by a studio. Most begin
as writers, gradually ascending the ladder from co-producer to
producer to supervising producer.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, most producers credited on a show are really writers
who help churn out 20-odd scripts each season. A few others are
directors given staff positions as--what else?--producers.</TE>
<TE>   After that, you get into the nebulous world of managers and
television executives, who sometimes take producer credits on
individual shows. Stars get into the act too, if they have enough
clout, with Ray Romano ("Everybody Loves Raymond"), Ellen DeGeneres
("The Ellen Show") and Pamela Anderson (yep, the "V.I.P." star) all
receiving executive producer titles on their respective series.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is thrilled about the credit "producer" being bandied
about so loosely, especially at a time when networks insist they are
trying to cut costs. ABC, for example, wants to eliminate such titles
for those managers who don't serve any role other than pocketing
$25,000 to $50,000 an episode just for making sure their client shows
up to work. Given the hunger for marquee talent, most within the
industry are skeptical as to whether ABC will truly enforce such a
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Established producers have also railed against what they
characterize as a proliferation of the credit. Barney Rosenzweig, who
produced such programs as "Cagney &amp; Lacey" and "The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill," contends that credits are real currency in the
entertainment industry and blithely handing out such titles renders
them meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   So what does a producer do, in his eyes? "He decides what story to
tell to an audience," Rosenzweig said. "He comes up with or finds
that idea and sees it all the way through to its production and
exhibition.... [Producers] are the first one there in the morning and
the last one to leave at night."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even producers who fit that description frequently lack the
decision-making autonomy they once possessed, as networks and
studios--often united under a single corporate umbrella--increasingly
assume more control over the creative process. Small wonder that the
Caucus for Television Producers, Writers and Directors--a "collection
of Don Quixotes," as producer Gerry Abrams put it--felt compelled to
draft a "creative bill of rights" trying to spell out where the
producer's authority begins and the network's ends.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, most producers today--including those who really
produce--are employees who don't own their work outright, unlike the
entrepreneurial spirit that guided Spelling, Norman Lear and other
titans of the 1970s. And while that distinction might seem minute
given the riches top producers can still amass, in essence it's the
difference between owning a small company and being a product manager
at Procter &amp; Gamble.</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly the way it looks to Joe and Harry Gantz, the
brother tandem that produces "Taxicab Confessions"--the long-running
voyeuristic HBO series, which may lack the cocktail-party cachet of
"The Sopranos" or "Sex and the City" but is nonetheless an attraction
to many subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   The Gantz brothers oversee all aspects of their show, from going
out on shoots in an unmarked van (the better to capture conversations
between the driver and unsuspecting passengers) to guiding editors as
the program is put together. What they don't do is own the store.</TE>
<TE>   "You make a salary, more or less," Joe said. "We've had some
success and won an Emmy, and still it's very hard to get ownership.
It's really not a great situation for creativity ... and it's not
going to get any better."</TE>
<TE>   "Do people other than independent producers care?" added Harry.
"They should, because it affects what they watch on television....
Any time you have so much power in the hands of a few, it affects the
diversity of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   True enough, but at least their mother can say, "My sons, the
producers."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that means.</TE>

<HD>Based on a True-Life Story, but Was That Story for Real?</HD>
<DH>Movies* A West Virginia town's encounter with the
unexplained inspires 'The Mothman Prophecies.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The local headlines screamed: "Couples See Man-Sized Bird ...
Creature ... Something!" "Monster No Joke for Those Who Saw It,"
"Gigantic, Fuzzy Bird Chases Auto in Storm."</LD>
<LD>   No, this was not a Samuel Arkoff B-horror production. This was
real--or possibly real anyway.</LD>
<LD>   The time was 1966 in Point Pleasant, W.Va., and something very
strange was happening. More than 100 people reported seeing a
9-foot-tall, black, winged creature with glowing red eyes. Some said
it spoke to them and forewarned of an impending disaster in their
town, a small farming community at the intersection of the Ohio and
Kanawha rivers. One year later, their worst fears were realized when
the bridge over the Ohio River, connecting Point Pleasant to Ohio,
collapsed and 47 people died.</LD>
<TE>   "Mothman"--as the beast was known by locals--was never seen or
heard from again.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who just don't want to talk about it
anymore, either because they are traumatized or they don't want the
press attention," said Jeff Wamsley, a Point Pleasant native and
author of "Mothman: The Facts Behind the Legend." "People were pretty
much scared out of their wits."</TE>
<TE>   The story of this strange season in Point Pleasant was chronicled
by journalist John A. Keel in his 1975 book "The Mothman Prophecies."</TE>
<TE>   The book is now a movie.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mothman Prophecies," a $42-million Sony Screen Gems release
that opens Friday, stars Richard Gere as a crusading Washington Post
journalist named John Klein who, through a personal tragedy, finds
himself in Point Pleasant. He gradually becomes embroiled in the
town's strange sightings until he reaches a point of obsession and
near lunacy. Although the real story occurred in the 1960s, the movie
is set in contemporary times. The film also stars Laura Linney (who
was paired with Gere in the 1996 thriller "Primal Fear") and "Will &amp;
Grace's" Debra Messing.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Richard Hatem ("Under Siege 2: Dark Territory") had
been fascinated by science fiction and the paranormal since
childhood. But it was not until one night in the spring of 1997 that
he was pulled into the Mothman world.</TE>
<TE>   During a bout with insomnia, he found himself in a Pasadena
bookstore. He saw "The Mothman Prophecies" on the shelf, picked it up
and soon enough was sitting cross-legged on the floor reading the
book. He read through the night. By the next day, he was on the phone
with author Keel and began writing the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Hatem based two characters on Keel. Gere plays the younger,
cockier journalist, while Alan Bates plays an older, wiser and
spooked professor who at one time also witnessed a paranormal event.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, Lakeshore Entertainment (producers of "The Gift,"
"Runaway Bride") bought the rights to the script and began a two-year
development process. But Hatem's vision for the film remained intact.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Hollywood movie ghosts make their presence known to help us
get back together with our girlfriends," said Hatem. "I wanted to
write a story that said you can ask questions about why things
happen, but they are the sort of things that we are never going to
get an answer to. This was a movie about dealing with something that
human beings will never be equipped to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Director Mark Pellington ("Arlington Road") was not interested in
making a "monster movie." Rather, he wanted a film about the
psychology of belief.</TE>
<TE>   "Could this be a man? A voice? A light or a monster?" Pellington
said. "Many of these things we don't answer. That was the appeal to
me, the ambiguity and the unanswered questions. We wanted to play it
straight and strip out any melodrama or kookiness."</TE>
<TE>   Keel, who has seen the movie, said he thought "Richard Gere does a
great job of gradually going nuts." Now 72 and still writing books
and articles from his home in New York City, he says: "I didn't go
nuts, but I was very upset. When the bridge collapsed, it was pretty
distressing.... I was determined I was going to find the answers to
this. As it progressed, I became more and more baffled. It took a
long time for me to realize that I was dealing with something that
the human mind could not understand. There are many things that we
will never know."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, nobody knows what those people saw on those dark West
Virginia nights. But for the folks who say they saw the strange,
malevolent creature--whatever it was--their lives were never the
same.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It began in mid-November 1966, when two couples, parked at an old
World War II munitions dump site that the locals called TNT, say they
were chased by a large creature. They reported the incident to the
police, and the sightings continued from there. Some said the
creature chased them to the ground. Others suffered from bleeding
eyes after reportedly seeing it. Many never slept well again. It did
not help to calm fears when the town's investigative reporter Mary
Hyre, who had devoted much ink to the Mothman, died suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   One theory is that people saw a huge sandhill crane that veered
off course. Another is that it was a giant, mutated owl. And others
say the people in Point Pleasant succumbed to mass hysteria.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that some people saw something. It was probably a
bird," said Hilda Austin, 58, who lived through the Mothman sightings
and is currently the head of the Point Pleasant Chamber of Commerce.
"Some of it was just hoax. It could have been something spawned by
the toxic ground from the TNT area. Some of the eyewitnesses were on
drugs. I thought it was a hoot [when this happened]; everyone just
sort of laughed at this. They just thought it was preposterous."</TE>
<TE>   But others, like cryptozoologist and author Loren Coleman, said
there is a history of this kind of lore in the Ohio River Valley. The
Native American tribes of the area had a long history of chronicling
stories about Thunderbirds--large "bird-man" figures that were always
harbingers of woe.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people want to make fun of Mothman because it's poor,
white Appalachia people [talking about it], but I try to put it into
context," said Coleman, who wrote the book "Mothman and Other Curious
Encounters." "The Iroquois and the Tuscarora and the Wyandot tribes
called them flying heads and big heads. They were exactly like the
Mothman--headless creatures with big red eyes."</TE>
<TE>   David Grabias, who was hired by the studio to make a Mothman
documentary that will air on the FX channel today,  said he was
convinced the locals saw something frightful.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard about it, I thought, 'Oh, it's West Virginia
and these are a bunch of hicks drinking too much hooch in the
mountains,'" said Grabias, who produced the Emmy-nominated
documentary "Why Dogs Smile and Chimpanzees Cry."</TE>
<TE>   "But the more people we talked to, the more we felt a sense that
there was a feeling of something strange and to let sleeping dogs
lie. The people were very believable."</TE>
<TE>   Pellington says that Mothman follows a pattern of the unexplained,
which makes rational, modern society ill at ease.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in things greater than us that are unexplained," he
said. "The mysteries of life are so profound; that is why this legend
and other kinds of mythology exist. I feel it keeps us human."</TE>
<TE>   Many locals were upset that the movie was not filmed in Point
Pleasant itself. It was shot in Kittanning, Penn., because it was a
large enough town to accommodate cast and crew. In addition,
Pellington needed to shut down the local bridge for two months during
filming--something the economy in Point Pleasant could not sustain.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of running from the Mothman legacy, Point Pleasant locals
are embracing it. A thriving port city at the turn of the century,
Point Pleasant has been suffering from a slow economy for many years.
Without jobs, most of the young people leave to find a better way of
life.</TE>
<TE>   Mothman, they are hoping, will bring them better fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   The Chamber of Commerce sold Mothman Christmas ornaments this
year. Another local created Mothman beanbag toys, which sold like
hotcakes, according to Austin.</TE>
<TE>   They don't seem to fear being placed in the pantheon of strange
places like Roswell, N.M., or Loch Ness, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping that it will do something that will help our
economy," said Austin.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't understand what the fascination is. This new popularity
of the Mothman started before the movie.... We don't care, we just
hope it will help us out."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Architect to Lead Sci-Arc</HD>
<DH>Architecture*  Eric Owen Moss will become director of a
school known for its experimentation and independent thinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Owen Moss, a native son and internationally known architect who
has been part of the Southern California Institute of Architecture's
"tradition of non-tradition" since its earliest days in the 1970s,
today will take over as director of the school.</LD>
<LD>   Sci-Arc, which moved from Marina del Rey to a former freight depot
downtown last year, is counted among the nation's leading educators
of architects, with a reputation for experimentation and close
interaction between its faculty of working architects and its student
body of about 400 undergrads and graduate students.</LD>
<LD>   Since its beginning, said Moss, Sci-Arc has sought "students who
were inventive, self-critical and extremely independent." Instead of
looking for big-name established architects in those first years,
Moss said, the school courted "interesting young practitioners who
had a lot of energy ... and I'm one of those people."</LD>
<TE>   Moss, 58, said he will continue in his practice while serving as
Sci-Arc director. He has had about 20 projects built in the Los
Angeles area, including the Stealth office building in Culver City
and the Pterodactyl parking garage and office space in Culver City.
(The parking garage is included in the Museum of Contemporary Art's
"What's Shakin'" exhibition).</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded Moss its
Academy Award for Architecture, placing him among the top
practitioners in the United States. Last year, he received a gold
medal from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of
Architects. In honoring Moss, the academy said that his designs
"embody a poetic vision .... The building[s] are resonant and
inspiring and, through their inventive presence, they establish a
sense of pertinent place."</TE>
<TE>   Moss was born in Los Angeles to transplanted New York parents.
After earning a bachelor's degree in English at UCLA in 1965, he
received a master's in architecture at UC Berkeley in 1968, and then
another master's degree in architecture from Harvard in 1972. His
Culver City-based practice includes 25 employees, who are currently
pursuing projects from Queens, New York, to St. Petersburg, Russia.
He lives with his wife, architect Emily Kovner, in Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   Since his return to Southern California in the early 1970s, Moss
has been a frequent presence at Sci-Arc, which was founded in 1972,
from teaching courses to serving on the institution's board. After
narrowing a list of six candidates to three finalists, the board
chose Moss on Jan. 15 to succeed director Neil Denari in the school's
top job. The other finalists consisted of two teams: Craig Hodgetts
and Hsin-Ming Fung; and Robert Mangurian and Mary-Ann Ray. Public
announcement of his appointment is scheduled for 1 p.m. today, when
Moss is to address students at the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Through Moss and board president Ray Kappe describe the school's
decision as a straightforward bid to raise Sci-Arc's profile and
better serve its students, the choice of Moss also represents a
return to more familiar personnel after the tumultuous tenure of
Denari.</TE>
<TE>   Denari, who took over in 1997, led the school's relocation to
downtown, which has been hailed as a bold, encouraging move by many
civic leaders and architects. But he suffered a no-confidence vote
among the school's faculty late last year. Soon after that vote,
Denari announced that he would leave the top job by June 2002. When
the search for a successor advanced quickly, Denari left the position
in December.</TE>
<TE>   In moving the school downtown, "Neil did something that was very
good, and very strong and very important," Moss said. However, Moss
added, "the building itself, I think, ought not to remain as
historically reverential.... I think it is interesting to take an old
train station and bring it back to life in another form. But it's too
finished. I think in some ways, it has to be taken apart again."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the school is headquartered downtown, Moss added, he sees
great opportunities for a student role in the area's fledgling
renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Kappe, chairman of Sci-Arc's 18-member board and a founding
director of the school, called Moss "a person is not afraid to move
things forward.... He's not short for words, and he's very
expressive, very articulate.... I just feel he will take Sci-Arc up a
notch."</TE>

<HD>Anything but Minimalist</HD>
<DH>London makes big noise as it cheers a festival of music by
American composer John Adams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The news of the past few days has not been encouraging for an
American in London. Headlines have been dominated by British alarm
over the American treatment of prisoners of war in Cuba. Rude
editorial cartoons lambaste President Bush mercilessly. In a book
published here this week, the archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams,
the likely next archbishop of Canterbury, labels the war in
Afghanistan as responding to terrorism with terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Yet in the newspapers, on the radio and television, and in the
concert halls of the Barbican Centre, an American composer and his
Americanness have been cause not just for celebration but outright
jubilation.</LD>
<LD>   Every January, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Barbican jointly
sponsor a "Composer Weekend," a three-day immersion in the works of a
single composer of the 20th and now 21st century. Berg, Janacek,
Weill, Hindemith, Berio, Birtwistle, Boulez, Lutoslawski, Ives,
Tavener and Schnittke have been among those investigated since the
series began with Stockhausen in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   This year, the composer was John Adams.</TE>
<TE>   From Friday to Sunday, "John's Earbox," as the weekend was called,
included eight all-Adams concerts, along with films and talks. It
began with a concert performance of the opera "The Death of
Klinghoffer" and ended with a new orchestral piece, "Guide to Strange
Places."</TE>
<TE>   Weekend passes to the entire festival were snapped up in October
immediately after they went on sale. Nearly every event was sold out,
and some had long lines for cancellations. More than 20 works by
Adams were performed, with the 54-year-old, Bay Area-based composer
in residence throughout. The programs were broadcast by the BBC on
the radio, along with a week of preparatory programming. The final
concert was televised. The cheering, ecstatic crowds at the concerts
were highly unusual by the normally restrained standards here.</TE>
<TE>   Equally exceptional was the makeup of the audiences: sophisticated
classical music lovers, curious newcomers, teenagers wearing
Radiohead T-shirts, families who might just as well have taken a
Sunday stroll over to the popular Tate Modern.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't only the audiences who welcomed Adams. In one of the
many advance articles about the composer, Andrew Clark in the
Financial Times wondered whether Adams might not be the greatest
American composer of all, and certainly more all-around than George
Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Elliott Carter or Brian Wilson. Meanwhile,
the early reviews ranged from generally positive to wildly so.</TE>
<TE>   In the Guardian, Andrew Clements called Adams' 1985 orchestral
work, "Harmonielehre," "the definite postmodern masterpiece" and "one
of the landmarks in music of the second half of the 20th century."
Even a simple radio listing in the London Times described Adams as
"the composer most likely to bring together the disparate armies of
classical music fans and pop lovers."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the idea that Adams offers something for everyone seemed
to be exactly what British cultural life desperately seeks at the
moment. The most celebrated British composers either take the
Modernist high road (Harrison Birtwistle) or are unapologetically
populist (Michael Nyman) with divided, partisan and, in the case of
the Modernists, not terribly large audiences.</TE>
<TE>   There is also, in the post-Sept.11 present, a strong reaction
against fashionable new British art, especially the in-vogue young
British visual artists such as Damien Hirst. In a magazine article
last week, for instance, Ivan Massow, the chairman of the Institute
of Contemporary Arts in London, railed against the shoddiness of the
latest Conceptual art as "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless
tat."</TE>
<TE>   Adams was presented as the perfect tonic. In pre-concert talks, in
the press, in conversations with Barbican concert-goers, one heard
continual praise for Adams' bringing substance to a Postmodern mixing
of styles. His thoughtful, considerate and often amusing manner in
interviews further charmed and impressed. Many called him the new
Copland and sought the clue to his success in his relationship to the
American experience.</TE>
<TE>   A little controversy didn't hurt, either. The concert performance
of "The Death of Klinghoffer," the first British performance of the
complete work, inevitably attracted attention in the wake of the
recent cancellation of excerpts from the opera by the Boston
Symphony. But the attitude expressed by representatives of the BBC
Symphony--which performed it under its new chief conductor, American
Leonard Slatkin--was that the opera offered a serious examination of
the roots of terrorism and was exactly what the times called for.</TE>
<TE>   In the pre-concert talk with the composer, the librettist, Alice
Goodman, explained that for her the confrontation between Palestinian
hijackers and the American Jewish tourist, Leon Klinghoffer, on the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro was practically an Old Testament
story, with "people still killing each other over land and belief in
the Negev."</TE>
<TE>   Performed by an intense cast in a darkened auditorium, with a
sober attention to music and text (projected as surtitles), the mood
was one of somber and unflinching reflection on the terrible murder
of an innocent victim. If anything, the newspaper critics seemed
slightly disappointed that the opera was not rabble-rousing after
all; they complained about too much slow music. A shaken audience in
the hall, however, weighed in with thunderous applause (as, according
to reports, did an audience in Ferrara, Italy, where the opera was,
coincidentally, given a staging Sunday by an all-Italian cast).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the weekend, Adams' "Guide to Strange Places,"
which the composer conducted, startled with the immediacy of its
reflection of how the world has changed since Sept. 11. Completed in
September, just before the terrorist attacks, and premiered in
October in Amsterdam, it begins as an almost self-referential parody
of Adams in his Minimalist, chugging mode.</TE>
<TE>   The composer explained to the audience that, wanting to write a
lighthearted "fantastique" movement, he started with what he knew and
let himself go. But where he went was into dark, ominous, weird
realms that his music has never before entered. What begins as
bright, chirping birdsong ends with frightening bass drum thuds and
unresolved growls in the brass. To me, it sounded as if Adams had
presciently found the strange places we all discover after our
complacency is shattered.</TE>
<TE>   A wealth of music in between covered familiar Adams ground. Some
of the extremes were missing, which meant that the festival lacked
full context. There were none of the early experimental pieces, the
electronic pieces, the pop songs.</TE>
<TE>   Missing too were the recent masterworks ("Naive and Sentimental
Music" and "El Nino"). Still, the overview was extensive, and the
overall impression was of a composer ever ready to bring the world
and how he feels about it into the concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   Performances were mostly good, occasionally striking, once or
twice revelatory. Slatkin led an orchestral concert in addition to
"Klinghoffer," which included a more monumental than probing account
of "Harmonielehre."</TE>
<TE>   Leila Josefowicz tore into the first movement of the Violin
Concerto, with Adams conducting, as if it were adventurous rock 'n'
roll. I missed the mystery of the work's wandering melody in her
raucous playing, but who wouldn't be impressed by the sheer visceral
energy and virtuosity she brought to the performance as a whole, and
by her genuinely thrilling playing of the last movement?</TE>
<TE>   Of special note was baritone Christopher Maltman, richly
expressive as the captain in "Klinghoffer" and the soloist in "Wound
Dresser." Michael Collins was the wonderful clarinet soloist in
"Gnarly Buttons." Pianist Rolf Hinds brought colors to the early
Minimalist "Phrygian Gates" that I'd never heard before.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the whole rather than any single performance that was
the point of the weekend. London now knows Adams well, and it has
warmly embraced him. It seemed the only unhappiness the weekend
caused was to other British composers, who stayed away en masse, and,
of course, to Americans who, having no institutions comparable to the
BBC, look on such enterprises with jealousy. When it comes to the
treatment of our composers, the British have much to teach us.</TE>

<HD>Car Companies Team Up to Fight State's ZEV Rule</HD>
<DH>GM, DaimlerChrysler, Isuzu and several dealerships file
lawsuits targeting zero-emission vehicle requirements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., this time with several allies, has renewed its
attack on the California Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandate in a pair of
lawsuits quietly filed earlier this month in state and federal courts
in Fresno.</LD>
<LD>   In another suit, filed last year in federal court in Sacramento,
GM was the sole plaintiff. That suit was dismissed when the judge
ruled it premature because the mandate hadn't taken effect.</LD>
<LD>   This time, though, the world's largest auto maker has been joined
by DaimlerChrysler, Isuzu Motor Co. and a group of San Joaquin Valley
new-car dealers.</LD>
<TE>   The new federal suit, filed Jan. 3, argues that the so-called ZEV
Mandate is an illegal effort by the California Air Resources Board to
usurp federal regulation of auto makers' fuel economy standards.
Isuzu is not a party to the federal action.</TE>
<TE>   The state suit, filed the next day, claims CARB didn't provide
auto makers adequate notice of several last-minute changes to the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The mandate, which took effect this month, requires major auto
makers to provide a mix of zero-emission vehicles and
advanced-technology ultra-low-emission vehicles for sale in
California beginning with the 2003 model year.</TE>
<TE>   The original rules said the special vehicles must account for at
least 10% of the passenger cars they sell in the state each year with
true zero-emission vehicles accounting for at least 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu, which sells only SUVs in the U.S., jumped in on the state
suit because one of the changes lifts exemptions on light trucks and
sport-utility vehicles starting next decade, requiring Isuzu to
develop or acquire a zero-emissions vehicle of its own.</TE>
<TE>   A second change GM and DaimlerChrysler found objectionable limits
the auto industry's ability to use small, golf cart-like Neighborhood
Electric Vehicles to offset requirements for full-service,
freeway-legal electric vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM and other auto makers have argued that the full-service
electrics are expensive to build and must be subsidized to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Using credits awarded for early introduction of cheaper
neighborhood vehicles this year and next would greatly reduce the
need to develop the full-service electrics--and DaimlerChrysler's GEM
subsidiary is one of the biggest neighborhood electric-vehicle
makers.</TE>
<TE>   The auto companies' state suit also argues that CARB didn't
conduct an adequate environmental evaluation of the effects of the
ZEV Mandate and didn't demonstrate that the mandate is necessary to
improve air quality in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who say they've been expecting the suit,
disagree with the allegations, as does the CARB.</TE>
<TE>   From Concept to Reality</TE>
<TE>   Insiders at Ford say the company is seriously considering a U.S.
version of the Fusion concept shown at the L.A. auto show earlier
this month.</TE>
<TE>   It's a four-seat sub-subcompact that uses a hybrid gas-electric
power train.</TE>
<TE>   The Fusion uses a so-called B platform, which makes it about a
size-and-a-half smaller than Ford's compact Focus.</TE>
<TE>   "A" and "B" platforms are used all over Asia and Europe but have
long been considered too small for U.S. tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Fusion, with styling that emulates an SUV, looks bigger than it
is, though.</TE>
<TE>   Auto industry executives in the U.S. are starting to wonder if the
push for low-polluting cars could create interest in Fusion-sized
vehicles here, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion
that adds to the air pollution burden could be lessened if people
drove smaller cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The Fusion was shown at L.A. and later at the Detroit show to
gauge public interest, said Ford design chief J Mays.</TE>
<TE>   And although Ford called it a concept, Mays said it is very close
to a real vehicle the company will unveil for the European market
this year at the Geneva auto show.</TE>

<HD>'That '80s Show': Nostalgia Only Goes So Far</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the tradition of "Return to the Blue Lagoon," Thursday Night
Football and "Saved by the Bell: The New Class" comes "That '80s
Show"--not exactly a sequel, but an attempt to parlay the dubious
achievements of the original into a franchise.</LD>
<LD>   From the creators of "That '70s Show," the '80s version, which
premieres at 8 tonight on Fox, has a different cast but employs the
same basic formula: semi-dysfunctional family, throwaway gags, retro
tunes, loud clothes and louder laugh track.</LD>
<LD>   The show focuses on a group of twentysomethings living in San
Diego circa 1984: the creative soul Corey (Glenn Howerton); his
slacker sister Katie (Tinsley Grimes); his best friend, the eager
Reaganite Roger (Eddie Shin); their glamorous pal Sophia (Brittany
Daniel); and the snarling punker Tuesday (Chyler Leigh), who works
with Corey at the local music shop Permanent Record.</LD>
<TE>   Also on the scene are Corey and Katie's marketing whiz of a dad,
R.T. (Geoff Pierson), who is about to ride the fitness wave with his
Gut Whacker gizmo, and the record shop boss Margaret (Margaret
Smith), a weary Summer of Love survivor.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's debut, the struggling songwriter Corey fails at love
when Sophia abruptly dumps him to make a play for his sister, and
fails just as badly in the business world when his father's firm
briefly hires him to write pitch lines. Back at the record shop,
opposites repel when the tender Corey meets the spike-haired new hire
Tuesday, so stay tuned for a potential fiery flirtation in the style
of "The Breakfast Club."</TE>
<TE>   Though the writers toy with the theme of capitalism run amok,
"That '80s Show" is at its best when all it does is affectionately
mock those days when neckties were thin and portable phones were
large. Shin, whose character takes himself way too seriously,
provides tonight's funniest moments--first, when robot dancing to the
Talking Heads and, later, leading a frenzied session of "Dynasty"
shots, the couch potato drinking game (you take a swig whenever one
of the nighttime soap's characters gets slapped). Shin, whose Roger
is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox on "Family Ties," appears to be the
standout in a capable ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   "That '80s Show" has its moments, but it's a bit like a school
reunion: The nostalgic fun is intermittent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "That '80s Show" premieres at 8 tonight on Fox. The network has
rated it TV-PG-DLS (may be inappropriate for young children, with
additional advisories for suggestive dialogue, coarse language and
sexual situations).</TE>

<HD>Two Grittier Bands From British Isles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not every British Isles band in the flowering post-Oasis wave is a
moony romantic a la Coldplay or Starsailor. Two exponents of grittier
brands of dreams played Monday at the House of Blues: Welsh group the
Stereophonics and young Dublin trio JJ72.</LD>
<LD>   The difference between the two was indicated by their frontmen's
choice of attire: Stereophonics' singer Kelly Jones in efficient,
reliable denim; JJ72's Mark Greaney in black leather.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of three albums, the Stereophonics have developed a
style heavily rooted in '70s workingman's rock: Zeppelin beats;
pub-rooted character studies a la Rod Stewart and his Faces bandmate
Ronnie Lane; guitar licks straight out of, dare we say, Wings. They
came off at times Monday as a less-jaundiced Oasis.</LD>
<TE>   Jones' raspy voice suggests both Liam Gallagher and Stewart, with
maybe a little bluesy screech of Humble Pie-era Steve Marriott. And
song after song portrayed regular folks faced with big dreams and
temptations, yet satisfied with being regular. It's a noble state,
and the Stereophonics make a worthy ambassador for it.</TE>
<TE>   JJ72, though, doesn't seem likely to settle for regular. On the
band's recent debut album, Greaney seems to have digested everything
from the Velvet Underground to David Bowie to Joy Division to Nirvana
to Radiohead and managed to make something of his own, with melodic
drive and lyrics portraying complex emotional states from scattered
images and fragmented thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Live, though, the chemical reactions of that mix were explosive,
with Greaney's high, quavery voice jacked up to a raw scream and the
music flecked with bursts of feedback and noise from his guitar and
thunderous backing from bassist Hilary Woods and drummer Fergal
Matthews. And yet it retained plenty of anthemic hook appeal. The
performance was impressive not just for visceral power, but for
possibilities it promised.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Leap of Faith on Film</HD>
<DH>Movies*  In a rare move for Hollywood, the lead character
in 'A Walk to Remember' is a Christian. Religious leaders and studio
execs are closely watching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Walk to Remember" is not just another teen movie. It doesn't
follow the well-worn path that leads to lost virginity, slashers on
the loose, scatological humor or just plain silliness.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the film, which opens Friday, took the road less
traveled. "A Walk to Remember" is one of the first mainstream movies
of its genre to feature a heroine who is a likable, intelligent,
spunky Christian.</LD>
<LD>   Pop singer Mandy Moore plays the role of Jamie, a Baptist
preacher's daughter who isn't ashamed of her faith and wears frumpy
clothes and no makeup.</LD>
<TE>   In "A Walk to Remember," based on a Nicholas Sparks best-selling
book, she becomes the unlikely love interest of Landon (Shane West),
the biggest man--and jerk--on campus.</TE>
<TE>   And the movie contains a feminist-friendly twist: The bad boy
makes himself over to get the good girl. Landon changes his life--and
risks losing his friends--to be more like Jamie.</TE>
<TE>   Recent evangelical Christian films such as "The Omega Code," and
"Left Behind: The Movie"--produced and released by a religious
organization and a specialty production house, not by Hollywood
studios--have shown that movies with overtly religious content can be
modestly successful.</TE>
<TE>   "The Omega Code," funded by Trinity Broadcasting Network in Orange
County, opened at No. 10 at the box office its first weekend in 1999
and eventually took in $12.5 million, the highest gross for a
Christian film. "Left Behind," produced by Cloud Ten Pictures, sold
more than 2.5 million video copies in 2000 before its theatrical
release early this year.</TE>
<TE>   But "A Walk to Remember," released by Warner Bros. for a pre-teen
and teen market, is different, producer Denise Di Novi said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an 'Omega Code.' This is a film for young people with
a Christian character. I want this film to reach everyone and inspire
everyone on a spiritual level."</TE>
<TE>   The risky subject matter has the movie's executives and religious
leaders eagerly awaiting the box-office results, which some see as a
viability test for mainstream films with unapologetic religious
themes.</TE>
<TE>   The film's spiritual content has led the studio to launch what's
believed to be the largest marketing campaign for a mainstream movie
targeted at the Christian community. Previously, Hollywood has made
small marketing forays into the same territory with films such as
"Pay It Forward," "K-PAX" and "The Family Man."</TE>
<TE>   Devoted fans of Sparks' novels and Moore's records and MTV
appearances will give the movie a marketing boost, as will the
spiritual message that's delivered within a hip teen movie, said Dawn
Taubin, president of domestic marketing for Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids have an antenna for something that's good for them," and
they don't like something "that feels like medicine," Taubin said.
"['A Walk to Remember' comes] in a package that's really appealing."</TE>
<TE>   An early version of the film was shown to, along with traditional
test audiences, Christian groups, which led to the elimination of
some of the profanity, including a "Jesus Christ!" outburst. And
while members of the faith-based media are mostly ignored by the
industry's publicity machine--often having to buy a ticket to review
a movie--this time they were courted.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the studio flew in Christian journalists from
around the country for a weekend junket. The studio also sent 10,000
study guides--with film clips and posters--to high school youth
pastors across the country. The packets asked pastors to take
teenagers to the film on opening weekend (the guide contains group
ticket sales information) and on Sunday engage them, as the booklet
says, "in a conversation about how their faith can have a profound
influence on the people around them."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has generated an early buzz within the Christian
community. "This is the first major Hollywood production I have
reviewed in the past 15 years that featured a Christian who didn't
turn out to be a hypocrite, a bigot or a crazed killer," writes movie
reviewer Phil Boatwright of the Baptist Press.</TE>
<TE>   CCM magazine--the Christian world's version of Entertainment
Weekly--called the movie "a supreme creation--edgy, smart and in
another league altogether." Another influential magazine,
Christianity Today, said it was "a remarkable film."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent interview, Moore, a 17-year-old Catholic, said
she's also curious about whether the "low- to medium-budget movie"
(Warner Bros. isn't disclosing the exact cost) can draw large
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of anxious to see if it does start a new trend because
it's always been such an off-limits topic," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Di Novi said she thinks the movie's spiritual overtones helped "A
Walk to Remember" test higher in focus groups than any of her
previous 17 films, including "Edward Scissorhands," "Little Women"
and "Message in a Bottle."</TE>
<TE>   Most of today's movies, TV shows and music don't support kids who
are thinking about things other "than what clothes they are wearing
and where to get pierced," Di Novi said. "Kids need to see there are
other teenagers who have the same spiritual yearning that they have."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who has her own MTV show in addition to hit records, said
the strength of Jamie's character drew her to the role.</TE>
<TE>   "She was such a good model for people to look up to regardless of
what religion you may be or what you believe in," said Moore, who
sings two original songs for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   For three months during filming in North Carolina, Moore traded
her streaked blond hair for a conservative mousy-brown cut ("with
bangs!" she says). And she exchanged her teen-sensation wardrobe of
sexy tight pants and shirts for simple, modest dresses and one ugly,
faded avocado sweater.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot to make Mandy not look like a supermodel," Di Novi
said. "I think girls really like that Jamie had the courage to not
care what she wore." Hunt Lowry, a producer who, along with E.K.
Gaylord II, provided the film's financial muscle, said Christians
have been painted inaccurately in most films--"they're either too
fanatical or too perfect."</TE>
<TE>   "What's so great is Jamie's just a normal girl," said Lowry, a
recent convert to Catholicism. "She just happens to be a big
believer. It's handled very nicely. You've got to snare the truth.
You lose an audience when it's not real."</TE>
<TE>   Many conservative Christians haven't complained about the movie's
realistic depiction of high school life, which includes some mild
profanity, sexual innuendo and drinking and drug references.</TE>
<TE>   Di Novi says it was critical to give a realistic portrayal of teen
life if the movie was going to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to make a movie that didn't feel like Bible study
or Sunday school," Di Novi said. "I really wanted to make a movie
that all kids can relate to."</TE>

<LD>   Estefans Get Restraining Order Against Actor</LD>
<LD>   Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio Estefan Jr., were granted a
temporary restraining order against an actor and aspiring singer who
has accused Emilio Estefan of making sexual advances and threatening
him.</LD>
<TE>   Judge Deborah White-Labora granted the order for the singer and
her music mogul husband against Juan Carlos Diaz, who has requested a
similar order against Emilio Estefan.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz was denied the order Jan. 15, but the judge set a Jan. 28
hearing on Diaz's petition. Diaz, who was in the 2000 film "Escape
From Cuba," alleges that Estefan touched him inappropriately when
they worked out at a gym and asked him for sexual favors over two
years. The couple's lawyer has called the allegations unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   The Estefans have described Diaz as an unwanted trespasser who has
harassed them at their home and the gym. Police records show Diaz has
twice been issued a trespassing warning, once at the Estefans' Miami
mansion and once at the gym.</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Jailed on Murder Allegation</TE>
<TE>   Rapper C-Murder, younger brother of music artist Master P, has
been arrested in the shooting death of a 16-year-old at a nightclub
in Harvey, La., authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police accused Corey Miller, 30, of fatally shooting Steve Thomas
following an argument Jan. 12. As many as 300 people were inside the
Platinum Club at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors will decide what charges should be filed against
Miller, who was out on bail on an attempted murder charge in Baton
Rouge when the Harvey incident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is a best-selling artist on Master P's No Limit Records.</TE>

<TE>   NYC Arts Institutions Forced to Wait in Line</TE>
<TE>   New York's cultural institutions, bracing for belt-tightening
under new Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, may have to delay or curtail
some projects because of the recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Bolstered by a booming economy, ex-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
had allocated $484.7 million to the arts--more than any other New
York City mayor in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Those with the most to lose are those with the largest capital
commitment from the city through 2005, the New York Times reports.
They include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has been promised
$26.2 million to nearly double its exhibition space; the New York
Botanical Garden, which is expecting a $31.3-million face-lift; the
Museum of Modern Art, which is waiting for $30 million to increase
space and build temporary quarters in Long Island City during the
renovation; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which had been told
it was getting $24 million for a new downtown site.</TE>
<TE>   Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, an
advocacy group, predicts that practical concerns having to do with
the city's survival will take precedence when the mayor announces a
preliminary budget Feb. 14.</TE>
<TE>   "Since no one wants to go back to the days when they didn't paint
bridges, cultural projects will be at the bottom of the list," she
said. "And when they get to the bottom of the list, there will be
nothing left."</TE>

<TE>   Limbaugh Shares Good News With Listeners</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since receiving a cochlear transplant to
correct his hearing loss, talk show host Rush Limbaugh discussed his
condition with listeners this week, saying that he was able to hear
the show for the first time in three or four months.</TE>
<TE>   And the sound quality? Slightly better than what you get when you
record someone on a micro-cassette recorder, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit better than that, but there's a light
fuzziness," USA Today quoted him as saying. "But as far as voices
sounding as I remember them, they do. As far as tonal quality,
everything is normal."</TE>
<TE>   Limbaugh, 51, had been deaf in both ears because of autoimmune
inner ear disease. The tiny electrodes, inserted in an operation a
few weeks ago, were activated this week.</TE>

<LD>When choreographer Mark Morris last visited the Southland in October,
he brought us an ugly frog, vain gods and goddesses, enchanting
natural creatures and magical staging effects.</LD>
<LD>   Morris was appearing in his role of director and choreographer for
the all-but-forgotten opera "Platee" by Rameau, which Morris had
staged for the Edinburgh International Festival in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   He returns this week in the more familiar but stripped-down guise
of director of the Mark Morris Dance Group, which will present five
works at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, Thursday to Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Four of them are new to Southern California. Morris will be
dancing one of them, "Peccadillos," a solo he created for Mikhail
Baryshnikov as part of Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project in 2000.
The other new pieces will be "Dancing Honeymoon" (created in 1998),
"Bijoux" (1983) and "V" (which premiered in London in October 2001).
Completing the program will be "The Office," created in 1994 and seen
that year at the Irvine theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't describe any of the dances," Morris said in a recent
phone interview from Detroit, where he and the company were
performing. "I will talk about the music and my dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be doing 'Dancing Honeymoon' which is for seven of us, to
music that was popular between the [world] wars. It's for violin,
piano, soprano and drums. It's choreographed to recordings of
Gertrude Lawrence and Jack Buchanan, transcribed and arranged for
this combination. I didn't do it. My music director [Ethan Iverson]
did it. He's a genius jazz musician."</TE>
<TE>   "Bijoux" is "a little solo for a woman [dancer], soprano and piano
to songs that are not very often heard, by Erik Satie."</TE>
<TE>   "Peccadillos" is another solo, also to music by Satie, "played on
a toy piano. It's piano and me. I do it. Misha still does it.
Basically, it's the same steps. It's the same dance."</TE>
<TE>   The newest piece, "V," is set to the Schumann Piano Quintet in E
flat, Opus 44. "This quintet is one of the great pieces of chamber
music," Morris said. "I've known it for 25 years. It just turned out
to be time to make a dance to it. It's four movements, quite
substantial. It's an unbelievable work."</TE>
<TE>   Using 14 dancers, the work is "as big a dance as my company can do
and still have covers. We haven't performed it very much." Does the
title have significance?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. It's a quintet for one thing. It doesn't make much
difference. There are some V [formations] in the dance. The title
came after the dance. There's no secret text to it. It was the first
dance I did in my new building. I worked about a month and a half,
two months on it."</TE>
<TE>   The new building is the 30,000-square-foot Mark Morris Dance
Center in Brooklyn that opened last year. "I feel thrilled and
shocked that we actually got this done," Morris said. "It's a great,
unbelievable, fabulous place. We've been rehearsing there since June.</TE>
<TE>   "It means there is someplace where we actually work and it's our
own headquarters and a home instead of rented studios all over town
that are really [awful]. My offices and the studios are in the same
building, which we haven't had since [the company was in a three-year
residency at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in] Brussels."</TE>
<TE>   The space will be shared with other companies and will include a
school that teaches all kinds of dance, as well as yoga.</TE>
<TE>   "We're teaching dance so that people get a chance at it and get to
know if they like it or not," Morris said. "I'm not trying to breed
people to dance with my company. It's already going very, very well."</TE>
<TE>   After Detroit, the company went back to New York for a few days
then flew out to Irvine. After this engagement, the troupe goes to
Scottsdale, Ariz., and St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "Traveling is a horrible nightmare," Morris said. "It takes
security five times as long as it used to. But for the last few
years, we've been touring for about six months a year. Touring is
quite a big mix now of what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Another constant is live accompaniment. "It's a very important
thing for me," he said. "It makes the shows real-er and better, and I
think that's wonderful. We take our own musicians. It's a lot more
work. But it's so much better."</TE>
<TE>   Returning to his new base is different since Sept. 11, however.
"New York is still shocked, and everybody goes on with what they do,"
he said. "Of course, everything is new.... Works of art look
different. Everything has changed a little bit. The meanings of
things have changed a little bit. I can't say how."</TE>

<HD>Vereen Dominates a Sentimentalized 'Fosse'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compared to the versions previously seen on local stages, a very
different edition of the Broadway musical "Fosse" comes to the PBS
"Great Performances" series tonight.</LD>
<LD>   In its pre-Broadway tour and national company performances,
"Fosse" was not only a tribute to the acclaimed choreographer and
director who died in 1987, but also a restaging of his dances for a
whole new generation of virtuosos.</LD>
<LD>   The TV version, however, is dominated by veteran song-and-dance
man Ben Vereen, who worked for Fosse a number of times and now takes
over number after number, including "Life Is Just a Bowl of
Cherries," an anthem that used to belong to the show's female diva.</LD>
<TE>   Even without the occasional appearances of Fosse protege (and
"Fosse" co-director) Ann Reinking, the Vereen segments turn "Fosse"
into a nostalgia musical, one further sentimentalized by interview
footage that tries to erase the bad-boy image that Fosse cultivated
and make him an icon of the American work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Taped on Broadway last August, the TV "Fosse" has also been
shortened, running under two hours, with four numbers missing that
survive in the home videocassette and DVD available from Image
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   As usual with its re-cut dance programming, PBS adds no "edited
for television" title to the credits.</TE>
<TE>   TV director Matthew Diamond confuses some of the large-scale
choreography but handles intimate passages skillfully.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, most of the numbers that Fosse originally choreographed
for film and television do look better on camera here than they did
when restaged for the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Vereen works hard, if not always well, but the show's original
edge and style come through in fine performances by Ken Alan,
Rachelle Rak, Marc Calamia, Meg Gillentine and Dana Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Edwaard Liang. Not only does his star solo and a steamy duet
end up on the PBS cutting-room floor, but his dancing in the "Mr.
Bojangles" number gets minimized by lighting and camera angles that
emphasize Vereen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Fosse" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV's "Great Performances"
series.</TE>

<HD>'American Family' Finally Arrives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In April 2000, producer Gregory Nava ("El Norte," "Selena") delivered
a series pilot to CBS that promised to break new ground as the first
TV drama built around a Latino cast.</LD>
<LD>   But what transpired in the ensuing months broke more hearts than
ground, as support for "American Family" eroded amid network concerns
that the story of an East L.A. family struggling with pressures both
internal and external just didn't have the right stuff for the fall
lineup. Some suggested that the real concern was that the cast was
too ethnic for mainstream audiences. The show, starring Edward James
Olmos as the family patriarch, was shopped around to other networks,
and rumors of new deals and airdates came and went without success.</LD>
<LD>   The story might have ended there had not PBS and sponsor Johnson &amp;
Johnson stepped into the breach to make tonight's debut of "American
Family" possible (8 p.m. KCET, KVCR). Additional episodes, which
began filming last fall, will air at 8 p.m. Thursday and then settle
into a regular Wednesday night slot.</LD>
<TE>   The long delay between the pilot and Thursday's new episode
necessitated several changes in the cast, but Nava's warm tone and
sure hand as writer and director make the transition almost seamless.</TE>
<TE>   The strong cast, along with Olmos, features Sonia Braga, Raquel
Welch, Rachel Ticotin, Constance Marie and Esai Morales. The show's
at its best when in storyteller mode, letting the plot unfold
naturally and using flashbacks with skill and sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Some manic moments of comedy are less successful, but both
tonight's pilot and Thursday's episode build momentum with elegance
around family crises, commitment and celebration.</TE>
<TE>   It's a family anyone can embrace.</TE>

<HD>GM Mulling Big Shift in Car Design</HD>
<DH>'Skateboard' Platform Versatility May Represent Industry's
Future</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. says it has seen the future, and it is ... a
skateboard.</LD>
<LD>   Not a flying skateboard, the likes of which Michael J. Fox swooped
around on in "Back to the Future," but almost as fanciful.</LD>
<LD>   GM says it has the technology to build free-standing car platforms
packed with fuel cells and all the other elements of an automotive
power train. They would be zero-emission vehicles with fuel economy
the equivalent of more than 100 miles per gallon.</LD>
<TE>   It won't happen overnight, but GM's top executives say they see a
time when the "skateboard" platform, dubbed Autonomy, would be the
basis for all of its consumer vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "We started with the premise, 'What if we were inventing the
automobile today rather than a century ago? What might we do
differently?'" GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said at the Autonomy
introduction at the North American International Auto Show this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Autonomy is more than just a new concept car; it's potentially
the start of a revolution in how automobiles are designed, built and
used," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of an Autonomy chassis gliding silently, with no seats
or vehicle frame on top of it, is almost spooky.</TE>
<TE>   It resembles a large, self-powered skateboard: a sculpted,
6-inch-thick, self-contained auto chassis with attachment points onto
which any type of vehicle body--from roadster to recreational
vehicle--could be fitted.</TE>
<TE>   The propulsion system is contained within the chassis, and
steering and braking are electronic, so there is no need to affix
brake and accelerator pedals or a steering column to the platform.
Instead, a steering yolk is plugged into the platform when a body is
attached.</TE>
<TE>   Even the familiar instrument panel is gone. An Autonomy vehicle
displays all information for the driver on the control yolk.</TE>
<TE>   Most components are software-based, so the platform can be easily
upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   GM figures the chassis would last 20 years, so vehicle bodies
could be shifted with drivers' needs--or even with the seasons--and
be replaced at will. Owners could switch from a roadster to a wagon
to a minivan while keeping the same platform.</TE>
<TE>   "If our vision of the future is correct--and we think it
is--Autonomy could reinvent the automobile and our entire industry,"
said Larry Burns, GM's vice president of research, development and
planning.</TE>
<TE>   GM believes it could cover the entire consumer vehicle market with
two or three variants of the Autonomy platform.</TE>
<TE>   The Autonomy presented at the auto show uses four 25-kilowatt
motors, one at each wheel. That's the equivalent of a 140-horsepower
internal combustion engine, respectable power for a small to mid-size
sedan. But power could be enhanced by adding fuel stacks, much like
increasing the memory of a computer through expansion slots.</TE>
<TE>   That expandability overcomes the problem auto makers face of
spending so much to develop new internal-combustion engine designs
that they must use the engines for years to recoup the cost.
Companies can get locked into a lineup of engines that are too
expensive to update.</TE>
<TE>   But with fuel cells, "If you need to double the kilowatt output,
you double the number of plates in the stack," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier to manufacture, safer and ultimately more
affordable," he said. "This is going to allow us to reinvent the
rules of automotive design."</TE>
<TE>   GM's concept Autonomy is a sleek, low-slung road-hugger
reminiscent of the latest Batmobile. GM design chief Wayne Cherry
said the sweeping lines up front show there's no power train in the
two-seater's body.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers could position themselves wherever they felt comfortable
in the car, farther forward or farther back, and not just on the
left-hand side, he said. The yolk-mounted controls could be locked
into a right-hand position if the driver chose to sit there.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a body, the Autonomy platform has an eerie kind of
beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted it to be a stand-alone design statement," Cherry said.
He added that this is a workable model for the future of vehicle
propulsion, and not just some far-fetched concept to strut onto auto
show stages. "This is extremely serious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as with all new technology, the stumbling blocks are numerous.
First, the viability of fuel cells is not a given, and debate rages
over whether the technology, including retail delivery of the
hydrogen needed to produce electrical power in a fuel cell, can be
brought to market in an affordable fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Performance issues also must be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Could GM build an Autonomy sport-utility vehicle that could tow a
2,000-pound trailer? GM and other manufacturers working on fuel cells
say perhaps not today, but that fuel cells are getting smaller and
more powerful by the month.</TE>
<TE>   Can obstacles to delivering the fuel be overcome? An Autonomy car
wouldn't be worth a nickel if drivers run out of power looking for a
place to refuel.</TE>
<TE>   And would a vehicle that has no engine block to absorb much of the
impact of a crash be as safe or safer than today's cars in a head-on
collision?</TE>
<TE>   The Autonomy has specially designed front- and rear-impact zones,
but extensive testing, and probably redesign, are needed before an
acceptable safety level could be achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Still, GM is so serious about Autonomy, Burns said, that it has 24
patent applications on it. That's in addition to 300 patent
applications regarding fuel cells in general.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel-cell cars are coming, there's no doubt about that. Ford Motor
Co. says it will put a fuel-cell version of the Focus on the market
in a limited test fleet in 2004, and DaimlerChrysler plans to produce
fuel-cell buses for city fleets.</TE>
<TE>   To develop a uniform approach to fuel-cell vehicles and developent
of a hydrogen infrastructure, the Bush administration this month
announced the Freedom Car partnership between the government and GM,
Ford and DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   GM insists that the easiest way to deliver fuel in the current
economy is through gasoline at service stations. In that interim
scenario, fuel-cell vehicles would use on-board reformers to extract
the hydrogen from gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   But it would not be a zero-impact vehicle because the carbon from
the gas would be expelled as carbon dioxide, a gas that contributes
to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the best way to deliver fuel is to produce the hydrogen
in large plants and then truck or pipe it to refueling stations. A
few companies are even working on home hydrogen makers that use water
and natural gas, and researchers are exploring the use of
hydroelectric and solar power to provide clean energy for hydrogen
extraction.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hurdles, auto makers say they are committed to
switching from internal combustion engines to hydrogen, though
executives and industry experts say it could be 30 or more years
before such a transformation is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, auto makers who are developing fuel cells say city
buses fueled by diesel and delivery trucks and taxis that make
numerous stops would be prime candidates for fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   GM says an Autonomy chassis would be particularly appropriate
because space is not taken up for the propulsion system. With buses,
hydrogen could be stored in secure tanks on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   With proper connectors, the Autonomy platform could even serve as
a backup energy source for powering a home or business.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers want vehicles they can be passionate about, that offer
functionality and flexibility, and that are safe and comfortable to
drive," Burns said. "This is better than anything we have today."</TE>

<HD>Lax Parents Giving Teen Drivers a License to Kill</HD>
<DH>Rules governing recently licensed youths can save lives--if
adults see they are followed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A column about the tragic consequences of teen drivers violating
California's provisional license law (Highway 1, Jan. 9), brought
mail from readers who expressed anguish over recent teen deaths and
frustration with parents who allow their kids to skirt the law.</LD>
<LD>   "You said exactly what all parents need to hear. We have to be the
ones to enforce the driving laws and rules for our kids," wrote Di
Keller Kaplan of Westlake Village. ''I have friends, I'm ashamed to
say, who have blatantly let their 16-year-old children drive younger
children around without an adult in the car. They let them drive
after midnight. It's all a total disregard for the law and the safety
of their kids and everyone else on the road," Kaplan said.</LD>
<LD>   She and others said a Dec. 29 crash that killed two teenagers and
injured two others would never have happened if the teens had obeyed
the provisional license rules.</LD>
<TE>   Kenneth Marshall Glass, the 16-year-old driver, was prohibited
under the state's graduated driver's license law from driving with
passengers under the age of 20, unless accompanied by a licensed
driver 25 or older. He also was forbidden to drive between midnight
and 5 a.m. His parents were out of town when the crash occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary probe into the crash indicates that the
Mercedes-Benz station wagon was traveling 106 mph when Glass lost
control about 1 a.m. The vehicle slammed into a wall on Westlake
Boulevard near Hillcrest Drive, a stretch of road with a 45-mph speed
limit.</TE>
<TE>   Glass and his friend, Jordan Bass, 16, died at the scene.
Passengers Joshua Kuai, 16, of Westlake Village, and Jenae Chu, 16,
of Thousand Oaks, survived but were hospitalized with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcing the law and keeping teens safe can be tough for parents
whose children see other parents ignoring the rules, readers said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol alone issued 1,433 teenage
provisional driving violations in 2001. That's up from 832 violations
in 2000, said CHP spokeswoman Anne DaVigo.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said the Westlake accident should be a wake-up call
for all parents who leave their teens home alone when they are out of
town.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how responsible and good the kid is, they're still
kids, and ... temptation and bad judgment can have terrible
consequences," Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the provisional license law is not difficult to
understand, the state allowed a number of exceptions that enable
teens to avoid or fudge the restrictions, some parents say.</TE>
<TE>   For example, teens are allowed to ignore the restrictions if they
have notes signed by parents, physicians, school principals or
employers stating it is necessary for them to drive at restricted
times or to carry young passengers without adult supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said teens bent on being out unchaperoned could
easily write a note and forge the signature of a parent, employer or
school official. The last two, especially, are difficult to check at
2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   And law enforcement officers in California can't stop a teen
driver with kids in the car just because the driver may look as if
he's still on a provisional license. Another violation--such as
speeding or failing to obey a stop sign--must be observed to warrant
the traffic stop.</TE>
<TE>   So some young drivers probably figure they can easily circumvent
the provisional restrictions so long as they don't get caught
violating other driving laws.</TE>
<TE>   For readers who expressed confusion over the provisional law,
here's a recap, as stated in the California Driver handbook.</TE>
<TE>   To get a provisional license, youths must be at least 16 years
old, pass the state driving test and have finished both driver
education and driver training courses.</TE>
<TE>   They must have had an instruction permit for at least six months,
and the parents are required to sign an affidavit certifying that the
teenager has had 50 hours of supervised driving practice.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, teens are allowed to drive alone with a provisional
license as long as they have not had an accident or traffic
violation.</TE>
<TE>   During the first six months of the provisional license, teens
driving between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. or at any time with
passengers under 20 in the car must be accompanied by a parent or
other licensed driver 25 years of age or older.</TE>
<TE>   During the second six months, teen drivers can haul passengers
under 20 without an adult driver in the car between the hours of 5
a.m. and midnight. But that adult--25 or older--still must be in the
car from midnight until 5 a.m. After that first year and until the
teen turns 18, the license remains a provisional one.</TE>
<TE>   Violations of the graduated license law, traffic tickets or
accidents occurring while driving with a provisional license can
result in strict limitations on driving or even in a six-month
license suspension, depending on the severity of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Parents also have the right to request that the Department of
Motor Vehicles cancel a teen's license if they believe the teen is
driving recklessly.</TE>
<TE>   Teen drivers convicted of using alcohol or a controlled substance
face a mandatory one-year license suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Driving privileges also can be delayed, suspended or revoked if
youths are convicted of habitual truancy from school, vandalism or
offenses involving firearms.</TE>
<TE>   One reader asked whether insurance companies cover accident claims
if they result from a crash in which the driver has violated terms of
his or her provisional license.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gonzales, spokesman for the Auto Club of Southern California,
said that yes, accident claims are covered for insured teen drivers
even if they were in violation of their provisional license at the
time of the accident. Of course, such negligence can make it hard to
keep insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, reader Rick Schlegel raised concerns about kids having
access to high-powered or hard-to-handle vehicles. Because speed and
inexperience seem to be a common thread in many of these fatal
accidents, Schlegel questioned the wisdom of letting teens drive such
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents, he wrote, "seem to only care about buying them a new
Mercedes, BMW or SUV. They don't realize what the car is capable of
and just turn them loose with it."</TE>

<HD>Spilling the Beans on Removing Wine Stains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Davis is famous for perfecting how wine is made. Leave it to a
16-year-old to find the best way to unmake it. Natalie Ramirez, a
high school student doing a summer internship in UC Davis' enology
department, conducted an experiment to find the best way to remove
wine stains.</LD>
<LD>   She tried to remove red wine from four different types of cloth
using a variety of cleaners and methods. Among her findings:</LD>
<LD>   * Stains that had been left overnight were, predictably, harder to
remove than stains that were treated immediately. But the most
effective methods for getting at the stains did not change. The
processes that were best for a 2-minute-old stain were still the best
for those that had set.</LD>
<TE>   * To the surprise of no one who has ever tipped over a glass, silk
is the hardest material to get wine stains out of. Nylon is the
easiest (relax, cotton was second-easiest).</TE>
<TE>   * The best commercial cleaning product is something called
Erado-Sol made by a company named Camco (www.ecamco.com). It can be
ordered online or from a laboratory supply house--$4 for a 2-ounce
squirt bottle or $1,850 for a 55-gallon drum. Spray 'n' Wash worked
just as well on cotton.</TE>
<TE>   * But the best treatment in most cases was a solution of equal
parts of 3% hydrogen peroxide and Dawn dishwashing liquid (be careful
using it on colored fabrics, though.)</TE>
<TE>   * The staple cleaners of wine folklore proved to be among the
least effective. Rubbing a red wine stain with white wine actually
made the stain worse on silk, though it did seem to do some good on
nylon. Sprinkling the stain with salt proved just as ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   The experiments were conducted under the supervision of Andrew
Waterhouse, an enology professor at Davis. Her work finished, Ramirez
returned to Center High School in Sacramento, where she is a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Great Expectations</TE>
<TE>   How much can you trust your perceptions of a wine? Not too,
according to a study by a French linguist named Frederic Brochet
reported in the Times of London newspaper. He ran two experiments to
find how expectations can affect how we taste.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, he presented a panel of wine experts with a series
of red wines, including one that was a white wine made red with
flavorless dye. Not one expert detected it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a well-known psychological phenomenon--you taste what you
are expected to taste," said Brochet, who in November presented a
paper on "The Color of Odor." "They were expecting to taste a red
wine, and so they did."</TE>
<TE>   In a second test, he presented the same wine twice to a group of
judges, the first time describing it as a prestigious grand cru
Bordeaux, the second time as a cheaper wine. You guessed it: The
judges overwhelmingly favored the wine they thought was more
expensive. While only 12 of the 50-odd experts liked the wine when
they thought it was cheap, 40 liked it when they thought it was
expensive.</TE>

<HD>The Simple Pot Roast Hits the Big Time</HD>
<DH>'Mom Food' No More, Braises Move Upscale</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES FOOD EDITOR</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most talked-about dish in Los Angeles right now isn't some daring
fusion of distant ethnic cuisines. It isn't a whimsical,
gravity-defying construction. It doesn't involve foie gras or
truffles or any other expensive ingredients. It is served at Jar,
Mark Peel and Suzanne Tracht's new restaurant, and it is pot roast.</LD>
<LD>   After decades of menus based on quick-cooking sautes and grills,
chefs and diners are rediscovering the pleasures of slow food. The
braise is back.</LD>
<LD>   It is one of the hallmarks at Jar, which opened five months ago
near the Beverly Center. "We wanted to focus on meats but be
different than the steakhouses, so we decided to focus on braises,"
Tracht says. "We were sitting around talking one day and Mark just
said 'pot roast,' and we knew it was right.</LD>
<TE>   "Anybody can make a great New York steak taste good or foie gras.
But to take a tough piece of meat and make it delicious is a little
bit of a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they're not the only ones embracing what was once
considered the homeliest of cooking techniques. A couple of blocks
away at Lucques, chef Suzanne Goin is going through braised short
ribs like nobody's business. She says she sometimes serves 50 orders
a night, which means cooking more than 100 pounds every day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going on with the short ribs," Goin says.
"Part of it is that everyone's talking about it, so, of course,
everyone wants it. And there's also the comfort food thing. They were
really hot over the holidays because everyone was bringing their
family in--short ribs are something Grandpa will eat. Food lovers
love them, but so do people who think squab might be too exotic."</TE>
<TE>   At its most fundamental, braising refers to the long, slow cooking
of meats in a covered pan with some liquid. Usually, only the
toughest cuts are used, because the tougher cuts have more flavor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an inverse ratio between tenderness and flavor," says
Peel. "A tenderloin is very tender but it has no flavor. A brisket
has great flavor, but you wouldn't want to eat it rare. Braising
develops rich flavors and tenderness you can never get from the
so-called best cuts of meat."</TE>
<TE>   What makes meat tough is connective tissue, which develops in
muscles that get a lot of exercise. Connective tissue is a protein,
but it cooks differently than normal muscle. When raw or rare, it is
stringy. But when it is cooked to a higher temperature with moisture
present, it melts, making meat juicy and flavorful.</TE>
<TE>   The common butcher's advice is that the cuts that are closest to
the ground are the ones that are best for braising. That means
shanks, bellies, short ribs (which come from the end of the rib cage
near the belly), brisket (the belly) and similar pieces. On menus
today you'll find braises made from everything from duck legs to pork
bellies.</TE>
<TE>   Though pot roast is classically made from a cut from the
shoulder--pot, chuck, blade or seven-bone roast--at Jar they use
short ribs, though a special restaurant variation that has removed
the thick pad of meat from the bones.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to our meat supplier and told him I wanted to do pot
roast, but that I wanted it to be a little different," Tracht says.
"He said he had the perfect thing, that he'd been trying to sell it
to chefs but without any luck. They call it a denuded short rib, and
it is the big piece of meat on top of the short rib with the bones
taken off and everything cleaned up. That's the tenderest piece of
braising meat I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the cuts of meat used in the Jar and Lucques braises
similar, but many of the important points of technique are too. Both
chefs emphasize the importance of browning the meat well before you
add any liquid.</TE>
<TE>   "One key is get a really, really good sear," says Goin. At
Lucques, the short ribs are browned in heavy black cast-iron pans
placed over the highest heat. "Most people don't have the right pans
or don't use a high enough heat. When I'm cooking with my mom, that's
the biggest mistake she makes. I'm always saying, 'Mom, you didn't
get the pan hot enough.'"</TE>
<TE>   Once the meat is browned, put it in a braising pan. At home, it's
best to use a Dutch oven or other cast-iron pot with a close-fitting
lid to seal in the moisture. On the other hand, at both restaurants
they braise in "hotel pans"--flimsy aluminum boxes that are covered
with aluminum foil (at Lucques, they first use a tight seal of
oven-proof plastic wrap, but that can result in some nasty steam
burns if you're not careful when you unwrap it). What's important is
to use a pan that will neatly hold the meat. If the pan is too much
bigger than the cut you're using, the meat will be swimming in liquid
and won't be as fully flavored.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a lot of good browned bits that have stuck to the
bottom of the searing pan, and you'll want to make sure to include
those. Pour off the leftover fat and deglaze the pan. Usually this is
done with a liquid--wine or stock--but at Lucques they add diced
carrots, celery and onions and the moisture released when they cook
does just as good a job.</TE>
<TE>   Which liquid you'll add to the braise is critical. It can be as
basic as water, or as complex as you want to make it. At Lucques,
Goin uses a combination of balsamic vinegar, reduced Port and red
wine along with veal stock. At Jar, it's simply Sherry and chicken
stock. This is what makes the dishes so different: Lucques' short
ribs come in a sauce that is dark purple, intensely flavored and
thick while Jar's is tan, clear and light in texture.</TE>
<TE>   At Lucques, the liquid is added to the level of the top of the
meat. At Jar it only comes three-quarters of the way. "That way you
get a nice brown crust on top," says Tracht. "When that comes out of
the oven, we have to put an armed guard around it or everyone will be
picking at it."</TE>
<TE>   There is no hard and fast rule for how long a braise needs to
cook. The only way you can tell is by touch. At first, the meat will
tighten up and feel hard and dry, then it will begin to relax. When a
braise is done, you can stick a meat fork in it with almost no
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like when they made Kickapoo Joy Juice in 'Li'l Abner,'"
says Peel. "When someone asked how they knew it was done, they'd say,
'When you feel in your heart that it's done, it's done.'"</TE>
<TE>   When the meat is done, let it cool in the cooking liquid. This can
be done either before or after the liquid has been strained of any
cooking vegetables and it helps ensure a really moist, tender dish.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, make sure that the cooking liquid is well skimmed of fat.
Because these tough cuts also contain a lot of marbling, they can
render an astonishing amount of fat. This will make the sauce
unpleasant and heavy. At home, the easiest way to remove it is to
chill the liquid separate from the meat. The fat will solidify on top
and you can skim it off with a slotted spoon.</TE>
<TE>   All this can be done well in advance. Braises actually improve
with cooling and reheating. Which is one of the reasons restaurants
are now so fond of them.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a great pickup dish," says Tracht. "All the work is done
at the beginning, all you have to do is reheat it and put it on the
plate. When people order them, it really takes a lot of pressure off
the saute and grill stations."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the days of nonworking moms, this was one of the braise's
chief selling points at home too. A stew could be started in the
morning and then left by itself while other household chores were
taken care of. With everyone working--and longer and longer hours--we
now go to restaurants to eat that kind of food.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are other reasons to braise in your own
kitchen--things that might be more appreciated by the modern home
cook. First, of course, they're economical--tough cuts are usually
the cheapest. (Though not always; osso buco has skyrocketed in price.
Tracht says she once complained to her meat man that she remembered
paying only $2.50 a pound for veal shanks and he responded, "Yeah,
and I remember walking to elementary school.")</TE>
<TE>   Braises smell great, too, filling a room with a sense of home. In
fact, that may be the key factor in their renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Says Tracht, "The biggest comment we get from people is, 'That's
even better than my mom's.'"</TE>

<TE>   SHORT RIBS</TE>
<TE>   8 meaty short ribs, about 2 1/2 pounds</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Fresh thyme sprigs, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 cup diced onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced celery</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced carrot</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   3 sprigs Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups red wine</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups Port</TE>
<TE>   3 cups veal or beef stock</TE>
<TE>   Place the ribs in a glass baking dish. Season with pepper and add
about 8 sprigs of thyme. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, season the ribs on all sides with salt and bring to
room temperature. Brown the ribs in the oil in a Dutch oven or
roasting pan over high heat until well browned on all sides, about 4
minutes a side.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the ribs to a platter. Cook the onion, celery and carrot in
the same pan you've browned the meat in over medium heat, stirring
constantly to pick up all the crusty bits left in the pan. Cook until
the vegetables are lightly browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the bay
leaf, about 6 sprigs of thyme and the parsley.</TE>
<TE>   Add the vinegar, red wine and Port and reduce by three-quarters;
this will take about 15 minutes. Add the veal stock and bring to a
boil.</TE>
<TE>   Place the ribs meat-side down in the pan. The liquid should come
3/4 of the way up the side of the meat. Cover the pan with oven-proof
plastic wrap and then foil. Place the ribs in the oven and braise for
approximately 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   After 2 hours 45 minutes, check the meat for doneness. It should
be tender and falling off the bone. Insert a paring knife into a rib;
the meat should fall off the knife easily. When the meat is done,
uncover the pan and let the ribs brown in the oven, 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Let the ribs rest for 1/2 hour in their juices, then remove them
to a baking sheet and strain the pan juices into a bowl. When the
juices cool you will be able to skim off most of the fat.</TE>
<TE>   When ready to serve, place the ribs in their juices in a
400-degree oven to reheat, about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   POTATO PUREE</TE>
<TE>   At the restaurant they pass the mixture through a fine mesh tamis
with a rubber spatula two times. This makes an extremely smooth
puree. You can skip this step if you want a more rustic-style potato
puree.</TE>
<TE>   2 large baking potatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 large Yukon Gold potatoes</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into chunks</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Boil the baking and Yukon Gold potatoes (skin on) in water to
cover with 1 tablespoon of the salt until tender, about 20 minutes.
Strain them and set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel the
potatoes and put them through a food mill or potato ricer, then place
them in a heavy-bottomed pan. Stir the potatoes with a wooden spoon
over medium heat to dry them out, then slowly add in the chunks of
butter, stirring constantly. Season with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon
of salt.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the milk and cream together in a separate pot.</TE>
<TE>   When the potatoes have absorbed all the butter, slowly add in the
milk mixture until you achieve the consistency of a puree. Taste for
seasoning and remove from the stove.</TE>
<TE>   If you are going to serve the puree soon, you can hold the
potatoes in a metal bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap. Otherwise
you can make them ahead of time, let them cool, keep them
refrigerated and later heat the puree in the oven with a little more
cream.</TE>
<TE>   HORSERADISH CREAM</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup creme fraiche</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons prepared horseradish, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Mix together the creme fraiche and horseradish. Season with salt
and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   4 shallots, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 cups young spinach, cleaned</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Potato Puree</TE>
<TE>   Short Ribs</TE>
<TE>   Horseradish Cream</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the shallots,
stirring until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Rinse the spinach but do not
dry, then add it to the pan. Cook the spinach until just barely
wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of each of 8 large bowls, place a spoonful of the
hot potato puree. Divide the spinach among the 8 bowls. Place a short
rib in the center of each bowl and spoon over some of the braising
liquid. Top with a generous spoonful of horseradish cream and serve
immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Jar Pot Roast</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 4  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   This recipe from Mark Peel and Suzanne Tracht of Jar can easily be
doubled to serve a crowd. The amount of Sherry called for may seem
like a lot, but in the final dish you don't really taste it. It just
contributes another level of flavor. Tracht says at the restaurant
this roast is served only with "one great big honkin' roasted
carrot."</TE>
<TE>   1 (4-pound) boneless chuck roast</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   3 cups dry Sherry</TE>
<TE>   2 carrots, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   4 stalks celery, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 leek, white and pale green parts only, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 head garlic, cut in half, unpeeled</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   6 cups low-sodium chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Season the roast liberally with salt and pepper. Brown the meat in
the oil in a large roasting pan over medium-high heat, about 4
minutes a side.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the pan from the heat and place the roast on a platter. Add
the Sherry to the pan. Return the pan to medium-high heat and reduce
the Sherry to 11/2 cups, about 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the carrots, onion, celery and leeks with the garlic and
lay them in the bottom of the roasting pan. Set the roast on top. Add
the bay leaf and the chicken stock; the liquid should cover 3/4 of
the meat.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the roast with foil, sealing it around the pan, and cook in
the oven until the meat is very tender, 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   When the meat is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in
the braising liquid 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the meat to a warm platter, strain the cooking liquid and
discard the vegetables. Skim the fat from the liquid. Reduce the
liquid in a large skillet over medium heat to about 31/2 cups, 30 to
40 minutes. Reheat the roast and the liquid before serving.</TE>

<HD>Pretzel's Twisted Tale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Foods with distinctive shapes just seem to cry out for myth-making.
Take the pretzel.</LD>
<LD>   Many people like to say a monk invented it (usually "around 610")
as a reward for children who learned their prayers, the word
"pretzel" coming from the Latin pretiola, which means "a little
reward." Others claim that monks designed it after the hands of a
person in prayer, with the name coming from preces, prayers.</LD>
<LD>   Both stories ignore the fact that in German the word is bretzel,
not pretzel. In medieval Old High German, it was even less like
pretiola--it was brezitella. Linguists think brezitella probably came
from the medieval Latin brachiatellum, meaning a little brachiatum,
which would be a bread baked in the form of crossed arms. Not that
anybody has found the word brachiatellum in any manuscript; the
linguists only claim their explanation is less unlikely than the
others.</LD>
<TE>   In any case, the pretzel belongs to a German family of breads that
are moistened before baking to give them a chewier texture. In a
bakery, pretzels are sprayed with a solution of lye, and the
resulting alkalinity encourages their familiar dark brown color
(fortunately, the caustic lye combines with carbon dioxide during
baking and becomes harmless). Bakery pretzels are then baked for
about half an hour--pretty long for something not much thicker than a
cracker--to make them absolutely dry and hard.</TE>
<TE>   Homemade pretzels and soft pretzels are often made much the same
way as bagels, by poaching them in boiling water before baking, the
difference being that bagels are usually poached in salt water rather
than water and baking soda. And, of course, that bagels aren't
pretzel-shaped.</TE>

<LD>You usually think of cottage cheese in a salad--not a sandwich. But
mixed with a few fresh herbs and seasonings, low-fat cottage cheese
makes a great high-protein topping for rye toast. I like the distinct
caraway flavor of the bread with the mild cottage cheese, and there's
something soothing about the warm toast and cool topping. Serve
shredded carrots and alfalfa sprouts alongside.</LD>
<LD>   For a quick snack, keep a batch of the cheese mixture in the
fridge. Instead of toast, try it with celery or carrot sticks.</LD>

<LD>I sometimes wonder why soup is such a comforting food. Maybe it's
because after you combine a few ingredients and put the soup on the
stove to simmer, it softly bubbles along, taking responsibility for
creating a pleasing meal for you.</LD>
<LD>   This cream of celery soup recipe is very simple and calls for
ingredients that are generally on hand if you cook at all. Don't use
the dark green outer stalks of the celery; the pale green and inner
white tender parts have much more flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Serve this with cornmeal muffins and poached or baked pears with a
brown sugar topping.</LD>
<TE>   Cream of Celery Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   10 to 12 stalks celery (inner light-colored or white center
stalks)</TE>
<TE>   1 onion</TE>
<TE>   6 cups chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Trim the leaves from the celery stalks and trim away the rough
bottom edges. Rinse the celery of any dirt. Chop the celery into
small pieces and place in a pot.</TE>
<TE>   Trim the root and top of the onion. Cut the onion in half from the
stem end to the root bottom. Turn each half flat-side down. Slice
from the root end to the top in 1/4-inch slices. Cut each half in
1/4-inch slices crosswise. Place in the pot.</TE>
<TE>   Add the broth and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
simmer, partially cover the soup and simmer until the celery is
tender, 30 minutes. Strain the vegetables from the liquid, keeping
the liquid in the pot. Puree the vegetables in a food processor or
blender. Return the puree to the pot and add the half-and-half and
milk. Stir to mix well, then add salt to taste. Reheat over low and
serve hot. Do not let the soup come to a boil.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's always a near mini-riot when Jerry Dimitman and his sons,
Robert and Steven, show up at the Alhambra farmers market with
Fallbrook-grown exotic citrus.</LD>
<LD>   Last Sunday, customers pushed and clawed for three varieties of
pummelo, the giant parent of the grapefruit: white-fleshed, pyramidal
Sutters, mild, sweet and very slightly bitter; spectacular Big Wongs,
colossal pear-shaped fruits especially sought by the Chinese for
their New Year celebration (Feb. 12 this year); and juicy,
green-fleshed Sarawaks, which have an intense sweet-tart, lemon-lime
flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Raul and Nora Rios, also from Fallbrook, had superb Booth and
White cherimoyas, Nagami kumquats, ripe yellow Bearss limes,
white-fleshed guavas (including one three-lobed specimen that
resembled Mickey Mouse) and the world's best dried Fuyu persimmons,
deep orange, leathery and very sweet, with an irresistible
caramel-pumpkin flavor. Jose Avitura of Walker Farms, from Exeter,
had pink-fleshed Cara Cara navels, berry-flavored Moro blood oranges,
smooth-skinned Meyer lemons and Dancy mandarins with classic "wild"
tangerine taste.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Adair brought excellent Medjool, Halawy and dry Deglet Noor
dates from Thermal. Billy Mua of Fresno displayed bok choy, rapini
and winter melon, and long stalks of sugar cane, which he peeled and
sectioned for purchasers. Vilma Causey of Kingsburg sold Asian pears,
kabocha squash and crunchy, pink-fleshed, slightly pungent watermelon
radishes.</TE>
<TE>   From Ontario, Maria Cabral brought good broccoli, cabbage and
slender carrots. Li-Wen Liao sold Chinese broccoli, green beans,
garlic, bags of dried, salted daikon and containers of chopped
mustard greens. Paul and May Hong sold exceptionally fresh and tasty
eggs and chickens, from Silkie (black-skinned and black-boned) and La
Belle Rouge breeds, raised in Newberry Springs.</TE>

<LD>Creamed spinach is one of those old-fashioned, homey dishes, perfect
with roast beef. But here it becomes the base for a simple Eggs
Florentine. Serve this for brunch or an easy Sunday supper and forget
the beef.</LD>
<LD>   And don't fret about poaching eggs. The secret to a perfectly
poached egg is to have the water at a happy simmer. That means more
than just barely simmering but definitely not close to a boil. You
want pea-sized bubbles bursting through at a steady pace.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Eggs Florentine</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 (6-ounce) bags baby spinach</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, minced</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chicken or vegetable broth</TE>
<TE>   1 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Dash ground nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 cup fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon white vinegar</TE>
<TE>   6 eggs</TE>
<TE>   6 thick slices French bread, toasted</TE>
<TE>   Place the spinach in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic
wrap and cook until just wilted, about 4 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer. Meanwhile, melt 3
tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onion and cook, stirring until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Sprinkle the flour over the onion and cook another 2 minutes, until
the flour has lost its raw taste. Add the broth, milk, salt and
pepper to taste and the nutmeg. Cook, stirring, about 3 minutes. Stir
in the spinach and cook just to heat through, about 2 minutes. Keep
warm.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a small skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, until
golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Set aside while you poach the
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Add the vinegar to the simmering water, then break 1 egg into a
small bowl and slide it into the water. Repeat with another egg. Cook
the eggs, 2 at a time, until the whites are set and the yolks look
slightly pink, 3 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon.</TE>
<TE>   To assemble, place 1 piece of toast on each of 4 plates. Divide
the spinach on top of each slice, then top with a poached egg.
Sprinkle with the bread crumbs.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: In the 1970s one of President Nixon's daughters had a
recipe for a chicken dish that was delicious. I don't remember which
daughter, but I think it was Tricia. Somewhere along the line I lost
the recipe. Do you think you might be able to obtain it?</LD>
<LD>   SUSIE ELDRIDGE</LD>
<LD>   San Marino</LD>
<TE>   DEAR SUSIE: Let's leave Tricia out of this. I found this recipe on
four different Web sites. One source credits Julie and three sources
credit Pat Nixon, their mother.</TE>

<LD>If you're really hungry, get one of the Marukai market bento boxes.
The makunouchi bento saba box contains a little more than a pound of
food, divided into an astonishing variety of tastes. Saba is
mackerel. In addition to that, you get shrimp tempura, sweet-flavored
fried chicken, a hot dog cut to resemble a flower, a potato
croquette, assorted vegetables, a slice of the sweet omelet called
tamago, sliced fish cake, shredded seaweed, candied green peas and
rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. A mug of green tea would be
the perfect accompaniment.</LD>

<DH>Don't throw away those roots, stems and leaves-- they could
be dinner.</DH>

<AU>CLIFFORD A. WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sputnik came to mind the first time I bought kohlrabi, that
odd-looking member of the cabbage family, with its enlarged corm and
stems shooting upward all in the same direction. Buy a kohlrabi, cut
off the leaves and you will see what I mean.</LD>
<LD>   Although the famous Russian satellite eventually came crashing to
Earth, my kohlrabi did not--it was very well received by my gaggle of
then-young children. Kohlrabi has turned into one of my favorite
vegetables because it's so easy to prepare, it's mild tasting and I
like the idea that it is uncommon.</LD>
<LD>   But, as with some other vegetables, after preparing it I had a few
spare parts left over. In the case of kohlrabi, it was the leaves,
and I couldn't bring myself to throw them out, because a little taste
had convinced me that they had the potential to be pretty good
eating. But what to do with them?</LD>
<TE>   I searched my library for kohlrabi leaf recipes and ... nothing.
Well, for years I have been traveling in and writing about the
Mediterranean. And if there is one thing that is true about
Mediterranean food, it's that nothing, and I mean nothing, gets
thrown away.</TE>
<TE>   I first tried kohlrabi leaves in a spaghetti alla carbonara my
kids had been asking me to fix. I decided to toss them in too, really
just to get rid of them. But the resulting dish was so good it became
part of my repertoire. The mild, vaguely cabbagey tasting leaves
added a delicate flavor to the creamy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   And that got me to thinking about all the other vegetable parts I
throw away that must be useful for something other than the compost
heap.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, those thick white or red stems of the Swiss
chard that cookbooks always tell us to strip the leaves from. Or the
equally thick stems of broccoli, the roots of spinach or the leaves
from beets, turnips and radishes.</TE>
<TE>   They're all edible--and not just edible but delicious, with a
texture and flavor that is different enough from the familiar that
you almost get the feeling you're eating an entirely new vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the parts are as unusual as kohlrabi leaves. Because
Swiss chard regenerates its leaves so copiously, even with heavy
harvesting, it's the leaves most cooks concentrate on (plus, because
the leaves are so hardy, they can stand up to all manner of soups and
stews). But Middle Easterners have come up with ingenious ways of
using the stalks as well.</TE>
<TE>   Some cooks use them to make soups and stocks, but they also can be
pureed and mixed with tahineh for a hummus-like dip called silq
bil-tahina. It's usually served as part of a Lebanese-style mezze
table, where a variety of small plates filled with appetizing foods
are served, usually as the entirety of the meal. The spread tastes
like a lighter version of hummus. If you use red chard stems, it will
be a beautiful pinkish crimson color.</TE>
<TE>   I also like to use Swiss chard stems in gratins and in my twist on
French onion soup, where I use them instead of onions (keeping the
baked layer of cheese on top).</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum are beet greens. They are
socommon, yet many people do not cook them, put off by their bitter
taste.</TE>
<TE>   But beet greens can be made less bitter by cooking them the way
they're done in southern Italy. In Apulia, the beet greens are stewed
with golden raisins and pine nuts and then served at room temperature
in a dish that is popular during the hot summer months. I usually
serve it with an assortment of other room-temperature vegetable
preparations or with a piece of grilled lamb. This dish can also be
made with turnip or radish tops.</TE>
<TE>   Because the tops of beets, turnips and radishes are so bitter,
cooks have come up with a number of ways to make them more palatable.
Bitter greens can be cooked in vinegar and sugar to create a
sweet-sour effect, or their bitterness can be balanced by cooking
them with lots of strong-flavored aromatics, such as garlic, herbs or
spices.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the best way to use tough, hardy leaves like this is in
stews. The long simmering will make them more tender, and combining
them with other ingredients makes them seem milder.</TE>
<TE>   One vegetable part that had always been thrown away even by a cook
as thrifty as me is spinach roots and stems. Who would want to eat
them? Well, for one, the Turks. Ispanak koku salatasi is a salad made
from the roots and stems of young spinach plants. They are first
cleaned and then steamed to soften them.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I had it was at a roadside eatery in Seljuk, a town
near Izmir. I thought it odd then and I think it odd now, but darned
if it isn't good, especially when you make it with honey and poppy
seeds. Another way to use the spinach roots and stems is chopped up
in a rice pilaf.</TE>
<TE>   Probably my favorite easy but uncommon hors d'oeuvre is cookbook
author Martha Rose Shulman's marinated broccoli stems. She always
serves them at parties as an accompaniment to drinks, and I'm usually
the culprit who eats them all.</TE>
<TE>   I use broccoli stems in other ways as well. One fairly elaborate
pasta is made by peeling the stems, cutting them into small sticks,
boiling them, rolling them in grated cheese and inserting them in
cooked macaroni. Then you layer the stuffed macaroni in a baking
dish, cover it with ricotta or tomato sauce and bake it. You will not
be unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   So many recipes call for broccoli florets that you might begin to
feel guilty about throwing away those great meaty stems. Well, this
is the solution. The results are so delicious you'll begin to think
that all this really isn't too uncommon after all.</TE>

<HD>Clonal Variations: Taking Chardonnay to the Next Level</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wine lovers have long been fascinated by the role clonal variations
play in wine character. It's not enough just to know the grape
variety, the vintage, vineyard and winemaker; the specific genetic
strain counts too. Recent vintages have yielded an increasing number
of clone-designated Cabernet Sauvignon bottlings. Now, it's
Chardonnay's turn.</LD>
<LD>   For the last five vintages, Chalk Hill Estate (in Sonoma County's
Chalk Hill area) has made wines from 17 Chardonnay clones. It
recently released six of the most consistently outstanding for
tasting.</LD>
<LD>   Chardonnays made from the same clones have been around for a
while, but it has been hard to get at their essential flavors and
compare them because they've been made by different producers. To my
knowledge, this is the first time a winery has presented a set of
polished, commercial-quality Chardonnays in which the only
significant variation is clonal.</LD>
<TE>   It is astonishing--the voices of the six wines are as distinct as
those of, say, six different piano virtuosos playing the same piece
on the same instrument. In theory, each clone has its own character,
which is asserted to some degree in the character of the wine made
from its fruit. Their delicate voices may not stand out in the final
blend--indeed, they shouldn't--yet each makes a decisive
contribution, as if each musician in an orchestra were a first-rate
virtuoso.</TE>
<TE>   Given that site remains the most important determinant of wine
character, regardless of clone, Chalk Hill Estate is a pretty good
testing ground. The estate has 13 soil types in a wide variety of
exposures, providing a wide range of vineyard situations.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just look at the data," winemaker Bill Knuttel says.
"You have to grow the vines, harvest the fruit, make the best wine
you can, and then taste the wine over time. And you have to repeat
that vintage after vintage. It's expensive and time-consuming, but
it's the only way to properly assess the clones."</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the winemaking for these clonal selections was
identical. Essentially, it followed the basic Chalk Hill Estate
regime: whole-cluster pressing, barrel fermentation, aging on the
lees with monthly stirring. All the wines were aged for the same
length of time, fined to the same degree and bottled with the same
level of sulfur. They were not filtered.</TE>
<TE>   The only significant departure from Knuttel's normal protocol was
that the primary and malolactic fermentations were standardized by
using commercial strains of yeast, rather than naturally occurring
ones that can vary. That eliminated the possibility of curveballs
that might blur the picture by affecting wine character.</TE>
<TE>   Like Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay has won wide popularity that
has taken it to every notable wine region in the world. Chalk Hill
Estate's plantings are a veritable United Nations of Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Chalk Hill wines, I particularly like the one made from the
venerable Martini Selection, a.k.a. Clone 4, which was selected in
Chardonnay's homeland, Burgundy, and propagated in Livermore Valley
by the Wente family in the 19th century. From there it went to Stony
Hill in Napa Valley, and therefore to the Louis Martini family
vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   Clone 4's ability to yield a large crop of reasonable-quality
fruit has earned it the nickname Super Clone. That might imply that
it yields mediocre wines, but the opposite is true: When grown on the
right soil and balanced for low yield, it gives concentrated, complex
wines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that nobody looks at the old clones," notes
Knuttel. "It's a mistake, because they have their places in the right
vineyards."</TE>
<TE>   Chalk Hill's 1999 Clone 4 bottling is a good example. It combines
power and finesse, luxuriant fruit and crisp definition, with
tropical fruit and peach inflections--classic California Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Clone 16 was selected in Rutherglen, a warm area in the state of
South Australia, and subsequently certified by UC Davis. The key to
its distinctive personality is the acid balance of its fruit:
relatively high in malic acid and low in tartaric. Malic acid is less
stable than tartaric acid. It decreases during ripening, and the loss
accelerates as the mercury rises. So, especially in a warm climate,
the finished wine is already low in acidity, even before being
further reduced by malolactic fermentation.</TE>
<TE>   But Chalk Hill's bottling is a lovely wine, rich and balanced with
a creamy texture and bright citrus notes. It definitely has its place
in a blend, contributing a rich perfume and luscious fruit to without
throwing the total acidity out of balance.</TE>
<TE>   Clone 17 was originally selected from the famed Robert Young
Vineyard in Alexander Valley, just a few miles from Chalk Hill
Estate. It is more subdued and less perfumed than either Clone 4 or
Clone 16, yet it has a higher-toned nose and brighter palate, with a
mineral undertone that tends to focus and define the lusher tropical
fruit elements around it.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the previous four, Clone 22 was selected from a
cool climate. It comes from Conegliano in the Friuli region of
northern Italy. Not surprisingly, its wine is on the lean, herbaceous
end of the Chardonnay spectrum. Clone 22's virtues in a blend are
brightness and a firm, even weight on the palate. It draws a defining
line through all of the complexity.</TE>
<TE>   I thought Clone 76 was the outstanding wine of the set. I wasn't
alone, Knuttel tells me. It's consistently the most preferred wine in
blind tastings. That's not surprising--it comes from Dijon and shows
the classic Burgundian Chardonnay values. The heady Chardonnay
perfume has tropical notes and an underlying stoniness that expands
through the palate as the lush first impression tapers into firm,
tight-grained minerality and a long, radiant finish.</TE>
<TE>   Clone 352, also from France, shows a fine, high-toned creaminess
with a delicate white-blossom perfume that evokes the still
wines--fully ripe and oak-aged--from vineyards in Champagne's Cote
des Blancs. At the same time, it has what Knuttel calls "a woody
apple character" that's very Russian River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Chalk Hill Estate's Chardonnay clone trials are the most
comprehensive ever undertaken in California. Still, they're just a
beginning. There is so much more to be learned about how to produce
the clearest possible expression of a varietal wine from a unique
planting. Luckily, the finest Chardonnays from this or any other wine
estate still shine in the future.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High on the Tibetan plateau, nomadic yak-herders have been grazing
their semi-wild herds for 10,000 years, making theirs the world's
oldest existing agricultural enterprise. During the brief summer,
these shaggy-haired ruminants, grazing above 13,000 feet on 60-odd
species of grass and wildflowers, make a milk that is rich, pure and
sweet, full of the flavors of mountain flowers and grass.</LD>
<LD>   In summer, the milk is plentiful to the point of surplus, but the
rest of the year is hard, cold and lean in this remotest of human
civilizations. While the "wish-granting yak" gives the nomads milk,
butter and meat for the table, hair for the tents and fleece and
skins for their clothing, one bad winter is all it takes to deplete a
family's perilously thin safety margin.</LD>
<LD>   This past summer, I spent a few weeks with the nomads. I was sent
by Trace Foundation, a New York-based organization engaged in
economic development projects in Tibetan communities on the plateau.
My job was to develop an export-quality cheese, to give the nomads an
opportunity to earn hard currency to supplement their subsistence
economy by turning their surplus milk into a cash crop.</LD>
<TE>   The nomads have always made butter and chura, which can be either
dried yogurt or dried buttermilk solids. But there is no tradition of
cheese-making, other than a monastic blue cheese that I had read
about (I could not find any firsthand reports of its existence).</TE>
<TE>   There is no tradition of cheese-eating on the Tibetan Plateau, nor
any taste for it. I had brought some of my well-aged cow's-milk
cheeses from home, and the Tibetans were politely circumspect in
their comments about the flavor. This was not going to be easy to
sell in the local market. But even if the Tibetans didn't appreciate
the taste of cheese, they certainly could appreciate the fact that
there was finally a possibility of a cash buyer for their milk--cash
that could buy luxuries such as shoes, roofing materials, stoves and
medicines.</TE>
<TE>   As a long-time cheese-maker, I am accustomed to working just a few
steps from the cows, using simple equipment, but I am also accustomed
to having electric motors, steam boilers and hot water flowing from a
tap. In Tibet, the boiler was fired by burning yak dung, the clean
and tidy factory was lighted only by daylight and the only motive
force came from the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   But the soul of a cheese is in the grass, by way of the milk--the
equipment can help or get in the way, but ultimately it is nature,
and not technology, that makes the cheese.</TE>
<TE>   I found myself living in a tent camp, with a rice sack full of yak
hair as a pillow. We were near a river whose only name, apparently,
is The River, with yaks, horses, long-horned sheep and marmots
grazing, and whole flocks of eagles soaring above. I had never seen
eagles in groups before, and was doubting that they were indeed
eagles, thinking them more likely to be vultures. Then I saw one of
them nose dive into a swale and come up with a marmot in its
talons--yep, those were eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being a couple of miles closer to the sun, the midsummer
weather was crisp: the brightest blue sky I've ever seen. Perhaps it
was illuminated by hypoxia? Ice on the tent in the morning, warming
up to about 75 degrees at noon, then dropping off toward the 40s when
the sun sets over the ridge at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The nomads, who were as curious about me as I was about them,
treated me like family. The children, being even more curious and
less shy that the parents, engaged me in games of soccer and, more my
style, cat's cradle. When my interpreter was not available, I would
pull out photos of my family and the farm--my wife's curly red hair
drew a lot of notice, as did the Guernsey and Jersey cows.</TE>
<TE>   Since winter is so long, there is a festival every few days during
midsummer: weddings, religious festivals, horse races. Every time a
group gathers, there is singing, dancing and eating. Yak meat is
served in a variety of ways and eaten with breads fried in yak
butter.</TE>
<TE>   During the festivals, I had a chance to engage in other nonverbal
communications by joining in some of the communal cooking projects. I
failed dumpling making, but I was able to show off some new pastry
shapes for yak-butter-fried breads: the palmier, croissant and snail
have now entered into the Tibetan pastry repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast was always tsampa: roasted barley porridge served with
tea, yak butter and dried yogurt. Lunch and dinner were always yak
and noodle du jour--nothing fancy, but solid, satisfying and tasty.
Yak is a bit stronger than venison, and it was often prepared with
oilseed greens (a cousin of broccoli), onions and some chiles. The
vegetables were, incidentally, an accommodation to the visiting
lowlander. Self-respecting nomads don't eat plants; it's just not
their place on the food chain.</TE>
<TE>   While the daily menu and recipe didn't change, the "dry-aged" yak
did get progressively stronger each day, so there was some variety
after all. By the 10th day, it was quite a relief when a fresh yak
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Yaks are mostly black, with a bit of white here and there, and
quite shaggy, sort of like aged buffalo with dreadlocks and huge
Wagnerian horns. These are semi-feral animals, not at all like the
friendly, kissy, golden retriever-like Jerseys and Guernseys I'm used
to.</TE>
<TE>   When Jersey cows see people coming into the pasture, they trot
over to sniff, lick and wipe their noses on the visitors. If a group
of yaks starts to move toward you, you look for a hole to jump into.
I admire the courage of the nomad milk wives, who are the only ones
who ever get close to the yaks--the men herd them with big snarling
mastiffs and handfuls of stones.</TE>
<TE>   On her wedding day, the bride's mother gives her a milk pail and a
brass pail hook, and the father gives the groom a yak dowry. If the
new couple prosper, after a few years the husband will buy his wife a
decorative, oversized pail hook, made of silver filigree and studded
with coral and turquoise. The pail-hook, functional or decorative, is
the symbol of the wife's betrothal. From what I saw, the nomad men
are kind, attentive husbands and fathers.</TE>
<TE>   A yak is as big as a Jersey cow but only gives as much milk as a
goat, a few liters per day. But the milk--oh, that milk! Rich, sweet
and fragrant from the wildflowers that made it. Milk from animals
that breathe clean air and drink pure water. When I tasted my first
sip of yak milk, out of a can in a saddle-bag, with bits of butter
created by the horse's canter, I knew that the lack of equipment
wouldn't hurt us a bit. This milk had the soul of a fine cheese in
it, and all we had to do was help it find its way out.</TE>
<TE>   What emerged from the refractory of the cheese vat we named Flower
of Rajya, after the nearest village (it's a hair-raising three-hour
jeep ride from the factory, but it is, after all, the nearest place
with a name). Rajya is also the location of a famous monastery and
school.</TE>
<TE>   Flower of Rajya is a firm cheese, made by simple methods, from
milk that arrives each morning by horse, motorbike and yak.
(Horse-carried milk has the most butter churned out of it; the yak,
it seems, offers a gentler ride.) The milk is heated and ripened in
big copper vats, curdled, drained and molded into 15-pound wheels.</TE>
<TE>   It is dry-cured in Tibetan red salt, sea salt from an ocean dry
for 15 million years. This crude salt, called Tears of Drolma, is dug
from the earth, tinged pink by the presence of iron. Its flavor is as
complex as Brittany's fleur du sel, but sweeter, if you can use that
word to describe salt. The cheeses are aged in the mountain air, then
wrapped in ceremonial scarves (khata) and packed in bamboo
dumpling-steamer baskets for the trip down to the lowlands.</TE>
<TE>   The flavor of Rajya is delicate, complex and slow on the
palate--it takes a full minute or two for it to unfold. It is
wonderful with wines and ciders. It tastes first of milk, with a
delicate, not-goat, not-sheep, some-other-animal flavor. Then you
taste the wildflowers in the crisp, dry, thin air, with hints of
leather and even wood. It is a clean, subtle flavor that builds up to
a gentle rise and then fades out into a long, slow, earthy, and, yes,
funky yak-like note. But it is not the infamous rancid-yak-butter
flavor that we hear about from trekkers--no, this is a clean but very
distinctive flavor.</TE>
<TE>   My Tibetan friends developed more of a tolerance than a taste for
cheese, with one exception: When I made a pot of yak mozzarella, just
for kicks, it was a huge hit. The sweet, creamy cheese was
appreciated by everyone. At one of the festivals, I spent a few hours
making little braids of fresh "yakkarella" for the hundred-odd
visitors, and every man, woman and child came by to taste.
Unfortunately, with no refrigeration or means of transport, yak
mozzarella will remain just a curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   White, formerly a well-known cheese-maker at New York's Egg Farm
Dairy, is founder of Grasslands Cheese Consortium, which helps
American grass-based dairy farmers become cheese-makers. He will be
presenting his yak cheese as part of the grilled cheese night
Thursday at Campanile restaurant, 624 S. La Brea Ave. For more

<HD>Flying in the Face of Countless Indignities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Balzar</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>I stood in line one day this week. Or the better part of one day. I
watched a woman collapse flat on her back across from me after
standing in line. Then I watched as people took advantage of the
commotion to quickly step over her and gain advantage in the line.</LD>
<LD>   I was barked at, snarled at, frisked, shoved and gouged. I studied
the techniques of line breakers and marveled as fellow travelers were
too exhausted, too cowed or too patriotic to object. I watched VIPs
escorted to the front of lines in some new expression of class
warfare.</LD>
<LD>   I had wanted to see for myself how much indignity and discomfort
Americans would bear. I took a round trip on our air transport
system. I flew the one big airline that made money last year,
presumably the model of business efficiency.</LD>
<TE>   Friends, the future is bleak.</TE>
<TE>   Just guessing, but I don't think what we're enduring now is a
temporary blowback from Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I suspect the opposite. Airlines, airports and all the
ancillary industries of our air transportation system have learned a
lesson: Travelers will keep taking it, no matter how bad things get.
And they'll be quiet about it too now.</TE>
<TE>   So what if the stale bag of $2.50 licorice is now $3.95? So what
if airport parking at home costs almost the same as a bargain hotel
room? So what if people are collapsing?</TE>
<TE>   I chose Las Vegas because hardly anyone must travel here. More
than any place I know, this single-minded desert outpost is a
destination of choice. Few, if any, of the 800 people inching forward
for 53 minutes to check bags are here for any purpose other than the
"pleasure" of getting away. Ditto the 2,000 of us who wait another 64
minutes in line to pass the security checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   If you arrived the recommended two hours in advance of your
flight, you already missed it. And there were still two lines to
go--the counter check-in and the boarding scrum.</TE>
<TE>   The one passenger who dared plead quietly for consideration in
making his flight received a stony stare. What are you, a terrorist?!</TE>
<TE>   Those National Guardsmen with their assault rifles are here for
our safety. They also serve the perverse function of wardens, grimly
enforcing docility in the ranks of the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to get passengers to talk. Few would, and then only in
furtive, hushed tones. The righteous grumbling that used to echo down
the terminal hallways has all but disappeared. It would be unseemly
in these patriotic times to complain.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I replied, but do we really have to be treated so badly?
Shhhsh, or someone will see us talking and we'll be fingered as
troublemakers and detained or strip-searched or heaven knows what.</TE>
<TE>   At the security gate, a screener growls at my wife: "You've got
too many bags."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't," she replies, holding out a purse and a small
shopping bag. But wait, was that a growl in her voice too? The
screener pauses. She seems to be weighing whether she's been
"disrespected." The line halts. Everybody at the airport has been
deputized and is brimming with authority. Finally we are allowed to
pass but not without a warning sneer.</TE>
<TE>   Because I am conservative by heart, I allotted four hours to get
through the airport. It has taken 3 1/2 to get to the gate.</TE>
<TE>   My flight is an hour late. I ask the airline gate agent, why? I
get no answer. I get instead a fascist once-over. This flight is
overbooked, is the message. Maybe a smart-aleck like me ought to take
the hint. There are plenty of good Americans willing to fly and keep
their mouths shut. Just look behind me; they're lined up by the
thousands for the chance.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months ago, I suggested that air travelers did not
have to take this anymore. For my own part, I said I was going to
curb my flying--establish my own mileage plan and reward myself by
not taking trips. Curiosity got me this time. I learned that I'd been
wrong. Maybe we don't have to take this, but we're going to.</TE>
<TE>   After almost six hours, we're in the air for the one-hour flight
home. The pilot tells us to look down at the traffic on the I-15
Freeway, as if we should be consoled.</TE>
<TE>   I'm imagining a billboard that reads, "If you were down here, you
would have been home an hour ago."</TE>

<HD>Independence Is Essential in Enron Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky is a constitutional law professor at
USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An independent special prosecutor is imperative to investigate
possible criminal violations by Enron Corp., its officers and its
auditor, Andersen Co. Almost every day reveals new ties between the
Bush administration and the failed energy company.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend, for example, it was learned that President
Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, previously a paid
consultant to Enron, told the president that Enron's failure would
not have significant economic repercussions. At the end of last week,
it was revealed that Vice President Dick Cheney attempted to assist
Enron in obtaining a contract to construct a power plant in India.
Cheney, who worked in the energy industry before his election, has
refused to answer questions about his meetings with Enron officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has strong ties to Enron. Bush's
presidential election bid received $113,800 from Enron and its
chairman, Kenneth Lay. Bush received another $300,000 for his
inaugural committee. In comparison, Enron contributed only $13,750 to
Al Gore's campaign. In fact, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft recused himself
from the Enron investigation because of the campaign contributions he
received from the company.</LD>
<TE>   It appears that Enron tried to exploit its connections to the
administration. Lay made repeated calls to Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham. Enron's president, Lawrence Whalley, made between six and
eight calls to Peter Fisher, the undersecretary of Treasury. The
content of these calls is not known, including whether Bush officials
said or did anything improper, such as not turning the matter over to
federal regulators in a manner that might have prevented some of the
fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   The close ties between Enron and the Bush administration demand
that the investigation be handled outside the Bush Justice
Department. A special prosecutor independent of the Bush
administration is the only way that the public can be confident that
the investigation is conducted properly and not influenced by
cronyism and partisan politics.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the law that provided for an independent counsel in
such situations expired and was not renewed after the excesses of
Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. The law was a victim of
politics, not principles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the
statute, the Ethics in Government Act, which provided the authority
for a panel of federal judges to appoint an independent counsel. The
law created an essential mechanism for taking investigations out of
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans always had opposed the law because of its origins
as a response to the Nixon Justice Department's participation in the
Watergate cover-up. Democrats, who succeeded in passing and renewing
the law, turned against it after it was used to investigate Bill
Clinton--especially whether he lied about having a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of Enron and Andersen is precisely the situation
in which it is crucial that there be an independent special
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   There are serious allegations that Enron violated criminal
laws--including federal security statutes--by concealing its
financial problems from investors and auditors. Andersen admitted
that it destroyed thousands of documents in October, November and
December as Enron was failing and declared bankruptcy. This certainly
raises serious concerns about whether there was obstruction of
justice. Enron's failure wiped out the savings and pensions of
thousands of people and cost investors billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Although the statute that created the mechanism for an independent
counsel selected by federal judges has expired, the attorney general
still has the authority to appoint one.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, before the Ethics in Government Act was enacted in 1976,
attorney generals appointed special prosecutors when necessary. For
example, Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon
Jaworski both were appointed by the attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Congress will reconsider its decision to let the Ethics
in Government Act expire. While there certainly were problems with
the independent counsel, the better approach would have been to fix
those problems--perhaps by limiting the scope and duration of
investigations--rather than allowing the statute to end. Scandals
will occur in the future, and an independent counsel is the only way
of providing assurance of a thorough and nonpolitical investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the president should use his authority to order
the appointment of a special prosecutor. If he refuses, Congress
should demand one.</TE>
<TE>   There is no other way to ensure the essential full and fair
investigation.</TE>

<LD>JERUSALEM--There is no cycle of violence.</LD>
<LD>   One side has religious fanatics who are violent and hateful but
discredited by the mainstream public and repudiated by most of its
religious leaders. The other side has religious fanatics who are
violent and hateful and celebrated by the mainstream as holy men.</LD>
<LD>   One side is ready to compromise for peace and has abandoned its
dream of complete possession of the contested land. The other side
insists on absolute ownership of the land.</LD>
<TE>   One side is prepared to stop arguing about history and give
precedence to the future. The other side is still fighting medieval
wars against infidels.</TE>
<TE>   One side has painfully concluded that both sides in this
decades-long conflict have inflicted and suffered injustices. The
other side believes that only it has suffered injustice and
attributes all wrongs to its enemy.</TE>
<TE>   One side believes that this is a tragic conflict between two
legitimate national movements. The other side believes this is a
conflict between native sons and foreign interlopers.</TE>
<TE>   One side was so sickened of being occupiers that it empowered its
archenemy and armed his terrorist forces and offered him shared
sovereignty over its capital city. The other side rails against the
injustice of an occupation that the occupier offered to end.</TE>
<TE>   One side has accepted international compromises for a peaceful
solution to the Middle East conflict, beginning with the Peel
Commission of 1937, through the U.N. partition plan of 1947, through
Camp David 2000 and Taba 2001. The other side has responded to each
of those compromises with terrorism and war, and then complains to
the world about the injustice of its defeats.</TE>
<TE>   One side turned to its current hard-line leader only after its
peacemaking leader returned from negotiations with war as the
counteroffer. The other side never produced a leadership committed to
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   One side teaches its children songs of peace. The other side
teaches its children songs of blood and fire.</TE>
<TE>   One side maintains free media that criticize their own government
and army and report on the other side's suffering. The other side
maintains controlled media that tell its people the Holocaust never
happened and that Sept. 11 was a well-earned blow against the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   One side anguishes and debates when its army commits an immoral
act. The other side dances in the street when atrocities are
committed in its name.</TE>
<TE>   One side tries to prevent civilian deaths during battle. The other
side defines the battle as a war against civilians.</TE>
<TE>   One side produces mothers who protest against sending their sons
into war. The other side produces mothers who boast about the suicide
deaths of their terrorist sons and declare their willingness to
sacrifice even more sons for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   There is no cycle of violence.</TE>

<HD>Sever Lindh's Ties to His Homeland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a professor of law at George
Washington University.</BD>

<LD>This week will mark the return of America's most curious prodigal
son. The long-waited transfer of John Walker Lindh to federal custody
has focused the nation's attention on what to do with the 20-year-old
jihadi from Marin County. Regardless of Lindh's potential criminal
liability, there remains the question of his right to be called an
American citizen, a son of the nation that he abandoned.</LD>
<LD>   If there is one area where biblical and constitutional images seem
to converge, it is in the meaning and the loss of citizenship.
Citizenship was once described in quasi-religious terms as a type of
covenant with the state; a civic family union that could demand an
absolute sacrifice from its members in times of war. It is a sacred
bond between citizens; a trust that despite our divisions and our
differences we remain loyal to the maintenance of our unique
constitutional system.</LD>
<LD>   In Lindh, the constitutional and biblical images seem to merge
into a modern variation of Luke's New Testament parable of the
prodigal son.</LD>
<TE>   Like the younger son of the parable, Lindh was blessed with a
great wealth of freedom and resources. Yet he chose to go to "a
distant land where he squandered" his inheritance, only to find
himself in utter destitution. Like the older son, many Americans have
a particularly harsh view of Lindh's return and his embrace of the
constitutional protections that he so cavalierly discarded. Yet
rather than the perfunctory punishment of a military tribunal, Lindh
is given the legal equivalent of the fatted calf in the form of
well-paid defense counsel and a publicly subsidized trial.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even St. Luke would be hard pressed to biblically
"spin" the unrepentant young Lindh. Yet the constitutional and
biblical elements come together for Lindh in one interesting passage.
The prodigal son stands before his father and confesses, "Father, I
have sinned against God and against you; I no longer deserve to be
called your son." This may be the crux of the matter for millions of
Americans. Despite the considerable sympathy for his parents, there
is an almost personal feeling of betrayal of our common identity as
citizens; a type of constitutional mortal sin for which only
denationalization is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until 1986 that Congress codified the current standard
for the "loss of nationality." The United States code says that an
individual can sever his national identity through seven distinct
voluntary acts, including entering or serving in the armed forces of
a foreign state engaged in hostilities against the U.S., accepting
employment with a foreign state that requires an oath of allegiance,
committing any act of treason or bearing arms against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Lindh may be able to defend against some of these
claims because of the government's refusal to recognize the Taliban
as a "foreign state." While the government must prove each of the
four criminal counts against Lindh "beyond a reasonable doubt,"
however, the standard for expatriation is the lower civil standard of
"by preponderance of the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Justice Earl Warren once described proceedings for
denationalization as the destruction of an individual's political
identity; the loss of the "right to have rights." Denationalization
is a chilling act in which 250 million people would turn their backs
on a native son who has abused their trust and traditions. Of course,
even if stripped of his citizenship, Lindh would still have
constitutional rights if tried and convicted, as do foreign nationals
in our justice system, such as Zacarias Moussaoui. Moreover, if given
a life sentence, denationalization would be purely symbolic, but it
would be an important and necessary symbol. Lindh would be
disenfranchised, a man without a nation.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the greatest argument for denationalization can be
found not in Lindh's courtroom in Virginia but in other courtrooms
all across the nation. While Lindh will be standing before a judge to
face criminal charges, Lily Carrasco and thousands more like her will
be standing before judges to become citizens. Carrasco came from Peru
to the U.S. and ultimately became a nanny for my three boys. While
Lindh was assisting those who called for the killing of any and all
Americans, Carrasco was petitioning to join our ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh and Carrasco are the modern parable of faith lost and faith
found. Lindh did not simply lose the legal right to claim
citizenship. He lost the moral right to stand with our newest
citizens who struggled so hard and so long to enter into our unique
covenant of faith.</TE>

<LD>Community leaders last week called for a cease-fire, not in the Gaza
Strip but in Los Angeles. Pleading for a moratorium on violence over
the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, a coalition of South Los Angeles
nonprofit organizations and neighborhood activists launched a
campaign against gang terrorism that last year cost at least 50 lives
in the Police Department's 77th Street Division alone.</LD>
<LD>   After falling for seven years, homicides citywide rose in 2000 and
again last year, to 584, with most tied to drugs and gangs. The
increase has sparked fears of a return to 1992's record high of
1,096--about the number of Israelis and Palestinians  killed in
Middle East violence over the past 15 months.</LD>
<LD>   Why don't such numbers strike outrage here?</LD>
<TE>   Outrage struck South Los Angeles in November when 13-year-old
Marquese Rashad Prude, who was not involved with gangs, was killed by
suspected gang members in the lobby of the St. Andrews Park
Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   From the response to the tragedy--200 people attended a meeting on
the shooting--came the coalition. Its first goal after the weekend
moratorium is to create safety zones at parks, schools and community
functions.</TE>
<TE>   To get there, the coalition aims to improve historically testy
relations between the black community and the Police Department so
that police officers are seen as community partners, not an occupying
army. As coalition member Henry T. Stuckey put it, "It's impossible
for us to stop the violence without the LAPD. And it's impossible for
the LAPD to stop the violence without us."</TE>
<TE>   The group has also enlisted the participation of Los Angeles
school board member Genethia Hayes, who promised to work to expand
after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead are plans to hold town hall meetings in churches citywide to
develop neighborhood-based plans to counter gang violence. Because
South Los Angeles residents are shouldering their share of
responsibility doesn't absolve the rest of Los Angeles from doing its
part.</TE>
<TE>   Like many cease-fires, the King holiday moratorium was broken; the
three-day weekend did not pass without violence. But police reported
that violent crime, including aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual
assaults and homicides, was down 16% from last year's holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the decrease had anything to do with the moratorium is
impossible to measure. What is certain, however, is that nothing will
really change until all of Los Angeles decides that it won't tolerate
homicide numbers here that rival the number of murders in the Middle
East.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With customary immoderation, the headline in one British tabloid
screamed "Torture!" The front-page picture of kneeling detainees,
chained hand and foot, wearing blacked-out goggles and
earmuffs--tools of sensory deprivation?--was called confirmation of
ill treatment of the Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners being taken to
the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   But wait a minute. Another British report, this one signed by a
team of government investigators, found "no sign" of inhumane
treatment. "There were no gags, no goggles, no earmuffs and no
shackles while [the prisoners] are in their cells."</LD>
<LD>   The assessment of the International Red Cross, which had full
access to the Guantanamo detainees last week, apparently fell
between. The Red Cross said the prisoners were not shackled, but it
did make some recommendations to the U.S. military on their
treatment. Unfortunately the Red Cross' recommendations, as is
customary, were not made public. The field will be ripe for rumor and
speculation until the Pentagon opens up Guantanamo to observation.</LD>
<TE>   A number of prisoners seized in Afghanistan assuredly require
heavy security. That would apply to anyone suicidally bent on
destruction. But until the mysteries of their confinement are cleared
up, lurid accusations of ill treatment cannot be squelched.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has so far refused to designate the men at Guantanamo
prisoners of war, preferring instead the term "unlawful combatants."
That linguistic nicety could serve to remove the prisoners'
entitlement to treatment outlined in the Geneva Conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Fighters for the Taliban, the former government of Afghanistan,
probably have a good claim to the right to be treated as prisoners of
war. That may not be so for members of the Al Qaeda terrorist group,
who were not members of a nation's army or even a militia. The
Pentagon should determine who is in what category and release that
information.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has sharply criticized what
he calls "breathless reports" filed by "people who are uninformed,
misinformed or poorly informed" about the treatment of the detainees.
Yet by locking out impartial observers, including reporters, he bears
much of the blame for any shoddy information. Nor does his
intemperate remark that the prisoners "are being treated better than
they treated anybody else" help his cause. Surely he does not measure
U.S. moral values against the Taliban's. The Pentagon has allowed
reporters to view the detainees only from a great distance. It should
provide a closer look.</TE>
<TE>   The Geneva Conventions, intended to provide for humane treatment
of war prisoners, among other things, were adopted in 1864 and
updated four times since. True, the conventions have often been
sorely breached, and they may be tricky to apply in the
unconventional wars of the 21st century. But better to open the
Guantanamo prison, and the process, to full observation than to let
accusation and rumor grow in the dark.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The alleged misdeeds of Enron Corp. are so broad, so glaring, they
may paradoxically have a cleansing influence on politics. Their most
remarkable effect may be to push Congress the last inch toward real
campaign finance reform.</LD>
<LD>   Both major parties have become addicted to so-called soft money,
funds raised through a loophole that evades the $1,000 personal
contribution limit and $5,000 political action committee limit.
Although most politicians have called for reform over the years,
their words are a far cry from actually giving up a system that has
poured hundreds of millions of dollars into their treasuries. In the
1999-2000 election cycle, the Democratic Party spent $244 million in
soft money, while the Republican Party spent $252 million.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes Enron, whose torrent of donations to the Bush
presidential campaign and all over Capitol Hill has dirtied the very
people charged with investigating the energy trader's spectacular
downfall.</LD>
<TE>   The House Republican leadership has not yet ended its resistance
to bringing campaign finance reform to a vote, but the shame of Enron
may gain reformers the last few signatures needed to reach the magic
218, a bare House majority. That would force a vote. A twin of the
bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T.
Meehan (D-Mass.)  easily passed the Senate last year, but a
parliamentary rules blockade stopped it in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would make a number of beneficial changes to the way
campaigns are financed. It would outlaw soft money contributions,
which were originally intended to finance "party-building" activities
like getting out the vote but ended up going almost directly to
campaign coffers. There is still debate over raising the current
limits on individual contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the bill is not a certainty once it reaches the House
floor. Opponents may try to substitute weaker legislation or employ
"poison pill" amendments--additions so unpalatable that even
supporters might vote against the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism may have briefly refocused lawmakers'
efforts, but campaign finance has put the spotlight back on the
political process. The energy that Congress has devoted to evading
campaign finance reform suggests the degree to which lavish donations
have corrupted the lawmaking process. If Shays-Meehan passes in or
near its original form, something good will have come out of Enron.</TE>

<LD>Re ''Detention of Al Qaeda Suspects Challenged,'' Jan. 21: Ramsey
Clark, Stephen Yagman and Erwin Chemerinsky (a failed attorney
general, a publicity hound and a befuddled college professor), who
presumably weren't bothered by the slaughter of terrorists in Tora
Bora, are now worried because the Pentagon doesn't house the Al Qaeda
captives at the Hilton.</LD>
<LD>   Where does it say we have to provide deluxe accommodations to
people who are out to kill us? Ultimately, the military may have to

government as mercenaries? With the justice they hand out (cut off
the hand of a thief, stone some others to death), I can imagine what
the punishment for some mercenary who came from another country and
murdered, raped and looted Afghanistan would be. I don't think many
lawyers would be in any hurry to go there and defend them.</TE>

medical attention and daily exercise.</TE>

<LD>Hadassa Gilbert (letter, Jan. 20) defies anyone to explain how
society is safer if people like Sara Jane Olson are put in prison for
the rest of their lives.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1690s George Savile wrote, ''Men are not hanged for
stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen.'' We are not
worried about vengeance. We are making a statement that we will not
accept violent behavior as a way of expressing a viewpoint.</LD>

<HD>Memorial: Honor What the Firefighters Did</HD>

<LD>Re "Airbrushing History With Divisiveness," Commentary, Jan. 18:
Sept. 11 was an emotional, in-your-face event, so I understand why
lots of people have opinions about the statue to the firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   To Jonathan Turley I would say that a memorial's intent can
symbolize an event, people or an idea. In this case, it memorializes
all the firefighters who died and their courage and love of country
and countrymen. We miss the broader point when we just want a
memorial to three guys who raised a flag. They will always have that
moment in their lives captured in a photograph, but the sculpture was
created to represent all who gave their lives.</LD>

<TE>   I must say it pains me as an American citizen to be witness to the
mind-numbing effects political correctness has had on our society.
The three firemen who took it upon themselves to valiantly raise this
country's symbol of freedom were, I'm sure, not concerned that they
all happened to be white but rather that they were showing bravery
and competence in a time of confusion and anguish. To alter the race
of these men is to take away historical accuracy and prove, once
again, that in today's world, we are more concerned with who did what
and what color they were than why they did it.</TE>
<TE>   The men represented in the Iwo Jima memorial were not "racially
altered" and what they did means more than who they were. That does
not dismiss the fact that there were plenty of soldiers of different
races that served in the war. Just as there were firemen and
policemen of different races serving at the World Trade Center. Why
should it matter that the three firemen were white? I have that
picture in a window of my house and every time someone passes by I
truly hope they are not thinking, "I wish that scene was more
diverse," but remembering what happened that day, how it changed our
lives forever and why those men did what they did.</TE>

<TE>   Have we become so obsessively concerned with proving how inclusive
and tolerant we are that we are willing to forgo factual accuracy?
The decision to transform three white firefighters raising a flag at
the World Trade Center into a bronze expression of balanced diversity
is odd in the extreme. Why stop there? Are there no female
firefighters in New York City? Are there no Asian firefighters?</TE>
<TE>   The now-famous photo depicted an actual event. It tells one story
of real people. One of thousands of tragic, touching and moving
vignettes that we witnessed and vowed to never forget. They should be
allowed to stand as recorded. The grim reality of that photo needs no
touch-up.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The L.A. Police Protective League's power play should be seen for
what it is (''LAPD Union Says Poll Shows Vast Majority Oppose
Parks,'' Jan. 18). The peer pressure among the rank and file of a
police department is destructive at times. Otherwise mature,
intelligent and capable police personnel get swept up in the
opportunity to lash out at whatever seems to be bothering them;
bashing and blaming the chief makes some feel good.</LD>
<LD>   Being a former chief of police (and recipient of a police union's
''no confidence'' vote several years ago), I know Chief Bernard Parks
and respect the fine job, in extremely difficult circumstances, that
he is doing. Mayor James Hahn and members of the Police Commission
should put the league's ''no confidence vote'' where it belongs, in
the trash. If Parks wants to continue in his job for another five
years the city of Los Angeles should leap at the opportunity to
retain him.</LD>

<LD>Regarding the Jan. 18 front-page article indicating no congressional
committee investigating the Enron scandal could muster a majority if
campaign contributions from Enron or Andersen disqualified them: I
would think this should raise a lot of questions.</LD>
<LD>   Should we have to be concerned about whether a politician can
honestly investigate campaign contributors? How can the public
respect any investigation under these circumstances? If not this,
just what will it take to convince voters campaign finance reform is
not only necessary but a prerequisite to responsible government?</LD>

<TE>   Re "As Questions Get Louder, Cheney Stays Silent," Jan. 18: Your
article reported charges that there are "at least 17 policies in the
White House energy plan that are virtually identical to positions
Enron advocated." If the advice and wisdom so generously shared by
Enron bears fruit, the California energy fiasco may prove to be a
best-case scenario for future energy crises.</TE>

<TE>   Re "A Scandal So Good It Hurts," Commentary, Jan. 18: I don't
often agree with John Balzar, but he's right on about what we've let
ourselves become. I was thinking the same thing as I watched a woman
feed her kids plums and fresh peas from the vegetable bins at the
supermarket--being very explicit in showing them how to pop open the
pea pods! As Balzar says, we've devalued simple and honest things
completely yet are surprised and outraged that our corporations and
institutions reflect the same dishonesty. It can't be otherwise--we
can't be more than the sum of our parts.</TE>

<LD>The most interesting aspect of "World Press Tries to Unknot Tale of
Bush and the Pretzel" (Jan. 16) is the revelation of just how much
the world pays attention to even the minute aspects of political life
in the United States. Certainly before Sept. 11 it was embarrassing
how little attention the average American was paying to the world.
Will we revert? Like it or not, the life and politics of a hegemonic
country in such a technologically and economically globalized world
are going to get a lot of attention.</LD>
<LD>   We as citizens of that hegemony have a responsibility, and indeed
it is in our best interests, to pay equal attention to the world and
to the foreign policies that our leaders practice. We have perhaps
the strongest constitutional government in the world, but if we're
not paying attention the politicians who construct our foreign policy
will respond only to the narrow and selfish interests (often
consisting of global, corporate fat cats) that can provide lucrative
campaign finances. And that, in the long run, hurts our politics, our
economy and our safety. We must be more active as a civil society.</LD>

<LD>Re "Justices Weigh States' Role in HMO Disputes," Jan. 17: Common
sense dictates that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and
quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. If our Supreme Court justices
cannot see that HMOs are indeed insurance companies, then they are
truly ducking the issue. Nonetheless, it is also up to Congress to
clarify this issue once and for all.</LD>
<LD>   The Congress had apparently inadvertently created this monster
issue in its Employee Retirement Income Security Act legislation; it
is now up to our Congress to remedy it before we start sending some
of its members packing in the next election. Our politicians' refusal
to pass the patients' bills of rights only highlights the need for
true campaign finance reforms. We need more politicians who value the
welfare of their constituents a little bit more highly than their own
reelection.</LD>

<LD>The county simply cannot build 20,000 new homes: That is the message
to the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which
recently assigned Santa Barbara County a tentative share of units to
absorb some of the state's anticipated growth.</LD>
<LD>   The county Assn. of Governments voted recently to contest the
number--a range between 19,789 and 21,759 housing units--by
requesting an assignment of about 6,000 fewer homes. The county is
not required to build the homes, only to set aside land for them.</LD>

<LD>Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in auction. The
Treasury Department sold $14 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.67%, up from 1.53% last week.</LD>
<LD>   An additional $13 billion in six-month bills was sold at a rate of
1.735%, up from 1.58%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 31 when the bills
sold for 1.71%. The six-month rate was the highest since Jan. 7 when
it was 1.70%.</LD>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.7% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,957.80 and 1.774% for a six-month bill selling for $9,912.30.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 2.03% last
week from 2.13% the previous week.</TE>

<LD>   The "open skies" accord signed by Transportation Secretary Norman

The United States had previously reached open skies deals with the
Czech Republic and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The department gave final approval Jan. 18 to Delta and Air
France's application for antitrust immunity so they can more closely
coordinate fares, schedules and revenue.</TE>

from American Airlines and British Airways.</TE>

<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. is bailing out of a major part of the pay-for-service
telephone business, dealing a major setback to psychics, sex chat
lines and other companies that use 900 numbers.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T stopped providing billing services for new 900 customers as
of Jan. 1 and will discontinue billing for all such numbers on Dec.
31. The decision was primarily a financial one, AT&amp;T spokeswoman Jean
Hurt said.</LD>
<LD>   The tawdry reputation of some 900 services and concerns about
AT&amp;T's image may have played a part, Hurt said.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Golden State Bancorp Inc. appeal
aimed at adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the potential take
from a breach-of-contract suit against the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   Golden State, the second-largest U.S. thrift, sought to overturn
limits imposed by an appeals court on the damages it can seek in one
of its two cases against the government. The ruling forced the
company to scale back its request from $1.6 billion to $643 million.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals court decision was in some respects a victory for
Golden State, which is controlled by financier Ron Perelman. The
ruling reversed a federal trial judge who had awarded only
$23million.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Golden State closed up 7 cents to $27.65 on
the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Attorneys for the controversial Morpheus online file-sharing service
asked a federal judge to reject part of the copyright infringement
suit brought by major record companies and Hollywood studios.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit against Nashville-based MusicCity Networks Inc., which
developed Morpheus, and two similar companies, accuses them of
enabling consumers to make free copies of movies and music online in
violation of the labels' and studios' copyrights.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for MusicCity's parent company and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an advocacy group for civil liberties online, asked U.S.
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles to dismiss half of
the infringement claims because Morpheus is protected by the Supreme
Court's decision in the landmark Sony Betamax case.</LD>
<TE>   In that ruling, the Supreme Court held that a technology with
substantial, legitimate uses couldn't be banned simply because some
people used it to violate copyrights.</TE>

<LD>   Rejecting pleas by civil rights groups, the justices let stand a
federal appeals court decision that struck down the rules as
violations of the Constitution's equal-protection clause.</LD>

relieves companies of any obligation to collect race and ethnicity

<LD>Titan Corp., whose irradiation equipment is being used by the U.S.
Postal Service to kill anthrax, agreed to buy closely held Jaycor
Inc. for $95 million in stock to attract military electronics
contracts.</LD>
<LD>   Jaycor makes radar and communications systems, which Titan could
use to expand its business with military research and development
agencies in the U.S. Jaycor will add $45 million to $50 million in
sales this year and is expected to increase profit, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies are based in San Diego. Titan, which also makes
satellite communications gear, had sales of about $1 billion in 2000.
Titan shares fell $1.10 to $20.27 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Fox Leases Saturday Block to 4 Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co. agreed to lease a four-hour
Saturday morning block on its network to animation supplier, 4 Kids
Entertainment Inc., for $101.2 million over four years.</LD>
<LD>   Although television networks usually pay outside suppliers a
license fee to air their programs, Fox is following both CBS and NBC
in auctioning off this time period because it has become more
difficult to make money on Saturdays as youthful viewers have flocked
to cable channels such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.</LD>
<LD>   Though television executives question whether any company can make
money in this time period by paying such high rent, 4 Kids said it
was willing to pay Fox $25.3 million a year to guarantee a home for
programs that generate ancillary revenue from toys and videos.</LD>
<TE>   4 Kids, which airs three programs on the WB network beat out DIC
Entertainment, Nickelodeon and other bidders.</TE>
<TE>   4 Kids is spending three times more than Discovery Communications
agreed last month to pay NBC for a three-hour Saturday morning block.
4 Kids Chairman Alfred Kahn said it could afford it because Fox,
unlike NBC, is not requiring that all the programs be educational.
Many of the networks use Saturday mornings to satisfy federal laws
requiring TV stations to run three hours a week of educational
children's shows.</TE>

<LD>California's biomedical research industry is in strong shape and will
provide a significant boost to the state's economy in the next two
years, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the
statewide association that represents the industry.</LD>
<LD>   The state's biomedical R&amp;D system, which includes thousands of
businesses, universities and private research institutes, accounted
for 225,000 jobs and $6.4 billion in exports to the rest of the
world, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   It also paid $12.8 billion in wages and salaries; for
Californians, that meant an average annual income of $64,353.</LD>
<TE>   The report also said that 68% of the state biomedical companies
said they expect to make big investments in R&amp;D in the next two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Though analysts said Tuesday that the industry is primed for
growth, there are several potential problems, including federal
restrictions on research.</TE>
<TE>   "Our greatest threats include a total ban on human cloning and
severe restrictions on stem cell research," said David L. Gollaher,
president and CEO of the California Healthcare Institute, the
association for the industry.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Reports Its First Profit</HD>
<DH>E-commerce: After losing billions of dollars since its
launch, the retailer earns $5million, or 1 cent a share, fueled by
holiday sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet revolution, which promised to transform the way
consumers shop for everything from compact discs to cars, reached a
grand milestone Tuesday when pioneering online retailer Amazon.com
Inc. reported the first profit in its seven-year history.</LD>
<LD>   In the last three months of 2001, the world's largest electronic
commerce company cleared $5 million, or 1 cent a share, contrasted
with a loss of $545 million, or $1.53 a share, in the same period a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The profit was fueled by robust Christmas sales as the Seattle
company sold $1.1 billion of books, videos, consumer electronics and
other merchandise in the fourth quarter, a 15% increase  from the
year-earlier period.</LD>
<TE>   Although analysts say Amazon may post a loss in the upcoming
quarters, they add that the company's efforts to streamline its
operations and consumers' increasing willingness to shop online
appear to have put it on a trajectory toward sustained profit in the
coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "They took a very good brand and very good shopping technology and
a great customer experience and they finally turned it into a
business model that the market can support," said George Sutton,
managing director of RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis. "This is a
good day for e-commerce broadly."</TE>
<TE>   After losing billions of dollars since it opened its virtual doors
in July 1995, Amazon promised Wall Street that by the end of 2001, it
would post a pro forma operating profit--a loose measure that
excludes routine business expenses such as restructuring costs,
amortization of goodwill and the cost of paying employees with stock.
By those standards, the company made $59 million in the fourth
quarter, contrasted with a loss of $60 million in the fourth quarter
of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Still hanging over the company is $2.2 billion in long-term debt
and the continuing challenge of  persuading customers to spend
increasing amounts online on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts viewed Amazon's performance last quarter as
"exceptionally impressive" considering that the company broke the
profitability barrier in the midst of a recession clouded by the war
in Afghanistan and the uncertainty of further terrorist attacks, said
Jeetil Patel, senior analyst with Deutsche Bank in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now seeing the proof that the e-retailing business does
really work at the end of the day," Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors rewarded Amazon by bidding up the price of its shares
24% to $12.60, up $2.44 on  Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts downplayed the significance of the $5-million profit
Amazon reported using "generally accepted accounting principles"
because it included factors that are outside its control, even though
they benefited the company's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the value of the company's European debt has
plummeted as the euro has weakened relative to the dollar. In
addition, the cost of paying employees in stock--a hallmark of the
dot-com era--falls with Amazon's stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon squeezed out its first profit after a year of aggressive
cost cutting. The company consolidated offices, closed a fulfillment
warehouse in McDonough, Ga., and shuttered customer service centers
in Seattle and Europe. Altogether, Amazon laid off about 1,300
employees in technical, professional and warehouse positions.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the company's growth rate slowed in 2001. But that
allowed it to get to the point where new customers and incremental
sales result in high profit margins, analysts said. Now Amazon is
positioned to aim for both.</TE>
<TE>   "This year will be more of a growth year," Sutton said. "Now they
can afford to get more aggressive in terms of growth without
sacrificing profits."</TE>
<TE>   For the first three months of 2002, Amazon executives said, the
company expects to have an operating loss of no more than $16 million
and could break even. Those would be considered strong first-quarter
results for any retailer because retail sales generally hit a lull
after the frenetic holiday shopping season.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are expecting that Amazon will report another profit  for
the 2002 holiday shopping season--if not sooner--when high sales
volume creates operational efficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for Amazon today is much different than in 2000, when
the dot-com meltdown was in full force. Company observers compared
the company's monthly loss--it's so-called burn rate--to the amount
of cash it had on hand and calculated that it would be out of
business by December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bad day for the naysayers," Sutton said.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that Amazon could be profitable doesn't mean there
will be coattails for other struggling online retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that mean everyone else can do it? No," Patel said. "Amazon
achieved almost $1.2 billion in sales to do so. Not a whole lot of
other companies can do that."</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, Amazon reported a net loss of $567 million,
down nearly 60% from the $1.4 billion it lost in 2000.</TE>

<HD>AOL Unit Files Suit Against Microsoft</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Netscape claims the software giant monopolized
the market, crushing competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER  and CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An AOL Time Warner Inc. unit filed a civil antitrust suit Tuesday
against Microsoft Corp. claiming the Redmond, Wash.-based giant's
monopolistic behavior nearly pushed AOL's Netscape Internet browser
out of the market.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit--filed by AOL subsidiary Netscape Communications Corp.
in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia--draws heavily
from federal court findings that Microsoft's business practices amid
the browser wars of the 1990s violated federal antitrust laws.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge ruled in April 2000 that Microsoft used
anti-competitive means to thwart browser Netscape. A panel of seven
appellate judges upheld eight separate antitrust violations by
Microsoft a year later.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders, and a
responsibility to consumers, to pursue this case," said AOL executive
John Buckley. "There are still issues that obviously have yet to be
resolved. We believe it's better to file this action now."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officials said the complaint is merely a sign that AOL
is trying to compete with Microsoft in the courts rather than the
marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "They've timed today's filing to interfere with the ongoing
efforts to bring our [other] anti-trust case to a conclusion," said
Jim Desler, a spokesman for Microsoft. "This lawsuit is not about
consumers. It's really about a company concerned about its business
performance."</TE>
<TE>   AOL, which bought Netscape for $4.2 billion in 1999, is seeking
unspecified damages that legal experts say could top hundreds of
millions--and possibly billions--of dollars. If AOL wins the case and
can prove actual financial damages in court, the company would be
entitled to triple that amount, according to federal antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   Netscape Navigator, once the dominant Internet browser, has been
overshadowed by Microsoft's Internet Explorer. About 66 million U.S.
home PC users rely on Explorer, compared with 16 million for
Navigator, according to the latest figures from Internet analyst
Jupiter Media Metrix. At work, Explorer users outnumberNavigator
users 29 million to 10 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the complaint, Netscape asked for a jury trial and an immediate
injunction against Microsoft's predatory behavior, both past and
future. Netscape claimed that "it lost browser licensing revenues; it
lost browser market share ... and it lost the profits that would have
existed if Microsoft had not acted illegally." Ultimately, a judge
will decide the amount of any damages and conduct remedies.
Netscape's complaint suggested the conduct remedies could be derived
from a proposal filed last year by nine states and the District of
Columbia--such as forcing Microsoft to release a version of Windows
without its own middleware products.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Gartenberg, a Jupiter analyst, said AOL is probably less
concerned with recovering damages than with creating a new impediment
to Microsoft's efforts to dominate online software with its .Net
initiative, which hopes to provide a multitude of Internet services,
according to individual references.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about money in the past as much as about potential
technologies in the future," he said. "Microsoft's legal troubles are
not over. There are going to be further vanquished competitors that
will continue to bring up these challenges going forward."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that Sun Microsystems Inc. and other competitors may
file follow-up suits on a range of technology issues, and noted that
complaints by Apple Computer Corp. recently helped scuttle a
$1-billion tentative deal between Microsoft and the state attorneys
general over 100 consumer antitrust lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Private antitrust actions often are filed after a government
lawsuit against the same target has been completed or is well
advanced, to save the necessity of providing proof for many aspects
of the case, said Utah Assistant Atty. Gen. Wayne Klein.</TE>
<TE>   Utah, like eight other states, has opted to pursue its own
antitrust action against Microsoft, rather than join the Department
of Justice effort working its way through federal court. Klein said
that AOL would benefit greatly from the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that findings were upheld on appeal--and most of
them were--that gets AOL part of the way there," Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   AOL still will have to establish that it was directly victimized
by Microsoft's anti-competitive actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The liability part of the lawsuit has been resolved. They just
have to focus on proving harm and on damages," Klein said.</TE>

<LD>Kmart Corp.'s model of selling a broad array of goods at value
prices--once a winning strategy--in recent years has become
vulnerable to newer, tougher and more innovative retailers that each
have picked off segments of Kmart's target customers.</LD>
<LD>   Those competitors now stand to gain even more from Kmart's
troubles, analysts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers, however, could see higher prices as competitors face
less pricing pressure from a consolidated and repositioned Kmart,
they said.</LD>
<TE>   Although the discount sellers are likely to gain the most from
Kmart closures and reorganization, the opportunities to pick off
pieces of Kmart's business stretch across the retail industry,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart is just squeezed in the middle. There just isn't a way for
them to differentiate," said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an analyst with
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The market is not that complicated. The
deep-value customer simply has a number of options that they didn't
have before, and those options get better and better."</TE>
<TE>   Bad news at Kmart quickly became good news for its two biggest
competitors, Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., both of which saw
stock gains Tuesday after Kmart's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Target and Wal-Mart stand to gain the most from Kmart's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton reportedly developed the model for his
stores by visiting Kmart stores and noting all the things they did
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond his attempts to improve upon the look and feel of Kmart
stores, Walton worked to beat his competitor at the discount game
Kmart helped invent. In order to offer the most consistently low
prices available anywhere, Wal-Mart stores quickly outpaced Kmart in
new technology, store operations, and eventually, size and buying
power. All of that solidified its abilities to promise customers
unmatched value.</TE>
<TE>   "That means no one can beat Wal-Mart on price," one competitor
said. "No one. It's suicide to try."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kmart tried to compete for the discount mantle, kicking off
the second quarter of last year with new promotions and lower costs.
Wal-Mart, with its bigger buying muscle and higher-tech operations,
moved in to match prices and lower them further, keeping the pressure
on Kmart but cramping its own margins in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Hale, a retail analyst with Banc of America Securities in
San Francisco, estimates that Wal-Mart has lost 1.2 percentage points
off its gross profit margin "in large degree because of [Kmart's]
pricing action." Kmart's bankruptcy is likely to ease that pressure,
Hale said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart has been very promotional in its pricing--in some cases
irrational," Hale said Tuesday in a note to clients. "The irrational
pricing environment should improve, benefiting [Wal-Mart] and all
other discounters."</TE>
<TE>   Target also stands to benefit further from Kmart's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In surveying the competitive landscape in the early 1990s, the
company--then called Dayton-Hudson Corp.--determined that its Target
stores would have to focus on more than just value pricing.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Target stores were positioned as a "mass with class"
chain, offering high-style goods at lower prices than department
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Target brought in known brands, such as Mossimo, and developed
other names, always with fashion as a focus. Target took architect
and designer Michael Graves, who had designed home goods for Italian
fine goods manufacturer Alessi, and turned him into a household name,
using Graves' designs and lower-cost materials to create more
affordable, but still fashionable, housewares.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Kmart responded, landing a prize contract with Martha
Stewart, Target had secured its position as the fashionable
discounter of choice.</TE>

<HD>EMI to Drop Mariah Carey, Sources Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI Group is expected this week to drop pop star Mariah Carey, less
than a year after signing her to a blockbuster four-album contract
worth more than $80 million, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The termination of the pact, which sources say will cost EMI an
estimated $30 million in exit fees, follows a difficult year for
Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown last summer before releasing
her debut album for the British music giant. But Carey's "Glitter" CD
for EMI was panned by critics and sold only about 2 million copies
worldwide. Her 1993 album, "Music Box," sold about 20 million copies
for Sony.</LD>
<LD>   This marks the first time a major music corporation has decided to
cut its losses on an unprofitable superstar pact after one album.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for EMI and Carey declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But sources say the parties have been in negotiations since
October, when EMI brought in music industry veteran Alain Levy to
take over the faltering music corporation with a mandate to cut
costs. EMI lost $77.6 million in the first half of its current fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   Levy and his second in command, David Munns, determined that it
would be best to get the $30-million loss off its books from the
Carey settlement before EMI's fiscal year ends in March, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Within a week of taking the reins at EMI, Levy fired Virgin head
Nancy Berry, the executive who signed Carey to the lavish pact after
outbidding several competitors. The Carey deal was approved by Nancy
Berry's former husband and boss, Ken Berry--who also was ousted when
Levy took over.</TE>
<TE>   EMI's Virgin Records signed Carey, an international star who had
sold more than 100 million albums at Sony, with the hope that she
would continue her winning streak. EMI spent a fortune on marketing
and promotional costs for "Glitter," but Carey's album lost more than
$10 million in the process, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Dumping Carey is a clear indication that Levy will run EMI in a
dramatically different fashion than his predecessors. The 54-year-old
French executive also has held frank discussions recently with his
top managers about reducing their lavish salaries and job perks at
EMI. Levy is being paid $1 million to run EMI--about one fifth of
what his competitors earn.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, who previously turned PolyGram into the world's leading
record company, has developed a reputation for being a frugal,
no-nonsense manager. Analysts say Levy's bold decision to cut ties
with Carey could have ramifications for fading superstars at other
labels too. Battered by decreasing sales and exploding costs, record
companies are scrambling to find new methods to make their quarterly
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Carey will leave EMI and become a free agent again, it is
unclear which record company would be willing to pay a hefty price to
sign her.</TE>

<HD>Allergan to Spin Off Eye-Care Unit by Midyear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc. said Tuesday that it will spin off the eye-care
business that built the company and allowed it to develop popular
skin-care and drug products, which now will become the core of the
Irvine company's business.</LD>
<LD>   The maker of Botox, a muscle relaxant that baby boomers are using
to remove wrinkles, said the new public company will be called
Advanced Medical Optics Inc. and will sell contact lens cleaning
solutions and eye-surgery devices. It will be based in Irvine and
should be spun off by midyear.</LD>
<LD>   Allergan's eye-care business brought in $551million last year, or
nearly one-third of the company's total revenue of about $1.7billion.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of 52-year-old Allergan rose $2.94, or 4%, to close at
$74.26 on the New York Stock Exchange. The number of shares traded
was nearly three times the average daily volume for the last three
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a step in the right direction," said Tim Chiang,
an analyst with Banc of America Securities in New York. "Allergan can
now focus on its most profitable and exciting business and no longer
be dragged down by the medical-device side."</TE>
<TE>   Allergan, which under Chief Executive David E.I. Pyott has
emphasized drugs, said the split would boost next year's earnings per
share to 22% to 25%. The company previously expected a 20% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Medical also would benefit from the split because it
would have its own management team and would probably have more to
spend on research and development, said David Buck, an analyst at
Buckingham Research.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan shareholders will receive one share of Advanced Medical
for every three or four shares of Allergan, Pyott said. After the
split, Allergan will have 5,200 employees and Advanced Medical will
employ 2,100.</TE>
<TE>   James V. Mazzo, an Allergan vice president and head of its
eye-surgery product line, will become president and chief executive
of Advanced Medical. During his 22 years with Allergan, he also has
had global responsibility for the firm's contact lens-care
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Pyott, who also serves as Allergan's chairman, will serve on
Advanced Medical's board for one year after the split, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In related news, Allergan on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net
income of $84 million, or 63 cents a share, versus $65 million, or 48
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 13% to $453.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings, excluding one-time
gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   Avery Dennison Corp. said net income fell to $58.1 million, or 59
cents a share, from $67.5 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier. Sales
at the Pasadena maker of Hi-Liter markers and sticky labels slipped
2.2% to $912.6 million from $933.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Emulex Corp., a Costa Mesa maker of data storage networking
equipment, reported a net loss of $28.3 million, or 35 cents a share,
for its second fiscal quarter, which included $39.1 million in costs
primarily associated with the acquisition of Giganet Inc. a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for its fiscal second quarter of the previous year
totaled $19.4 million. Revenue was down 13% to $62.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Grupo Bimbo to Buy 5 U.S. Bakeries</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's Grupo Bimbo, the world's third-largest bread maker, said
Tuesday that it will acquire five U.S. bakeries from Canada's George
Weston Ltd. in a move that will double Bimbo's U.S. operations. .</LD>
<LD>   The $610-million deal--including bakeries in Montebello and near
San Francisco--will bring the number of plants Bimbo owns north of
the border to 17. Bimbo also gets exclusive rights in the U.S. to
Oroweat bread and Entenmann's baked goods, brands popular in the
western U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Bimbo also will get Western distribution rights to Thomas' English
Muffins and Boboli pizza kits.</LD>
<TE>   "This acquisition fits perfectly with our vision of creating a
pre-eminent baking business in the United States," Bimbo Chief
Executive Daniel Servitje said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexico City-based company has begun to make major inroads in
the long-entrenched U.S. baking business, buying up Mrs. Baird's
Bakeries and Four-S Bakeries in California in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   After the acquisition, about $1.2billion in revenue--more than a
third of the company's total--will come from its U.S. operations.</TE>
<TE>   George Weston is selling the western U.S. business to pay down
debt from its Bestfoods baking acquisition and to focus on its core
brands in the northeastern U.S.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Seeks Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH>Retail: Filing is expected to result in the closure of
hundreds of stores and an unknown number of jobs lost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST and GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp., an institution that used discounted prices and Blue
Light Specials to reach out to blue-collar America, on Tuesday became
the largest retailer to seek protection in bankruptcy court.</LD>
<LD>   The bankruptcy filing, which listed $16.3 billion in assets and
$10.3 billion in liabilities, is expected to eventually result in the
closure of hundreds of stores and layoffs for some of Kmart's roughly
250,000 employees nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer, whose roots date back to 1899,
said it secured $2 billion in financing that will allow the company
to operate while reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.</LD>
<TE>   The widely anticipated filing was welcomed by analysts and some of
Kmart's vendors, whose support will be critical to the company's
turnaround efforts. Martha Stewart, Kmart's best-known brand, said
Tuesday that it was sticking by the retailer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said it planned to emerge from bankruptcy in 2003, and
Tuesday the nation's second-largest discount retailer began the task
of determining which of its approximately 2,100 stores should close.
Kmart has 164 outlets in California, about half of them in Southern
California. All of Kmart's stores were operating Tuesday, although
some shoppers complained that shelves were not properly stocked.</TE>
<TE>   The company blamed the bankruptcy on increased competition, poor
holiday sales and the recession, a series of unsuccessful sales and
marketing initiatives and, most recently, an erosion of support among
its vendors. Kmart sought unsuccessfully to secure a bailout from
lenders, and the company suffered a particularly stinging blow last
weekend when Fleming Cos., its only grocery supplier, halted
shipments after Kmart failed to make a regular weekly payment.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing and the $2-billion cash infusion are "the
best news that has come out of Kmart in some time," said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry
publication in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kmart's problems have been mounting for years, its rapid
fall into bankruptcy came after investors pummeled the company's
stock in recent weeks and rating agencies downgraded its debt.
Kmart's financial strain stemmed largely from the company's fierce
battle against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's low-price leader,
and Target Corp., which offers trendier merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said those companies have created clearer brands.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart is being squeezed at both ends," said Jeff Parkhurst, a
director with Interbrand, a New York-based brand and corporate
identity consulting firm. "They don't have the market on trendy
merchandise and they don't have the market cornered on cost. They
don't have much of anything right now."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart is expected to use bankruptcy to shed many unprofitable
leases and reduce other costs that are stalling its attempted
restructuring. The $2 billion in financing will give Kmart cash
needed to stock its store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it was seeking Bankruptcy Court approval to
terminate the leases of about 350 stores that were closed by Kmart
and are being leased by other tenants. That would save the company
about $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart also said it has hired Ronald B. Hutchison as executive vice
president and chief restructuring officer. Hutchison, 51, was
formerly chief financial officer at Advantica Restaurant Group Inc.
and worked with James B. Adamson, a turnaround expert who Kmart
tapped last week as its chairman.</TE>
<TE>   As the two men work together to reposition Kmart, they face
numerous challenges in winning the confidence of shoppers, vendors
and investors.</TE>
<TE>   Grocery supplier Fleming had not resumed shipments as of Tuesday,
said company spokesman Shane Boyd, who added that Fleming would "be
able to resume shipping immediately once they've [Kmart] been able to
demonstrate they can meet their commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart must keep shelves stocked if it hopes to win consumers back.
"You go around and you cannot find anything in all this mess," said
Laurie Francisco, 47, a nursing assistant who was shopping at a Los
Angeles Kmart store Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Loyal customers, including many with modest incomes who have come
to rely on Kmart's sale items, worried that Kmart's cost cutting
might result in nearby stores closing. "This store is like my house.
I know where everything is," said Nilda Zuloaga, 73. "I don't want it
to close."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agree that a key to Kmart's future will be keeping brands
that set it apart--including Martha Stewart, Sesame Street, Disney
and Thom McCan. "If you lose those, then Kmart just becomes a very
poor version of Wal-Mart and they won't survive long term," industry
analyst Eric Beder said.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. said in a statement Tuesday
that it is optimistic about Kmart returning to financial health. The
company said Kmart will continue to sell Martha Stewart Everyday
brand products "for the foreseeable future." Martha Stewart sales in
Kmart stores total about $1.5 billion annually.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys who've studied the contract linking Martha Stewart
Living to Kmart say it's not probable that the high-profile
consumer-goods company can break away from Kmart. Although the
contract includes language that seems to give Stewart's firm the
right to part company with Kmart after a bankruptcy filing, "the
provisions track right along with bankruptcy code provisions that
negate the clauses," said Lynn M. LoPucki, a UCLA law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living did have a right to part company with Kmart
before a bankruptcy filing, LoPucki said, "but they didn't do it
before the filing and it's clear that they can't do it after the
bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   The complex bankruptcy filing included papers for 38 Kmart
entities, including the flagship Kmart Corp. The cases were
consolidated in a hearing Tuesday in Chicago, where Kmart filed for
bankruptcy.  The petition lists assets of nearly $16.3 billion,
surpassing the bankruptcy filing in 1990 by Federated Department
Stores, which had been the retail industry's largest Chapter 11 case.
Kmart listed debts of more than $10.3 billion, with the top 50
unsecured creditors holding about 42% of the debt, or $4.3 billion
worth of loans, debt securities and products and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Several pension and retirement funds were among 50 creditors
listed by Kmart. The Wisconsin Investment Board had invested $30
million in Kmart debt securities, but any drop in value isn't
expected to have much of an effect because the diversified fund has
about $60 billion in assets, a manager said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest single group of unsecured creditors are holders of
nearly $2.8 billion in debt securities.</TE>
<TE>   Loans from the four next largest creditors--BankBoston, Chase II,
Bank of New York and Credit Suisse First Boston--total $425 million.</TE>

<HD>Co-Founder Venter Steps Down as President of Celera
Genomics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Craig Venter, the maverick scientist whose drive to crack the
human genome ignited one of the fiercest rivalries in modern science,
resigned Tuesday from the company he helped launch, Celera Genomics.</LD>
<LD>   Venter's abrupt departure from the high-profile gene-mapping
company prompted speculation that he left under pressure from
Celera's parent, Applera Corp. No successor to Venter was named.
Applera said Chairman and Chief Executive Tony White will assume
Venter's position as president until a replacement is found.</LD>
<LD>   Venter, who led Celera in a race against the publicly funded Human
Genome Project two years ago, leaves Celera as the company shifts its
focus from genomics, his specialty, to drug development, in which
Venter lacks expertise.</LD>
<TE>   White, in a statement Tuesday, cited a need for Celera to make
"room for additional senior management experienced in pharmaceutical
discovery and development." Celera's acquisition last year of San
Francisco-based Axys Pharmaceuticals heightened the need for a
seasoned drug executive, White said.</TE>
<TE>   Venter remains a scientific advisor to Celera and will continue as
chairman of his nonprofit Institute for Genomics Research, which owns
about 2% of Celera stock. Venter couldn't be reached Tuesday. Celera
didn't respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   With backing from Applera in 1998, Venter started Celera to decode
the human genome, putting himself at odds with a scientific
establishment that backed the government-funded project. Venter's
bold predictions that his Maryland-based company would decode the
genome faster than the government-sponsored group further irked the
research community. But his challenge sped up the race. Both teams
announced they had sequenced the genome in 2000, one year ahead of
Venter's ambitious forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Venter's departure from Celera underscores a shift taking place in
genomics, a business that once infatuated Wall Street but has since
fallen from favor. Two years ago, companies such as Celera, Incyte
Genomics Inc. of Palo Alto and San Diego-based Sequenom Inc.
envisioned a business selling genetic data to information-hungry drug
companies. Now, nudged by investors,  genomics companies are mining
their databases for their own use, looking for a bigger payoff in
pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of Venter's departure caught analysts by surprise,
though the company had subtly signaled change was afoot. On Jan. 6,
former DuPont Co. executive David Block was named vice president and
chief operating officer of the Celera Therapeutics business, the
company's drug discovery and development arm. Moreover, White, the
Applera chief, had been spending "most of his time in the last three
to six months" at Celera, said Winton Gibbons, an analyst with
William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago. "Looking back, that probably was a
sign," Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Duncan, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort &amp; Wasserstein
in New York, called Venter's departure "a natural change as the
company changes its business model from sequencing the genome, which
he championed and was critical to."</TE>
<TE>   Applera-Celera Genomics Group shares closed at $22.30, down $1.54
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction of analysts to Venter's departure was mixed. Venter
embodied the company, said analyst Duncan, so investors might react
negatively to his departure, at least initially.</TE>
<TE>   Without Venter, Celera might have difficulty attracting scientific
talent, said Gibbons, the William Blair analyst. Venter "was a magnet
for scientific expertise and the specific kind of scientist that
wants to break the mold and try every new thing. It's an open issue
whether they can continue to bring people in."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Geist, an analyst with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee,
said the change was good news for the company. "The company has
languished because it is valued as a service-based business and is
not getting the credit it deserves in drug discovery," he said.
Celera recently received an undisclosed milestone payment for an
inflammation drug from its development partner, Aventis
Pharmaceuticals, but "the stock didn't respond at all."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has about $1billion in cash on its balance
sheet, has a market value of $1.4billion, analysts noted. Venter,
Geist said, "was not viewed as someone who would remain an executive
indefinitely."</TE>
<TE>   Celera lost $186.2 million on revenue of $89.4 million for fiscal
2001, which ended June 30.</TE>

<HD>Guilty Plea in Insider-Trading Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Authorities say former auditor had advance
knowledge of Tribune Co.'s acquisition of Times Mirror Co.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A onetime senior auditor for Times Mirror Co., the former owner of
the Los Angeles Times, has agreed to plead guilty to federal
securities fraud in an insider-trading case tied to Tribune Co.'s
acquisition of Times Mirror.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities said Tuesday that the former corporate
auditor, Daniel J. Wooten III, netted nearly $77,000 in illicit
profit by buying 2,285 shares of stock in Times Mirror based on
confidential information about the takeover.</LD>
<LD>   The authorities said Wooten, who plans to plead guilty to one
count of fraud, bought the stock in early March 2000, only days
before the $6.8-billion deal with Tribune was announced.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of his stock purchases, Wooten already had left Times
Mirror and was working as a controller for Rustic Canyon Group, a
venture capital firm in Santa Monica that worked on the takeover.</TE>
<TE>   According to a criminal information and plea agreement filed in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by prosecutors Tuesday, Wooten
learned at a Rustic Canyon staff meeting March 6 that a Tribune-Times
Mirror deal was about to be announced.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Wooten used his online stock brokerage account to
start accumulating Times Mirror shares, according to the court
papers. He sold his shares at a profit of $76,652 on March 13, 2000,
the day the deal was announced in a transaction that lifted the value
of Times Mirror shares about 60%.</TE>
<TE>   David Z. Seide, the prosecutor handling the case for the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles, said authorities quickly detected
suspicious stock trading that led them to Wooten. He said Wooten,
upon being confronted by federal investigators, confessed to the
illegal trading.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea agreement, Wooten is required to pay back all of
the illicit profit. In addition, the U.S. attorney's office will
recommend to a federal judge that Wooten pay an additional criminal
fine of $3,000 and receive three years of probation, including six
months of home detention. Wooten is scheduled to be arraigned in
federal court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten, 38, of Torrance, faced 10 years in federal prison, but
Seide said he is recommending a lighter sentence because of Wooten's
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to agreeing to plead guilty to a criminal charge,
Wooten also plans to enter into a civil settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, authorities said. Under the terms
of that agreement, Wooten would be subject to a permanent injunction
barring him from further securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Robert L. Corbin, a lawyer representing Wooten, released a
prepared statement saying: "This is a tragic situation. Mr. Wooten
has an excellent reputation and has obeyed the law his entire life.
He acted alone while committing this impulsive act and will pay for
it throughout his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Wooten accepts responsibility for his conduct, has cooperated
fully with the government's investigation and has voluntarily taken
steps to undo any harm he has caused, including efforts to resolve
all outstanding issues with the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   Corbin said Wooten currently is working as a part-time consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Seide said the probe into possible insider trading in the Tribune
buyout is continuing, but he declined to identify potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Tribune and Rustic Canyon said they had no
indication that anyone with their organizations was a target.</TE>
<TE>   Rustic Canyon is headed by Thomas Unterman, a former Times Mirror
chief financial officer. The firm was an advisor in the takeover to
the Chandler Family Trust, which had been the controlling shareholder
in Times Mirror.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-page report to be released today by Democratic members of the
House Small Business Committee blasts the Bush administration and
congressional leaders for giving short shrift to small-business
issues during the most recent congressional session.</LD>
<LD>   "The new administration and congressional leadership ... proved to
be the best friend big business ever had," says the report, to be
released by Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on
the committee. Meanwhile, the report says, "the needs of small
business, with its great potential to spur economic recovery, were
left unaddressed."</LD>
<LD>   The report cites administration and congressional inactivity on
nearly a dozen bills and proposals on a range of issues from federal
contracting to worker training.</LD>
<TE>   The report pushes for passage of the Small Employer Tax Relief
Act, which would provide for accelerated depreciation and more
favorable tax treatment for investments. The bipartisan Small
Business Contract Equity Act would increase the number of contracts
awarded to small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   It also supports the American Small Business Emergency Relief and
Recovery Act, which would offer entrepreneurs low- and no-cost loans,
grants and debt forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Those measures failed to pass during the last session of Congress,
according to the report, though portions of some were included in
other approved measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Small business does not seem to be a priority of the Congress or
the administration, based on the inability to move legislative
initiatives or even programmatic initiatives," said Rep. Danny K.
Davis (D-Ill.), a member of the Small Business Committee.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ken Lisaius countered that the president's
tax reform initiative will "lower taxes for the 17 million
unincorporated small businesses that file on the personal income tax
statement."</TE>
<TE>   The report is being released in advance of the new legislative
session in the hope of focusing more attention on the needs of small
business, Velazquez said.</TE>

<SM>SMALLBIZ A 14-page report to be released today (wed) by
Democratic members of the House Small Business Committee blasts the
Bush Administration and Congressional leaders for giving short shrift

leadership...proved to be the best friend big business ever had,''
said the report, to be released by Nydia M. Velazquez, ranking
Democratic member on the committee. Meanwhile, the report said, ''the

<HD>Index Hints Recovery Is Near</HD>
<DH>Economy: Key gauge posts largest gain in six years in
December, spurring optimism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A key forecasting gauge for the U.S. economy posted its largest gain
in almost six years in December, suggesting the economy could emerge
from recession within the next three months, a private research firm
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board said its U.S. index of leading economic
indicators rose 1.2% in December after a gain of 0.8% in November.
The December rise was the largest since February 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The increase exceeded expectations of Wall Street economists, who
had forecast the index would grow by 0.8% as the economy struggled to
shake off the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that the increase was so strong in December, the fact
that the index was up strongly in November, the longevity of the
increase and the breadth throughout different sectors of the economy
all go along with expectations that in one, two or three months the
recession will be over," said the board's chief economist, Ken
Goldstein.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Manufacturers, however, was not as
optimistic, as manufacturing remained one of the economy's weakest
spots.</TE>
<TE>   "New orders for manufactured goods continued to be negative in
December, so bets should be hedged for a weak and meandering
recovery," said the association's chief economist, David Huether.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer, speaking
in Texas before the report was released, also expressed caution.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was premature to say whether "this is the beginning of
the beginning," but said the economy, which entered recession in
March, was "certainly looking much better than two months ago."</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which last year cut
interest rates 11 times to a 40-year low, meets Jan. 29-30.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein said the rapidity with which consumer expectations
bounced back, along with the large decline in initial claims for
jobless benefits, were surprising components of the December report.</TE>
<TE>   The strong consumer, labor, investment and housing sectors were
"very positive signals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the Fed's aggressive monetary policy, growth in the
money supply, retail discounts and a fall in energy prices were
contributors to "the reemergence of economic momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Another economic yardstick in the report, the so-called lagging
index, which measures past trends in the economy, rose 0.1% last
month after a 0.3% drop in November.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the 10 components that make up the leading indicators
index rose in December, led by jobless claims, the Treasury yield
curve, money supply and the average workweek.</TE>
<TE>   Capital goods orders and manufacturers' new orders fell.</TE>

<HD>Lucent Reports Narrower Loss</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Phone- equipment maker also forecasts a sales
increase of as much as 15% from fiscal first quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucent Technologies Inc., North America's biggest phone-equipment
maker, predicted an end to three straight quarters of sales declines
and posted a smaller fiscal first-quarter loss after cutting costs.</LD>
<LD>   Sales will rise as much as 15% this quarter from the  previous
period's $3.58 billion. For the three months ended Dec. 31, Lucent's
net loss narrowed to $423 million, or 14 cents a share, from $464
million, or 14 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Henry Schacht said phone companies "remain cautious"
about spending plans for 2002. Chief Executive Patricia Russo has
vowed to boost revenue and stem losses that totaled $16 billion last
fiscal year by focusing only on sales to big carriers such as Verizon
Communications Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "They're starting to turn the ship around," said Ryan Tansey, an
analyst at John Hancock Advisers Inc., which owns Lucent shares. But
"it's still a 'show me' story."</TE>
<TE>   Excluding certain costs, writedowns, results from discontinued
operations and the sale of its optical-fiber unit, Lucent said it
would have had a loss of 23 cents a share in the latest quarter, a
penny better than the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call. Sales, which fell 18% from a year earlier, also
exceeded the $3.21-billion average estimate provided by First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The Murray Hill, N.J.-based company said its second-quarter loss,
excluding items, will narrow by more than 10% to 15% from the first
period's shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucent's ability to guide second-quarter earnings and sales up
just points to the fact that expectations just got too low for the
whole sector," said Bob Costomiris, a money manager with Strong
Capital Management Inc., which owns Lucent shares.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent said it can break even, excluding some expenses, by the end
of this fiscal year on quarterly sales of $4.25 billion, less than
its previous threshold of $4.75 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent rose 25 cents to $6.94 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other technology earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * BellSouth Corp., regional phone company for the Southeastern
U.S., said fourth-quarter net income fell 29% as restructuring,
currency losses and writedowns in the value of investments--all
during a recession--depressed profits.</TE>
<TE>   But excluding one-time charges, the results announced Tuesday
handily beat the consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts, who
generally praised the company's cost-control efforts and ability to
increase its data revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based BellSouth said earnings were $792 million, or 42
cents a share,  down from $1.1 billion, or 59 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting one-time costs, BellSouth profit was $1.19 billion,
or 63 cents a share, up from $1.12 billion, or 59 cents, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected
per-share earnings of 60 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue was $7.63 billion, up from $7.31 billion a year ago,
including returns from Cingular Wireless, BellSouth's joint venture
with SBC Communications.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth shares were down 60 cents to $37.45 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Motorola Inc., the Schaumburg, Ill., maker of mobile phones,
posted a fourth-quarter loss of $1.24 billion as demand dropped. The
deficit gave Motorola its first annual loss before restructuring
costs in 71 years.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterly loss was 55 cents a share, contrasted with net
income of $135 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 27%
to $7.32 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Before certain costs, the full-year loss was $697 million,
compared with Motorola's previous annual loss of $3,745 in 1930.
Chief Executive Christopher Galvin has vowed to return to
profitability in 2002 by cutting jobs and closing plants, especially
in the semiconductor unit, which is generating most of the company's
losses.</TE>
<TE>   * Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., a Camarillo maker of chips for
fiber-optic networking equipment, reported a fiscal first-quarter
loss of $106.9 million as customers trimmed orders amid an inventory
glut. The per-share loss was 54 cents. Year-earlier net income was
$28.1 million, or 15 cents. Sales in the period ended Dec. 31
declined 76% to $39.1 million.</TE>

<HD>CSFB Settles IPO Kickback Charges; SEC Says Investigation
Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal securities regulators formally announced Tuesday the
settlement of one part of a probe into alleged manipulation of
initial public stock offerings in the late 1990s. But officials
stressed that the investigation continues on other fronts.</LD>
<LD>   As reported in The Times on Saturday, brokerage Credit Suisse
First Boston agreed to pay $100million to settle charges that it
allotted sought-after shares of IPOs in exchange for investor
kickbacks in the form of higher commissions.</LD>
<LD>   The securities firm, which made $718 million underwriting
technology IPOs in 1999 and 2000, will pay a $30-million fine and
disgorge $70million in profit to resolve charges of "abusive IPO
allocation practices," the Securities and Exchange Commission said.</LD>
<TE>   Demands for higher commissions were pervasive and encouraged by
some senior executives at the unit of Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group,
the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers alleged that
CSFB illegally profited on skyrocketing IPOs by charging commissions
of as much as $3.15 a share, compared with a typical rate of 6 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC continues to investigate at least nine firms, including
Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., in connection with IPO
underwriting practices. The settlement by CSFB may not end the
prospect of SEC action against individuals at the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "While I do not wish to comment on any individuals, I will say
that our investigation is continuing," said Stephen Cutler, the SEC's
director of enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC didn't accuse CSFB of fraud, instead charging it with
violating federal record-keeping requirements.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased that our firm has reached a full resolution
of this matter with regulatory authorities," CSFB Chief Executive
John Mack said. "We are strongly committed to upholding the highest
standards of conduct."</TE>
<TE>   The $30-million fine is the second-highest after Salomon Bros.'
$120-million fine in 1992 for submitting bogus bids at Treasury bond
auctions.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is probing whether firms, including Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs Group, FleetBoston Financial's Robertson Stephens unit
and J.P. Morgan, received pledges from customers to purchase more
stock after IPOs began trading. Although that inquiry has a different
set of facts, CSFB's agreement may presage a settlement by other
firms, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB agreed to change its methods of allocating IPO stock and its
supervisory practices. The firm also agreed to hire an independent
consultant to review its new policies after a year and to adopt the
consultant's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB and three dozen other firms still face more than 1,000
class-action lawsuits filed by investors who were saddled with losses
after shares of companies such as VA Linux Systems Inc., Red Hat Inc.
and Akamai Technologies Inc. plunged. But the firm's legal position
in these suits is strengthened by its avoidance of SEC fraud charges,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The payments from the settlement with regulators will go to the
SEC and the NASD, not to investors who claim they lost money
investing in technology companies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no impact. The money isn't intended to go to the class
members," said Melvyn Weiss, the lead lawyer in a class-action
lawsuit against CSFB and the other investment banks. He said he will
press ahead with his case.</TE>

<HD>Tyco to Split Into 4 Units</HD>
<DH>Manufacturing: Concerns about the firm's accounting
practices are believed to be a reason for the move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL LAYNE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., bowing to shareholder demands for greater
transparency in accounting, said it plans to split into four
companies and shed $11 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   "It's absolutely surprising," said Mark Demos, an analyst with
Fifth Third Investment Advisors, which owns Tyco shares. "It goes
against the grain of Tyco's message over the past decade."</LD>
<LD>   The breakup reverses the strategy of Tyco Chief Executive Dennis
Kozlowski, who oversaw $64billion in acquisitions and whose methods
were compared with General Electric Co. Kozlowski will head the
electronics and security-systems company that remains after Tyco
spins off its health care, fire protection and flow control, and
financial services units.</LD>
<TE>   Tyco, which is based in Bermuda and run from Exeter, N.H., was the
subject of criticism from some analysts and investors who said the
company manipulated its accounting for acquisitions to mask slowing
growth in its business.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to deliver shareholder value, not wait around to be
vindicated," Kozlowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s accounting lapses and failure may have forced Tyco
to take the steps to boost its stock price after  losing $25 billion
in market value since December, investors said. Proceeds from
transactions and the sale of Tyco's plastics business will be used to
repay some of the company's $79 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are suffering [because of] Enron," Kozlowski
said. "The thing that brought down Enron was rogue financing off the
balance sheet. There's none of that at Tyco."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares rose $1.10, or 2.4%, to $47.55 on the New York Stock
Exchange after rising as high as $52.55.  The company's 6.38% bonds
maturing in 2011 rose $59 to $1,008 to yield 6.27%, traders said.
That's down from 7.11% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Revelations that Enron's auditor knew of irregularities at the
energy trader before its collapse have fueled doubts among some
investors about the reliability of corporate financial statements. In
July 2000, Tyco said the Securities and Exchange Commission ended a
probe of its accounting and took no action after Tyco made some
adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   "Management has been frustrated by the [stock's price-to-earnings]
multiple and the level of rumors out there," Demos said.</TE>
<TE>   The company had considered the breakup even when the stock was
trading in the mid-$50s. Breaking up Tyco probably will increase the
share price and address the accounting concerns, Kozlowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "The four independent entities will have far greater clarity, far
greater transparency, because they're smaller units in accounting and
every other matter," Kozlowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Money manager David Tice was the first to challenge Tyco's
accounting in October 1999. Tice, who runs the Prudent Bear fund
through Dallas-based Tice &amp; Associates, claimed Tyco set up reserves
when it made acquisitions and used them to boost earnings later. Tyco
denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to investor concern was Tyco's announcement  Jan. 15 that
its fiscal second-quarter profit will be less than analysts forecast
because of falling demand from telecommunications and
computer-networking companies.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco will sell stakes of as much as 20% in three of the four units
to the public and then distribute shares to existing investors. Terms
of the distribution weren't disclosed. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is Tyco's
financial  advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's board would consider offers for all the businesses if
potential acquirers expressed interest, Kozlowski said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slump on Tech Woes</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Worried investors are not impressed by upbeat
economic news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks plummeted again Tuesday as investors unloaded the
shares, concerned about the sector's run-up since October in the face
of still-weak corporate earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The broader market also closed lower despite upbeat economic news.
But most stocks' losses were modest compared with the hit to the tech
sector.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index sank 47.81 points, or 2.5%, to
1,882.53, a two-month low. The tech-dominated index has fallen 8.6%
since reaching 2,059 on Jan.4.</LD>
<TE>   Among blue-chip indexes, the Dow industrials eased 58.05 points,
or 0.6%, to 9,713.80 on Tuesday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 23 to 13 on Nasdaq and by 18 to 14 on the
New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   As activity resumed on Wall Street after Monday's closure in
observance of Martin Luther King Day, sellers were pummeling tech
shares almost from the opening.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Bernstein, chief U.S. strategist at Merrill Lynch, issued
a bearish report on the tech sector. His comments on the broader
market had helped contribute to last week's sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein advised clients to book any gains they may have in tech
stocks since October. Valuations in these stocks "are now clearly
stretched to bubble-like levels," he said, according to Bloomberg
News.</TE>
<TE>   Among tech leaders that slumped Tuesday were Sun Microsystems, off
$1.16, or 9.6%, to $10.96; Agilent Technologies, down $1.32, or 4.6%,
to $27.16; and Siebel Systems, down $1.64, or 4.8%, to $32.62.</TE>
<TE>   There was some good news from tech: Amazon.com surged $2.44, or
24%, to $12.60 after reporting its first net profit ever.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a stronger-than-anticipated economic report failed to
impress investors in general. The Conference Board said its index of
leading economic indicators, a key forecasting gauge, rose a strong
1.2% in December, the third consecutive monthly gain and a signal
that the economy may be on the verge of rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit disappointing. You had some decent news and the
market rose initially, but it wasn't able to stay up," said Robert
Harrington, head of listed block trading at UBS Warburg. "People are
expecting an economic rebound but I don't think [stock] valuations
and fundamentals are there yet. As a result the market has adopted a
'Prove it to me' attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say investors also are disappointed that more companies
haven't sounded upbeat about 2002 prospects in their fourth-quarter
earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   After a strong rally in the first few days of this year, the Dow
now is off 3.1% since Dec. 31. Nasdaq has lost 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets, Treasury bond yields rose modestly. Robert
McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, said Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan is more optimistic about an economic recovery
than investors interpreted after his speech earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Unidentified Fed officials also told the Washington Post late last
week that investors had "over-interpreted" Greenspan's comments.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean the Fed will refrain from cutting interest rates
at the agency's next meeting Jan. 29-30, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the yen fell to a three-year low against the
dollar, reaching 133.9 per dollar compared with 132.6 on Friday, as
traders interpreted remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill to mean the U.S. won't act to stem the slide in Japan's
currency.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Most telecom shares followed the tech sector lower. Qualcomm
sank $3.55 to $41.40 and Nokia fell $1.35 to $21.15.</TE>
<TE>   But Lucent Technologies rose 25 cents to $6.94 after saying it is
on a "path to profitability" in its current fiscal year, excluding
some expenses. North America's biggest maker of phone equipment said
it sees revenue rising 10% to 15% in the current quarter from the
December quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent also reported a fiscal first-quarter loss that narrowed
from a year ago after a gain on the sale of its optical-fiber unit.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor stocks were particularly weak. Intel slid $1.78 to
$31.70 and PMC-Sierra dropped $1.29 to $20.37. The SOXX chip stock
index slid 4.6%.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug stocks were winners on an otherwise down day. Merck gained
$1.29 to $59.29 after reporting earnings. Pfizer rose 70 cents to
$40.80 and Lilly gained $1.26 to $75.85.</TE>
<TE>   * International Paper, the biggest paper maker, rose 69 cents to
$38.91. The company reported a profit, before some costs, that beat
analysts' forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Viacom Class A shares fell $1.91 to $38.79, extending last
week's decline, amid concern its 2001 purchase of CBS Corp., formerly
known as Westinghouse Electric Co., links it to about 130,000
asbestos lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   * Japanese stocks slumped, with the Nikkei-225 index losing 2.2%
to 10,050.98.</TE>
<TE>   In Argentina, the Merval stock index dropped 5.2%. In Mexico, the
IPC index eased 0.3%.</TE>

<HD>SEC Cites CSFB E-Mail in Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission, in documents detailing the
settlement with Credit Suisse First Boston over alleged IPO abuses,
cited e-mail messages between CSFB employees to support the
contention that the firm broke the rules. Some excerpts:</LD>
<LD>   "OK, we got another screaming deal and I weaseled you guys some
stock," a salesman told a customer, according to the SEC. "We've yet
to see any leverage out of you guys for the free dough-re-me. Does it
make sense for me to continue to feed your guys with deal stock? Or
should I take the stock to someone who will pay us direct for the
allocation?"</LD>
<LD>   A CSFB senior manager tells another senior manager what would
happen if part of an investor's profit from an IPO stock's expected
immediate surge isn't paid to CSFB: "Either [client] pays us, or he
gets [expletive] nothing."</LD>
<TE>   The recipient responds: "Agreed."</TE>
<TE>   CSFB employees who work on the "syndicate" desk responsible for
allocating IPO shares told colleagues that clients should get IPO
shares only if they agree to do other trades, generating commissions:
"If you are thinking of allocating shares to some of the smaller
accounts, then there should be an opportunity to write almost
instantaneous tickets on the secondary side; i.e., this is not a
charity!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Some CSFB brokers, such as those who served wealthy executives at
technology firms, required customers to pay back to the firm as much
as 65% of their profits from IPOs, according to one e-mail.</TE>

<HD>Bush Makes 2 Recess Appointments to SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD> Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday made recess appointments of a Republican
and Democrat to the Securities and Exchange Commission, permitting
them to serve temporarily without the approval of the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Cynthia Glassman, a principal at the Ernst &amp; Young
accounting firm, and Democrat Isaac Hunt Jr., who was an SEC member
from 1996 to last month, received the appointments.</LD>
<LD>   They can serve until the Senate adjourns at the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Bush used his constitutional authority to install executive agency
officials while Congress is in recess. The legislative body returns
today.</TE>
<TE>   Glassman and Hunt will join Chairman Harvey Pitt, a Republican, on
the five-member commission. The other member, Republican Laura Unger,
has said she intends to leave as soon as a replacement can be named.</TE>
<TE>   Including Unger's seat, the SEC now has two openings for
commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Bush in December announced plans to nominate Glassman as well as
another accounting executive, PricewaterhouseCoopers lawyer Paul
Atkins.</TE>
<TE>   Bush hasn't announced plans for the fifth slot, which by law must
be filled by a non-Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The naming of Glassman and nomination of Atkins, both from Big
Five accounting firms, may stir controversy: Accounting issues have
taken center stage at the SEC with the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear whether some in Congress might oppose naming
accounting executives to the SEC, under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Bush used the recess loophole because of the
SEC vacancies and the need for it to be well-staffed to grapple with
issues related to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "There are obviously some very critical issues that will be coming
before the SEC in the near future," said White House spokeswoman Anne
Womack. "The president wanted to ensure that the SEC had the manpower
to handle the issues as well as a balanced perspective while doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the SEC reminded companies as they prepare their 2001
annual reports that better disclosure is needed for off-balance-sheet
deals and other accounting methods associated with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Herdman, chief accountant at the agency, said, "Our hope is
that public companies will go beyond the minimum legal requirements
and serve investors with the very best possible discussion of the
company's financial position and operating results."</TE>

<HD>Debt-Rating Agencies Looking at Timeliness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the top debt-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and
Standard &amp; Poor's, said Tuesday they are considering ways to respond
more quickly, and aggressively, to signs of trouble at the companies
they follow.</LD>
<LD>   The focus on improving the timeliness and relevance of
corporate-bond ratings comes at a time of rapid-fire downgrades and
amid criticism that experts did not alert investors soon enough to
the problems brewing at Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at both agencies said the increased frequency of
ratings downgrades in recent months is not so much a response to the
Enron fiasco as it is a reaction to the poor credit environment
created by the country's economic recession.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Moody's issued a report Tuesday outlining several
proposed changes to its rating process; an executive at Standard &amp;
Poor's said his company has been engaged in a similar dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   The measures being considered by Moody's include shortening the
ratings review period and allowing rating changes to be made without
formal reviews "when the relevant facts are known with a reasonable
degree of certainty," according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report said Moody's has made no formal decisions on these
proposals and that the company would seek feedback in the coming
weeks from market participants.</TE>
<TE>   Although executives at both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's insist
the emphasis on timeliness has little to do with Enron, they
acknowledge a new push to dig deeper into the complex ways that
corporate loans and trading agreements are structured.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has been accused of hiding debt in shadowy partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Griep, chief credit officer at S&amp;P, said in addition to
making more frequent ratings changes, his company also has begun to
take a closer look at how its ratings match up with stock- and
bond-market indicators.</TE>
<TE>   "Dramatic price moves may indicate that there's new information in
the marketplace," Griep said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Public Oversight Board, an accounting industry supervisory group,
voted to close Tuesday after the group said it was excluded from SEC
Chairman Harvey Pitt's new plans for enforcing accounting standards.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt responded by urging the five-member board to reconsider its
action. "Nothing I said on Thursday, or since, was in any way
intended to suggest that the POB had no role to play," Pitt wrote in
a letter to the board's chairman.</LD>
<LD>   The board, created in 1977 to oversee the quality of corporate
audits, said it would go out of existence by March 31.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to Pitt, the board said it was not consulted and was
not given a role in Pitt's plan for an oversight body to police
accountants and review audits in the wake of Enron's fall.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Will Face Test in Branding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Kmart Corp. clearly has the attention of shoppers, what ad
message will the retail chain deliver to consumers to keep them
coming into its stores?</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. uses marketing muscle and state-of-the-art
inventory controls to make good on its promise of everyday low
prices. Target Corp. has built a reputation for trendy but reasonably
priced merchandise. But Kmart has struggled for years to build a
solid brand image that clicks with shoppers.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart's highly publicized bankruptcy filing will generate a brief
window of opportunity among shoppers who believe that it will
initially lead to lower prices. But savvier shoppers, particularly
those who worry about getting refunds, clearly will use the
bankruptcy filing as an excuse to abandon Kmart.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart's managers must fix the chain's broken parts, such as its
distribution and inventory management system, before cranking up the
volume on advertising, marketing experts say. "Nothing will kill a
poor product faster than good advertising," cautioned Michael Belch,
a marketing professor at San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the company has spent about $2 billion to fix an
antiquated distribution and inventory control system that continues
to sap profitability by failing to keep shelves stocked. Kmart also
has struggled to cut ad costs by reducing its dependence on newspaper
ads.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart relies heavily on such shoppers as Nilda Zuloaga, 73, who
Tuesday pushed a cart littered with Big K newspaper advertisements
through the store. "All the time I bring these," the Eagle Rock
resident said, pointing to circulars promising low prices on Folgers
coffee and bedsheets.</TE>
<TE>   This last holiday season, Kmart cut advertising expenses
dramatically, instead emphasizing its BlueLight Always price strategy
that mirrors Wal-Mart's promise of everyday low prices. But when
Kmart cut back on newspaper circulars, sales plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.1-billion cash infusion announced Tuesday by Kmart gives
the chain breathing room as it tries to reorganize its debts under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. But it's uncertain whether
the package will be large enough to support Kmart's big ad expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is the big problem--where are they going to get all the
money they need?" said John Hansen, a San Francisco bankruptcy
attorney who has represented high-profile retailers. "You need
funding to keep the shelves stocked, but if you don't advertise, you
don't get customers."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart must move to calm vendors that, in recent days, began to
demand cash upfront before making deliveries. "The tightrope that
every vendor walks is making sure you don't continue to ship products
if it turns out that you're not going to get paid," said Dale D.
Achabal, a marketing professor at Santa Clara University.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Kmart can repair its inventory systems and wean shoppers
from the newspaper circulars, the new Kmart management team led by
turnaround veteran Chairman James B. Adamson faces the longer-term
challenge of crafting a solid image for Kmart that won't conflict
with Wal-Mart's role as price leader and Target as the trendy
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart might try to build on its relationship with Martha Stewart
and search out other attractive brands that will lure customers into
its stores. But "building a portfolio of better brands is a lengthy
project," said Jeff Parkhurst, a director with Interbrand, a New
York-based consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   And as Kmart begins to craft its post-bankruptcy advertising
messages, it's likely that Adamson will emerge as a spokesman, much
as Lou Gerstner became the public face of IBM during its
restructuring and Gordon Bethune spoke out for Continental Airlines
after it entered bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Connie Chung Leaving ABC News to Join CNN</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marking perhaps its highest-profile signing of news talent from a
major network, CNN will announce today that Connie Chung is leaving
ABC News to host a prime-time show on the cable news channel.</LD>
<LD>   CNN, a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc., confirmed the deal but
declined to offer specifics. However, Chung is expected to fill a
lineup void created by the departure of Greta Van Susteren, who
hosted the 8 p.m. show "The Point" before jumping to Fox News Channel
earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Hiring Chung represents the latest salvo in a noisy, colorful
battle for on-air personalities between CNN and News Corp.'s Fox
News, which has been cutting into CNN's ratings dominance. CNN has
been aggressively changing the face of its news, hiring Paula Zahn to
host a morning show and bringing Aaron Brown over from ABC to anchor
a prime-time program.</LD>
<TE>   Although Chung scored a coup by landing an exclusive "20/20"
interview last summer with embattled Congressman Gary Condit, ABC
hadn't found her a regular anchor slot. Chung, who joined ABC in
1997, had several months remaining on her contract but the network, a
Walt Disney Co. unit, is letting her leave early.</TE>

<HD>Real Estate Experts Fear  Flood of Vacant Stores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Kmart Corp. shutters hundreds of stores as many analysts expect,
the nation's retail market could be flooded with vacant properties
that will not be easily absorbed. Analysts said that probably will
drive down retail rents in some areas and leave behind a trail of
blight.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy protection
Tuesday, could close several hundred of its more than 2,100 stores as
it tries to get back on its financial footing. Given the nation's
economy and that many retailers besides Kmart had a poor holiday
season, experts are expecting even more retail properties to be
vacated.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart's stores are big, generally 80,000 to 120,000 square feet in
size. And although some abandoned stores may be picked up by Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Target Corp., both of which are planning expansions,
these competitors already have stores that overlap with Kmart in a
number of key markets.</LD>
<TE>   "There's already an excess supply of retail space and this will
exacerbate problems to levels unseen before," said John Melaniphy
III, vice president of Melaniphy &amp; Associates Inc., a retail
consulting firm in Chicago. If Kmart unloads hundreds of stores, he
said, "it's going to be a huge blow to the real estate industry."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, where the economy has been largely
shielded from the worst effects of the downturn, several analysts
agree that any Kmart sites that are vacated probably would be
absorbed fairly quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Some sites could be taken by national chains such as Kohl's Corp.,
which is looking to expand in the region. In addition, with buildable
land in short supply throughout the Southland, some developers could
be interested in converting sites into other uses, such as homes or
warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kmart has not announced any immediate plans for closing
stores, analysts widely expect that older, struggling outlets will be
the most likely candidates to be shut down. On Tuesday, the
discounter said that by declaring bankruptcy, it no longer will be
obligated to pay leases that have not expired on 350 stores that
previously were closed or are being subleased to others.</TE>
<TE>   That move is expected to save $250 million a year, Kmart said.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart stores, which have been in Southern California for more than
30 years, tend to be in older retail districts along major streets.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttered sites could be acquired by other chains, subdivided
and leased to smaller retail tenants, or redeveloped into residential
housing or warehouse space.</TE>
<TE>   If sites are closed, "I don't expect those stores to remain
vacant," said Richard Giss, a retail analyst at Deloitte &amp; Touche in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the uncertainty surrounding the future of Kmart stores,
public officials are wondering about the fate of a huge warehouse
that Kmart had planned to open next month in Mira Loma.</TE>
<TE>   The building, a former Toysrus.com distribution center, was
expected to employ 400 to 500 people. But county officials have not
heard whether Kmart's plans have changed since filing for bankruptcy
protection, said Raymond Smith, a spokesman for Riverside County.</TE>

<HD>J&amp;J, Merck Profits Rise in Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmaceuticals heavyweights Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck &amp; Co. posted
higher fourth-quarter profits, but generic competition and slowing
sales growth of arthritis medicine Vioxx helped stifle results at
Merck.</LD>
<LD>   Along with posting an 18% rise in profit, Johnson &amp; Johnson named
longtime company executive William Weldon to take over as chairman
and chief executive of the maker of Tylenol and Band-Aids. Weldon
succeeds retiring J&amp;J chief Ralph Larsen, who has held those posts
since 1989, and becomes the firm's sixth chairman in J&amp;J's 116-year
history.</LD>
<LD>   CIBC World Markets analyst Mara Goldstein said she was surprised
that Larsen was passing the baton so soon to Weldon, his
pharmaceuticals chief.</LD>
<TE>   "People knew Larsen was going to be stepping down, but it wasn't
expected this year," said Goldstein, who added that Weldon was known
for turning the company's once-sleepy pharmaceuticals unit into a
powerhouse operation.</TE>
<TE>   Merck, the world's third-largest seller of prescription drugs,
posted a 5% rise in profit as cost cutting helped to offset slowing
sales of key drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck reported earnings of $1.86
billion, or 81 cents a share, in line with analysts' estimates. That
compares with $1.76 billion, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Merck reaffirmed that it expects little or no earnings growth in
2002. The company shocked Wall Street last month when it warned that
2002 profit would be flat as generic competitors continued to eat
away at its prescription drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J posted earnings of $1.1 billion, or 36 cents a diluted share,
compared with $936 billion, or 30 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Before special charges, including remaining one-time costs
associated with the company's acquisition of Alza Corp. last year,
earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 39 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   "J&amp;J's results were pretty solid, and in line with expectations,"
said CIBC analyst Goldstein.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares rose $1.29 to close
at $59.29, while J&amp;J's stock slid 58 cents to $59.12.</TE>

<HD>2 Homeowner Insurers Request Hikes</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeowners' insurance premiums in California may continue to spiral
higher after two major insurers requested rate increases this week.</LD>
<LD>   State Farm Insurance Cos., California's largest insurer, requested
a 6.9% rate boost, according to state Department of Insurance filings
made public Tuesday. Regulators approved a 6.9% increase for the
company last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Automobile Club of Southern California applied for a 6.6%
increase.</LD>
<TE>   Requests for rate increases of less than 7% do not require a
public hearing and typically are approved by the Department of
Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   All of the state's largest insurers have requested rate hikes in
the last year, saying their claims costs have risen.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Insurance Group has asked for five rate hikes in the last
two years. Four have been approved and the fifth is pending.
Cumulatively, the requests would boost the insurer's average premium
by 37%.</TE>
<TE>   Allstate Corp. is waiting for review of its 22.3% requested hike.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Restructures TV Unit  to Focus on Software and
Services</HD>
<DH>Technology: About 500 jobs will be affected as the company
moves  away from designing UltimateTV hardware.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY  and ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barely a year after launching its UltimateTV video recorder with
great fanfare, Microsoft Corp. is splitting up the engineering team
behind it and designing no more new versions of the hardware.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the company will focus on developing software and
services for all the major brands of hard-drive-based video
recorders, including UltimateTV, said Bruce Leak, the head of
Microsoft's new TV services group.</LD>
<LD>   The move came as part of yet another restructuring of Microsoft's
troubled TV efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Of about 500 people working on UltimateTV in Mountain View,
Calif., two-thirds will be reassigned to the TV services group and
Microsoft's Xbox team, and the positions of almost 170 will  be
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Leak said Microsoft will continue offering and supporting the
UltimateTV service, which is available through DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   The company recently demonstrated new features for the UltimateTV
software, and Thomson Multimedia still plans an upgraded version of
its RCA UltimateTV receiver.</TE>
<TE>   UltimateTV is one of several brands of personal video recorders,
which store programs digitally on a hard drive instead of VHS tapes.</TE>
<TE>   The main difference between UltimateTV and its competitors,
including recorders from TiVo Inc., Sonicblue Inc. and EchoStar
Communications Corp., is its ability to log on to the Internet for
Web pages and e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of personal video recorders have fallen short of analysts'
expectations, with estimates putting UltimateTV below 100,000
subscribers. By contrast, 1.5 million Xbox game consoles have been
sold since November.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggested that the company was shifting its bets,
counting on Xbox to carry Microsoft's TV technology into homes. But
David Hufford, an Xbox spokesman, said the UltimateTV engineers
assigned to the Xbox team will be dedicated first to cutting the cost
of the game console, not to expanding its functions.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft plans to offer a complete package of software for video
recorders and services that could enhance any manufacturer's
hard-drive-based models.</TE>

<HD>Seles Shoots for Stars, Gets Venus</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She stops Williams' 24-match winning streak,
advances to Australian Open semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The winner had fallen into the Rebound Ace trap before, having pulled
off a memorable victory against her biggest rival, Steffi Graf, only
to go through flat motions in her semifinal against Martina Hingis,
winning only six games.</LD>
<LD>   Monica Seles remembered the celebrate-too-soon lesson from three
years ago at the Australian Open. Which is why she kept her feelings
mostly hidden after Venus Williams netted a forehand on match point
in what had been a ferocious, riveting baseline exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Despite recording her first victory against Williams in seven
matches--also stopping a 24-match winning streak--Seles didn't let
her feet leave the ground Tuesday at the Australian Open. Nor did she
let her smile linger, putting a business-as-usual cast on the
proceedings after defeating the second-seeded Williams, 6-7 (4), 6-2,
6-3, in the quarterfinals in 1 hour 57 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   This left Williams in the position of dictating the potential
compelling story line. She respects Seles, and Williams' mother,
Oracene, was heard saying that she hoped Seles would go on to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I think more than anything she deserved to win and who knows what
will happen?" Williams said. "Maybe she'll take the whole Slam home
and that'll be like an exciting story. She will deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   For the eighth-seeded Seles, it was too early to start talking
about a storybook ending. Her last Grand Slam title came at the
Australian Open in 1996, the lone Slam championship since she was
stabbed by a deranged Graf fan in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Standing between Seles and her 10th Grand Slam title, at least
immediately, is Hingis again in the semifinals. Although Hingis is
12-4 against Seles, Seles has won their last two matches, both in
Southern California in August on a hard-court surface.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, defending champion and No. 1 Jennifer
Capriati will meet No. 4 Kim Clijsters of Belgium in a rematch of
their French Open final last year. Neither had a difficult
quarterfinal today. Clijsters beat No. 7 Justine Henin of Belgium,
6-2, 6-3, and reached her first Australian Open semifinal. Clijsters
was better in almost every area, committing only 15 unforced errors
to Henin's 30.</TE>
<TE>   Henin had trouble adjusting to Clijsters' power, unable to find a
Plan B. Amelie Mauresmo of France appeared to have the same problem
against Capriati, never mounting much of a threat. Capriati, who won
6-2, 6-2, in 65 minutes, is rounding into top form and said she is no
longer troubled by her hip flexors, but opted to keep her legs taped
for protection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty tough to top last year," Capriati said. "It's the
best I ever played. Today, I kind of had that same feeling. I was
focused and concentrated. I played like I was on a mission. Last year
that's how I played."</TE>
<TE>   Seles also rekindled the past with her penetrating groundstrokes.
Typical of this tournament, the winner was the player least injured,
or least infirm. In the morning, Seles had a slight fever and said
she had problems getting air. Williams' aching left knee felt fine,
but she tweaked her right hamstring and left the court for eight
minutes in the first set to receive treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "She called the trainer and I thought, 'Gosh this is going to be
one of those strange matches.' ... It was really weird circumstances
and both of us were fighting a lot of stuff within ourselves," Seles
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to find an appropriate rhythm against Williams, who
seemed to alternate hitting aces (15) or a double fault (10). At
times, her movement was terrific, then at other junctures, she felt
she couldn't make the run and sprayed her groundstrokes, finishing
with 49 unforced errors.</TE>
<TE>   Seles appeared fitter than the last time she played Williams, at
La Costa in August. In her prime, Seles was the dominant force,
raising the standard with the hardest, most accurate groundstrokes.
Since her last Slam victory, Seles has been trying to catch the new
generation, making progress and then sliding back because of
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of former touring professional Mike Sell as her
coach, since June, has helped stabilize her situation. He
acknowledged he was a nervous wreck during the Williams match.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike adds a lot of consistency to my workouts," Seles said. "It's
just really been nice just to have someone that I can count on. I
think that's been the most difficult throughout my career since my
father passed away [in 1998]. It's just whoever would be working with
me, something would happen, and they would have to leave. And it's
tough when you keep changing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sell: "This is a fun time for her. Nobody expected she would
be No. 1 in the world again. I feel and we feel she can."</TE>
<TE>   Sell was asked if he missed the men's tour. "I get my
competitiveness through Monica," he said. "To get her better is my
highlight. She's a workaholic like I am."</TE>

<LD>   The South African veteran was like an old car running on fumes at
the Australian Open, slowly falling apart. First, his ankle went out
and he was forced to default his doubles match. Today, he simply
could not last against ninth-seeded Marat Safin of Russia, retiring
form their quarterfinal after seven games because of torn stomach
muscles.</LD>
<LD>   He was scheduled for a MRI exam and ultrasound later today.</LD>
<TE>   For the record, Safin led, 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's great," Safin said. "I don't have to spend too much
energy on the court and don't have to make a lot of kilometers on the
court, and I can save my energy for the semifinals."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ferreira: "It's very disappointing. When I was warming up
this morning I felt a little twinge, nothing too serious. When I came
out in the first game and in the third or fourth point, I hit my
serve and really felt it pulling and it gradually got worse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that I've had happen three or four times in my
career, so I know what it's all about. I just know there is no
possibility of me carrying on."</TE>
<TE>   Safin, the U.S. Open champion in 2000, will play either No. 7
Tommy Haas of Germany or Marcelo Rios of Chile in the semifinals.
Haas is 2-1 against Safin, and Safin is 2-1 vs. Rios.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, No. 16 Thomas Johansson of Sweden will
face Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic. Neither has played in a Grand
Slam semifinal. Johansson leads their series, 2-1, and won their most
recent match indoors in the first round of Davis Cup last year, in
four sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is going to be completely different story," said
Novak, who beat Stefan Koubek of Austria, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, in the
quarterfinals. "One year ago we played Davis Cup and it was one of
the worst matches in my life in Davis Cup."</TE>

<HD>Court Ruling Boosts Twins and Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In yet another sign that the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos
should live to play on opening day, a Minnesota court Tuesday upheld
an injunction that forbids major league owners from dissolving the
Twins before their Metrodome lease expires.</LD>
<LD>   While owners vowed to appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court, it is
highly unlikely that an appeal could be decided within three weeks,
when spring training camps open.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig last week said owners remained
committed to eliminating teams before the season, refusing to rule
out the improbable scenario of yanking players off the field during
spring training and folding their teams. Selig did not return a call
for comment Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   While owners are not expected to abandon their plan to eliminate
two teams, Selig could announce a one-year postponement of that plan
within two weeks, a source said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That decision could accompany approval of the pending sale of the
Florida Marlins to Montreal owner Jeffrey Loria, after which Selig's
office would assume control of the Expos and run the franchise for
the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a district court
ruling that the Metrodome's operators could suffer "irreparable harm"
if the Twins bought out the final year of their stadium lease rather
than fielding a team. The original injunction was granted 10 days
after owners voted to eliminate two teams before the coming season,
with the Expos and Twins the likely targets.</TE>
<TE>   By postponing that plan for one year, owners could threaten the
elimination of the Marlins, Twins and Oakland Athletics, all in
search of a new stadium and none bound to a lease beyond the coming
season. One of those teams--or the Expos if not folded--also could
move to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The players' union also objected to the owners' plan. The union
contends that, under the terms of the expired labor agreement, owners
cannot eliminate teams without union approval.</TE>
<TE>   A union grievance, currently before an arbitrator, would become
moot if players and owners negotiate conditions for folding teams as
part of a new collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear that contraction is not going to go forward for
next season and rather than fighting everything to the mat, maybe
there's a time to say all right and take another look at their
decision and their course of action," Minnesota House Majority Leader
Tim Pawlenty told the Associated Press.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota's NCAA Problems Not Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minnesota officials hoped their bad times with the NCAA investigators
had ended with Clem Haskins and his disgraced men's basketball
program.</LD>
<LD>   However, new allegations against Minnesota were revealed over the
weekend, but they pertained to the women's program and former coach
Cheryl Littlejohn.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations may be considered minor by the NCAA, and Gopher
officials are hoping they earned some leniency by self-reporting
them.</LD>
<TE>   Among violations reported by Minnesota are Littlejohn arranging or
providing free or reduced-cost housing for prospective
student-athletes; buying four fleece jackets for student-athletes,
and employing the mother of a student-athlete ($250 for housekeeping
services).</TE>
<TE>   Littlejohn is also accused of arranging a $60 loan from a student
manager to a student-athlete, and arranging transportation for
student-athletes and their family members.</TE>
<TE>   This latest mess obscures Minnesota's strong season. The Gophers
are 14-3 under first-year Coach Brenda Oldfield, including victories
in eight of their first nine games for the best start in school
history. The Gophers are 4-2 in the Big Ten after upending No. 5
Wisconsin on Sunday, their first win over a Top 25 team since 1995,
and moved into the Top 25 for the first time in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota will get a hearing with the NCAA on April 14-15. Any
sanctions wouldn't begin until next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the first half of conference play complete, the Pacific 10
clearly can see the mission in front of it.</TE>
<TE>   There are six weeks left--five weeks of conference play and the
first women's Pac-10 tournament--to prove the conference deserves
more than the four teams it usually gets into the NCAA tournament,
and also show the selection committee it doesn't deserve fewer teams
in the field of 64.</TE>
<TE>   Third-ranked Stanford, 18-1 and riding a 10-game winning streak,
is the only lock for a berth even if it doesn't win the conference
tournament and its automatic NCAA slot.</TE>
<TE>   After that, six teams, separated by one game, are fighting for
their NCAA lives; go ahead and subtract California, UCLA and
Washington State from the process unless they produce a miracle in
the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for some teams to break out," USC Coach Chris
Gobrecht said. "It would be nice of the committee to take six or
seven of us, but it's important that something happens in February
that says these teams are the stronger teams in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The conference tournament may be our last resort. But it's not
good if we all stay clumped together."</TE>
<TE>   Others see a need to knock off Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "To have Stanford beaten would get a little more light on
conference," Oregon Coach Bev Smith said. "I would hope we're seen as
a competitive league. But having someone beat Stanford would do more
justice to our league."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Senior Associate Athletic Director Marie Tuite is the
Pac-10 voice on the 10-member NCAA tournament selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   She is up against the Big 12, Southeastern, Big Ten and Atlantic
Coast conferences that dominate the polls. Among her arguments will
be end-of-season finishes, head-to-head competition, common opponents
and win-loss percentages.</TE>
<TE>   A definitive line between the top five conference teams and the
second tier would strengthen Tuite's position.</TE>
<TE>   Which means Arizona State, USC, Washington, Oregon, Arizona and
Oregon State have six weeks to sell themselves to the selection
committee--or spoil it for somebody.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt the tournament is much needed," Washington Coach
June Daugherty said. "Stanford is very good and getting national
recognition. But we're seeing several teams in the Pac-10 coming on
strong. It puts more importance on the tournament."</TE>

<HD>Tyson Shows Teeth Again</HD>
<DH>Boxing: He apparently bites Lewis at news conference  and
might face sexual-assault charges in Las Vegas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Reverting to the savage behavior that once cost him his boxing
license, Mike Tyson bit Lennox Lewis on the leg Tuesday at a  news
conference, according to several of Lewis' representatives, capping
a brawl that left two prominent boxing figures unconscious on the
floor and plans for a Tyson-Lewis matchup in the air.</LD>
<LD>   Police investigators announced later Tuesday they had found
evidence to back up a woman's claim she was sexually assaulted at
Tyson's Las Vegas home in September. No charges have been filed.</LD>
<LD>   In Tuesday's wild scene on the stage of the Hudson Theater in the
Millennium Hotel, Jose Sulaiman, head of the World Boxing Council,
briefly blacked out when he fell, hitting  the back of his head. He
was being evaluated for a possible concussion late Tuesday. Gary
Shaw, Lewis' promoter, lost consciousness for a short time after
being pummeled in  the head as he tried to separate the two fighters.</LD>
<TE>   Tyson emerged with a small cut on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Tyson have signed to meet April 6 at Las Vegas' MGM
Grand Garden Arena, with Lewis to receive $20 million and Tyson $17.5
million. But, in a statement issued after Tuesday's fiasco, Lewis
said, "As a result of today's events, I will evaluate my options
after the relevant boxing commission has ruled."</TE>
<TE>   To fight in Las Vegas, Tyson must obtain a license from the Nevada
State Athletic Commission, which stripped him of his license in 1997
after he bit Evander Holyfield on both ears during  a heavyweight
title match.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the commission weren't ready to say,  before
examining videotapes of the brawl, whether Tyson's actions would
prevent him from getting a new license. Tyson is scheduled to appear
before the commission next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The  news conference, held to formally announce the fight, began
with Tyson walking out stage right. Lewis came out stage left with
the idea that the two would step up to a raised platform and meet eye
to eye.</TE>
<TE>   But when Lewis appeared, even before a spotlight had been thrown
on him, Tyson rushed forward.</TE>
<TE>   A Lewis bodyguard interceded and Tyson threw a left hook at the
bodyguard. As the two tumbled to the floor, Lewis threw an overhand
right aimed at the back of Tyson's head.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the stage was filled with bodyguards, security
people, handlers for both fighters and numerous publicists.</TE>
<TE>   "My motivation for approaching Lewis,"  Tyson said in a statement,
"was to stage a faceoff which, I was told, both camps had agreed to.
I was here to promote a fight, not be intimidated."</TE>
<TE>   The biting, if it did indeed occur, happened at the bottom of the
pile, beyond the view of any camera.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a bite out of Lennox's leg,"  Harold Knight, Lewis'
assistant trainer, said of Tyson. "Lennox has got a gash on his leg.
He's going for a tetanus shot. He's got an open wound."</TE>
<TE>   Said Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada commission,
"Those are unsubstantiated allegations. I'm a football official and
when I try to break up a pileup in football, do I see biting and
grabbing and things you could probably be arrested for if they
happened elsewhere? Yeah. But you can't always tell what happened in
a pileup."</TE>
<TE>   Luther Mack, chairman of the Nevada commission, said he also wants
to examine Lewis' behavior in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told he threw the first punch at Tyson," Mack said. "And
this is Lewis' second time [he wrestled with Hasim Rahman at a news
conference last summer before  to their title fight]. Tyson also has
a history with this type of thing. We are still going ahead with our
hearing and everything will figure in."</TE>
<TE>   In assessing the sexual-assault charges against Tyson, who spent
three years in an Indiana prison after being convicted of rape in
1992, the commissioners will look at the results of a four-month
investigation by Las Vegas police.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there's probable cause to believe a crime occurred,"
said police  Lt. Jeff Carlson, commander of the city's sex crimes
unit. "We're not the attorneys. It's their decision whether to
prosecute."</TE>
<TE>   The case has been turned over to the office of Clark County
District Attorney Stewart Bell. A spokesman for Bell's office said
Tuesday no decision has been reached on pursuing the case.</TE>
<TE>   "You are innocent until proven guilty," Ratner said. "Certainly a
condition could be put on Tyson's license, if it is granted, that
could revoke it if he is convicted."</TE>
<TE>   Given the pace of legal proceedings, there is no chance Tyson
could charged, tried and convicted by April 6.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Tuesday's fiasco, Ratner and Sulaiman decried the overall
pattern of recent months in which there has been one news conference
fight after another. It began with Lewis-Rahman, followed by
featherweights Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera, who fought at
a December news conference in Houston, followed by Oscar De La Hoya
and Fernando Vargas, who got into a shoving match last week at the
Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, this has become part of the sport," Ratner said, "and I
hate it. There is no reason for it. We may have to have separate
press conferences."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sulaiman, "This is not good for boxing. It is time we do
something about it. This is one big demerit for the sport. We have
become a Roman circus, it seems."</TE>
<TE>   After exiting  the  news conference, Tyson took a walk around the
block in midtown Manhattan. It looked like a victory lap. He was
besieged by autograph seekers and well-wishers, slapping him on the
back and cheering him on.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Julius Page scored 21 points, mostly from long range, and Pittsburgh
overwhelmed No. 12-ranked Syracuse, 72-57, Tuesday night at
Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers (17-3, 5-2 Big East) defeated the Orangemen (16-4,
5-1) in their on-campus field house for the first time since 1982-83,
their first Big East season.</LD>
<LD>   Pittsburgh, limiting opponents to a Division I-leading 57 points
per game, reached its defensive average while holding Syracuse 20
points below its scoring average.</LD>
<TE>   "They get everyone involved defensively--their guards rebound, and
they do it as a team," Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh outrebounded Syracuse, 43-18.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Shumpert led the Orangemen with 17 points and James Thues
had 15, but no Syracuse player had more than four rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Cincinnati 54, Saint Louis 50--Steve Logan scored 25 points
at St. Louis and the Bearcats (18-1, 6-0 Conference USA) survived the

<TE>   Jason Edwin had 15 points for Saint Louis (9-10, 3-3).</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati appeared to take control at the end of the first half,
finishing with a 15-0 run for a 30-23 lead.</TE>

three-point range, but Kentucky missed 17 of 33 free throws to keep
Auburn in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn started the second half shooting two for 15 with seven
turnovers, but it still took Kentucky nine minutes to increase its
seven-point halftime lead.</TE>

<DH>At 6 Feet 7, 240 Pounds, Clancy Is the Big Man on the Block</DH>

<LD>If ever anyone seemed destined for a career in football, it was Sam
Clancy.</LD>
<LD>   He chose basketball.</LD>
<LD>   At 6 feet 7, 240 pounds, with the wing span of a pterodactyl and
sporting a shaved head and perpetual scowl, Clancy would seem to be
the prototypical intimidator down low.</LD>
<TE>   His coach once said he was as soft as the Pillsbury Doughboy.</TE>
<TE>   He led an NBA pre-draft camp in scoring and rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy was told he needed to get meaner and probably wouldn't be
drafted until late in the first round at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   And he has taken heat for his brand of silent leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no one associated with USC's basketball program doubts
Clancy's will to win or his mere presence as a major factor in the
Trojans' return to national prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say I'm a simple guy," Clancy said. "I mean, it doesn't take
much to please me. I basically do everything that I do ... for my
mother. She's the reason I'm here. She pushes me every day to go out
and strive to be the best that I can be."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yeah, did we mention that Clancy, the biggest and baddest
enigma of the enigmatic and No. 23-ranked Trojans, is also a
soft-and-cuddly mama's boy?</TE>
<TE>   Things aren't always as they seem with Clancy, the Trojan power
forward who flirted with turning pro last summer before pulling his
name from the NBA draft hat to come back to USC for his senior
season. But there is no doubt that the Trojans wouldn't be where they
are today without their best and most feared player.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, the eldest of three children by Sam Clancy Sr. and Anetta
Harris, was reared in Cleveland while his dad toiled in the NFL's
trenches as a defensive end for 11 years with the Seattle Seahawks,
Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts.</TE>
<TE>   His sister, Samantha, is a freshman at the University of Richmond
and his brother, Samario, is a high school junior with more hoops
acumen than his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got more skill now than I did at the same age and he's got
size-15 feet, so hopefully he grows into those," Clancy said. "My
sister, I'm really proud of her. She's like the brains of the family.
She got [an academic] scholarship to go to Richmond, which is like a
$26,000 school. She got a full ride to go there and she gets straight
A's and I ask her, 'How do you get straight A's? I've been in school
forever and only gotten a handful of A's. How do you get straight
A's?'"</TE>
<TE>   Despite his athletic pedigree, Clancy played only one year of
organized football--as a high school freshman.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Clancy, who also played college basketball at
Pittsburgh, steered his son away from the football and toward
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was playing, he was 6 years old and he had to help me to
the car after every game because of my injuries," said Clancy Sr.,
now a New Orleans Saint defensive line coach. "He played that one
year of football and didn't want to play any more so I just supported
his decision."</TE>
<TE>   Added the younger Clancy: "And I'm not too big a fan of playing
football in that 20-degree weather of Cleveland in the wintertime.
It's no fun to me."</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland cold led him to California.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, a high school All-American at St. Edward High in Fairview,
Ohio, had never been to California when he took his recruiting visit
to USC. He fell in love immediately with the climate and campus.</TE>
<TE>   Having been recruited heavily by traditional powers Cincinnati and
Michigan State, Clancy signed with moribund USC in what was a huge
recruiting coup for Trojan Coach Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ready for a change of scenery in my life," Clancy said. "I
came out here on my visit and it was like a whole other world to me.
And I really liked Coach Bibby and an assistant at the time, Coach
[Dave] Miller. I liked the way they were selling the program."</TE>
<TE>   So sold that some alleged Clancy was paid $25,000 to become a
Trojan. A Pacific 10 Conference investigation found no evidence of
impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   An up-and-down freshman season was followed by a breakout
sophomore year that was derailed by a broken right foot.</TE>
<TE>   But he was free of injury enough last year to lead USC to the
Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament while leading the Trojans in
scoring (17.3), rebounding (7.5), field-goal percentage (.501) and
blocked shots (81).</TE>
<TE>   Clancy put his name in the early-entrant NBA draft list and,
because he did not hire an agent, kept his college eligibility alive.
He said he would definitely leave school, though, if he were
guaranteed to go in the first 17 picks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite leading the Chicago camp in scoring and rebounding, he
could get no such guarantee and returned to USC, partly on the advice
of his dad.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't think, as a father and as a fan, that he was
ready," Sam Sr. said. "I thought he needed his senior year and to get
closer to graduating. Plus he had his own goals still that he hadn't
met yet."</TE>
<TE>   The younger Clancy, a sociology major, has no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably the best thing I could have done," Clancy said.
"Now a lot of NBA personnel guys know who Sam Clancy is and what he
can do. It was good for me to get my name out there."</TE>
<TE>   While Bibby was glad to see his best player return, he has not
spared Clancy any tongue lashings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gotten better skill-wise," Bibby said of Clancy's growth
from awkward freshman to silent senior. "Tougher? No. He hasn't
gotten any tougher and I think that's the only drawback to Sam. He's
a very likable guy, he's very nice and he's the same way on the floor
as he is off the floor, and I think once he gets on the floor he has
to change his personality.</TE>
<TE>   "If he would change and be that mean son-of-a-[gun] that you want
to see, then he would dominate the game every night."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy just smiled at the theory. The All-American candidate has
seemingly turned it on in Pac-10 play, averaging 20.4 points and 8.9
rebounds for the Trojans, who are tied with Oregon for first place at
6-1.</TE>
<TE>   While Clancy's game is a cross between Karl Malone's and Larry
Johnson's, NBA director of scouting Marty Blake said Clancy is one of
the two best "small" power forwards in college ball, along with
Iowa's Reggie Evans.</TE>
<TE>   "Clancy is very aggressive and he has NBA ability," Blake said.
"Where he's going in the draft, nobody has any idea. The thing that's
really going to help him is his aggressiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy's parents divorced when he was 13 and said the divorce had
no real effect on him. And while everything he does is for his
mother, he does have a healthy relationship with his father, even
though he wasn't a fan of his dad's teams.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Sr. saw him play as a Trojan for the first time last January
when Oregon and Oregon State came to town, and Anetta watched him in
the NCAA East regionals in Philadelphia in March.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving at USC, Clancy had the school's sports information
department remove the "Jr." from his name so he could be his own man
and forge his own identity. Anetta, meanwhile, said her son is quiet
by nature.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be something you're not," she said of Bibby's daily
request that Clancy be more of a vocal leader. "I think he's a solid
leader. He's like the power behind the throne. You can feel his
presence.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wasn't my son, he'd be my friend."</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward David Bluthenthal said his former roommate is the
same today as he was in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's changed about him," Bluthenthal said. "He just got
better. I can't say he's been spending more time in the gym ... he's
just gotten more confident, more aggressive. He's still playing video
games on end--Grand Theft Auto and Tony Hawk. That's some video-game
wizardry there."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Clancy's USC legacy will be more than posturing over
the PlayStation. He has a shot at ending his college career as the
Trojans' third-leading scorer, behind Harold Miner and Ronnie
Coleman. Clancy is already USC's all-time leader in blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hate to lose and I just try to do whatever I can to make
my team win," Clancy said. "I'm a very competitive person and I don't
take losing too lightly. I don't like it at all, so my first two
years here were tough."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how tough the last four years would have been for USC
without Clancy.</TE>

<HD>Q&amp;A WITH ROGER CLEMENS</HD>
<DH>He's Not Planning to Retire Soon but Has an Idea What Cap
He'll Wear in the Hall of Fame</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Hiserman</AU>
<BD>Times Senior Assistant Sports Editor</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next season will be Roger Clemens' 19th in the big leagues, but even
as he approaches 40 "The Rocket" shows few signs of slowing down.
With a fastball that's still routinely clocked in the 95-mph range,
he was 20-3 and averaged about a strikeout per inning for the Yankees
last season in winning his sixth American League Cy Young Award.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens keeps a fast pace during the off-season, too. Last
weekend, he played in the pro-am at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic,
and on Monday he was in Las Vegas making an appearance for major
league baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Part of his Las Vegas gig was to "pitch" to a group of
businessmen, tossing easy fastballs over the plate so the "batters"
could say they got a hit off a future Hall of Famer.</LD>
<TE>   Easier said than done. Clemens said one of the executives kept
inching closer to the plate with each swing and miss. "I kept telling
him to step back away from the plate a little, but he just kept
moving in," Clemens recalled. I told [one of the organizers], 'I
really don't want to hit this guy!'"</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Clemens was in Carson, shooting a television
commercial for DirecTV--with the proceeds from his appearance going
to the Roger Clemens Foundation, an organization he and his wife,
Debbie, established in 1992 to support several children's charities.
Before the shoot, he took a few minutes to talk to Times Senior
Assistant Sports Editor Mike Hiserman about the state of baseball,
the Yankees and his career. The only taboo subject: Mike Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Baseball was on a high coming off a great World Series, but
since then fans have been subjected to talk about contraction, Senate
hearings, lawsuits and labor issues. What are your thoughts?</TE>
<TE>   A: We all need to get on the same page, there's no question about
it. The game is just too good right now. [Even so] everyone knows it
couldn't handle another stoppage. I don't think that's going to
happen, but we can't solve [ownership's] problems. Contraction? Well,
I think about the guys that are going to lose jobs and I think about
the people behind the scenes that are going to lose jobs. I dislike
even talking about it. I think everybody saw what was going on in the
Senate, what was going on on TV. We've [asked] many times for
[owners] to give us their books and let's get this thing on the right
page. It's never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Critics who say money buys championships are quick to take
their shots at the Yankees because of the big payroll. How should
baseball level the competitive playing field?</TE>
<TE>   A: As soon as you say that, you have a Minnesota Twins' team
leading its division halfway through the season. A $110-$115 million
payroll doesn't guarantee you success. Obviously [Yankee owner]
George Steinbrenner built his empire in New York and he'd probably
tell other owners to move if they can't run their business properly.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's it like playing for an organization that can afford
players like Jason Giambi, Rondell White, Robin Ventura and Steve
Karsay to help fill any perceived voids in the lineup?</TE>
<TE>   A: It makes me excited to get busy again and start working because
I know I have a lot of guys counting on me to be successful.
Obviously, it'd be different if I thought I was on a club that was
going to lose 100 games. I continue to tell some of these guys who
were [Yankee] farmhands--[Andy] Pettitte, [Derek] Jeter and [Mariano]
Rivera--just how spoiled they are because they don't know the other
side. I've been in the situation that Pedro Martinez is in over there
[in Boston]. You have to win every five days. They're going to wear
him out. He's been hurt the last four years. He doesn't have the body
style I have, that I tried to build because of all that. Here, it's
the opposite. I know if I have a hiccup I got [Andy] Pettitte and I
got [Mike] Mussina and El Duque and now even [David] Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you left Boston after the 1996 season, Red Sox General
Manager Dan Duquette was quoted as saying you were in the twilight of
your career. In the six seasons since, you've won 20 or more games
four times. Were his comments motivation?</TE>
<TE>   A: That story has gotten its mileage. I've told many people, and
some general managers take heed to it, that in our game you have to
look past a guy who can throw 95 miles per hour or hit a ball 400
feet. You look at their character and what they're about. The truth
is going to get told one day.... I've been biting my lip. I wasn't
offered anything back there. [Duquette] tried to make me look like
the villain, and the fans basically turned on me, but that's part of
the game.... Everybody talked about money at that time, but I got an
offer from Colorado that would have made me twice the highest-paid
pitcher. But I told my agent, 'There's not a lot of Hall of Famers
coming out of Colorado.' At least not pitchers. Hitters maybe, if
they stay around enough.... When I went to Toronto, [team owner] Mr.
[Paul] Beeston said he was going to rebuild the team. But then things
there changed a little bit, so I was real fortunate I had an out and
[the Yankees] made the trade for me. The rest, as they say, is
history. Two rings and World Series experiences. The parades that
I'll never forget. Playing in New York now with all the tragedies
that have happened. Gosh, what else? Now having maybe a chance to
chase down 300 [career victories; he needs 20 more].</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your training routine in legendary. What's involved?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's a five-day plan. I'm convinced the amount of [abdominal]
work we do now is what has kept my back strong. When you kick your
leg up and push off, your stomach contracts. I know it's why Andy
[Pettitte], after throwing 87-88 miles an hour, is throwing 94-95
miles an hour. We're doing 600 to 800 abs four times between starts.
We have a program where we're nonstop for about 48 minutes that'll
just wear you out. We had two of the young kids come and join us in
Baltimore and they both threw up. Here I'm 39 and they're 25.
Running, we try and get three miles in under 21 minutes. Andy's 6-5
and 230 and I'm 6-4, 235-237, so we're moving pretty good. As far as
specifics, we kind of keep it to ourselves because I don't want
someone else trying it and getting hurt doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What keeps you at it every day?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's like I told Andy last week when we're working, killing
ourselves, at 7 in the morning. Midway through I looked at him and
said, 'Who y'all think is working right now? You think anyone else is
working right now?' They're not. They're going to be working at 1 in
the afternoon and go for about 45 minutes, and they'll try to get [in
shape] in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A lot of purists talk about the importance of being able to
pitch inside and move people off the plate. Why do you need to do it,
and is it a lost art?</TE>
<TE>   A: The reason for pitching inside is real simple. It makes a
17-inch plate a 24-inch plate. You can expand the plate and expand
the zone and that's what you want to do. But my main thing is--and
this is why people don't get out of the way and they get hit--is that
when I go inside I don't aim the ball, I throw the ball. I turn it
loose. When you do that, if you're an eighth of an inch off, you're
going to hit guys. It's part of the game. They don't apologize when
they hit balls up the middle. I got a bruise here (pointing to a spot
on his left shin) from 10 years ago that's going to be here for the
rest of my life. It looks like somebody hit me with a sledgehammer. I
throw the ball up there 95-96 miles per hour and have been hit by it
coming back at 140 miles per hour. Even your molars hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are your main goals before you retire, and how would you
like to be remembered?</TE>
<TE>   A: Hopefully I can get to 300 [victories]. And if I do it in the
Yankee uniform, that's going to say a lot about what hat I wear in
the Hall. I'll be remembered, hopefully, like some of the guys I've
passed. I still shake my head when I pass a Joe Wood or the Big Train
like I did this past year for strikeouts in the American League.
There are some records that I didn't even know about that our P.R.
guy keeps me aware of and it's very exciting when I get a guy within
reach. I never thought about it much, but now I realize how hard it
was for the guys I'm catching to attain all those strikeouts and
throw those shutouts and get those wins. I want to play 24 or 25
years. This will be my 19th. And the main goal is the same as it's
always been. We're trying to win again.</TE>

<HD>Odom Injury Forces Shorter Rotation</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lamar Odom won't play tonight against the Lakers, which doesn't help
the Clippers' chances for a victory, but does give Coach Alvin Gentry
the shorter bench he has been seeking.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry used only eight players in Monday's victory over the Denver
Nuggets, down from the customary 10 he has employed for most of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Once Odom's sprained right wrist is healed, it's possible that one
(or more) of those eight also will be on the bench.</LD>
<TE>   The players seem to sense that playing time will be tougher to
come by, which Gentry hopes will produce increased competition for
minutes. Gentry was pleased to see shooting guard Eric Piatkowski
record a career-best nine assists in an off-shooting game Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't shoot well," Gentry said of Piatkowski's missing eight
of 11 shots in 40 minutes. "The floor still opened up with him out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski could well be one of the players whose playing time
diminishes, although nothing has been determined.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is so talented and wants to play a lot and probably
deserves to play a lot," Piatkowski said. "There's a logjam at my
spot with Corey [Maggette], Q [Quentin Richardson] and myself. When
things are going well and you're playing a lot, it's great. When it's
not, you're depressed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, who did not score in 17 minutes Monday against Denver,
will try to guard Kobe Bryant of the Lakers tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette drew the defensive assignment in the Lakers' victory Nov.
20 against the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry climbed onto his soap box Tuesday, delivering more praise
for Elton Brand, who had perhaps his finest game as a Clipper on
Monday. Brand, acquired on draft day from the Chicago Bulls, had a
season-best 31 points and took 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "His game is blue collar, but he's got tons of talent," Gentry
said of Brand, averaging 18.5 points and 11.2 rebounds. "You can't
play on guts alone. To go out and average [about] 20 points and 10
rebounds in the West tells me that he's not only a hard worker, but
he's also talented.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I think he can be a franchise player. Not many guys
average 20 points and 10 rebounds. There's Shaq [O'Neal] and Tim
Duncan and not too many others who fit into that category."</TE>

reached, but then team wouldn't have to pay $11.26 million.</DH>

<LD>The Dodgers and pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii are so far apart in
negotiations on a three-year contract that the Japanese left-hander's
agent fears Ishii may not play in Los Angeles this season.</LD>
<LD>   "It's to the point where I may need to go back to Ishii and
prepare him for the possibility of not [playing for the Dodgers],"
said Joe Urbon, Ishii's representative. "You're always far apart at
the beginning of this process, but when you look at the pitchers
Ishii has been compared to, when you consider the Dodgers paid an
$11.26-million posting fee [to the Yakult Swallows for Ishii's
negotiating rights], where we are right now is disconcerting."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers' initial three-year offer last week was believed to be
in the $6-million range. Urbon is believed to be seeking a deal more
comparable to that of Seattle Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, who
last winter signed a three-year, $14-million contract that includes
$7 million in incentives. Seattle paid an additional $13.125 million
to acquire Suzuki's rights.</LD>
<TE>   Kim Ng, Dodger assistant general manager, spoke at length to Urbon
on Tuesday, and the team made its first counter-offer to Ishii, but
that was believed to be less than $7 million for three years, still
far below what Urbon is seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Ishii is going to be surprised and offended," Urbon said.
"It's frustrating, because I don't think we're being unreasonable at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Evans, Dodger general manager, would not discuss negotiations
in detail, but he remains confident the team will be able to secure
Ishii by the Feb. 8 deadline. If the Dodgers don't sign Ishii, they
won't have to pay the $11.26-million rights fee, and Ishii would
return to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every expectation that we're going to sign him," Evans
said. "There's a long way to go. There are no red flags. If there's a
difference in opinion, it's about what we feel his worth is and what
they feel his worth is. The process could take time, but that's
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii went 12-5 with a 3.40 earned-run average last season in
Japan and has a 78-45 career record and 3.38 ERA in nine years. Jim
Colborn, Dodger pitching coach, has compared Ishii to a "scaled-down
version of Randy Johnson."</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation the Dodgers might be factoring the
$11.26-million rights fee into the total value of Ishii's package,
speculation Evans declined to comment on. But that fee goes to the
Yakult Swallows, not Ishii, and Urbon doesn't think that should be
structured into Ishii's deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have a hard time bridging the gap, but it's too important
to throw up your hands and say, 'Forget it,'" Urbon said. "We still
have 17 days. Let's see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers held exploratory negotiations with the agent for
shortstop Pokey Reese on a one-year contract but decided not to make
a serious bid for the former Cincinnati Red infielder because they do
not want to block the path of promising young shortstop Cesar
Izturis, who was acquired this winter from the Toronto Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Andy Ashby, recovering from elbow surgery, is scheduled to
begin throwing off the mound on Feb. 1, and ace Kevin Brown, also
recovering from elbow surgery, is on course to begin throwing off the
mound when spring training starts. ... The Dodgers continue to
explore trades for a closer, with Boston's Ugueth Urbina and Bobby
Howry of the Chicago White Sox as primary targets, but they don't
appear close to any deals. ... Among the non-roster invitees to camp
this spring are outfielder Mark Whiten, utility players Roberto Kelly
and Mike Kinkade and pitchers Dennis Springer and Jesse Orosco.</TE>

<HD>Scratch Hurts McInnis</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Marty McInnis didn't say anything negative after  the Mighty
Ducks' practice on Tuesday, it was easy to determine that the veteran
winger was still bothered about being a healthy scratch for Monday's
4-2 loss to the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, I was aggravated," said McInnis, who probably will
return to the lineup tonight when the Ducks play host to Minnesota at
the Arrowhead Pond. "No one wants to sit out. There are only so many
games in a season. When things aren't going well, you don't want to
be sitting on the sideline watching the guys work out there."</LD>
<LD>   In 49 games this season, McInnis has nine goals, 20 points and a
plus-minus rating of minus-17.  Forgettable numbers, for sure, but
McInnis  isn't the only Duck who hasn't  gotten the job done this
season. But Anaheim Coach Bryan Murray, whose team is 1-10-1 since
Dec. 30, has to start somewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to penalize some guys if they are not playing at a high
level," Murray said. "If a guy doesn't dress, he usually is upset.
... Marty came to see me right away and wanted to know, 'Why am I not
playing?' ... I really liked that."</TE>

<HD>Summerall Steps Down, Not Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Summerall, who has been involved with the NFL as a player and
broadcaster for 50 years, announced Tuesday that the Super Bowl on
Feb. 3 will be the last game he will work with John Madden.</LD>
<LD>   He emphasized he is not retiring from broadcasting, just stepping
down as Fox's lead NFL play-by-play announcer. Summerall and Madden
have been together for 21 years.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Buck, Fox's lead baseball announcer, is expected to be named
Summerall's replacement.</LD>
<TE>   Summerall's announcement answered a lot of questions before they
could be asked during Super Bowl week in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I would be getting a lot of questions," Summerall said,
"and since I had already made up my mind I might as well make the
announcement now."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement has been a year and a half in the making. It was
leaked to reporters in July 2000 that Summerall would be retiring
after the Super Bowl in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But the next day at a news conference at a Century City hotel,
when Summerall was asked why he was retiring, he said, "I'm not
retiring."</TE>
<TE>   This caused embarrassed Fox executives to do an about-face.</TE>
<TE>   "He can do whatever he wants," Fox Sports chairman David Hill said
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The party line since was that the Summerall issue would be
addressed after the upcoming Super Bowl. And whenever asked,
Summerall would say he hoped to remain with Madden.</TE>
<TE>   But Summerall decided about two weeks ago that he would step
aside.</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision was his and no pressure was put on him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was totally my move," Summerall said. "However, I'm not saying
they're not glad I decided to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Although Summerall hinted that he might be headed back to CBS,
where he spent 33 years, he did not rule out staying at Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the possibility of being paired with Troy Aikman,
Summerall, who lives in the Dallas area, said: "Troy is a rising
star, and I'm not sure working with me would be a step up."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall said he met with Hill and Fox Sports President Ed Goren
last week, and also talked with Bob Stenner and Sandy Grossman, who
have been the producer and director on the Summerall-Madden team for
years.</TE>
<TE>   He said he and Madden discussed his decision at length last
weekend in St. Louis, where they announced the Rams' playoff victory
over Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Hill and Goren declined to comment Tuesday, but Goren issued this
statement:</TE>
<TE>   "Pat Summerall is not only a Hall of Fame broadcaster, but one of
the classiest men to ever work in the business. His 50 years as a
player and broadcaster is a record that will never be broken. Quite
simply, for generations of fans, Pat Summerall was the voice of the
NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall had his left knee replaced in March 2000, and in all has
had 10 knee surgeries to correct injuries sustained during his
playing career.</TE>
<TE>   "Health does not play a factor in my decision," he said. "I
haven't felt this good since I quit drinking [11 years ago]."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall played 10 seasons in the NFL as a tight end and kicker
with the Detroit Lions, Chicago Cardinals and New York Giants. He
began broadcasting while still with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall's style is a study in word economy. He uses as few words
as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, a producer on a golf event I was working told me,
'Don't ever forget this is a visual medium. You don't have to tell
people what they see. If I ever hear you say he made that putt,
you're fired.'"</TE>
<TE>   Summerall said that even though the networks are putting emphasis
on attracting young viewers he believes there is still a place for
older announcers.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Chick Hearn, look at Keith Jackson, look at Ernie
Harwell," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Announcers like these take people back in time and provide a
connection between sons and fathers."</TE>
<TE>   As for being emotional about his last game with Madden, Summerall
said that no doubt would be the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone once said I cry at Wal-Mart openings," he said. "So I
guess you can say I might get a little emotional."</TE>

<LD>   Percin then dribbled inside the box, eluded two defenders and
blasted a shot that beat goalkeeper Shaka Hislop.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 4-2 victory and an uninjured Felix Potvin tempered his displeasure,
but King Coach Andy Murray was still upset Tuesday that Kevin Sawyer
of the Mighty Ducks ran his goaltender in the first period of Monday
night's game.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, making no move for the puck, slammed into Potvin at full
speed behind the net as the goaltender retrieved the puck.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, second in the NHL with 175 penalty minutes, was suspended
for five games last month after making a run at goaltender Mike
Vernon of the Calgary Flames, part of a fight-marred game Dec. 8 at
Calgary.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm sure the league will look at it," Murray said of Monday's
infraction, which resulted in a double major for Sawyer and led to
the Kings' first goal. "I don't like to comment on those things. The
league has to deal with that....</TE>
<TE>   "But he's done that twice now. He's already been suspended for it
once. He plays real hard, and I respect what he's trying to do. He's
fighting lots of battles to try and keep a spot in the NHL. But there
are just some things you don't do, and I'm sure [Duck Coach] Bryan
Murray's told him that too.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a ridiculous hit."</TE>
<TE>   Though his head snapped back violently when he was hit, Potvin was
not injured. He seemed to get a kick out of the replay, watching it
repeatedly Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King winger Craig Johnson, who suffered a cut above his right eye
when he took a high stick from Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski,
will sit out Thursday night's game against the Minnesota Wild at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, one of only five Kings to have played in all 49 games, is
enjoying one of his best seasons, with 10 goals and 11 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing a prominent role on our team right now, in terms of
ice time," Murray said. "He's getting power-play time,
penalty-killing time, and he's responded to the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson is expected to return to practice Friday.</TE>

<HD>Fox Says Shaq to Hold Back</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the moments after he nearly finished Brad Miller and changed all
of their lives, Shaquille O'Neal told Rick Fox he would never be
basketball tolerant again.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, others have sensed that O'Neal would show his familiar
restraint.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, it could be years before the incident fades.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he'll go a stretch where he's pretty good," Fox said.
"Then, it'll start to build again, assuming they'll be allowed to
pound on him to the point where he can be injured."</TE>
<TE>   Now that it has been established O'Neal can be pushed, the hard
fouls could come more frequently, Fox said, "in hopes there is a
flare-up."</TE>
<TE>   Fox chuckled at the strategy. "If they look at that tape, they'll
realize Miller was a very fortunate man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's representatives, Mike Parris and Perry Rogers, met Friday
in New York with Commissioner David Stern and league Vice President
Stu Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The conversations were friendly, and O'Neal's people focused on
the greater good of keeping O'Neal healthy and how the league would
benefit from that.</TE>
<TE>   There was no solution gained, as ultimately O'Neal and the game
will sort it out a call at a time, or it won't. That's how they left
it, with a promise to stay in touch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson will coach the Western Conference all-stars if the
Lakers have the conference's best record at the conclusion of
Sunday's games, or if the Laker record is second in the conference to
Sacramento's.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Rick Adelman coached last year's game in Washington and
NBA rules bar the same coach in consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Cotta, Laker strength and conditioning coach, and his wife,
Tracey, on Monday had their first child, a daughter named Greer

<HD>Laker Defeat a Tough One to Defend</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal scores 40 points in return from
suspension, but lowly Nuggets shoot 57% and end 14-game road losing
streak, 107-91.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal pushed himself away from the suspension, three games
for the angry swipe he took at a career's worth of abuse, on Tuesday
night and did what he does, only to have the Lakers do what they do.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal made 17 of 22 shots and scored 40 points, and the Lakers
lost to one of the NBA's sorry franchises, it playing the second of
back-to-back games on the road.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver Nuggets, two months without a road win, shot 57% and
defeated the Lakers, 107-91, at Staples Center. Voshon Lenard scored
29 points and James Posey scored 23 while the Lakers stood around on
defense, watched O'Neal score on offense, and so lost for the fourth
time in six games.</LD>
<TE>   In the spirit of their mercurial season, the Lakers were three
days removed from their impressive victory in San Antonio, six
removed from a mystifying loss at home to Miami, and no more ready
with an explanation for their absolute disregard for the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's hard to figure out which team is going to show
up," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "We laid back and watched Shaq
perform and he was great. He did a fine job."</TE>
<TE>   As this one ended, O'Neal stood slowly from the bench, wiped his
face with a towel, shook his head and trudged into the tunnel. He
again did not speak to reporters, other than to say, "I don't have
anything nice to say, so I shouldn't say it."</TE>
<TE>   By late in the fourth quarter, by the time they defended the
Nuggets with an ounce of energy, it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant was not in the game for four late minutes, when the
Lakers tried a final push. Brian Shaw was in the backcourt with Derek
Fisher. Bryant scored 15 points, making six of 14 shots, and was
closest to Lenard in the fourth quarter, when Lenard scored 13
points.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively he's having trouble out there," Jackson said, "so we
just gave him a little break. I have no fault with Kobe."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers again tested one of the NBA's great mysteries: How the
two-time defending champion could lose to the last-place team in
every division by the middle of January. The Nuggets arrived tied for
last with the Memphis Grizzlies in the Midwest Division, and playing
like it. Since Dec. 21, the Lakers have lost to Memphis, Golden
State, Chicago, Miami and, ta-da, Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't ever experienced that kind of situation before,"
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets had lost 14 in a row on the road and were 3-11 since
Dan Issel resigned, including Monday's 13-point loss to the Clippers
on the same floor. But they scored easily against the Lakers, who are
prone to lethargy against pick-and-roll offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We should just play solid," Rick Fox said, "and respect whoever's
in front of us as someone who's worthy of being in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, it would have been a day for O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   That's the thing about Shaq versus the Nuggets, versus the NBA,
versus the world: The rules are so blurry, or are interpreted as
such.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't tell," Jackson said. "This is a game-to-game
situation. There is nothing that can be delineated out of this whole
thing until we get to the playoffs and get to games where teams
really have to foul as a matter of fact. Then, how are they going to
judge it at that point."</TE>
<TE>   It was all about O'Neal again, back again for the second time in
three weeks. In a month fractured by injury and league discipline,
O'Neal had played six basketball games. From his wounded toe, O'Neal
went to the injured list for five games on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not by design, O'Neal, a tri-captain, did not go to
mid-court before the game to chat with referees. Fox and Bryant, the
other captains, did. O'Neal shot free throws instead, and posed with
a friend's son.</TE>
<TE>   His return came several minutes later, with the crowd eager.</TE>
<TE>   "At center, No. 34 ... " Lawrence Tanter told it, and the place
was happy to have him.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal made four of seven attempts in the first quarter and eight
of eight in the second. He made nine consecutive shots from the end
of the first quarter to the end of the second, and so reached
halftime with 27 points, 20 on dunks and layups.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets contributed to Shaq's big night back by coming in with
no player taller than 6-foot-11 or heftier than 250 pounds. Zendon
Hamilton was that guy, and Nugget Coach Mike Evans started him in the
post.</TE>
<TE>   When Hamilton (who scored a career-high 17 points) tired, Evans
sent Raef LaFrentz after O'Neal, and then Chris Anderson, a spindly,
tattooed, billy goat-bearded version of Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, O'Neal's tolerance was not tested against the Nuggets,
who neither defended his shots nor hacked him excessively. Jackson
said he expected nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to be the same as he was before, where he took
a lot of punishment and went to the line and worked it out at the
line, or whatever," Jackson said. "The process, though, is going to
change a little bit because the review that goes on is going to be a
little more intense."</TE>

<HD>NBA Finalizes $4.6-Billion TV Contract</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: ABC will air 15 games of week, plus Finals,
but most games will be shown on cable outlets ESPN, TNT and a new
network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Al Michaels add the NBA to his resume? Will Marv Albert be
limited to doing NBA games on TNT? Will John Saunders become the new
Ahmad Rashad? Where will Bill Walton end up? Can TNT hold on to
Charles Barkley?</LD>
<LD>   Though the NBA's new six-year, $4.6-billion television contract
finally was announced Tuesday, those are some of the questions that
still have to be addressed.</LD>
<LD>   "We have had no discussions with Al Michaels, the lead announcer
for ABC Sports who would be a great addition to any package," ABC
President Steve Bornstein said Tuesday. "Either have we had any
discussions internally about any announcers."</LD>
<TE>   Decisions on talent have been on the back burner. Bornstein, ESPN
President George Bodenheimer, Turner Sports President Mark Lazarus,
NBA Commissioner David Stern and the other principals involved in
negotiating the contract have been too busy putting together a very
complex deal.</TE>
<TE>   News of a deal came out Dec. 14, but it took more than a month to
work out the details.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a legal Olympics," Stern told The Times. "All of this may
have ruined a holiday, but we are very pleased. From a business
context we have shown a 25% increase, we have obtained a 50% interest
in a new network, and we are now involved with the two largest
integrated companies in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Disney entry of ABC and ESPN will pay  $2.4 billion over six
years in rights fees, and AOL Time Warner will pay $2.2 billion. The
combined average per year will be  $766 million, which is $146
million more than NBC and Turner are paying in the final year of a
four-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the NBA, through AOL Time Warner, gets a 50% interest in a
new cable channel that for now is being called ASN, All Sports
Network.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, industry experts say the equity in the channel
could be worth as much as $1 billion to its two owners.</TE>
<TE>   NBC executives have called the NBA a money loser, but Disney and
AOL Time Warner executives believe it is a money winner because they
are multimedia companies involved in broadcast and cable television,
the Internet, radio and print.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC did a great job on the NBA and it was a great partnership
where both sides benefited," Disney President Bob Iger told The
Times. "Not to take anything away from them, but what helped us
greatly is our multi-platform approach and an overall package that
includes the ESPN aegis and makes us more attractive than a
single-platform owner."</TE>
<TE>   The new contract, which takes effect next season, will:</TE>
<TE>   * Put 15 Sunday game of the week regular-season telecasts on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   * Put the NBA Finals on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   * Put other playoff games on TNT and ESPN, with the conference
finals and conference semifinals being exclusive to those networks.</TE>
<TE>   * Put an exclusive Thursday night doubleheader on TNT, meaning
those games cannot also be carried by local carriers such as Channel
9 and Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   * Put the All-Star game on TNT.</TE>
<TE>   * Put 75 regular-season games on ESPN with no local blackouts,
meaning Laker and Clipper telecasts will appear on both the local
carrier and ESPN. ESPN will have a single telecast on Wednesdays and
a doubleheader on Fridays.</TE>
<TE>   * Put 75 regular-season telecasts on the new cable network.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said the exclusive Thursday night telecasts on TNT will not
reduce the number of local telecasts from carriers such as Channel 9
and Fox Sports Net because ABC and TNT combined will be limited to
the same number of exclusive telecasts (11 per team) that NBC has.</TE>

<HD>Warner Is Only Bruised</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Quarterback Kurt Warner is expected to practice for the St. Louis
Rams today despite rib soreness that required X-rays be taken Monday.
The examination revealed no breaks, only a bruise.</LD>
<LD>   Warner, who will face Philadelphia in the NFC championship game
Sunday, has had a rough few weeks. He has endured lower back pain,
stomach flu and a bruised throat that left him speechless for much of
last week. His back spasms resurfaced during the Green Bay game.
Warner said he probably was dehydrated from getting sick last week.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Yes, the Eagles blitz. Maybe more than any team in the league. But
Warner might be better prepared for it than he was in the opener,
when he was sacked four times for a loss of 26 yards in a 20-17 Ram
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear Kurt all the time saying that he just wishes the whole
practice would be blitz period," tight end Ernie Conwell said. "He
loves the challenge. Sometimes, I think he might get bored with the
typical seven-on-seven drill, where he drops back and the receivers
are running perfect routes and he throws a nice ball in.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is built for the blitz, as far as we don't have checks
at the line of scrimmage. Every play has blitz reads put into it. The
one thing is, in this offense, you have to be willing to trust one
another. The quarterback has to have faith and trust in the line to
know what protection they're going to pick up, who's going to come
free, and know that the receivers and backs are going to make the
right decisions."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ram offense never took its foot off the gas against the
Packers, and Coach Mike Martz now acknowledges he goofed. He lamented
calling plays for Pro Bowl running back Marshall Faulk late in the
fourth quarter. Finally, backup Trung Canidate  trotted onto the
field and replaced Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   "Marshall was a mistake," Martz said. "My whole concept in that
fourth quarter was trying to keep the defense off the field. That's
everything I was thinking about."</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that Martz was simply frustrated, trying to jump-start
an offense that never really got rolling? The Ram defense carried the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to score points," Martz said. "It's a different
train of thought for me. I was just trying to get first downs in
little pieces and run the clock down, and I got so wrapped up in
that. Then I realized he was out there and that we had to get him
out. ... I wish I could tell you there was a reason, but there
wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Steelers play the New England Patriots in the AFC
championship game Sunday--the fourth time in eight years under Bill
Cowher they've reached the conference finals, all at home.</TE>
<TE>   But only once have the Steelers advanced to the Super Bowl with
Cowher in charge--in the 1995 season, when they beat Indianapolis,
20-16, in the AFC championship game before losing to Dallas, 27-17,
in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Even some Steeler fans might be surprised to learn Cowher's .610
overall winning percentage is higher than Hall of Famer Chuck Noll's
.572. But Cowher is 1-3 in AFC championship games or Super Bowls
while Noll was 8-3, losing only in AFC title games to Miami (1972,
1984 seasons) and Oakland (1976).</TE>
<TE>   Under Noll, the Steelers won AFC championship games in the 1974
and 1975 seasons (Oakland) and 1978 and 1979 (Houston). All games
were in Three Rivers Stadium except the 24-13 victory at Oakland in
1974 that served as a start for the Steelers' run of four Super Bowl
titles in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Until that game, the Steelers had never played in a championship
game in the franchise's 41-year history, and they were not expected
to win until the emerging Steel Curtain defense overwhelmed the
Raiders' offense. The Steelers repeated by beating Oakland, 16-10,
the following year on a frozen, wind-swept Three Rivers turf.</TE>
<TE>   Cowher knows what the Steelers need to do Sunday at Heinz Field to
avoid an abrupt end to this surprisingly good season--if only because
he knows what they didn't do in 1994 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we finish this season doing what we intended to do when we
started out, we haven't done anything," Cowher said. "We didn't
finish it in 1994. You remember the 1997 season because you lost to
Denver. You remember the 1995 season because you lost to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "You always remember your last game. And that has to be recognized
that you're only as good as your last game."</TE>

<HD>Dungy Agrees to Coach Colts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Dungy didn't need much time to get a new job.</LD>
<LD>   Eight days after being fired in Tampa Bay, Dungy reached an
agreement to coach the Indianapolis Colts and a formal introduction
is expected today.</LD>
<LD>   Colt owner Jim Irsay said the deal is for five years and will pay
Dungy about $13 million.</LD>
<TE>   "He was by far the best candidate out there," Irsay said. "Tony is
a proven winner and an ideal type leader who we want to represent the
horseshoe."</TE>
<TE>   Colt President Bill Polian said in a statement that he and Dungy's
agent, Ray Anderson, were still working on the deal's final details
Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Irsay said the Colts had engaged in a bidding war for Dungy with
the Carolina Panthers, with whom Dungy also interviewed last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to be outbid for Tony Dungy. He was going to be
a Colt for sure," Irsay said.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy will join the New York Jets' Herman Edwards as the only
black head coaches in the NFL. Irsay said he thought it was
significant that negotiations with Dungy ended Monday, while Dungy
attended White House ceremonies to celebrate the Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "What a great thing for that to happen on Martin Luther King day
because he is the reality of Dr. King's dreams," Irsay said of Dungy.
"I knew we had a coach when he started asking about Pacers tickets."</TE>
<TE>   Dungy, 46, was fired by Tampa Bay last week. The Colts fired Coach
Jim Mora on Jan. 8, primarily because he refused to get rid of former
defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Fangio has since accepted the
coordinator's post with the expansion Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Mora went 32-34 and took Indianapolis to the playoffs twice in
four seasons. The Colts went 6-10 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy was the most successful coach in Buccaneer history, going
54-42 in six seasons. The Buccaneers were 9-8 this season, including
a loss to Philadelphia in the wild-card round.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a simplistic genius," Irsay said of Dungy. "There is no
question that this is the piece of the puzzle that I think is the
final piece."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The head of the NFL's officiating department wants to keep the
rule that led to the replay decision that helped New England beat
Oakland in Saturday's playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't an unusual occurrence," Mike Pereira said. "This
happens several times a year. It's not like this is a fluke that
happens once every 10 years. We discussed it in 1999 and we decided
to keep it just the way it is. I don't think we should change it
now."</TE>
<TE>   The play occurred with 1:47 left in regulation and the Patriots
trailing, 13-10. New England quarterback Tom Brady was hit by
Oakland's Charles Woodson and the ball came loose. It was recovered
by the Raiders, apparently clinching the game for Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   But it was reversed on replay when referee Walt Coleman ruled that
Brady's arm was coming forward and that he had never tucked the ball
completely away. Under the rules, that means it is an incomplete
pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jacksonville Jaguars showed just how intent they are on fixing
their salary cap troubles when they put left tackle Tony Boselli on
the expansion-draft list.</TE>
<TE>   Boselli, a three-time all-pro, was the first draft pick in Jaguar
history, the cornerstone of their franchise. Now, the seventh-year
veteran could become the cornerstone for the Houston Texans, who will
choose players in the expansion draft Feb. 18.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay kicker Martin Gramatica signed a seven-year contract
with the Buccaneers instead of becoming a restricted free agent. ...
Dallas Cowboy linebacker Dexter Coakley was added to the NFC Pro Bowl
roster, replacing Derrick Brooks of Tampa Bay, who is injured. ...
The New Orleans Saints decided against keeping two-time Pro Bowl
defensive tackle La'Roi Glover at $5.5 million next season, so
Glover, who led the NFL with 17 sacks in 2000, might become a free
agent March 1.</TE>

<LD>Mike Richter, playing with a touch of flu, made 35 saves in relief of
his rookie backup and the New York Rangers rallied from a three-goal
deficit to defeat the New York Islanders, 5-4, Tuesday night at
Uniondale, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Theo Fleury scored the winner at 8:02 of the third period,
stealing the puck from defenseman Marko Kiprusoff and racing nearly
the length of the rink for his second goal of the game.</LD>
<LD>   Richter's backup, Dan Blackburn, 18, had his worst game, giving up
four goals in just over five minutes as the Islanders built a 4-1
lead midway through the first period.</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers also got goals from Mikael Samuelsson, Manny Malhotra
and Steve McKenna to end a nine-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Peca, Brad Isbister, Dick Tarnstrom and Adrian Aucoin
scored for the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 1, Philadelphia 1--Martin Havlat scored a fluke unassisted
goal at 7:12 of the third period to give Ottawa a tie at
Philadelphia, ending the Flyers' seven-game home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Havlat's shot trickled off goaltender Roman Cechmanek, but Flyer
defenseman Kim Johnnson tipped the puck back into the net in a
clearing attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Roenick scored for the Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Lalime made 42 saves for Ottawa. Cechmanek had 33 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Atlanta 0--Olaf Kolzig made 27 saves at Atlanta for
his 25th career shutout, and second this season against the
Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   Ulf Dahlen, Jaromir Jagr and Brendan Witt scored.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta outshot the Capitals, 27-23.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Calgary 1--Alexander Mogilny scored twice and had an
assist at Calgary, Canada, and the Maple Leafs ended a five-game
winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jonas Hoglund, Bryan McCabe, Darcy Tucker and Robert Reichel also
scored for Toronto, which moved within one point of the idle Boston
Bruins for the Northeast Division lead.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Curtis Joseph made 28 saves.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, something we can all agree upon.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal took the Staples Center floor Tuesday accompanied
by the first unilateral declaration he has heard in more than a week.</LD>
<LD>   Not all Laker fans were standing, but all of them were cheering.</LD>
<TE>   The message, if not overwhelming, was overwhelmingly clear.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he belongs.</TE>
<TE>   Here, on the floor, in a uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Here, on another Tuesday night in the middle of the January,
against another outmanned Denver Nugget team, trying to win another
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Here, dunking on an alley-oop pass from Derek Fisher, dunking over
Zendon Hamilton, blocking an attempted dunk by James Posey.</TE>
<TE>   Here, not there.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the back of a punch. Not in the middle of a controversy.
Not wearing a sign that portrayed a certain columnist as a frog,
thereby insulting large segments of the amphibian world.</TE>
<TE>   Not on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Never on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not you agree that O'Neal should have thrown the punch
at the back of the head of the Chicago Bulls' Brad Miller on Jan. 12,
leading to a three-game suspension, surely you agree with this:</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers need him not as a sideshow, but a center.</TE>
<TE>   They suffered a stunning defeat to the Nuggets on Tuesday, a
107-91 loss to a team that had not won a road game in more than two
months.</TE>
<TE>   But, for once, nobody was blaming O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   He led everyone on the floor with 40 points and 11 rebounds. He
had five assists and one turnover. He played hard for 39 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so the evening showed that the Lakers can lose to lousy teams
even with their best player. And, indeed, they have previously won
games without him.</TE>
<TE>   But, c'mon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question, it's obvious, everyone knows, he has to be
here," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics from his absence are more revealing.</TE>
<TE>   If you count the Bulls' game, which the Lakers led by three points
with 2:44 remaining when he was ejected, the Lakers were 2-2 while
O'Neal sat.</TE>
<TE>   He may have indeed pulled his punch that grazed Miller's ear. But
it was still hard enough to briefly knock the two-time defending
champions into a .500 team.</TE>
<TE>   And, who knows, his return may have knocked them into the
defensive distraction that led to Tuesday's loss, in which the 41%
shooting Nuggets shot 57%.</TE>
<TE>   "We laid back and watched Shaq perform," said Coach Phil Jackson,
adding, "We didn't get everyone involved."</TE>
<TE>   Agreed Lindsey Hunter: "Yeah, we got caught up in it a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   So it seems obvious, O'Neal needs to behave like a bigger man than
his tormenters because the Lakers are bigger than O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   He loses three games, they can lose a lot more.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, even after Tuesday's game, O'Neal had yet to
indicate to the local media--and by extension, his fans--that he
agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't got anything nice to say yet, so I'd rather not say
anything," he said before the game, declining the umpteenth
reasonable request to provide an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   But then, late in the first quarter, he spoke volumes.</TE>
<TE>   While going for a rebound underneath the Laker basket, he was
tackled by the Nuggets' Raef LaFrentz. While lying on the floor, he
didn't scowl or shout or point. He simply shrugged and climbed to his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Then, showing what will ultimately be his best punch in this
constant fight against flagrant fouls, O'Neal stepped to the line and
made two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   That's all it takes, you know. That's all it will ever take.</TE>
<TE>   Those so quick to applaud O'Neal for a dangerous action are not
giving him enough credit for the smarts and skill to figure out a
better way to retaliate.</TE>
<TE>   He can make the free throws, as he did Tuesday, six times in nine
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [O'Neal] is going to be the same as he was before,"
Jackson said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a lot of punishment, went to the line, worked it out on
the line."</TE>
<TE>   Or, he can make like Karl Malone and work in a couple of legal
licks--elbow, forearm--after a hard foul. He can show teams, as he
showed the Nuggets, that beating on him is as productive as beating
on a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, there are alternatives to the dangerous retaliation of
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, he seemed to find them, which is good.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm expecting him to be upset," Hamilton said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   He was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   While it is still important to get O'Neal's explanation of the
incident--particularly for those ticket-holders who blew big bucks on
two home games without ever seeing him play--apparently this on-court
cool will have to suffice for now.</TE>
<TE>   It is a demeanor that Laker fans should hope to see for the rest
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Because there will be times during these final months that O'Neal
will go to the bench for legitimate reasons.</TE>
<TE>   He will need to go there for his feet. He will go there for his
stamina.</TE>
<TE>   The team simply cannot afford for him to go there again because of
his temper.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal ended Tuesday's game with a cleanly executed somersault on
the way to a successful free throw.</TE>
<TE>   It looked a lot better than a punch.</TE>

<LD>Hart High climbed over Saugus' trees and now sits alone atop the
Foothill League in girls' basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a front line that stood 6 feet 2, 6-1 and 6-1, the Indians
relied on defense and dominating guard play to claim a 43-32 victory
Tuesday at Hart.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman Ashlee Trebilcock scored 18 points and junior Amanda
Patton had 11 points for Hart (18-3, 5-0), whose backcourt outscored
Saugus' guards, 29-2.</LD>
<TE>   Ali Campbell scored eight points and 5-9 forward Brandi Kimble had
11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Defending-league co-champion Saugus (16-3, 3-1), played without
Coach Eric Olsson, who served a one-game suspension after being
ejected from a game last week.</TE>
<TE>   The front line of Julia Bradley (16 points), Jessi Loring (10
points) and Sheridan Arredondo (four points) accounted for all but
two points for the Centurions, who made 14 of 43 shots (32%). Hart,

<HD>'32 Gold Medalist Shea, 91, Is Killed</HD>
<DH>Olympics: He had been excited about watching his grandson
compete at Salt Lake City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Shea became the hometown hero of the first Winter Games on
American soil when he won two speedskating gold medals at the 1932
Lake Placid Games and unwittingly started a family tradition: He
watched his son compete in the 1964 Winter Games and was braced for a
flood of emotions when his grandson carried that heritage to Salt
Lake City next month.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have a right to cry," the patriarch of the first family with
three generations of Olympians told one interviewer. "The pride
that's coming to me will be absolutely priceless," Shea, 91, told
another.</LD>
<LD>   The oldest living U.S. winter Olympic gold medalist died early
Tuesday after a van police said was driven by a drunk driver slid out
of control on a Lake Placid, N.Y., road, striking Shea's car. Herbert
J. Reynolds, 36, of Saranac Lake, N.Y., is facing criminal charges.</LD>
<TE>   The Shea family remained in seclusion Tuesday, but Jim Shea Jr.
issued a statement recalling his grandfather's pride and joy when he
qualified for the U.S. skeleton team, making clear that he will set
his grief aside next month and compete in his grandfather's memory.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew better than most the importance of the Games," the
statement said in part. "I will carry his card in my helmet during
the competition. Regardless of the outcome, I know I will have
succeeded simply by achieving my grandfather's dream of competing in
the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   News of the death cast a pall Tuesday throughout the Olympic
community and the Lake Placid village, where flags were lowered to
half-staff. It was there that Shea's grandfather settled in the
1880s, and where Shea remained a popular figure, taking his daily
walks around the Lake Placid skating oval, the same one he had
starred on 70 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jim Jr. qualified for the Olympics last month on the U.S.
skeleton team, the elder Shea was becoming an Olympic star all over
again--and enjoying every minute of it. Plans were underway to honor
Shea during the next month's opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sitting here right now holding Jack's Olympic tickets," said
Mike Cofrin, a director with U.S. Speedskating, his voice thickening
with tears. "This was going to be the culmination of Jack's life. It
was going to be a special moment for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the national media courted Shea not only as the
head of America's Olympic First Family, but because he also embodied
the Olympic ideal as he offered insight into a dark chapter in sports
history.</TE>
<TE>   After winning two gold medals in 1932, Shea was still the best in
the world four years later when the 1936 Olympics were to be held in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. But Shea, whose father owned a Lake
Placid grocery that served many Jewish customers, refused to go.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he carried the Olympic torch around the Lake Placid
skating oval and then gave a speech that brought tears to the eyes of
many in the crowd of 2,000, recalled Eric Flaim, a four-time
Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack spoke so eloquently about the Olympic ideal," Flaim said
Tuesday. "Jack believes strongly about how he believes in peace and
how he feels the Olympics truly do bring humankind together. He had
those 2,000 people listening to every word. It was very emotional."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Cofrin and Flaim created the Jack Shea Award for a
speedskater who demonstrated the ideals of good citizenship, good
sportsmanship, honor and morality. Shea was given the first award.
Eric Heiden received the second.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the three generations of Shea Olympians filmed a
series of television advertisements for a cellular telephone company.
In it, Shea and Jim Sr., 63, a cross-country skier at the 1964
Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, sing about Jim Jr. to the tune of
War's "Low Rider."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Jr., 33, is then seen humming the same tune while tapping in a
phone number on his cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Fuller, group manager of sponsorships for Sprint, said the
commercial elicited unprecedented positive response. "We'd like to
keep running it and make it a tribute to Jack," Fuller said. "But
that will be up to the family."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shea's first speedskating race, at age 7, certainly wasn't a
portent of the greatness that would follow. He fell only 15 feet from
the starting line. In tears, he was picked up off the ice by local
police chief Tom Black, who told him there would be other races.</TE>
<TE>   When the Winter Games came to Lake Placid for the first time in
1932, the 22-year-old Shea skated past the Scandinavian stars to win
gold in the 500-meter event in 43.4 seconds. That was six-tenths of a
second faster than his idol, Charles Jewtraw, posted in winning gold
in 1924 at Chamonix, France.</TE>
<TE>   "When I stood on that dais to get the gold medal and I heard the
national anthem of the United States, how proud I was to represent my
country, my community, my father and mother, to follow in the
footsteps of Charlie Jewtraw," Shea said in an interview with the
Associated Press in 1990. Shea also won the 1,500 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Shea graduated from Dartmouth after winning his gold medals and
had planned on becoming a lawyer. But with the Depression in full
swing, he couldn't complete law school. Instead, he went home to Lake
Placid and worked at the post office and his father's grocery store
and eventually held several political positions in Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   He was the spearhead for bringing the 1980 Olympics to Lake
Placid--to him, it was like another gold medal. It was at those Games
that Jim Jr., at 13, began to understand his grandfather's love of
the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather was on the Olympic committee, and I saw all the
U.S. hockey games, the 'Miracle on Ice,'" Jim Jr. said earlier this
year at an Olympic media summit. "It was a tremendous inspiration for
me to see all that, and I wanted to be a hockey player. I suddenly
understood the Olympic ideal my grandfather always talked about."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the Shea family, conversations often veered toward
sports and the Olympics. But there was one conversation in particular
that grandfather and grandson recalled in a recent NBC television
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him, 'Gramps, how come you didn't go to the Olympics
after '32?' ... You weren't fast anymore? And he sits up and he goes,
'No. I was fast.' And I said, 'Well, what happened?'"</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the interview, the elder Shea continued the
story.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Jim, 'I did not think that Germany was a proper place to
have the Olympics because what was going on there was a crime against
humanity.'"</TE>
<TE>   It took Jim Jr. awhile to settle upon his winter sporting event.
Hockey didn't work out, and he found bobsledding boring. But the
skeleton, in which the athlete lies on his stomach on a piece of
metal and slides up to 80 mph down an icy hill, caught Jim Jr. by the
heart.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheas celebrated when skeleton returned to the Olympic program
for the first time in more than 50 years. And they celebrated even
more in December when Jim Jr. qualified for the U.S. team--at Lake
Placid.</TE>
<TE>   Shea told the New York Daily News that if Jim Jr., who is a medal
favorite, made it onto the podium in Salt Lake City, "I'm afraid
tears of joy would come down my face," he said. "I think it would be
an emotion that would be above expression."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Sr. told the Associated Press on Tuesday, "Until yesterday, we
were living our dream, and for Dad it didn't happen. But his spirit
will be carried forward by Jimmy."</TE>
<TE>   Shea is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three sons. A fourth
son, Patrick, died in 1978. Shea's funeral will be Friday at 10 a.m.
at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Lake Placid.</TE>

<LD>Despite the blizzard of Arizona points that led to UCLA blowing a
20-point lead and losing by 10 on Saturday, Coach Steve Lavin's
forecast for the Bruins is sunny.</LD>
<LD>   "I am as encouraged and upbeat about my team as I have been in my
tenure," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Lavin pointed to the improved play of freshman point guards Cedric
Bozeman and Ryan Walcott, which, in turn, has enabled Jason Kapono
and Matt Barnes to return to their natural positions.</LD>
<TE>   He likes the improvement in seniors Billy Knight and Barnes, who
have become consistent and prolific scorers. He believes center Dan
Gadzuric is playing well, despite chronic foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty exciting as far as looking into the crystal ball and
predicting what we will be like four weeks from now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the meat of the Pacific 10 Conference schedule looming, Lavin
plans to give generous playing time to his four freshmen, including
guard Dijon Thompson and forward Andre Patterson in addition to the
point guards.</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen throughout the conference are making strong contributions
and Lavin said their growth is a result of their coaches exhibiting
patience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched [Stanford Coach] Mike Montgomery and [Arizona Coach]
Lute Olson and how they stuck with young guys through 20-point
deficits early in the season," Lavin said. "Then they start doing
things to help you win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines, who missed the last two games because of a concussion,
has been cleared to play in Thursday's game against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Hines did not practice Tuesday, and neither did two teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson has a sprained right foot and is wearing a walking boot,
and Gadzuric has flu. Both are expected to play.</TE>

<LD>From UCLA to Arizona to California to Stanford in a matter of five
games, there's no rest for weary USC in Pacific 10 Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the No. 23 Trojans' lot as they return to the Sports Arena
for the first time since Dec. 16 with a two-game homestand against
California Thursday night and No. 17 Stanford Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like I've said all along," Coach Henry Bibby said Tuesday,
"every game is so important; the next game that we play is the most
important game. You have to put so much energy going against both of
those teams.</LD>
<TE>   "And when you can get a victory it's a great win for you beating
any team in the Pac-10. It was a great weekend for us to go to
Arizona and split. If I could do that the rest of the year, I'd be
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby believes that if the Trojans (14-3, 6-1 in Pac-10) can win
their six remaining home games and get close to a split of their last
five road contests, USC could win the regular-season league title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think every team in the Pac-10 is conscious of winning home
games and it's very important that we set the stage at home," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Clancy's climb in the Trojan record book continues: With a
combined 50 points in games at Arizona and Arizona State last week,
the senior power forward passed Gus Williams and Lorenzo Orr for
eighth place on the  all-time scoring list with 1,347 points.</TE>
<TE>   And with 692 career rebounds, Clancy, who has a league-leading
nine double-doubles, is three from passing Orr for No. 10 on the
school's rebounding list.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy had six blocks on the two-game trip to give him 173 for his
career, moving him past Stanford's Tim Young (167), Arizona's Ed
Stokes (167) and Oregon State's Scott Haskin (172) on the Pac-10's
career list.</TE>

<HD>Newborn Boy Found in Trash Bin</HD>
<DH>Crime: The baby suffered skull fractures, but doctors
believe no surgery will be needed. Officials are seeking the identity
of his mother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A newborn boy was recovering Monday after he was discovered in a
Monrovia dumpster hours after his birth Saturday night, hospital
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A man heard what he thought was a kitten while taking out his
trash about 10:50 p.m. He discovered the crying baby wrapped in a
plastic bag inside a trash bin behind an apartment complex in the 700
block of West Foothill Boulevard, according to the Monrovia Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   The baby, only hours old, had been dropped into the bin headfirst,
said Andrea Stradling, a spokeswoman for Huntington Memorial Hospital
in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Nurses at Methodist Hospital in Arcadia, who treated the infant
first, nicknamed him Baby Andrew. He was taken to Huntington's
neonatal intensive care unit Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was treated for skull fractures, hypothermia and
dehydration, Stradling said. Doctors believe that his head injury
will require no surgery, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neurological tests indicated that the infant was healing well, but
he will remain at the hospital for observation for a week. "He's
really a very lucky little boy," Stradling said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new state law, people can leave babies at hospitals
without the fear of facing prosecution. No one, however, has left a
baby at Huntington or Methodist hospitals since they established
procedures for handling such cases, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A door-to-door search for the mother was unsuccessful. Anyone with
information is asked to call Monrovia police at (626) 256-8000.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuits Question Actions of Sheriff's Deputies in 3 Cases</HD>
<DH>Safety: Agency's finding that its officers did nothing
wrong is challenged by lawyers and county supervisors, who OK
settlements of claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three recent cases involving allegations of misconduct by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies have led to the deaths of two men and the
wrongful incarceration of a third, while costing the county $2
million in lawsuits. But none of the more than a dozen deputies
involved have been disciplined, according to records and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   In all three cases, internal sheriff's investigations found that
the deputies did nothing wrong. Those conclusions have been
challenged by civil rights attorneys and county supervisors, who
approve settlements of lawsuits against the Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the cases and their settlements are forcing Sheriff
Lee Baca to demonstrate his commitment to pursuing allegations of
official wrongdoing while still maintaining his fairness in assessing
complaints against his deputies. Those questions can take on a
political cast this year, as Baca is facing reelection, challenged by
two other members of his own department.</LD>
<TE>   The first case cost the county $1.1 million and Bryant Hunter his
life. A deputy driving through Compton shot through the windshield of
his patrol car at Hunter, who was on foot, and there was a brief
chase. Hunter died about a week later from his wounds. Although the
deputy said Hunter appeared to be reaching for a gun when he was
shot, evidence later raised questions about the official account of
the incident.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, Calvin Newburn spent 27 months in state prison
before an appeals court ordered him released, ruling that two
deputies' testimony that they had witnessed him selling rock cocaine
was not credible.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there are the questions that have surfaced regarding
Kevin Evans, a mentally ill inmate who died as 13 deputies tried to
restrain him in a downtown Los Angeles jail complex.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that although those investigations are unrelated, they
raise a consistent concern about the Sheriff's Department. In each
instance, the agency defended its deputies' behavior even as county
lawyers agreed to pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle
legal claims.</TE>
<TE>   Although two of the three incidents occurred during the previous
administration, the lawsuit settlements have been reached under Baca,
who has repeatedly spoken of the need to crack down on wrongdoing in
his agency and created a unique outside monitoring unit to do just
that. The cases are under review by that group, the Office of
Independent Review, headed by former federal civil rights prosecutor
Michael Gennaco.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Baca cautioned against jumping to conclusions
about the conduct of deputies based on litigation. As he and others
noted, lawyers sometimes agree to settlements for strategic or cost
reasons, even when they do not believe their clients have done
anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the public should assume that a lawsuit is
conclusive evidence of wrongdoing," the sheriff said. "The nature of
the cases at hand is complex."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said he would wait for Gennaco's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I pushed hard to have this office created, so we could
learn from our experiences going into court," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   Gennaco said he would look into the actions of deputies as well as
larger questions raised by the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fundamental concern is to prevent tragedies like what have
occurred from occurring" again, he said. "That's not to say that we
won't be making conclusions in these matters on the behavior of some
deputies."</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors referred the cases to Gennaco in the last
three months. Supervisor Gloria Molina, the Sheriff's Department's
most vocal critic on the board, said it may be up to Gennaco to do
what she doubts Baca is able to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The brass doesn't have the courage to stand strong and implement
discipline," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant Hunter</TE>
<TE>   The most recent case settled by the supervisors involves the fatal
shooting of Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   He was walking down Compton Avenue just after midnight on March
12, 1998, when two deputies on their way to work spotted him holding
what they believed was a paper bag containing an open container of
alcohol, according to county and court records. Although the
Sheriff's Department did not patrol Compton at the time, carrying an
open container of alcohol in public violates county law.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies said that they steered their car toward Hunter and
that when the cruiser was 10 to 15 feet away, Deputy Shawn Jones
ordered Hunter to walk toward the car. Then, allegedly thinking that
Hunter was reaching for a gun, Jones pulled his own pistol and fired
once through the windshield, according to district attorney files.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter fled down the street, and Jones fired another shot--this
time through the open driver's door window. His partner, Dennis
Missel, stepped from the car and also fired several shots, according
to legal papers.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies said they thought they saw Hunter hurl an object over
a chain-link fence, then turn the corner. They found him bleeding in
a driveway. Hunter died of blood loss from the single bullet wound
eight days later at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center,
according to a memo from county attorneys. It is unclear which shot
hit him.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators recovered a .357 Smith &amp; Wesson from the area where
deputies said they saw Hunter throw an object.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department found the shooting "in policy." The
district attorney's office declined to prosecute, writing in a formal
rejection notice that Hunter, who had several felony convictions,
might have feared a third strike if the deputies arrested him for
carrying an illegal handgun.</TE>
<TE>   But county supervisors and Gary Abrams, the attorney representing
Hunter's family, cited what they said were several troubling details:</TE>
<TE>   The gun that deputies found and Hunter theoretically carried bore
no fingerprints. Nor did the paper bag or bottle of brandy that
Hunter was reported to have been carrying.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed by Abrams states that a folding knife was found
in Hunter's waistband by Deputy David Auner, who was later charged
with falsifying police reports in a separate incident. He was found
not guilty in that case.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I have is some very strange circumstances, where
there were no prints on anything this gentleman was carrying while
sweating and running," Abrams said.</TE>
<TE>   The case is not the first in which Jones has played a role in a
fatal shooting. The deputy was also involved in the death of Miguel
Ruiz in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a call about a man with a gun outside a house, Jones
and his partner arrived at the Ruiz home in South Los Angeles on Feb.
28, 1994, and saw Ruiz standing in the driveway, pistol in hand,
according to a memo by county attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies said that they told Ruiz to drop the weapon but that
he ran into a house and slammed the door shut behind him, the memo
states. One deputy--it is unclear who--kicked the door open and
stumbled inside, where Ruiz was allegedly pointing his gun at the
deputies. Both officers fired. Ruiz died of his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   But the account of the deputies was contradicted by eight
witnesses, county attorneys wrote. Ruiz's family and neighbors say he
was inside his house when the deputies arrived. Family members say
that deputies kicked in the door unannounced and that Ruiz was rising
from the couch, gun in his waistband, when he was shot, according to
county records.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Gregory Moreno, who represented Ruiz's wife in her
lawsuit against the county, said Ruiz had his gun handy because he
had chased away his daughter's abusive boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   That lawsuit was settled for $425,000. The Sheriff's Department
ruled the shooting appropriate and took no action against its
deputies, according to county documents.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who now works in the department's training division, did
not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   His role in the two shootings has alarmed county supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "This one cries out for a second look," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
said after voting to approve the Hunter settlement last month.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Newburn</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Newburn spent more than two years in state prison after two
deputies told a jury that they had seen him selling crack cocaine on
a corner in the unincorporated Lennox neighborhood in southwest Los
Angeles County, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies said that late on the afternoon of Jan. 22, 1997,
they set up surveillance at a post more than 30 feet away from the
corner where Newburn was allegedly dealing. Their reports indicate
that they watched him move back and forth between a parked truck and
passersby on the corner for about 30 minutes, then detained Newburn
and found crack stored in the wheels of the truck he had lingered by,
according to a memo by county lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Newburn, 30, told a different story. In court papers, he said he
was going to visit a girlfriend with two acquaintances and was
standing outside her house when a sheriff's car pulled up and
deputies pushed them against the fence and began searching them.</TE>
<TE>   When Newburn grumbled that he was going to file a complaint, he
said the deputies asked him if he was on parole, according to court
and county records.</TE>
<TE>   Newburn was the only one of the three men who was arrested. One of
his acquaintances went to the Lennox sheriff's station to complain
about an unlawful arrest and left his number with the watch commander
there, according to Newburn's lawsuit against the county. The man was
never contacted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged Newburn with possession of cocaine base for
sale. His first trial ended in a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   Before his second trial began, Newburn's attorney subpoenaed the
records of communication between the Sheriff's Department's squad
cars to challenge deputies' testimony that they had seen Newburn deal
drugs while conducting surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until closing arguments were about to begin in the
second trial that the department produced the documents Newburn's
attorney had requested, court records state. The trial judge, Stephen
E. O'Neil, refused to allow them to be entered into evidence. Newburn
was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He appealed the conviction and waited in prison for 27 months
while the appeal was considered. In January 1999, the California
Court of Appeal found that the records of communication contradicted
deputies' testimony that they had had Newburn under surveillance. His
conviction was overturned, and he was released.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office declined to refile charges. County
supervisors approved paying $295,000 to settle Newburn's civil rights
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Creamer and Conner, who work in the Special Enforcement Bureau,
did not return calls or messages left with the sheriff's media
office.</TE>
<TE>   The department investigated the case and found that the six
deputies involved did not have formal surveillance training and
failed to document the surveillance. It attributed the discrepancy
between the testimony and the transmission records to "a memory
lapse" and determined there was no policy violation or criminal
intent. Therefore, said a memo from the department to county
supervisors, the deputies were not disciplined. They were given
remedial training on surveillance and testifying in court.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Evans</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Evans, a homeless schizophrenic living in Palmdale, was
arrested by sheriff's deputies in 1999 and transferred to the jail
complex in downtown Los Angeles. Doctors who never entered the jail
to examine Evans directed that all of his limbs be tied down in order
to control him.</TE>
<TE>   When a team of deputies laid him down to restrain him, Evans began
to struggle. Deputies piled on top of him, according to county
records, including a videotape of the restraint, and Evans died.</TE>
<TE>   Once they realized he was dead, the deputies turned off the video
camera and called for paramedics. Several minutes passed before
medical personnel attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators found no wrongdoing by the deputies,
though a nurse did resign and plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of
falsifying a report. Supervisors agreed to settle a lawsuit by Evans'
family for $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   The videotaped death has already spurred one outside inquiry, by
attorney Merrick Bobb, who monitors the Sheriff's Department for the
Board of Supervisors. His report was highly critical of the
department, and its presentation to the board touched off a pointed
exchange between Baca and supervisors, some of whom wanted the
sheriff to take stronger action against the deputies involved. Baca
and the supervisors agreed that Gennaco should look at the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Baca has defended his deputies' behavior in the Evans case,
saying that they did not want to hurt the inmate and that they
followed department policies, which he said have been changed since
the death.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Terrell, the civil rights attorney who handled Newburn's civil
suit, said he hopes that Baca can reduce institutional resistance to
taking responsibility for deputies' questionable actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the impression he wants to make some changes, but he hasn't
been tested yet," Terrell said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Baca stressed that deputies must make snap decisions
on life-and-death matters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sequence of events....When you add it all up, it
doesn't easily wash in the sterile, after-the-fact analysis," the
sheriff said. "When we finish our analysis of these cases, you're
going to find pieces that support what we've done and things that
maybe could have been done differently."</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Claims Client Was Political Pawn</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: He says candidate misled the informant in
bid to build tough image. Candidate calls accuser 'a nut.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election season in full swing, an Oxnard defense lawyer has
accused a candidate for district attorney of boosting his image as a
crime-fighting prosecutor by double-crossing an informant in a murder
case with false promises of immunity.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Joseph O'Neill first made the allegations of
prosecutorial misconduct six months ago in a motion to dismiss murder
charges against Bridget Callahan, 29, who along with two skinhead
gang members is accused of killing a teenage girl in October 1998.</LD>
<LD>   But O'Neill added a new twist to his motion last week, suggesting
in court papers that Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh
intentionally deceived Callahan for his own political gain.</LD>
<TE>   "This sordid pact with the devil," O'Neill wrote, "clearly
indicates that the desire to convict at any price has swapped
hard-won integrity and professional respect for personal benefit and
political reward."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill describes Bamieh's dealings with Callahan as "a scandalous
tale" and "a Faustian bargain for favorable publicity . . . made at
the price of ethics, morality and a soul that quickly disappeared on
a rapid path to Hades."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the allegations Tuesday, Bamieh called O'Neill "a nut"
who has no evidence to back up his claims.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said the supplemental motion filed Friday is riddled with
errors. He also suggested that O'Neill--who in October sent Bamieh a
$100 campaign contribution, which the candidate said he returned--is
trying to drum up publicity about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "If a crazy guy is going to call me names, what am I supposed to
say?" Bamieh said of O'Neill's motion. "Most people in the legal
community wouldn't take this seriously."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's allegations come amid a contested election for Ventura
County district attorney and have already emerged as an issue in the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh and Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten are vying to
fill the seat of retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether authorities improperly coerced Callahan to
talk about the slaying of 17-year-old Nichole Hendrix of Ventura and
whether an agreement that Callahan signed is valid.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan alleges that prosecutors promised her immunity in
exchange for her statements and told her she need not consult a
lawyer before signing the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, she was indicted on charges of first-degree
murder along with the two male skinheads she implicated. She is now
asking a judge to set aside the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of the Ventura County district attorney's office,
the state attorney general recently agreed to prosecute the case to
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. A hearing is set for
March 8, three days after the election.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill alleges that prosecutors acted unethically and devised a
"nefarious scheme" to compel Callahan's cooperation. He has
subpoenaed six prosecutors, including Bamieh and Totten, to testify
about their actions in the Callahan case.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, who was removed from the case after announcing his
candidacy, said he never made a promise of immunity to Callahan and
rejected defense claims that she was coerced.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we did in that case was ethical and proper," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bamieh, authorities tracked Callahan to Arizona to
talk to her about an unrelated murder case and learned she had
information about the Hendrix slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan later voluntarily entered into an agreement to provide
information, according to a transcript of the December 1999
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities thought she had only been a witness to the
slaying, after hearing her version they determined she was culpable
of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said he encouraged his supervisors to let Callahan plead to
a lesser charge based on her cooperation. They eventually offered her
a chance to plead to second-degree murder, but Callahan refused.</TE>

<HD>State Veterans Home to Regain Its Accreditation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state-run veterans home at Barstow, which lost federal approval
and $5 million to operate its skilled nursing facility for sick
military veterans, has passed a series of inspections and is ready to
start accepting patients requiring skilled nursing again, it was
announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The subject of numerous investigations since it opened in 1996,
the desert facility lost its federal accreditation along with its
financial aid 19 months ago because of poor patient care and other
violations.</LD>
<LD>   In one highly controversial case, a former World War II sergeant
choked to death on his lunch, but officials at the California
Veterans Home claimed he suffered a heart attack. The death report by
the coroner, however, said the 76-year-old patient gagged on a chunk
of broccoli.</LD>
<TE>   In July 2000, the federal government decertified the veterans home
as a skilled nursing facility, a decision that cost the state
institution $5 million in federal Medicare and Medi-Cal support and
per diem payments for services provided to patients.</TE>
<TE>   The decertification was based on findings by the state Department
of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   For almost two years, no new patients requiring skilled nurses
have been admitted, although the home has continued to accept new
residents who do not need close medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, who campaigned hard in 1998 for the support of
veterans, said Tuesday that Barstow had "passed all regulatory
hurdles" in inspections conducted in November and January. He praised
the Barstow staff for its efforts to "turn around past difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the state departments of Veterans Affairs and Health
Services said they expect the federal government to give its final
approval soon so that new patients can join the 87 left in the
nursing facility. There are about 112 other residents at Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   It was especially important for Barstow to pass its final
inspections because admission of skilled nursing patients at the
state's third veterans home at Chula Vista depended on the outcome.
No new nursing patients were admitted at Chula Vista while the
Barstow facility was unaccredited.</TE>
<TE>   In Davis' first year in office, the Barstow home became an
embarrassment. He ordered his director of Veterans Affairs, Tomas
Alvarado, to eat, sleep and live at the facility until it got
straightened out. It was later disclosed that Alvarado slept some
nights at a motel, which angered Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when it became clear that Alvarado would not win
confirmation by the Senate, he resigned. In a recent interview, he
accused Davis of failing to "back me up."</TE>

<HD>Bird Tamer Unruffles Pet/Owner Relations</HD>
<DH>Animals: For $100 an hour, 'Bird Whisperer' Ken Globus will
turn a misbehaving parrot or cockatoo into a lovebird.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Got a macaw with an attitude or a parakeet with issues? Have a
cockatiel that only a masochist could love? Ken Globus, who calls
himself the Bird Whisperer, says he can turn them into, well,
pussycats.</LD>
<LD>   His unusual occupation involves breaking through what he calls a
bird's "bubble of fear." In the wild, he said, birds in the parrot
family are prey and tend to be afraid of just about everything.
Globus tries to calm them by making them confront their fears.</LD>
<LD>   He demonstrated his $100-an-hour technique at the home of a
bird-loving friend in Woodland Hills. As a foot-long cockatoo
screeched like a demented rock fan in a nearby cage, Globus
approached Popcorn, another umbrella cockatoo that was in foster care
awaiting adoption. He quickly got the skittish Popcorn, whom he had
never seen before, to perch on his hand.</LD>
<TE>   "Conventional wisdom says, 'Never force a bird,'" said Globus, who
writes screenplays when not taming birds. "I'm completely opposite."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 15 million pet birds in the United States,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "People often buy birds as furniture or artwork--because they're
pretty," Globus said. But many owners soon discover they cannot live
with a screaming cockatoo or a parrot that attacks every time they
try to clean its cage.</TE>
<TE>   Globus always brings the owner into a training session. After all,
he or she is the one who must live with the bird. "It's a very
emotional thing," he said of the process of bringing bird and owner
together. "It's not unusual for there to be tears."</TE>
<TE>   Bird owners seek professional help mostly for biting, screaming,
rivalry with other birds, jealousy of humans and feather plucking,
said Larry Lachman, coauthor of "Birds Off the Perch: Therapy and
Training for Your Pet Bird," to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</TE>
<TE>   Lachman, who has a doctorate in human psychology, said he knows of
only half a dozen people with national reputations for improving bird
behavior, and he was unfamiliar with Globus.</TE>
<TE>   Because bird trainers are unregulated, Lachman said, "it's buyer
beware."</TE>
<TE>   Globus, who has his own Web site (www.thebirdwhisperer.com),
described his method as assertive and hands-on.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the bird to accept handling is essential to making it a
good companion. To do that, Globus turns Popcorn, now considerably
less ornery, on its back, holding it firmly and vibrating his other
hand over it. Popcorn doesn't fuss or struggle, even in this odd
position.</TE>
<TE>   A large cockatoo can come down on a finger like a feathered pit
bull, but Globus is blase about minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I get bitten all the time," he said. "Sometimes I'll induce a
bird to bite me to show the owner how to respond to the worst-case
scenario." His advice: Never pull back or show fear.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles native, Globus got involved with birds 20 years ago.
His parents sold tropical fish, and when they expanded their shop, he
suggested they sell other creatures. They added birds.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned it from the birds," Globus said of his unusual
technique. "I try things, and the feedback from the birds leads me on
the path."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Reitzenstein, long active in the West San Fernando
Valley Bird Society, rescues abandoned parrots and other species.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, she said, she was taking care of a feisty
eclectus parrot named Ruby who repeatedly bit her. She asked Globus
if he could make Ruby behave. "He did it in about an hour, and she
never went back to being horrible," Reitzenstein said. She looked at
Globus and announced, "You're the Bird Whisperer!"</TE>

<LD>Prosecutors charged a suspected gang member Tuesday with murdering a
13-year-old boy while the victim was doing his homework at St.
Andrews Park Recreation Center in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Zaire Paul Dennis, 21, of Los Angeles and another
man entered the center in November and opened fire, killing Marquese
Rashad Prude. The second suspect, Ronnie Winfield, 18, of Los Angeles
was later killed in a gang shooting, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Prude had no gang affiliations, and they suspect
that he was shot because he was the first person the assailants saw.</LD>

<HD>State May Be Broke by June, Connell Says</HD>
<DH>Finance: The controller fears there will be no money to pay
bills and foresees a need to borrow up to $8 billion next fiscal
year. A Davis aide scoffs at warning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Controller Kathleen Connell, who must track
California's cash flow, warned Tuesday that the state will end the
fiscal year with virtually no money to pay its bills, and may have to
borrow as much as $8 billion next year.</LD>
<LD>   Even under Davis' more optimistic view, Connell said, the state
could be forced to borrow $2 billion in the new fiscal year that
begins July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Connell said she expects that the state can borrow using a revenue
anticipation note, a type of short-term loan that is repaid during
the same year it is issued.</LD>
<TE>   "The governor will not be in disagreement that we will need to do
a borrowing," Connell said, adding that she believes the state will
probably need to borrow $5 billion. "It is a question of how much and
when."</TE>
<TE>   Connell is a Democrat, as is Davis. But she has been among the
governor's most persistent critics.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed her comments: "Kathleen
Connell has proved herself wrong in projecting just about everything
about the state's financial situation. We expect this pattern to
continue."</TE>
<TE>   The controller, whose job entails writing checks to cover state
expenses, said the budget that Davis proposed this month
overestimates the amount of tax money flowing to Sacramento by about
$1.4 billion, and underestimates an array of costs, including those
for public schools.</TE>
<TE>   She says the state will need to spend $935 million more than Davis
estimates to fully cover costs of rising enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a multiyear problem," Connell said. "This problem does
not go away in the beginning of July 2003. In fact, we think the cash
situation in July 2003 may be more precarious than it is at the
beginning of this fiscal year."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to her downbeat view of the governor's budget, Connell
predicted that the state won't receive the bulk of the $1.1 billion
that Davis assumes he will get from the federal government for health
care and to help cover costs related to terrorism. The governor is
counting on receiving at least 75% of the request.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said she based her assumptions on a combination of her own
calculations and those of the state's legislative analyst and the
Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   "We will end the fiscal year with virtually almost nothing in the
bank," Connell said, adding that with a budget of $100 billion, the
state should have at least $2.5 billion in the bank at all times.
"Unless we do a financing, we do not have adequate cash to run the
state of California, and in fact we dip into a deficit situation come
next March [2003]."</TE>
<TE>   Connell said the state must sell energy bonds no later than
December to cover the $6.5 billion it spent purchasing electricity
last year.</TE>
<TE>   If the state cannot sell the bonds, it will have to use revenue
anticipation warrants, which are paid off the following year, and
could run the cost of borrowing as high as $8 billion, she said. The
state has not issued a revenue warrant since the recession of the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like you asking for extension on your credit card
payment," Connell said, describing such an action a "black mark."</TE>
<TE>   Rating agencies downgraded California's credit rating during the
energy crisis last year. State officials will meet with executives of
rating agencies this week in an effort to assuage concerns about the
state's credit-worthiness.</TE>

<HD>Nurturing UCLA Women's Asian Roots and U.S. Lives</HD>
<DH>Education: Founded by students of Japanese descent in 1928,
the sorority Chi Alpha Delta is now a cherished pan-ethnic
institution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty years later, Aki Yamazaki still wonders about a box of sorority
papers and mementos she hid in her parents' attic on 29th Place near
Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard. She wonders if the people who
live there now might have come across the box. She wonders how they
would receive her if she knocked on the door of the old house and
explained why she had come.</LD>
<LD>   She'd have to tell them the story of Chi Alpha Delta, which was
organized in 1928 by 14 Japanese American UCLA students who were
barred from Greek sororities.</LD>
<LD>   She'd have to tell them how Chi remained independent, rather than
affiliating with a national sorority. How it became the oldest
continuing Asian American student organization in the country. How an
influx of young women of Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Thai and
Vietnamese heritage in the last three decades has made Chi a
cherished pan-ethnic Asian American organization.</LD>
<TE>   Today, fewer than 10% of the sisterhood's 65 members are Japanese
American, said UCLA political scientist Don T. Nakanishi, who has
supervised students doing research on the sorority.</TE>
<TE>   "The survival of the Chis for nearly eight decades is remarkable,
because [the sorority] has gone through so many difficult historical
periods and demographic transformations," said Nakanishi, director of
Asian American Studies Center at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "No other Japanese American or Asian American student group has
had such longevity."</TE>
<TE>   Every spring on Charter Day, the sorority honors its alumnae, who
sometimes come from across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Chis have tracked down 1,000 alumnae through research
projects, most of which Nakanishi has supervised.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings us a lot of pride in having so much history and being
part of the group," said this year's Chi president, senior Christina
Wu.</TE>
<TE>   With her roommate, Pamela Cheng, Wu has pored over many papers and
photographs in the Chi Alpha Delta archives.</TE>
<TE>   Some photos show serious-looking young Asian women in
flower-pattern dresses and Bermuda shorts at a beach party.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, with a sailor hat perched on her head, is Doris Aiso
Hoshide, now 91 and living in Rockville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The year was 1932. Hoshide had changed her major from education to
geography after completing practice teaching, because a placement
official at UCLA told her Japanese couldn't get teaching jobs.</TE>
<TE>   She still remembers her sorority years as among her most
fun-filled: beach picnics in San Pedro, dinners and teas in homes of
her sorority sisters, socials with young men from the Japanese
American Bruins Club, the only other Japanese American student group
on campus, dancing the fox trot and the Charleston at the Biltmore
and Beverly Wilshire hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Juggling School and Family</TE>
<TE>   As daughters of struggling immigrants living in a narrowly defined
subculture, women like Hoshide had to juggle school and family
responsibilities. Their social life was limited to Japanese churches
and temples, but they yearned to feel "American." The sorority
functions were gifts of fancy that satisfied that longing.</TE>
<TE>   An annual black-tie dinner-dance with the Japanese American Bruins
Club was the social event of the year in the Japanese American
community, said Kiyoshi Patrick Okura, a retired clinical
psychologist in Maryland. He was a founding member of the men's group
and the first Japanese American to play varsity baseball at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "We did things in grand scale," he said. "We wanted to have the
best place. We hired an orchestra. There was so much discrimination,
we wanted to show that we could match anything that [mainstream
groups] could put on."</TE>
<TE>   One year, 1933, Okura and a friend spent the exorbitant sum of $10
on a bouquet of red roses in an unsuccessful effort to persuade
actress Jean Harlow to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Discrimination meant that Chis could not live on campus or have a
sorority house. But the exclusion didn't deter them. After they were
officially recognized by the university in 1929, they got busy
filling their social calendar, raising money for scholarships for
Japanese American students and performing community service.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes of a meeting from that first year noted that a sack of
rice and a basket would be given to needy families for Christmas.
"Names to be gotten from YWCA," the minutes said.</TE>
<TE>   Another entry, dated Dec. 8, 1941, ended: "The monthly dinner
meeting was canceled due to the national crisis. President Roosevelt
declared war on Japan this morning. All activities are temporarily
suspended."</TE>
<TE>   Aki Yamazaki, who lives in Van Nuys with her retired pediatrician
husband, was the president of the sorority that year. Her last act
after Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing internment
for residents of Japanese descent, was to put all the sorority papers
in a box and hide it in her parents' attic.</TE>
<TE>   She hoped to retrieve it when she returned home, but she did not
have the luxury of tracing the past. By the time the war was over,
she was married; her husband--who had gone to war in Europe with the
Army--was a prisoner of war; and their first child had died at birth.</TE>
<TE>   Yamazaki had to leave school just a few credits short of
graduation. Half a century later, in 1992, she was awarded her
bachelor's degree in dietetics at a special ceremony at Royce Hall.
Overwhelmed by emotion, she could not utter a word when she went to
the podium to receive her degree.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the World War II years, when Chis couldn't attend
school because they were interned, the sorority has thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Now as then, Chis don't have a house. Today it is by choice:
Members don't see a need to live in the same house to maintain
friendship and solidarity. They have rejected offers by other Asian
American Greek groups to join them, choosing to remain an independent
sorority identified solely with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Even on campus, where people of Asian ancestry make up 35% of the
student body and there are 75 Asian American organizations, the women
feel what Yamazaki describes as the desire of "birds of the same
feather to flock together."</TE>
<TE>   They share an enduring conflict between traditional Asian values
expounded in the home--such as not tooting one's own horn and holding
back emotions--and the more expressive values of the dominant
American culture.</TE>
<TE>   Said sorority President Wu, a communications and accounting major
who was born in Westwood: "Even though [she and her roommate] were
born in America, [and] a lot of the girls might be third and fourth
generation, we still have the same values and personality traits that
we gain from Asian families."</TE>
<TE>   Wu quietly defied her immigrant parents, who considered pledging a
sorority a waste of time and money. "Sometimes it's hard," she said.
"We're trying to assimilate into the American culture and be
Americans, but at the same time we are trying to make our presence
known."</TE>
<TE>   To her delight, Wu learned after becoming a Chi that some of her
sisters had heard the same superstitions she grew up with, including
the one warning children to eat every grain of rice in their bowl,
lest they end up with an ugly spouse.</TE>
<TE>   "We find that our parents are very similar--very academically
driven," said Nikki Kodama, last year's president.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of comfort can be felt in something as seemingly
trivial as knowing the Japanese word for egg when preparing a
Japanese dish, Kodama said.</TE>
<TE>   She thought the term was tamago, but wasn't sure. A call to a
sorority sister resolved the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Pride in History, Togetherness</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Chis sent Christmas cards to all the alumnae whose
addresses they could find. "It brings us a lot of pride in having so
much history and being part of the group," Wu said.</TE>
<TE>   Chis no longer give a sack of rice and a food basket to the needy.
Instead, they teach reading to students at the predominantly Latino
Magnolia Avenue Elementary School in the Pico-Union district on
Saturdays, do arts and crafts and play with them. They raise money
for breast cancer research. They walk dogs from animal shelters.</TE>
<TE>   They sing Christmas carols at the UCLA Medical Center with an
Asian American fraternity, and help community groups in Little Tokyo
and Chinatown raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   For a faculty tea in 1940, many Chis dressed up in kimonos. Last
month, when the sorority held its 55th annual Christmas party at the
posh Reef-On-The-Water Restaurant in Long Beach, there were a lot of
exposed shoulders and backs.</TE>
<TE>   An outsider would have been amused by the difference. Chis would
have been pleased by the similarities.</TE>

<HD>Cuts Are Weighed at Irvine Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Board may increase class sizes in primary
grades or trim other programs to address a $5.2-million budget
shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine school board members debated late Tuesday whether to increase
class sizes in primary grades and make the high-scoring district
among the first in the state to walk away from a popular class-size
reform program.</LD>
<LD>   Board members said before the night was out they would make that
painful choice or others to address a $5.2-million budget shortfall.
Trustees were also considering trimming more than 20 programs, from
school nurses to music and science classes.</LD>
<LD>   If the board approves all the slated cuts, about 200 teachers, or
more than 15%, could be laid off, said Anne Caenn, president of the
Irvine teachers union.</LD>
<TE>   The board also voted Tuesday, as expected, to close Los Naranjos
Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   "We are writing a sad chapter in the history of this district,"
said board President Steven Choi. "Not just in the district, but in
the city."</TE>
<TE>   Caenn expressed sadness as well. "I don't know if I could make
these decisions," she said. "Tonight, Irvine Unified School District
will change our profile and join the ranks of the average."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 200 parents who attended the meeting said they would
not want to be in the trustees' shoes, faced with tough decisions.</TE>
<TE>   But others, like Vickie Lynn Bibro, castigated the board for
cutting academics while retaining sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I am appalled," said Bibro, mother of several Irvine school
district children. "You're making the wrong choices. . . . It's not
right, and you know it."</TE>
<TE>   Many said, however, that they felt they had little choice but to
abandon the smaller class sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Though the state picks up much of the cost for the 6-year-old
initiative, each year districts must pay a greater proportion for
salaries and extra classrooms as new teachers climb the pay scale
faster than state funding keeps up.</TE>
<TE>   With the state facing budget cuts, Irvine is not the only school
system having trouble paying for the popular but expensive program.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, nearly all of California's 900 eligible school
systems were part of the program, which caps class size at 20, down
from more than 30, in most primary grades.</TE>

<HD>City Approves Funds for 4 Youth Centers</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Council votes to contribute $1 million
toward local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs construction projects.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jackie Dollarhyde shares the plight of many working parents.</LD>
<LD>   Weekday afternoons, her three children call her at work to let her
know they have arrived home from school. She reminds them to do their
chores or homework, but the Thousand Oaks mother is concerned about
the two hours they must spend alone until she can leave her part-time
job as a real estate assistant.</LD>
<LD>   "I hate for my kids to be by themselves," said 41-year-old
Dollarhyde, whose children are 8, 11 and 14. "But I'm not in a
position where I can afford child care."</LD>
<TE>   The situation may get easier for Dollarhyde and parents like her
in the Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks City Council recently agreed to provide $1
million in matching funds toward the construction of four Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs are to be built on the grounds of Sequoia, Colina,
Redwood and Los Cerritos middle schools.</TE>
<TE>   They will provide a number of before- and after-school activities
for students 6 to 18 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 10,000-square-foot buildings is expected to cost about
$700,000. They will go up on vacant land on the existing campuses,
and the first center could open as early as spring 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Conejo and Las Virgenes will own and operate
the facilities, paying the Conejo Unified School District $1 a year
to lease the land.</TE>
<TE>   The youth organization will have to raise at least $450,000 toward
the construction of each center before it receives a $250,000 grant
from Thousand Oaks for each site.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the cost is worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "It will give parents a sense of knowing that, instead of leaving
the middle school and going to the mall or bowling alley, [their
children] are going to a location where there is supervision and
trained personnel," said Thousand Oaks City Councilman Dan Del Campo.</TE>
<TE>   The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in Thousand Oaks will be the first in
Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Others exist in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo, Oxnard, Ventura,
Fillmore and Port Hueneme. The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Conejo and Las
Virgenes also plan to build new youth centers in Oak Park, Agoura
Hills, Westlake Village and Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal is to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 to 2000, the number of delinquency offenses in Thousand
Oaks rose from 39 to 133, including truancy, curfew violations and
possession of alcohol by a minor. Graffiti increased an estimated 88%
in 2001 from the year before, according to Thousand Oaks law
enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Keith Parks, who oversees the Ventura County sheriff's
station in Thousand Oaks, said his office has also noticed increased
recruitment efforts among gang members in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of kids at young ages, especially middle school, is to
test limits, to see what they can do and can get away with," Parks
said. "This will provide an opportunity for those kids to be in a
supervised environment."</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Love, principal of Los Cerritos Middle School, said she
welcomes the clubs' helping parents who need a place to drop off
their children before heading to work.</TE>
<TE>   "Some parents do a long commute and have to leave early," Love
said. "That creates a child-care problem for them in the mornings and
afternoons."</TE>
<TE>   The Conejo Recreation and Park District operates a number of
after-school programs, including the Thousand Oaks Teen Center on
Janss Road. But some parents consider the facility too far a walk for
their children and say no convenient bus service is available.</TE>
<TE>   The park district also offers after-school programs at Sequoia and
Redwood middle schools, where students can do their homework and
receive tutoring. Those programs cost $200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Lindsey, recreation services manger for the recreation
district, said the programs will likely be phased out after the Boys
&amp; Girls Clubs at those schools are built.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just filling a gap right now to provide services to
parents," she said. "I don't know if there is enough of a need to
provide [both]."</TE>
<TE>   Each new club will be staffed by five full-time and 10 part-time
employees, as well as 20 adult volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   The centers will feature a computer lab, homework room, tutoring
room, lounge, kitchen and snack area.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a pool table, board games, exercise equipment and an
activities room where students can listen to music or participate in
arts and crafts. And club members will be able to use the schools'
gym and athletic field.</TE>
<TE>   Club membership will be $15 to $20 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Johnston, chairman of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Conejo and Las
Virgenes, said the centers will have an open-door policy, so that
parents can decide how often their children will visit the
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But he estimates each club will have approximately 1,000 members,
and attract 300 to 400 students each day.</TE>
<TE>   Many Boys &amp; Girls Clubs are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays,
on Saturdays and during summer vacations.</TE>
<TE>   At least once a year, club members from the four schools will meet
as a group with a staff member to establish rules of conduct, such as
how long each student can use a computer or exercise equipment before
giving someone else a turn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for them to feel that it's their club and that
they have a responsibility to maintain it properly, and to live up to
the rules and regulations," Johnston said.</TE>

<HD>Noncitizens Testify They Voted in Compton Election</HD>
<DH>Courts: Witnesses in trial challenging results of mayoral
contest say councilwoman's backers recruited them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight illegal immigrants testified Tuesday in the Compton election
fraud trial that they were asked to register and vote for a
councilwoman allied with mayoral candidate Eric Perrodin in the June
5 election.</LD>
<LD>   Six witnesses said they cast votes for Councilwoman Leslie Irving
in the election, which is being contested by former Mayor Omar
Bradley. The other two said they registered but did not vote.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking through a court interpreter, the eight witnesses told
similar stories of being approached by a Spanish-speaking woman who
urged them to register and to vote for Irving. Four testified that
Irving was with the woman.</LD>
<TE>   Bradley's attorneys have alleged widespread election fraud and are
seeking to have the election overturned. Perrodin ousted Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Gridley, the attorney representing Compton, said he doubted
the witnesses' recollection.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of them had a slightly different story," Gridley said after
court recessed for the day. "Someone came and advocated for the
Irving campaign, but the only consistent testimony is that they spoke
in a language Irving doesn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   The testimony echoed that of two witnesses called in November who
said they were visited at their homes in a trailer park by Irving and
her associates, who directed them how to cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's her," said Araceli Garcia, identifying Irving from a
photograph on a campaign flier. "She was wearing a cap, but it's her.
She was going to help the schools for Compton, so that's why I
signed."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said that Irving did not speak to her, but that "the
Hispanic woman" instructed her to sign voter registration documents.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the eight witnesses said that signatures on voter
registration cards and other election materials were theirs, but that
printed name and address information had been filled out in English
by Irving campaigners.</TE>
<TE>   "They just told me to sign and they would take care of
everything," said Nicolas Soto, who testified that three people who
came to his house in March gave him Irving campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses said they were told their immigration status
didn't matter because the election was being held in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me that every person's house they go to has to sign,"
said Daniel Avila, who identified Irving from two photographs as one
of the women who visited his home.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Hertz, Omar Bradley's attorney, said he plans to call an
additional 10 witnesses today.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the testimony has been that it was Irving and people with
her campaign," Hertz said. "These are not only illegal votes, but
links to offenses against the elective franchise."</TE>

<HD>Site for School Doesn't Pass Test With Neighbors</HD>
<DH>Education: Conflict in Santa Ana is tinged with class,
racial overtones. And the district still has to wrest the lot from a
developer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans to build a state-of-the-art elementary school in Santa Ana have
a group of residents from some of the city's most exclusive and
historic neighborhoods vowing to stop what they see as an
encroachment on their way of life.</LD>
<LD>   "It will destroy the ambience of the neighborhood," said Bill
Eldridge, 57, a resident of Fisher Park, just south of the planned
Lorin Griset Elementary School. "This is the best and one of the few
remaining good neighborhoods in the city."</LD>
<LD>   The district says its planned $12-million campus would accommodate
at least 850 students and ease overcrowding at nearby Santiago
Elementary School. Santiago has 1,100 students, about 500 more than
its capacity. Those students are now being taught in 23 portable
classrooms.</LD>
<TE>   The site, a vacant 9-acre lot between the Santa Ana Freeway and
Flower Street, is surrounded by such upscale neighborhoods as
Morrison Park, Floral Park, Riverview and Fisher Park. Yet the Santa
Ana Unified School District serves some of the neediest students in
the state. Two-thirds of the children qualify for free or
reduced-price lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the issue is a City Council-approved plan to build 36
luxury homes on the site. District officials said they are trying to
negotiate to buy the land from the developer. If that fails, they
said, they could stop the housing development through eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has been tinged with class and racial overtones and
accusations that opponents of the school don't want poor Latino
students in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of the questions raised and comments made had racial
implications and it saddens me," said Kim Gerda, 44, a Floral Park
resident who has two children in the district and supports building
the school. "But there are also kind and tolerant people in this
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% of the district's students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Unified School District has an unusual problem: $330
million for new schools but few places to spend the money.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the district passed a construction bond measure to
build 11 elementary schools and two high schools. So far, officials
have located sites for both high schools but only four elementary
schools.</TE>
<TE>   One of those sites is the proposed location for Lorin Griset
elementary, named after a former Santa Ana mayor. The lot, at 2800
Farmers Drive, once belonged to Farmers Insurance, which had offices
there.</TE>
<TE>   The company sold the land last year to developer Brehm Companies
and the San Diego-based firm received City Council approval to build
the luxury homes.</TE>
<TE>   School officials say they have had their sights on the land for
years, but lost out in the bidding to Brehm because school districts
must perform state-mandated environmental tests on the land before
even making an offer. Brehm officials could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Strict environmental guidelines for school sites and the
increasing scarcity of undeveloped land make it extremely difficult
for the school district to find suitable land, Supt. Al Mijares said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have scoured the district," Mijares told a group of residents
during a town hall meeting last week. The location is ideal for a new
school, he said, and "we can build almost immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The raucous meeting was organized by residents opposed to the
school. They wanted to pose questions to district officials,
including board members John Palacio and Nativo L. Lopez. The group,
Santa Ana Residents for Responsible and Excellent Public Education,
has threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Some of their questions: Why can't the district condemn blighted
apartment buildings and build schools there? How will the district
control traffic? Will the campus be locked after classes so it won't
attract crime? Who will use the school after hours? Will students be
bused from other areas?</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that building on the site of an apartment building
would mean knocking down someone's home, and the district would not
do that. Some in the crowd booed.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic will be less than when Farmers Insurance occupied the lot,
district officials said. More boos.</TE>
<TE>   The district must make the facilities available for public use
after hours by law. Murmurs filled the room.</TE>
<TE>   Few students if any would be bused to the school, district
officials said, because 2,300 elementary pupils in the district live
within a 1 1/4-mile radius of the site.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Garza, 40, a member of the residents group who lives in
Washington Square, accused the district of forcing campuses on
neighborhoods. "We are not opposed to the school. We are opposed to
them coming into our neighborhood to drop off their kids. We want to
enjoy our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Garza and others deny that their opposition is based on
socioeconomics or ethnicity.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's Schoolyard Brawl</HD>
<DH>Education: Class, racial overtones tinge conflict over
planned campus. And the district has yet to obtain the property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans to build a state-of-the-art elementary school in Santa Ana have
a group of residents from some of the city's most exclusive and
historic neighborhoods vowing to stop what they see as an
encroachment on their way of life.</LD>
<LD>   "It will destroy the ambience of the neighborhood," said Bill
Eldridge, 57, a resident of Fisher Park, just south of the planned
Lorin Griset Elementary School. "This is the best and one of the few
remaining good neighborhoods in the city."</LD>
<LD>   The district says its planned $12-million campus would accommodate
at least 850 students and ease overcrowding at nearby Santiago
Elementary School. Santiago has 1,100 students, about 500 more than
its capacity. Those students are now being taught in 23 portable
classrooms.</LD>
<TE>   The site, a vacant 9-acre lot between the Santa Ana Freeway and
Flower Street, is surrounded by such upscale neighborhoods as
Morrison Park, Floral Park, Riverview and Fisher Park. Yet the Santa
Ana Unified School District serves some of the neediest students in
the state. Two-thirds of the children qualify for free or
reduced-price lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the issue is a City Council-approved plan to build 36
luxury homes on the site. District officials said they are trying to
negotiate to buy the land from the developer. If that fails, they
said, they could stop the housing development through eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has been tinged with class and racial overtones and
accusations that opponents of the school don't want poor Latino
students in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of the questions raised and comments made had racial
implications and it saddens me," said Kim Gerda, 44, a Floral Park
resident who has two children in the district and supports building
the school. "But there are also kind and tolerant people in this
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% of the district's students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Unified School District has an unusual problem: $330
million for new schools but few places to spend the money.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the district passed a construction bond measure to
build 11 elementary schools and two high schools. So far, officials
have located sites for both high schools but only four elementary
schools.</TE>
<TE>   One of those sites is the proposed location for Lorin Griset
elementary, named after a former Santa Ana mayor. The lot, at 2800
Farmers Drive, once belonged to Farmers Insurance, which had offices
there.</TE>
<TE>   The company sold the land last year to developer Brehm Companies
and the San Diego-based firm received City Council approval to build
homes.</TE>
<TE>   School officials say they have had their sights on the land for
years, but lost out in the bidding to Brehm because school districts
must perform state-mandated environmental tests on the land before
even making an offer. Brehm officials could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Strict environmental guidelines for school sites and the
increasing scarcity of undeveloped land make it extremely difficult
for the school district to find suitable land, Supt. Al Mijares said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have scoured the district," Mijares told a group of residents
during a town hall meeting last week. The location is ideal for a new
school, he said, and "we can build almost immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The raucous meeting was organized by residents opposed to the
school. They wanted to pose questions to district officials,
including board members John Palacio and Nativo L. Lopez. The group,
Santa Ana Residents for Responsible and Excellent Public Education,
has threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Some of their questions: Why can't the district condemn blighted
apartment buildings and build schools there? How will the district
control traffic? Will the campus be locked after classes so it won't
attract crime? Who will use the school after hours? Will students be
bused from other areas?</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that building on the site of an apartment would mean
knocking down someone's home, and the district would not do that.
Some in the crowd booed.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic will be less than when Farmers Insurance occupied the lot,
district officials said. More boos. The district must make the
facilities available for public use after hours by law. Murmurs
filled the room.</TE>
<TE>   Few students if any would be bused to the school, district
officials said, because 2,300 elementary pupils in the district live
within a 1 1/4-mile radius of the site.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Garza, 40, a member of the residents group who lives in
Washington Square, accused the district of forcing campuses on
neighborhoods. "We are not opposed to the school. We are opposed to
them coming into our neighborhood to drop off their kids. We want to
enjoy our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Garza and others deny that their opposition is based on
socioeconomics or ethnicity.</TE>

<HD>County Home Prices Soar 16%</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The jump last year was the biggest since the
1980s. Sales continued to rise in December and analysts say trend
will continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The price of a typical Ventura County home soared nearly 16% during
the last year, the biggest annual bump since the 1980s, as sales
continued to surge in December and analysts predicted another good
year for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   County home prices rose to a median of $304,000 last month, up
$13,000 from November and $41,000 from the previous year, DataQuick
Information Systems reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Ventura County is now in the '300 Club' for median price [meaning
the median has crossed the $300,000 mark] along with Orange County
and most of the [San Francisco] Bay Area," DataQuick analyst John
Karevoll said.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County's median price--the point at which half the homes
sell for more and half for less--is higher than in all other Southern
California counties except Orange, where the typical home sold for
$332,000 last month. That compares with a statewide median of
$240,000 and a regional median of $247,000.</TE>
<TE>   The county's unit sales total in 2001 also exceeded every other
year since 1988, with 1,360 homes closing escrow in
December--bringing the 12-month total to 16,426. That easily
surpassed the go-go rate of the last two years and nearly doubled the
annual sales of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The market was bolstered by low interest rates, which boosted
buying power, and a shortage of available houses, which gave sellers
leverage, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll thinks the housing market will continue to be a harbor
for investors as the battered U.S. economy struggles to rebound. He
expects houses in Ventura County to increase in value by 7% to 9%
this year, and sales to be nearly as high as in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything still looks strong," he said. "But the rate of
appreciation is probably going to slow down a notch as the luxury
market goes fairly flat. There will be more homes selling in the mid-
and entry-level market."</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom is that sales will slow this year as
interest rates rise, Karevoll said. But he disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any corners being turned yet," he said. "The
indicators just aren't there."</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll said signs of a weakening market can be seen when buyers
borrow higher amounts and household finances are pushed to the brink
to pay the mortgage. Another sign is when sellers are carrying part
of the mortgage themselves because banks refuse. Karevoll sees
neither of those signs now.</TE>
<TE>   "Another stress factor is the foreclosure level," he said, "and
it's about as low as it can go."</TE>
<TE>   Default Rate Slows Over Last 5 Years</TE>
<TE>   About 100 homeowners default on their mortgages each month in
Ventura County, Karevoll said, compared with about 250 a month five
years ago when the market was crawling out of a prolonged recession.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in December underscore the strength of the local market.
While the number of sales was off slightly from the peak in December
2000, prices were up sharply nearly everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Values jumped, in particular, in west and central Ventura, south
Oxnard, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and the Lake Sherwood area near
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Ventura County was alone in its housing boom.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a recession and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, sales
for the six-county region reached 303,425 last year, up from 301,894
the year before.</TE>
<TE>   In percentage terms, Ventura County's unit sales jump of 7.2% was
second in the region only to Riverside County, at 8.4%. That compares
with 1.2% in Los Angeles County and a loss of 7.1% in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ventura County market is strong and stable," Karevoll said.</TE>

<HD>John Jackson, 77; National Heritage Fellow Was Among the
Last Masters of Piedmont-Style Blues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Jackson, 77, one of the last masters of the so-called Piedmont
style of blues singing and guitar picking, who was recognized in 1986
as a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts,
died of kidney failure Sunday at his home in Fairfax Station, Va. He
had liver and lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, who grew up in rural Rappahannock County, Va., never
completed first grade. But he learned a library's worth of music by
ear and recorded nine albums from 1965 to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   His emergence as a performer coincided with a movement to preserve
the unwritten repertoire of Delta and Piedmont blues songs, which had
long been played by gifted itinerant, sometimes uneducated musicians.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't read and write, and I have to keep everything right up
there," Jackson once said.</TE>
<TE>   He sang for presidents and audiences around the world, from
coffeehouses to Carnegie Hall in New York and Royal Albert Hall in
London. The State Department sent him abroad to represent the finest
in American music.</TE>
<TE>   He was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship, the country's
highest recognition in the folk and traditional arts, four years
after it was created.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post critic Geoffrey Himes was impressed with the
mastery Jackson displayed on his final release, "Front Porch Blues"
(Alligator Records).</TE>
<TE>   "Like many an older artist," Himes wrote, "Jackson has pared away
all the unnecessary notes to reveal the essential dialogue between
his gravelly baritone voice and his sparkling, skeletal guitar
lines."</TE>
<TE>   For all his acclaim, Jackson continued to work as a part-time
gravedigger and never saw music as a full-time occupation.</TE>
<TE>   He might share a bill with Pete Seeger and the Carter Family one
weekend and return to the graveyard on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson grew up on a farm, the seventh of 14 children. His parents
were amateur musicians, but he credited a chain-gang convict he knew
only as "Happy" with his earliest guitar training.</TE>
<TE>   As he grew older, Jackson was invited to play at local gatherings.
A violent fight at one country party, at which a man accused Jackson
of stealing his guitar, turned him off to music for years, as did an
increased demand for rock 'n' roll. He eventually became caretaker of
Fairfax City Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   He had long forsaken his musical ambitions, he said, when a bunch
of bored children wandered by one day and asked Jackson to entertain
them with a song. Soon he was giving lessons in the back room of a
gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Perdue, a government employee who had just helped start
the Folklore Society of Greater Washington, stopped at the service
station one day in 1964 and saw Jackson with the guitar.</TE>
<TE>   He coaxed the musician to play Mississippi John Hurt's "Candy Man"
and was immediately struck by his precise rendering of the complex
piece. Perdue persuaded Jackson to play at the old Ontario Place in
Washington, where record label officials often caught top local acts.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Strachwitz, whose California-based Arhoolie label became a
force in roots music, heard one of Jackson's performances and decided
to record him.</TE>
<TE>   They went to Jackson's home and taped him for 11 hours; Strachwitz
paid the musician $150.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, "Blues and Country Dance Songs From Virginia" came
out.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson said he never made enough money from his songs to quit
grave digging.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include three sons, a daughter, seven grandchildren,
five great-grandchildren, a sister and two brothers.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Candidate to Seek Jail Probe</HD>
<DH>Politics: Stites meets with former inmates who claim they
received inadequate medical care while in county custody. Challenger
says Baca has mismanaged finances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A challenger to Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca agreed Tuesday to
take up the cause of two former inmates who claim their medical needs
were neglected in jail.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Sgt. John Stites, who hopes to unseat Baca in the March5
election, said he will ask the sheriff to open an investigation into
the cases of James Stern and Marco Cardona, both of whom have filed
claims against the county.</LD>
<LD>   Stern said he went blind in one eye after being denied eyedrops
and other medical care, and Cardona said jail nurses refused for 10
weeks to give him prescription muscle relaxants to control his
cerebral palsy.</LD>
<TE>   Baca did not return calls seeking comment. He has refused to
debate his challengers and has resisted direct confrontations with
either of them.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Wilson, an attorney for the two inmates, is pressing
their case partly by attempting to enlist the aid of Baca's two
challengers, Stites and Sheriff's Sgt. Patrick Gomez. Gomez attended
a news conference with Wilson and Stern last month.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Stites held an informal "fact-finding" meeting to
determine the extent of the problems alleged by Stern, 37, and
Cardona, 41.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that he does not represent the department,
Stites said: "Issues like this are something we need to listen to. We
need an increased budget to support medical care for the inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Stites, who is on leave from his job until after the election,
said the sheriff has mismanaged the department, spending money on
"nontraditional" law enforcement and failing to focus on basics. For
instance, he complained that Baca is not allocating enough money to
patrol areas of the county.</TE>
<TE>   When the East Los Angeles sheriff's station was searching for the
so-called Haircut Bandit recently, Stites said supervisors there had
to seek help from three other stations.</TE>
<TE>   Stites, who ran for sheriff in 1994 and received 7% of the votes
cast, said he has serious questions about the department's budget and
the way the sheriff is spending it.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing from the two inmates, Stites said that, if elected,
he would allocate more money to health care in the jails.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, who was held for about eight months on a grand theft
charge, described what he said was a series of missteps by jail
nurses and others who refused to prescribe and provide him with
eyedrops and other medications for his glaucoma. At one point, he
said, he was admitted to the Los Angeles County Medical Center, where
a doctor mistakenly believed Stern was there for treatment for colon
cancer. His vision problems worsened during his time in jail, he
said, to the point where he is now blind in one eye and has extremely
blurred vision in the other.</TE>
<TE>   Cardona, who was held for about five months on child support and
domestic violence charges, said he was denied a visit to the doctor
for nearly three months. He said it was only after a newspaper
reporter began asking questions that he was allowed to see a doctor
and receive his medication.</TE>

<HD>Defense Names Rubin Case Informant</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Lawyers identify the man after the JDL president
and a top aide plead not guilty. Prosecutors are angry at disclosure
and express worry for man's safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government's confidential informant in a bomb plot case
against two Jewish Defense League leaders was identified by defense
lawyers Tuesday, upsetting prosecutors who expressed concern for his
safety.</LD>
<LD>   The defense attorneys said that Danny Gillis, a 22-year-old former
Navy enlisted man, set up Irv Rubin and Earl Krugel in hopes of
wresting control of the organization from them.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors bristled with annoyance at the disclosure, which
occurred during a sidewalk news conference outside federal court in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   However, they did not dispute that Gillis implicated Rubin and
Krugel in a plot to blow up the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los
Angeles, the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and the San Clemente
field office of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista), who is of Lebanese
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, the JDL's national chairman, and Krugel, the organization's
West Coast coordinator, pleaded not guilty Tuesday before a federal
magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   One of Rubin's lawyers, Peter Morris, told reporters afterward
that Gillis "is a crazy man who had a vendetta against Rubin." He
repeated earlier defense claims that Rubin and Krugel were entrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner, the lead prosecutor in the
case, listened quietly as the defense lawyers attacked Gillis by name
outside the court. Afterward, Jessner confronted Morris about
identifying Gillis, telling him "that's not the way things are done
here."</TE>
<TE>   Jessner declined to comment further, but Thom Mrozek, a spokesman
for the U.S. attorney's office, said:</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can to ensure the safety of
informants who provide important information to our investigations,
and publicizing their names could easily compromise the safety of
this or any other informant."</TE>
<TE>   Morris, a former federal prosecutor, said he saw nothing wrong
with revealing Gillis' name, which, he noted, would have surfaced
during future court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer said witnesses will testify that Gillis boasted
that he planned to "take down" Rubin and Krugel and assume control of
the JDL.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said the FBI became Gillis' unwitting tool.</TE>
<TE>   Public records reveal only scant details about Gillis: He is 22,
served in the Navy as an enlisted man, and registered as a member of
the American Independent Party during the 2000 general election. His
last known address was a Northridge condominium.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, a person identifying himself as Danny Gillis posted a
statement on the Internet defending the JDL, saying the organization
"has gotten a bad rep over the past years. Now we are trying to
change that.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not bad people and we don't like to cause trouble, but
sometimes to get rid of evil people you have to do evil things," the
statement reads.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Stone, a longtime JDL member, said outside court Tuesday
that he had met Gillis at a fund-raiser in 1999. Stone said Gillis
asked if the JDL sold drugs and also told Stone that he knew how to
make bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In a court affidavit filed after Rubin and Krugel were arrested,
FBI Agent Mary Hogan said the informant was recruited into the JDL by
Rubin and Krugel when he was a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   The informant, she said, had committed previous criminal acts on
behalf of the JDL, including building and placing a bomb at an
unidentified mosque. The affidavit gave no details.</TE>
<TE>   The document said the informant contacted the FBI after he was
invited to a meeting with Rubin and Krugel on Oct. 19 to discuss
bombing Arab religious and political institutions.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, the informant agreed to wear a concealed
transmitter and attended about a dozen subsequent meetings, mostly
with Krugel, to plan the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's case rests largely on tape recordings of those
meetings. Copies were recently turned over to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jessner told reporters Tuesday that the tapes will show that "the
defendants were not entrapped."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said that they are analyzing the tapes, but that
it is clear that Gillis masterminded the alleged plot.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin and Krugel were arrested Dec. 11 after the informant dropped
off five pounds of explosive powder--the final component for a pipe
bomb--at Krugel's home in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, each defendant could be sentenced to more than two
life terms without the possibility of release.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, 56, and Krugel, 59, are being held without bail in solitary
confinement at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center. Their trial
is scheduled to start March 19.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Teacher Faces Molestation Trial</HD>
<DH>Crime: Now serving time in an unrelated federal
pornography case, Paul Kreutzer is accused of lewd conduct with
girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 36-year-old woman has accused her fifth-grade science teacher of
molesting her as a child.</LD>
<LD>   The woman testified in a Van Nuys courtroom last year that at age
10 she told the principal at Our Lady of Peace school in North Hills
that Paul Kreutzer had molested her.</LD>
<LD>   The principal spanked and derided her until she said she was
lying, the woman said.</LD>
<TE>   After that she didn't think much about Kreutzer, she said. His
arrest in March 2000 on federal child pornography charges, however,
sparked her childhood memories, she testified. She talked to
authorities, and more criminal charges were filed against him.</TE>
<TE>   She is one of nine women, most now in their 30s, and a teenage
girl who have accused Kreutzer of molestation, said Deputy Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson. They are expected to
testify that Kreutzer, 63, molested them as children.</TE>
<TE>   He is charged with 31 counts of lewd conduct with a child under 14
in crimes dating to 1968. If convicted, the former president of the
Santa Clarita Historical Society faces up to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "This is without a doubt the most horrendous case that I have had
the opportunity to handle in my 20 years of doing this kind of work,"
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash said last
February, after presiding over the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection began Tuesday in Van Nuys before another judge,
Barry A. Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The former teacher, who worked in San Fernando Valley public and
parochial schools for nearly three decades, is serving 30 months in
prison on the unrelated federal pornography case. Kreutzer was
dismissed by the Los Angeles Unified School District on Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has declined to comment on alleged offenses that
occurred while Kreutzer worked in Catholic grade schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the molestation case, at least five of his alleged victims said
Kreutzer befriended unsuspecting parents to gain access to their
daughters. Most of the alleged crimes occurred while the girls were
between 10 and 13.</TE>
<TE>   Among the alleged victims are two Vietnamese sisters who
immigrated to the United States in 1975 and lived with Kreutzer to
help them better assimilate into their new community, according to
Kreutzer's lawyer and the two women. A few students went on overnight
camping trips with him.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer taught one of his alleged victims to folk dance and paid
for another's piano lessons, according to transcripts of the
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Rose Reglos, said her
client denies all the criminal allegations. "He didn't do it," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Reglos said Kreutzer had "very close relationships with some of
these girls," especially the Vietnamese sisters, who lived with him
for years and called him Daddy.</TE>
<TE>   "He treated them like his children," she said, even helping to pay
their college tuition.</TE>
<TE>   For years after they left his home, they continued to call him
whenever they needed help, financial or otherwise, Reglos said. "He
still loves them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very painful for him," she said. "He doesn't understand why
this is happening."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest in the group of alleged victims, who is now 44, said
she met Kreutzer in 1968 through the folk dance group he organized
that met on Saturdays at Holy Redeemer school in Montrose.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest, who is now 15, testified that Kreutzer molested her
in 1996 while he was a teacher at Sunland Elementary School. She said
Kreutzer told her to disrobe while playing "Simon Says" at his house,
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Several allegations involve the Vietnamese sisters who moved into
Kreutzer's one-bedroom La Crescenta apartment in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters had left Saigon with their parents and a brother on
April 29, 1975, and headed to the United States. After living in
refugee camps, they settled in Montrose.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer met the girls' family through Holy Redeemer Catholic
Church and offered to help them assimilate into the community,
according to his lawyer and testimony by the older sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to live with him because my parents felt that it was a
good opportunity since he was tutoring us in English," the woman, now
35, testified last year at the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the girls took turns sleeping in a twin bed with
Kreutzer, who the older sister testified would touch her while she
slept.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1977, they moved with Kreutzer to a mobile home park in
Canyon Country, where they were later joined by their youngest
sister.</TE>
<TE>   There, according to testimony, the alleged sexual abuse escalated.
The youngest sister, now 32, testified that she shared a bed with
Kreutzer for five years, as the touching progressed to intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   "We would usually take showers with Paul....We would all be naked
and he would shower and shampoo us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another alleged victim testified that Kreutzer bathed her.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who had had back surgery and wore a body cast, said
Kreutzer regularly bathed her at her own home and molested her there,
with her parents in another room.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the allegations involve six girls who attended Our Lady of
Peace School in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Two women recalled separate overnight school trips when they were
10, saying Kreutzer forced them to sleep in his station wagon and
molested them.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim who is now 36 accused him of having a sexual
relationship with her that included intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't make me feel uncomfortable because at the time I
thought that I was special," she testified last year.</TE>
<TE>   She said Kreutzer would take her to the beach and out to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   One day during recess, she recalled in court, she told friends
about her relationship with Kreutzer.</TE>
<TE>   The principal, a nun, then confronted her. The principal called
her "a filthy little lying girl" and coerced her into changing her
story, the woman testified.</TE>
<TE>   "After being spanked and lectured and spanked and lectured, I gave
in and said that I was the liar," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A classmate testified that Kreutzer molested her on a school
outing and her mother told school officials.</TE>
<TE>   That woman, also now 36, said in court that the same principal
made her confront Kreutzer with the allegation; then she was scolded
for spreading rumors about her fifth-grade teacher.</TE>

<HD>Discount Stores Fight It Out, Penny by Penny</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Iwould have bet money that I'd be eaten by worms before Kmart ran
into trouble because other stores were selling cheaper. But now we
have the news that the Blue Light discount chain has rolled over.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart apparently lowballs Kmart on price and Target beats it on
quality. I haven't figured out where Costco fits into this, but my
guess is that one day we'll have just one discount chain with stores
the size of Jupiter, and everyone will drive to them in Ford
Excursions.</LD>
<LD>   I stopped going to Kmart when they brought in the Martha Stewart
Everyday line because I knew in my heart that Martha would never
enter a Kmart. Same with Kathie Lee Gifford, who had her name on a
line of Third World sweat shop clothing.</LD>
<TE>   But I'm here to tell you that if the Orange County town of La
Habra is any indication, the death of Kmart will not be the end of
discount shopping in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   An old friend named Lee Quarnstrom recently retired to La Habra
and began making daily explorations around this bargain-hunter's
paradise. He saw a Dollar Tree store and a 99-cent store too, but
that was just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   You've got to come look at this place, he told me one day. There's
a raging discount war, and the combatants include a 98-cent store, a
97-cent store and a 96-cent store.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need to bring a fistful of dollars," said Quarnstrom,
former editor of Hustler magazine and a columnist for a less
reputable outfit (the San Jose Mercury News). He was also one of Ken
Kesey's merry pranksters.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend of mine had a joke about a guy standing at an
intersection with a 99-cent store on one corner and a 98-cent store
on another corner, trying to decide whether to go for quality or
quantity."</TE>
<TE>   At the 96-cent-and-up store, owner Tony Nguyen promised: "This is
the best price you'll find."</TE>
<TE>   "But we have items they don't have," clerk Suong Luu retorted at
the nearby 97-cent store, which is next to the Pay 'n' Save and a
store that's apparently named 5 T-shirts for $10. Then there's the
Best For Less store, which is having a "Blow-Out Sale!"</TE>
<TE>   Quarnstrom, by the way, bought a pair of Dr. Dean Edell reading
glasses at the 97-cent store and swears by them. I bought a can of
Ajax at the 96-cent store and a scented Virgin Mary car freshener at
the 98-cent store.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what else to say, except that one of these little
shops opens and another one wants to go a cent cheaper," said Colleen
Smith, an office assistant at the Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. And I haven't yet ruled out the possibility of shaking up
the whole town by opening my own 95-cent store.</TE>
<TE>   There's a big population of low-income immigrants in La Habra, and
that's one explanation for the discount craze. But I wondered if
there was more to it, so I stopped into Casket Discounters, near the
Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone dies and the family goes to a mortuary, and all sorts of
things go through your mind," said salesman Arthur Quintero. "You
say, 'This is Mom, do we really want to save money on the casket?'
The fact is, you don't have to pay the prices they're asking. We've
got all the same caskets here for 20% to 70% off, and you don't have
to feel guilty about it."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a good business plan for now. But what happens when
Costco starts selling caskets?</TE>
<TE>   Smith, of the Chamber, says there's a Wal-Mart coming to La Habra
in May, along with a Sam's Club and possibly even a Costco.</TE>
<TE>   It won't matter to Sara Moreno, who does her shopping at the 99
Cents Plus store. She was checking out with three helium-filled
balloons for a birthday, a decorative gift bag, two boxes of 32-count
Valentine cards, tissue paper and a comb, all for $6.94.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get these prices at Target or Kmart," she said, "nor
can you get this kind of service."</TE>
<TE>   "We like to make the customer feel comfortable, like family," said
the clerk.</TE>
<TE>   People want bargains, shopper Tina Spanley said at the Dollar
Tree, which is not far from Ross Dress for Less. "Target, Wal-Mart
and Kmart don't have snack foods for a dollar, like they have here.
And look at this oven cleaner. It's not the name brand, Easy Off, but
for a buck? I'd try it for a buck, because Easy Off is 5 dollars."</TE>
<TE>   As La Habra's biggest booster, Quarnstrom likes to think that the
town is a post-Kmart look at American retail, and he welcomes bargain
hunters from far and wide.</TE>
<TE>   We had lunch at Lilly's, which was running a special. A tamale,
enchilada, taco and soft drink, all for only $3.99.</TE>
<TE>   It was first-rate food, but I had the sinking feeling that the
same deal was available somewhere else for $3.98.</TE>

<HD>John Love, 85; Was Colorado Governor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>John A. Love, who went from a political unknown to become Colorado's
36th governor and later the nation's energy czar, has died. He was
85.</LD>
<LD>   Love died Monday in Aurora after a long illness, his family said.
A Republican, Love became governor by beating Democratic incumbent
Steve McNichols in 1962.</LD>
<LD>   Regarded as a political moderate during his first term, Love was
reelected in 1966 and 1970. Until Love, no Colorado governor had
served more than six years.</LD>
<TE>   In 1973, he quit to become then-President Nixon's first energy
czar. Less than a year into the job, he resigned, citing frustration
with the Nixon administration over the growing Watergate scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Born on a farm near Gibson City, Ill., Love moved to Colorado
Springs with his family when he was 3. He earned his bachelor's
degree from the University of Denver in 1938 and his law degree from
the same school three years later.</TE>
<TE>   He was a lawyer for the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
before entering the Naval Aviation Cadet Program at the start of
World War II. The day he was awarded his pilot's wings, he and the
former Ann Daniels of Colorado Springs were married.</TE>
<TE>   Love served in the Pacific, flying in the Black Cat Squadron, so
named because its planes were black Catalinas assigned to night
missions. He was twice awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to practice law in Colorado Springs, he was drawn to
politics. He was president of the El Paso County Young Republicans,
the county executive committee and the state central committee.</TE>
<TE>   In Love's early gubernatorial career, many legislative veterans of
his party considered him a political novice and tried to bypass him.
Once, he sided with Democrats in a successful drive for a larger
state budget.</TE>
<TE>   His wife died in 1999. He is survived by three children, including
Rebecca Love Kourlis, who sits on the Colorado Supreme Court.</TE>

<HD>Stanley Marcus, 96; Shaped Store Into Icon of Opulence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Marcus, a Harvard MBA graduate who turned a family-run
women's apparel store into a pioneer of high-end retailing and
extravagant gift-giving, died Tuesday in Dallas. He was 96.</LD>
<LD>   The chairman emeritus of Neiman Marcus, a company synonymous with
opulence and highbrow tastes, was hospitalized Sunday and died with
family members at his side, a spokeswoman for Stanley Marcus
Consultancy told the Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   His daughter, Jerrie Smith, told the Dallas Morning News that
Marcus died of "old age" at Zale Lipshy University Hospital. "He died
gently," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Known as the "merchant prince of Texas," Marcus spent 50 years at
Neiman Marcus, shaping fashion and retail trends while helping
transform Dallas from its early rough-and-tumble image into an
international shopping destination. In 1938, Marcus originated the
Neiman Marcus Awards, considered the Oscars of fashion, introducing
what are now household names such as Christian Dior and Muccia Prada.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus, fondly known to employees as "Mr. Stanley," kept a simple
philosophy for the business: "I do believe the best is discernible to
the observant eye."</TE>
<TE>   Of German and Jewish descent, Marcus was born in Dallas on April
20, 1905, to Minnie and Herbert Marcus, who along with his sister and
brother-in-law, Carrie and Al Neiman, opened their first store in
downtown Dallas in 1907 with $25,000 from the sale of a sales
promotion business.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus began working at the store in 1926, shortly after receiving
his master's degree in business administration from Harvard's
business school. Twenty-one years old at the time, his first duties
including working as a salesman in the store's women's apparel
section.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his first year at the store that he introduced
weekly fashion shows, the first of its kind by a department store in
the United States and the first of a number of pioneering moves by
the legendary retailer. The oldest of four children, Marcus
eventually rose through the ranks, getting promoted to secretary,
treasurer and director of the company, a new position that included
managing the sportswear shop. In 1949, Marcus was named president of
the company as it launched its boldest move yet to open a branch
store in suburban Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Under Marcus' direction, Neiman Marcus was the first to offer
personalized gift wrapping for customers and started a Christmas
tradition of selling exotic his-and-her gifts, which continues today.
The first his-and-hers category debuted in the 196Os with a pair of
Beechcraft airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The company was the first retail apparel store outside New York to
advertise in national fashion magazines and in 1953 prompted Vogue
magazine to describe the store as "Texas with a French accent."
Indeed, early Neiman Marcus customers included cowboys, Indians and
women from rural outposts where land had yielded oil and newfound
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "As far back as 1934, Marcus realized that his greatest
competition was from leading retailers in New York and San
Francisco," the American Advertising Federation said as it inducted
Marcus into the Advertising Hall of Fame in 2000. "Defying
conventional wisdom, he boldly pursued a national advertising
campaign for his local store with two ads in Vogue and in Harper's."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the company operates 32 Neiman Marcus stores nationwide,
from Beverly Hills to Honolulu, as well as two Bergdorf Goodman
stores in New York. It also publishes a popular catalog that has
featured custom-made Lexus convertibles, a helicopter in Neiman
Marcus colors and $2.5-million necklaces.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who sold extravagance, his tastes were pragmatic and
simple. Asked a few years ago to define elegance, Marcus replied:
"It's the antithesis of sumptuousness. It's understanding that what
is right for one occasion at 8 o'clock in the morning is wrong for 8
o'clock at night. If you visit airports, particularly, you see the
antithesis of elegance. People wear everything from bikinis to
sleeveless tank tops.... I think a sense of appropriateness is
probably the best qualification for elegance."</TE>
<TE>   Although Marcus had retired from the company in 1975, he continued
to provide business advice and consultation, working five days a week
and showing up at his office wearing custom-made suits. He also
founded his own publishing house, SomeSuch Press, and was an avid
collector of miniature books.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus is survived by his wife, Linda Cumber Robinson; a son,
Richard; two daughters, Wendy Raymont and Jerrie Smith, along with
numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>A Reprieve for Air Museum</HD>
<DH>History: Lovingly tended by a volunteer staff, Moffett
Field displays will be saved, with timely donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When the Naval Air Station at Moffett Field was slated for closure
eight years ago, Carol Henderson vowed that she would not allow its
storied past to be lost.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew the Navy was leaving and I started going through
everyone's office, putting yellow stickers on things, telling them I
wanted all that stuff," said Henderson, a 77-year-old
great-grandmother in red-white-and-blue sneakers. "I would go into
dumpsters to rescue things I knew were important."</LD>
<LD>   Henderson, a member of the Moffett Field Historical Society and
the wife of a retired Navy man, collected photographs and uniforms,
test equipment, flight gear and training manuals that now comprise
the society's museum.</LD>
<TE>   Squeezed into five crowded rooms within a cavernous, steel-framed
hangar built in the 1930s to house giant dirigibles, the museum is
home to about 60 years of military memorabilia and a library of books
on Moffett Field and U.S. military history.</TE>
<TE>   But it lacks a sprinkler system and other fire-safety equipment,
and for that reason the museum was forced to close Jan. 11. With a
shoestring budget and volunteer staff, the facility's future was
anything but certain.</TE>
<TE>   But last week two private donors, including Cisco Systems Inc.
Chief Executive John Chambers, stepped up to save the little museum
at the sprawling base that Henderson and her family once called home.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy left Moffett Federal Airfield in 1994, and NASA took
over its management. The property houses NASA's Ames Research Center,
which develops information technology and aviation operations systems
such as air traffic control technologies and is the agency's lead
center for astrobiology research.</TE>
<TE>   The base is also home to the 129th Division of the Air National
Guard, and the U.S. Air Force, based at nearby Onizuka Air Station,
maintains offices there. NASA is also developing a research park on
the site where several universities will be able to collaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The historical society was warned for three years that it had to
bring the museum's safety system up to date or face eviction, said
Ames spokeswoman Ann Hutchison. As NASA completes a new security
perimeter around its own facilities, the rest of the base will be
made more accessible to the public at the end of January.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate a lot more people will be coming to the museum, so
we really had to say these safety issues had to be dealt with right
now," Hutchison said.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson said the group tried to raise the money for the
improvements by putting on an air show with another museum. The event
was a debacle and the Moffett Field museum lost about $9,000, as much
as its operating costs for a year.</TE>
<TE>   As news of its impending closure spread, some people came to
retrieve the artifacts they had lent to the museum. Then last week,
Henderson ordered a sheet cake and called together her nearly two
dozen volunteers. The society had received $160,000 to fund the
needed improvements from the John and Lynn Chambers Foundation and
the Seligman Family Foundation in San Francisco, she announced.</TE>
<TE>   She has until April 15 to bring the museum up to code, after which
it can reopen. Henderson doesn't know when the repairs will begin;
the historical society is waiting to hear from NASA exactly what work
must be done.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of sleepless nights" before the project was rescued,
said Henderson, who came to Moffett Field with her husband in 1949,
when he returned from the Berlin Airlift. "I thought about mortgaging
my house because I knew I wasn't going to leave this museum."</TE>
<TE>   A few cities from San Francisco to San Jose banded together to
purchase the Moffett Field property for $276,679 in 1931, and then
sold it to the Navy for $1. The air station was commissioned in 1933
and the first hangar, which now houses the museum, sheltered the
dirigible USS Macon.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 feet high and long enough to hold three football fields,
the giant hangar is a Bay Area landmark, visible from U.S. 101. The
museum's modest, windowless rooms are organized chronologically--an
enthusiastic display of historic black-and-white photographs, somber
Navy portraits, yellowed news clippings, even the passenger basket
from a 1940s-era blimp.</TE>
<TE>   One room is dedicated to the Macon, the 785-foot-long,
146-foot-high dirigible that went down in a storm off Point Sur, near
Monterey, on Feb. 12, 1935. Two of its 83 crewmen were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Without its dirigible, the Navy was done with Moffett Field for a
while. It swapped the property with the Army until 1942, when the
Navy took the station back as a blimp patrol headquarters for the
West Coast during World War II, an era chronicled in the next room.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, the F3D Skynight jet arrived, the first night jet fighter
in the military. Its first test flights were conducted at Moffett
Field. During the Korean War, Moffett was a base for fighter jets
that flew from Navy carriers in the Pacific, and a decade later it
became the Pacific headquarters for all P-3 "Orion Hunter"
anti-submarine aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   One room displays women's uniforms, commemorating their service at
Moffett Field, and another holds the museum's library. The sudden
infusion of cash will buy the museum some time, but questions remain
about its future.</TE>
<TE>   The historical society's relationship with its landlord, NASA, has
been rocky. And the hangar itself has had no repairs for about 10
years, said retired Navy Capt. Tom Spink, a regional vice president
of the Assn. of Naval Aviation and a museum advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to go out and start getting a lot of money," Spink said.
"They've put together a real nice collection at the museum, and we've
got to keep our eye on the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Information about the museum is available at its Web site,
www.moffettfieldmuseum.org.</TE>

<HD>Davis Reveals Plan to Limit Hospital Nurses to 5 Patients</HD>
<DH>Health: Applauded by the profession, proposal includes
rules for emergency, pediatric and obstetric care. Recruiting and
cost worry industry officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California would become the first state in the nation to limit the
number of hospital patients assigned to each nurse under regulations
proposed Tuesday by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules ultimately would prohibit hospitals from assigning a
nurse to more than five patients in large hospital units devoted to
patients recovering from surgery and serious illnesses. That's half
the number typically assigned in many facilities, and half what the
hospital industry had proposed.</LD>
<LD>   The rules would be phased in; initially nurses would be allowed to
treat six patients.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed standards also limit nurses in emergency rooms to one
trauma patient, pediatric nurses to four child patients, and
obstetrics nurses to two mothers in labor.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses' unions and consumer advocates applauded the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most sweeping health care reform that we've seen,"
said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses
Assn., one of the unions that represents registered nurses. "I can't
think of anything that's as prominent in the everyday life of the
patient."</TE>
<TE>   But hospital industry officials and others said that the rules
face tremendous practical obstacles in a state that has been among
the hardest hit in a severe national nursing shortage. According to
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, California ranks
49th among states in its share of registered nurses, with 544 nurses
per 100,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Several thousand new nurses must be employed to meet these
requirements," said Duane Dauner, president of the California
Healthcare Assn., which represents hospitals. "But are they
available? And is there money to pay them?"</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Tuesday how the administration planned to enforce
the rules, although a Health Services department spokeswoman said
current fines and procedures would remain in effect. Those details,
Davis said, would be worked out over the next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The rules are designed to prevent patient neglect and injuries
after years of cutbacks to hospital nursing staffs. They are expected
to be implemented over two years, beginning in July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement reflects the rising status of health care as an
issue in the governor's race. The Democratic governor pointed to his
health care record during his State of the State speech earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Tuesday's announcement had the flavor of a political
event. Davis made the announcement in Los Angeles, flanked by union
members in the courtyard of an urban hospital, St. Vincent Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was careful not to criticize the hospital industry,
promising that "there is still a free market" and hinting that the
state would provide financial and other incentives to help hospitals
recruit nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "You can decide who to hire and what to pay," Davis said. "But you
have to have quality care."</TE>
<TE>   The new rules, which must be aired at public hearings and still
could be revised by the state Department of Health Services, are
being watched carefully in other states. Nursing unions and patient
advocates are pushing similar proposals in Massachusetts, and plan to
roll out a national campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In this state, nurses such as Trande Phillips, a Kaiser Permanente
nurse from Northern California, say the strict standards mean that
she will stay in the profession.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I really needed to leave nursing if we didn't get
these ratios," said Phillips, a member of the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she recently took care of 16 seriously ill
children--including one who was recovering from surgery--with just
two other nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to risk patients' lives and I don't want to risk my
license," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Relie DemaAla, a nurse at Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health
Center and a member of the California Nurses Assn., said she has been
asked to care for up to 11 patients at a time on her night shift. At
times, she said, patients have been hurt while awaiting a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just running from room to room," DemaAla said.</TE>
<TE>   Some representatives of the nursing profession said the new
standards don't go far enough. "We don't think they're good
enough....We're pleased that the ratios are out but we're going to
fight to improve them," said Beth Kapell, a lobbyist for the Service
Employees International Union, another union that represents
California nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The staffing rules are the result of two years of jostling among
hospitals, nurses and others to comply with a 1999 bill requiring
health care regulators to develop new standards. The state already
regulates the number of nurses required per patient in intensive care
units and nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hospital trade group, the California Healthcare
Assn., did not sharply criticize the plan Tuesday, Dauner said
officials plan to voice their concerns during public hearings. He
said hospitals are particularly concerned about the maximum number of
patients assigned to emergency room nurses. If there aren't enough
nurses on hand, he said, hospitals might have to turn patients away
from emergency departments.</TE>
<TE>   Cost is also a factor. Kaiser Permanente, the state's largest HMO,
has discovered that. It voluntarily pledged last year to hire one
nurse for every four patients in its large medical and surgical
units, which will cost up to $200 million and require recruiting
2,000 more nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules also add to the pressures on the managed care
industry, which has pushed hospitals to accept less money to care for
patients, helping fuel the reduction of nursing staffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Increasing the number of nurses relative to patients is going to
raise hospital costs, and ultimately raise health plan premiums,"
said Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn. of Health
Plans, the HMO trade group. "In many cases, that may be appropriate
and necessary ... to improve quality, but it doesn't get around the
reality that we're facing cost increases that many people are having
difficulty paying."</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Won't Be Charged in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ventura County prosecutors say William Oney of
Simi Valley shot his stepson's father in self-defense last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will not file criminal charges against a firefighter
arrested last fall in connection with the fatal shooting of his
wife's unarmed ex-boyfriend in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   William Oney, 29, told investigators he acted in self-defense when
he fired a .45-caliber handgun at Todd Thies, a 31-year-old
construction worker, after a child custody dispute at Oney's home.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Harman, a Ventura County senior deputy district attorney,
said Tuesday that after a three-month investigation, prosecutors
could find no evidence to dispute Oney's account.</LD>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is, we reviewed the facts of the case," Harman
said. "It was justifiable self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   Harman noted that Oney had state law on his side.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1984 Home Protection Bill of Rights, a homeowner can use
deadly force if he has a reasonable fear of imminent peril from
someone who is not a member of the household and who enters
unlawfully or by force.</TE>
<TE>   According to Simi Valley police, Thies was shot once about 7:30
p.m. on Oct. 17, shortly after he arrived to pick up his 4-year-old
son.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reported hearing a woman scream and a gunshot from
inside the family's single-story house in the 3100 block of Waco
Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi Oney, 28, called 911 as the shot was fired, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Oney, a Los Angeles County firefighter who was off
duty at the time, walked out of the house and surrendered to
officers. Thies, who was unarmed, died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Oney was released two days later after prosecutors said they
needed additional time to investigate before deciding whether to
press charges.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Oney appeared briefly in Ventura County Superior Court
and left the courtroom immediately after Harman told Judge Glen
Reiser that no charges would be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Oney has been on paid leave. An internal investigation is
continuing, said Fire Inspector Michael Brown.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will not file criminal charges against a firefighter
arrested last fall in connection with the fatal shooting of his
wife's unarmed ex-boyfriend in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   William Oney, 29, told investigators he acted in self-defense when
he fired a .45-caliber handgun at Todd Thies, a 31-year-old
construction worker, after a child custody dispute at Oney's home.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Harman, a Ventura County senior deputy district attorney,
said Tuesday that after a three-month investigation, prosecutors
could find no evidence to dispute Oney's account.</LD>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is, we reviewed the facts of the case," Harman
said. "It was justifiable self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   Harman declined to discuss specific facts, but noted that Oney had
state law on his side.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1984 Home Protection Bill of Rights, a homeowner can use
deadly force if he has a reasonable fear of imminent peril from
someone who is not a member of the household and who enters
unlawfully or by force.</TE>
<TE>   According to Simi Valley police, Thies was shot once about 7:30
p.m. Oct. 17, shortly after he arrived to pick up his 4-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reported hearing a woman scream and a gunshot from
inside the family's single-story house in the 3100 block of Waco
Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi Oney, 28, called 911 to report the dispute as the shot was
fired, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Oney, a Los Angeles County firefighter who was off
duty at the time, walked out of the house with his hands above his
head and surrendered to officers. Thies, who was unarmed, died at the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Oney was released two days later after prosecutors said they
needed additional time to investigate before deciding whether to
press charges.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Oney appeared briefly in Ventura County Superior
Court. He was not represented by a lawyer and left the courtroom
immediately after Harman told Judge Glen Reiser that no charges would
be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Oney has been on paid administrative leave from the Fire
Department. An internal investigation that started immediately after
the shooting is continuing, said Fire Inspector Michael Brown.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear when the investigation will be completed, but fire
officials said possible outcomes could include reinstatement or
probation.</TE>

<LD>Manhattan's largest independent bookseller was holding a
going-out-of-business sale Tuesday, and one of the slowest movers was
the autobiography of Danny Bonaduce, the former "Partridge Family"
child star.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got it sitting on the front table," said Ronald Stephenson,
a manager at Coliseum Books. "Maybe his book would do better in L.A.
than in New York."</LD>
<LD>   The tome, "Random Acts of Badness--My Story," had been marked down
50% to $11.48. Whatever, I'm sure it's every bit as much fun as the
radio show Bonaduce co-hosts here on KYSR-FM (98.7). Station
billboards around town promote it with this guarantee: "Less painful
than waxing!"</LD>
<TE>   Sound-alike competition: This week's winning homonyms (see
accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A Singer product that you might expect to find on a farm
(submitted by Mildred Berger)</TE>
<TE>   * An apparent reference to people who idolize addicts (C.L.
Sherburne)</TE>
<TE>   * A sofa that wears a disguise (Ken Mooney)</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a piano that can whirl around (Doris Walden and
Jane Bush).</TE>
<TE>   OK, on the last item, I confess that I had never heard of a spinet
piano. Then again I'd never heard of the spinning variety either,
though I seem to recall Jerry Lee Lewis throwing one around during a
concert.</TE>
<TE>   Levels of meaning: A motorist who led police on a brief chase
through Costa Mesa pulled into a store's parking lot and surrendered
peacefully. I think the name of the store also could describe his
decision: Smart &amp; Final.</TE>
<TE>   A 80-proof illumination system: A discussion here of Hollywood
saloons that regularly lit up the night with flames brought a note
from writer Frank Mulvey.</TE>
<TE>   "Surely the granddaddy of all blazing bars was the aptly named,
but now defunct, Firefly on Vine Street, just south of Hollywood
Boulevard," said Mulvey, author of "The 101 Best Bars of Los
Angeles." "Last call was announced nightly when one of the twin
brothers who owned the joint ignited the entire length of the bar.
And, being professional bartenders, the brothers used vodka, not
lighter fluid."</TE>
<TE>   Bad karma? The San Francisco Examiner reports that a $100,000
Porsche Speedster was stolen from actor Nicolas Cage, who portrayed a
Southland car thief in the movie "Gone in Sixty Seconds." You'll
recall that Cage's character was so skilled at car heists in Long
Beach that a rival crook uttered these classic words to him: "Get out
of Long Beach, tonight!"</TE>
<TE>   There are deadlines and there are deadlines: A colleague who was
having cable TV service installed at her residence couldn't help but
feel sympathy for the cable guy. The poor fellow's cell phone and
beeper sounded constantly that morning. At one point, she heard a
cell caller say to him: "Aren't you through yet?" She figured he had
jobs stacked up through the day. She thought differently, however,
when she saw him head for his truck afterward. Three other cable
trucks were there as well. The other drivers were waiting
impatiently--so they could all go to lunch.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: During one NFL playoff broadcast, CBS' Dan Dierdorf
observed that, "like the Queen Mary," 340-pound Baltimore Raven
tackle Tony Siragusa has trouble stopping "once he starts moving."
Was Dierdorf hinting at the next destination for Siragusa, who has
announced his retirement? Will Siragusa be towed to Long Beach and
transformed into a tourist attraction? Despite his appetite, his
upkeep would be less expensive than that of the QM.</TE>

<LD>It was about 10 days ago that Gary Brownstein finally had it up to
here, and he followed the junkie who shoots up in his building
downtown as regularly as some people show up for work.</LD>
<LD>   He trailed him down the street, to the corner, into the Burger
King, all the while on the phone to the cops, telling them, here he
is, here he is.</LD>
<LD>   In 22 years in the garment trade here, Gary had called the cops
before, about the junkies on the stairs, the panhandlers who scare
his clients and the hookers who hit on them. He called the cops so
often that finally his landlord called him and told him the cops
wanted him to lay off.</LD>
<TE>   So here's the Army veteran on his cell phone to the cops. Nothing.
Finally he flags one down, and the cop tells him, "Nope, I gotta take
care of traffic violations."</TE>
<TE>   Gary e-mailed me recently, and if an e-mail could sputter
indignantly, his did. I'd written about Lisa Magdaleno, who came to
downtown L.A. from Orange County to shop one day and got threatened,
then got lost, then got ticketed. So she spent her Christmas money in
Long Beach, and scratched L.A. off her list. I matchmade her with
Councilwoman Jan Perry for lunch to show her the better downtown.</TE>
<TE>   That really got to Gary, who can't get cops, much less council
members, to come calling in his downtown, a place where clients
refuse to walk the two blocks from the California Mart without an
escort. His company, Staples Designer Services, sold the Staples name
to the office supply people; he can see his old name in lights on the
arena on his way home at night. He'd love to leave downtown, but as
long as the garment trade is here, so is he.</TE>
<TE>   Gary's was not the only e-mail. Tom Burrows is one of the new
urban pioneers living downtown in spite of "tons of garbage,"
burned-out street lights, sidewalks defiled with condoms and feces
that can't be hosed off because then they defile the ocean, and the
24-7 parade of whores and crackheads, parolees and the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The homeless. The poor homeless. Can we admit here and now that
nothing has really worked? We shut them up in mental hospitals, where
some of them shouldn't be, then dump them out on the streets, where
they shouldn't be either. We spirit them away for the 2000 Democratic
convention and the 1984 Olympics. We dither ourselves into paralysis,
and nothing seems to alter their landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Brownstein, pitying the homeless, peeved at the LAPD, get a
load of Lee Baca, friend of the friendless.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff of Los Angeles County wears a tan uniform, not a white
coat. Nonetheless, Lee Baca says often and truly that he runs the
world's biggest mental institution--the jails. The spinning
turnstiles bring in the homeless on some crime, clean them up and
spin them back out onto the street.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff, who is running for reelection, has become dead-set on
doing something different about the homeless. I saw his idea the
other day, in a scale model, with little trees and American flags,
laid out on a table in the office of Chief Al Scaduto. Eighteen
months ago, before Baca assigned this to him, Scaduto says he didn't
know from homelessness. When he put on the tan uniform 34 years ago,
they were "bums," motley guys whose problem was the bottle and whose
cure was a few sober weeks on the county jail farm.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's a different problem, with a different lingo, and Scaduto
has learned to speak it: "Being able to help the downtrodden is going
to be of benefit to us all."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's plan is based in part on a Florida experiment. I
call it Club Ted, after the professional homeless activist Ted Hayes.
It is a four-acre camp on an old oil well- equipment site behind the
jail, where just-released men and women with mental troubles check in
for beds, showers and help in open-air tent living, until they find a
permanent place. It's exactly the sort of place for those homeless
who refuse, according to a nonprofit Shelter Partnership study, to
stay in a place with four walls or preaching.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there's some fearful opposition. It's a law of physics
and politics: Every action engenders an equal and opposite reaction.
The homeless may not like a place that won't let them wander in and
out at will. Activists will worry that Club Ted squeezes another
wedge out of a homeless-money pie that never seems to get any bigger.
Some Chinatown merchants, who might like the idea if it weren't a
block or two away, fear the homeless "overflow," the unpleasantries
Gary Brownstein sees every day.</TE>
<TE>   One, in a letter to the editor, dismissed it as a "drop-in-the-
bucket" solution.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. But here's another law of physics: You get enough
drops, you fill up the bucket.</TE>

<HD>SLA Bank Robbery Senseless, Hearst Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: She denounces the group that kidnapped her and
voices no qualms about testifying in the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst on Tuesday called a 1975 bank
robbery that left a mother of four dead "a violent, senseless, evil
act" committed by bloodthirsty revolutionaries.</LD>
<LD>   Hearst said she has no qualms about testifying against former
members of the radical Symbionese Liberation Army, which kidnapped
her and with which she eventually participated in two bank robberies.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have any skeletons in my closet," she said in an an
appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live." "I'm not afraid to go in front
of a jury."</LD>
<TE>   Hearst said the Crocker National Bank robbery in the Sacramento
suburb of Carmichael was part of the SLA's plan to overthrow the
government.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a robbery," said Hearst, who has admitted to driving
a getaway car that day. "It was an expropriation. It was a combat
operation."</TE>
<TE>   The SLA declared war against the United States and boasted of the
groups crimes as battles in that war, Hearst said. "It really was
their own little jihad that they had going," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst, 47, is expected to be the prosecution's star witness in
the case against four former radicals arrested last week in the 1975
robbery and murder. Hearst, who was granted immunity in the
Carmichael case, described the crime to FBI agents in 1976 and then
gave details in her 1982 book, "Every Secret Thing." She also
testified in 1990 before a Sacramento County grand jury, which
declined to return an indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Hearst's account of the crime is bolstered by
physical evidence and testimony of other witnesses. But defense
attorneys say she is a criminal herself and cannot be believed.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst was convicted in 1976 of robbing the Hibernia Bank in San
Francisco with the SLA and served nearly two years for the crime.
Surveillance photos showed Hearst carrying a semiautomatic carbine.
Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, and she
was pardoned by President Bill Clinton last year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, William and Emily Harris, Mike Bortin and Sara Jane
Olson were charged with murder in the shooting death of 42-year-old
Myrna Opsahl as she deposited church offering receipts at the bank.
The four have all maintained their innocence. A fifth suspect, Jim
Kilgore, remains at large. .</TE>
<TE>   Hearst was kidnapped Feb. 4, 1974, by members of the SLA, a small
band of radicals founded in the Bay Area in the 1970s whose slogan
was: "Death to the fascist insect that preys on the life of the
people."</TE>
<TE>   During the television interview Tuesday, Hearst described her
experience being kidnapped while a UC Berkeley student. She said she
was locked in a closet, tortured and brainwashed to do exactly what
the group's leaders told her to do.</TE>
<TE>   She said the kidnapping and the Hibernia Bank robbery instilled in
her feelings "of guilt and self-loathing and despair and pain that
was just overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Her life has never been the same since the armed kidnappers
knocked on her door, Hearst said. "I've lived my entire adult life in
many ways haunted by what happened," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst said she had been telling authorities for years about what
happened at the Carmichael bank, and that she feels bad for Riverside
County physician Jon Opsahl, who has pressured authorities to bring
his mother's killers to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was throwing down the gauntlet saying, 'Look, this
is what happened,'" Hearst said. "There's a family out there that
needed to know what happened."</TE>
<TE>   In her book, Hearst wrote that she drove a getaway car and was
parked outside the bank while Emily Harris, Olson, Kilgore and Bortin
went inside. Others helped outside, she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them wore disguises, including ski masks and wigs, she
wrote. The book says Bortin stood on a teller's counter and waved his
gun around, Olson emptied the tellers' drawers and Emily Harris shot
the female customer.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst, a mother of two who now lives in Connecticut, was prepared
to testify against Olson in the Minnesota woman's recent attempted
bombing case in Los Angeles, but said she was let off the hook when
Olson pleaded guilty. Last week, Olson was sentenced to 20 years to
life in prison for her role in the failed bombing plot to kill LAPD
officers in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Hearst said, she stands ready to tell a jury what the
Harrises, Bortin and Olson did during the Carmichael bank robbery.
She said the hold the SLA had over her, which she blamed for her
participation in their crimes, is long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in a closet and they were threatening to kill me, I
was terrified of them at one time," she said. "They just don't have
any power over me anymore. They haven't had for years."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst described the Harrises as "extremely dedicated
revolutionaries." And she said Olson was a "forceful personality" who
dragged her siblings and friends into the SLA in the 1970s and who
has not been completely honest about her involvement in the group.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst said Olson pleaded guilty in the attempted bombing case
because she was guilty and because of the evidence--including
Hearst's testimony--she would have had to face at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Olson made a brief court appearance Tuesday in Sacramento, where a
judge appointed her Beverly Hills attorney Shawn Chapman to represent
her in the murder case.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Chapman told reporters that Olson is
innocent and has no information implicating the others arrested in
Opsahl's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman also said that Hearst has been "disbelieved in every
venue" in which she has spoken about SLA activities.</TE>

projects, city officials said. Wal-Mart disputes the accusation.</LD>
<LD>   The store, at Talbert Avenue and Beach Boulevard, twice failed an
electrical inspection, a city spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, several projects at nearby Lambert Park--adding a
railing, improving handicapped access and sandblasting--that were
part of the city's approval for the store had not been completed in
time for the opening, the spokesman said.</LD>

<DL>HUNTINGTON BEACH</DL>
<LD>A judge will wait until at least March to decide whether to expand
his ruling that an assessment method that raised the tax bill on a
Seal Beach home is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John M. Watson ruled in December that the
county tax assessor illegally raised the assessed value of the home
by more than the 2%-a-year limit set under Proposition 13.</LD>
<LD>   County attorneys have defended the practice, called "recapturing."
It is used after properties have dropped in value and had their
assessments lowered. When the values rebound, the new assessments
routinely exceed the 2% limit.</LD>

<LD>A 26-year-old man was convicted Tuesday of kidnapping a married
couple in Sherman Oaks in 1999 and sexually assaulting the woman.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Lyn Richie faces up to life in prison after a Van Nuys jury
found him guilty of kidnapping, robbery and sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   The monthlong trial ended when the jury of nine women and three
men took less than two hours to reach guilty verdicts on all nine
felony counts.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub in Los Angeles is
scheduled to sentence Richie on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   Richie's accomplice, Joseph Navar Downey, 23, was sentenced to
life in prison in May 2000 for two separate kidnappings and rapes.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Richie and Downey were convicted of carjacking a
Covina couple in February 1999. They robbed the couple, then took
turns raping the woman while her husband was held at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Richie's mother and brother testified he was at home
when the crimes occurred, his attorney, William J. Hardy, said.</TE>
<TE>   Both victims identified Richie in court, and there was DNA
evidence linking him to the sexual assault.</TE>

<HD>Design Students Display Visions for L.A. River</HD>
<DH>Planning: Their ideas, including parkland, housing and an
urban lake, have no price tags and would take decades to realize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Visions for the future of a four-mile stretch of the Los Angeles
River near downtown are being exhibited this week. But there are no
price tags attached, and the ideas would take 30 years to realize, if
they ever are.</LD>
<LD>   The ideas are those of 12 students of the Harvard University
Graduate School of Design, whose semester-long efforts were solicited
by the Friends of the Los Angeles River and the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy.</LD>
<LD>   They were under the direction of landscape architect George
Hargreaves, a professor known for his work at the San Francisco
Presidio's Crissy Field and on the plans for the Clinton Library in
Little Rock, Ark.</LD>
<TE>   The Southland exhibit, open to the public without charge, is at
the 2-year-old Los Angeles River Center and Gardens, where Lawry's
California Center once stood on West Avenue 26. Hours are 9 a.m. to
9:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The phasing out of certain industrial and rail activities on the
east side of the river and the gradual crumbling of some of the
concrete sides open up new opportunities, Hargreaves and five of the
students said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The students envisioned uses ranging from parkland, housing and an
urban lake to even a display of old rail cars.</TE>
<TE>   Hargreaves mentioned possibly shifting all rail lines from the
east to west side of the river and eventually putting those tracks
underground.</TE>
<TE>   Although he and the students suggested spreading the river outside
its concrete banks and making its boundaries "softer and greener,"
there was little detailed discussion of how periodic floods might be
controlled, other than retaining more water in the mountains. The
concrete banks were built as a flood-control measure.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the River President Lewis MacAdams said visits were
exchanged, with the students coming to Los Angeles and L.A.
conservationists visiting Harvard, to examine a broad range of ideas
for future projects.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have here is a blueprint for the urban core for decades
to come," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge, welcoming Hargreaves and the
students to the city Tuesday, said he believed that some of their
ideas could be implemented soon but that others would take far
longer.</TE>
<TE>   No formal proposals have been drafted, however.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Unified School District trustees voted at Tuesday's board
meeting to put three schools on year-round schedules.</LD>
<LD>   Muir Middle School and 61st Street Elementary School in Los
Angeles and Walter Reed Middle School in the San Fernando Valley will
operate on four-track year-round schedules, with 180 days of
instruction beginning in the 2002-03 school year.</LD>
<LD>   After the 6-1 vote, board members voted 4 to 3 to approve an
amendment requiring that the three schools have a 180-day schedule,
instead of having the option of a three-track schedule with 163
extended days.</LD>
<TE>   The amendment ensures that the three schools will have the 17
additional days of instruction.</TE>

<HD>Turning Their Senior Year Blahs Into Bravos</HD>
<DH>To fight 'senioritis,' a district requires its students to
take on graduation projects. Their choices range from Lou Gehrig's
disease to hip-hop music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While seniors at many other high schools are slumping into the apathy
of "senioritis," Brandon Wicker at California High School in Whittier
is tackling research about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</LD>
<LD>   Watching his 64-year-old grandmother battle the neurological
illness, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, inspired him to take on
the topic for his required graduation project. So he does not mind
the extra academic work, poring over medical journals and
interviewing health experts, during a phase of education that is
otherwise not widely known for its rigor.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a brutal disease," said the soft-spoken 18-year-old, who
plans to study guitar performance next year at either Cal State
Fullerton or University of the Pacific in Stockton. "Researching this
topic has helped me take care of my grandmother."</LD>
<TE>   To graduate, seniors in the five-campus Whittier Union High School
District are required to complete a project that resembles a college
thesis. The requirement began six years ago to combat senioritis, the
breeze-by attitude that often kicks in after college application
deadlines in the winter. Teachers used to complain about how
difficult it was getting seniors to think of anything but partying
and life after high school.</TE>
<TE>   "By spring break, there's not much kids want to do," said Patricia
Hodges, a social studies teacher at California High and the senior
project coordinator there. "How do you keep them going for the rest
of the year?"</TE>
<TE>   Seniors must choose a topic they will research for an eight- to
10-page paper and complete a related hands-on activity to keep them
involved for the whole year. By graduation, each senior delivers a
speech to a panel of community and faculty members on what he or she
has learned.</TE>
<TE>   Wicker, for example, will give a talk at St. Jude Medical Center
in Fullerton on how to be prepared for dealing with family members
afflicted with the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Last school year, three students did not graduate on time at
California High because they failed to complete their projects,
Hodges said. To receive a diploma, such seniors have to finish the
work, plus attend summer school or take an independent study class in
the fall.</TE>
<TE>   State education officials say there are no reliable lists of other
schools requiring such graduation projects, but they say interest is
on the rise. That is especially true since a federal commission last
year recommended that every American senior complete a capstone
project.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a general concern of the senior year being a wasted
year," said former California state Sen. Gary K. Hart, who was on the
commission that studied the final year of high school. Hart founded
the California State University Institute for Education Reform, a
policy center.</TE>
<TE>   Whittier high schools model their program on a curriculum designed
by Far West EDGE Inc., in Medford, Ore., which reports that it has
trained about 200 schools in the state. Districts in Lodi, the
Antelope Valley and San Diego are among those using it.</TE>
<TE>   At California High School, Diana Maglalang, 17, gracefully twisted
her wrists in circles as she described the hand movements of
traditional Filipino dances--the topic of her senior project. She
plans either to teach other students the steps to one of the dances
from Baguio, Philippines, where her family is from, or perform one at
school.</TE>
<TE>   For the written report, she's been reading books on the history,
music and costumes of the dances and took classes at a Filipino dance
workshop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very stressful. I've never stayed up so late working,"
said Maglalang, who wants to major in biology at San Diego State and
become a dentist.</TE>
<TE>   California High senior Mako Crawford said his project on the
history of hip-hop music also is taking up a lot of his time. But he
enjoys the work and the freedom he had to choose a topic that
interested him. He plans to produce an album for a local musician.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just that senior year we have nothing to do; that's why they
make us do this," said Crawford, 17, who is awaiting word on
applications to various UC and Cal State campuses, where he wants to
study business, music or film.</TE>
<TE>   Myron Dembo, professor of educational psychology at USC's Rossier
School of Education, said senior projects are part of a growing trend
toward giving students a broader understanding of the world. "It
recognizes that kids can't learn everything that they need to learn
in a classroom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dembo praised Whittier Unified for including members of the wider
community as evaluators and mentors for the projects. School staff
ranging from administrators to custodians also participate.</TE>
<TE>   When Rosa Chatterton, a receptionist at a local dentist's office,
was asked to be a panel member she was a bit hesitant, but the
experience helping evaluate the speeches and papers proved positive.</TE>
<TE>   "You always get a feeling that there's so many kids in trouble,
you don't get to see the really good kids all the time," Chatterton
said. "It was good public relations for the school."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from keeping students focused on school during their final
year, the projects can shape their futures too. La Serna senior Aaron
Carson decided he wants to study marine biology after graduation
because of his project on dolphin training. He's working with a
mentor from Sea World in San Diego to put together a performance in
which he will swim with bottlenose dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   For Matt Langan's senior project last school year at California
High, he refurbished his grandfather's 1927 Model-T Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went into the project, I didn't know anything about cars,"
said Langan, 18. He's now in his first year at Universal Technical
Institute in Rancho Cucamonga, and still working on his grandfather's
car.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the project, I was just going to go to college and take
general classes," Langan said. "The project helped me realize I could
go into that field."</TE>

<LD>A North Hollywood High School student was being sought Tuesday in the
shooting death of a female classmate.</LD>
<LD>   Jamarie Johnie Chatrie, 18, of North Hollywood is suspected of
shooting Shadene Thompson, also 18, shortly after 11 p.m. Monday
outside an apartment building in the 11200 block of Huston Street in
North Hollywood, Los Angeles Police Det. Vince Bancroft said.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson and two male friends had attended a party in the building
and were outside talking when Chatrie approached, Bancroft said.</LD>
<TE>   According to witnesses, Chatrie told Thompson several times to go
home. When she refused, he pulled out a small-caliber handgun and
shot her, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The two North Hollywood High students had a "previous dating
relationship," and Chatrie "must have thought it was more than it
was," Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was pronounced dead at 11 a.m. Tuesday at a Mission Hills
hospital, police said.</TE>

<LD>Federal funding for a program that works to increase the number of
college-bound students has doubled to $18 million, it was announced
Tuesday at the Project GRAD National Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Included in the education bill recently signed by President Bush,
Project GRAD (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) USA will use the
additional $9 million to expand programs and launch new ones.</LD>

<HD>Council Split Over Call to Ban Billboards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another campaign by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski
to ban new billboards in the city drew a lukewarm response Tuesday
from some of her colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt the time was right to comprehensively and decisively take
a stand against the proliferation of billboard blight in our
neighborhoods," Miscikowski said.</LD>
<LD>   The councilwoman is also calling for a November initiative to tax
billboard companies at least $20,000 annually per existing sign to
pay for enforcement of city sign laws. She was joined at a City Hall
news conference Tuesday by 15 leaders of homeowner groups and
community organizations who support that proposal.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most positive thing to make a visual improvement in the
city of Los Angeles," said Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of
Encino. There is currently a moratorium on new billboards, imposed to
allow the city time to consider new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski also proposed a ban last year, but the council voted 8
to 3 to tentatively support a trade-off plan allowing 70 new
billboards along freeways in exchange for the removal of 2,000 in
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Nick Pacheco and Jan Perry said they prefer the
trade-off plan because it will help rid neighborhoods of the signs.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Jack Weiss, Tom LaBonge, Eric Garcetti and Janice
Hahn--all of whom were elected last year--said Tuesday they support
the ban as part of a larger package of laws to go after existing
illegal signs.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss has proposed charging billboard owners a fee without seeking
a public vote.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, who was also elected in 2001, said he
supports "any reasonable restriction" on billboards, but stopped
short of committing to a ban, as did Council President Alex Padilla
and Councilman Nate Holden.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America branches in Thousand Oaks and downtown Ventura were
robbed Tuesday afternoon, federal authorities said. The heists were
not related.</LD>
<LD>   The first holdup occurred about 4:10 p.m. in the 900 block of
Westlake Boulevard in Thousand Oaks when a man in a business suit
handed a teller a threatening note and then fled with an undisclosed
amount of cash, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The robber was described as Asian, 6 feet tall and 200 pounds with
dark wavy hair. The robbery may be related to a similar incident in
November in Camarillo, said FBI Special Agent Brent Robbins.</LD>
<TE>   The second robbery occurred shortly before 5 p.m. on the 500 block
of Main Street in Ventura, Robbins said.</TE>
<TE>   While one robber handed a teller a note and grabbed an undisclosed
amount of cash, a second stood by the front entrance wearing a black
wig with gold streaks, Robbins said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were white and in their mid-30s. The man with the wig was
about 5 foot 4 and thin with a slightly dark complexion. He was
wearing glasses and possibly a fake mustache and goatee. The other
robber was 6 feet with a dark complexion, clean shaven and wearing a
black leather jacket.</TE>

<LD>A woman distracted by spilled coffee drove her pickup truck into a
power pole early Tuesday, knocking out electricity to 3,900
residences and businesses in east Ventura and Montalvo and closing a
road.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Terrie Wadkins, 44, of Ventura was driving south on
Ventura Boulevard about 8:15 a.m. when she spilled her coffee and
veered off into a utility pole, shearing it off. The ensuing outage,
which also knocked out traffic signals along Victoria Avenue and
Johnson Drive, affected customers along Victoria and Montgomery
avenues and Valentine and Bristol roads, said Nancy Williams, a
spokeswoman for Southern California Edison.</LD>
<LD>   Power was restored to all but two customers by 9:30 a.m., but
Ventura Boulevard remained closed Tuesday afternoon between Seahawk
Street and Victoria as crews put up a new pole, Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura Police Officer Rick Murray said Wadkins suffered minor

<HD>Huntington Beach Blocks Today's Wal-Mart Opening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach Wal-Mart that has long been fought by nearby
residents will not open as scheduled today because the company failed
to finish several on-site projects, according to city officials--a
charge Wal-Mart disputes.</LD>
<LD>   The store at Talbert Avenue and Beach Boulevard failed electrical
inspections Friday and Tuesday, a city spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, several projects at nearby Lambert Parkthat were
required as part of the city's approval for the store--adding a
railing, improving handicapped access and sandblasting--had not been
completed in time for today's opening, said Richard Barnard, a city
spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   "We did indicate to them that until they correct these problems,
we will not give them an occupancy permit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the store was forced to delay its opening and to hold a
reception Tuesday afternoon in the parking lot for more than 230
employees and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart officials are hopeful the store will open later this
week.</TE>
<TE>   The company believes that most of the city-ordered work has been
completed, said Robert S. Mc Adam, a Wal-Mart spokesman. But the city
blindsided the company with its refusal to accept either a bond or a
written promise that the rest will be completed, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have fought the retailer from the outset over
construction of the store at the former Crest View Elementary School
site, citing traffic, noise and other concerns.</TE>
<TE>   After the store was approved by the city Planning Commission,
residents qualified a ballot initiative to overturn the city's
decision. But the measure was defeated by a 54%-46% margin in March
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive and president, in a letter
to Mayor Debbie Cook dated Jan. 18, told her that the company has
cooperated and tried to meet every city request. He urged the city to
overlook the construction shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   "On behalf of your citizens and our associates," Scott said in the
letter, "isn't it time to get past our differences and move on with
this project?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott's letter also noted that the city will "needlessly forgo"
the sales tax from $137,000 in sales each day the store remains
unopened. In addition, 40 community organizations in Huntington Beach
are also expected to receive $66,300 in contributions, "when our
store opens," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Although McAdam, who was at the Huntington Beach store, was
telling passersby that the store would open at 8:30 a.m. today, the
city is adamant that unless all the problems are fixed, including the
park walkway railing, no permit will be signed allowing the store to
open. "When it's completed--fully completed--we're ready to roll,"
Barnard said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart has spent more than $1 million to finish projects the
city required, McAdam said.</TE>
<TE>   Those requirements include an 8-foot sound wall for adjacent
residents, who also were given the option of having double-pane
windows installed at Wal-Mart's expense to decrease noise; shielded
parking lot lights; and a truck bay with a roof and walls on three
sides to help muffle noise.</TE>

<HD>Judge Puts Off Ruling on Taxes Till March</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge will wait until at least March to decide
whether to expand countywide his ruling that an assessment method
that raised the tax bill on a Seal Beach home is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John M. Watson asked attorneys for homeowner
Rob Pool, who filed the original suit, to define whom the ruling
should apply to before a March 11 hearing.</LD>
<LD>   County Assessor Webster J. Guillory has until March 4, the day
before he faces reelection in the primary, to appeal Watson's ruling.
If he does, further action at the Superior Court level would be
postponed until the appellate court upholds or overturns Watson's
decision.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Orange County Board of Supervisors
declined to appeal the ruling, saying it was up to Guillory to defend
his assessment practices. Guillory hasn't said whether he will
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Watson ruled in December that some Orange County property
assessments violated Proposition 13, the landmark tax reform measure
passed by California voters in 1978. The judge ruled that Guillory,
following a practice used by assessors statewide, illegally raised
the assessed value of Pool's home by more than the 2%-a-year limit
set by Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys have defended the practice, used after properties
have dropped in value and had their assessments lowered. When the
values rebound, the new assessments routinely exceed the 2% limit--a
method called recapturing.</TE>
<TE>   Pool and his attorneys want Watson to expand the ruling into a
class-action suit. Watson pondered Tuesday whether tax relief should
be limited to those who appealed past property tax bills or should
include everyone who "sat on the beach" and thought about appealing
but didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Watson also said he has heard that some taxpayers were told by
government workers that appealing their assessments would be
fruitless because the recapturing method was legal. "That was
erroneous [advice], according to this court," Watson said.</TE>

<HD>Irvine to Increase Size of 3rd Grade</HD>
<DH>Schools: Board votes to abandon popular program to help
address a $5.2-million budget shortfall.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine school board members voted late Tuesday to increase class
sizes in third grade, making the high-scoring district among the
first in the state to walk away from a popular class-size reduction
program.</LD>
<LD>   Trustees were still debating whether to make first- and
second-grade classes larger as well.</LD>
<LD>   Board members said before the night was out they would make more
painful choices to address a $5.2-million budget shortfall. Trustees
were considering trimming more than 20 programs, from school nurses
to music and science classes.</LD>
<TE>   If the board approves all the slated cuts, about 120 teachers, or
10%, could be laid off, said Anne Caenn, president of the Irvine
teachers union.</TE>
<TE>   The board also voted Tuesday, as expected, to close Los Naranjos
Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   "We are writing a sad chapter in the history of this district,"
said Steven Choi, board president. "Not just in the district, but in
the city."</TE>
<TE>   Union president Caenn expressed sadness as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I could make these decisions," she said.
"Tonight, Irvine Unified School District will change our profile and
join the ranks of the average."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 200 parents who attended the meeting said they would
not want to be in the trustees' shoes, being faced with tough
decisions. But others, like Vickie Lynn Bibro, castigated the board
for cutting academics while retaining sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I am appalled," said Bibro, mother of several Irvine school
district children. "You're making the wrong choices . . . . It's not
right and you know it."</TE>
<TE>   But many said that they felt they had little choice but to abandon
the smaller class sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Though the state picks up much of the cost for the 6-year-old
initiative, each year districts must pay a greater proportion for
salaries and extra classrooms as new teachers climb the pay scale
faster than state funding keeps up.</TE>
<TE>   With the state facing budget cuts, Irvine is not the only school
system having trouble paying for the popular but expensive program.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, nearly all of California's 900 eligible school
systems were part of the program, which caps class size at 20, down
from more than 30, in most primary grades.</TE>
<TE>   The Val Verde district in Riverside County, which lacks classrooms
and has no money to build new ones, already has increased class sizes
in second and third grades. First-grade classes could grow next fall.
Capistrano Unified School District Supt. James A. Fleming said his
district may be forced to increase third-grade class size if the
state budget allocation for schools doesn't rise.</TE>
<TE>   Several more districts notified a state education group that they
are considering increasing the number of students in primary classes.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School
Business Officials, the group that surveyed districts about the
program, said he believes more districts will have to increase
kindergarten or third-grade class sizes next year, but hesitate to
say so publicly because they fear reaction from parents and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state plan, districts must start shrinking classes in
first grade, then move onto second, and finally third and
kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   The program also requires that every class have 20 students or
fewer, or the school risks losing funding. The problem is that new
children turn up throughout the year, meaning school officials must
set class sizes at 18, and even combine grades and bus students away
from their neighborhood schools to keep totals under 20.</TE>
<TE>   Many local officials favor changing the law to allow as many as 22
students in some classes, as long as the average class size remains
at 20.</TE>

<LD>The Garden Grove City Council on Tuesday unanimously passed a 45-day
moratorium on new Internet cafes, and placed tighter controls on the
20 cafes already open.</LD>
<LD>   The new ordinance also will restrict the number of computers to
cut back on crowding, set a mandatory closing time of 2 a.m. and
require surveillance cameras. Cafe owners who spoke said they planned
to buy the cameras anyway.</LD>
<LD>   The changes follow several criminal incidents, mostly in parking
areas; the most serious was the Dec. 30 stabbing death of a
20-year-old outside the PC Cafe on Garden Grove Boulevard. A
21-year-old suspected gang member has been charged with murder.</LD>

<HD>Will Irvine Co.'s Sacred Heritage Trump Native Americans'?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Orange County need another 2,500 homes near Turtle Rock?</LD>
<LD>   Absolutely. How else are we going to fill up the San Joaquin Hills
toll road or the parking lots at Fashion Island?</LD>
<LD>   If that's not a good-enough reason for you, there's not much more
I can say.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, however, an unexpected element was added to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   A small wall carving--clearly the relic of the ancient Indian
civilization that inhabited the area--has been found on land that
would be bulldozed for modern-day development.</TE>
<TE>   That has led to this seeming mismatch: local American Indian
groups that say the carvings are part of a sacred heritage versus the
Irvine Co. landowner, which views building new homes as part of a
sacred heritage.</TE>
<TE>   In a contest like that, it's inconceivable that I'd side with the
Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   And yet ...</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not partial to another 2,500 homes.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, I'm aware that Juaneno and Gabrielino Indians--both
still represented in Orange County--first inhabited the area. Local
lore has it that the Gabrielinos named the actual rock Turtle Rock in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, they've laid claim in a spiritual sense to the now
suburbanized Turtle Rock community, all the while agonizing over what
has been built atop their hallowed ground.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, I got an e-mail from Kathy Sandoval, who describes
herself as cultural liaison with the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians
in South County.</TE>
<TE>   I've been unable to hook up with her, but her e-mail speaks
eloquently: "Today, I look out from my eyes and see all the giant
machines slowly methodically changing the face of this Earth," she
writes. "I feel like a tiny voice that cannot be heard."</TE>
<TE>   She's writing specifically about the proposed tollway in South
County, but it could just as easily be directed at home construction
on original Native American land.</TE>
<TE>   There is no disputing the power of Sandoval's lament.</TE>
<TE>   But what to do when the source of the dispute is a small etching
on a small cave wall? Archeologists have described the Turtle Rock
discovery as little more than a doodle--a wavy line 4 inches long
with a circle at one end.</TE>
<TE>   Does it mean anything? Does it mean nothing?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it means something, but published reports so far
indicate that even experts can only guess at what it is.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the threshold has to be higher.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first finding in the county that links us to an
ancient people--some reports indicate the civilization may go back
more than 2,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   For historical reasons--if not out of simple respect--a lasting
legacy of that civilization should be maintained.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, the Irvine Co. has publicly acknowledged the need
to preserve many Indian sites and has pledged to do so. It also has
demonstrated in the past that it is quite willing to build atop
Indian burial sites (the remains were relocated), so the company's
record is mixed.</TE>
<TE>   The vexing question, however, is whether every site where people
once lived, farmed and walked must be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   My heart says yes; my head something else.</TE>
<TE>   I won't lose a moment's sleep if the Irvine Co. decides to build
elsewhere. The burden of proof, however, lies with the Indian groups
to make the case for the sanctity of the land.</TE>
<TE>   As I always do with underdogs, I'd advise them to choose their
fights wisely, and with an eye toward winning the more important
battles.</TE>
<TE>   But because my viewpoint makes me uneasy, I'll give Sandoval the
last word. Again, she's writing about a proposal to extend a tollway,
but her words resonate beyond that:</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a tiny voice that cannot be heard. I have to scream
as loud as I can and not let despair silence me.... It seems as
though people want to develop every inch of land--every corner, field
and lot."</TE>

<HD>Water District Recruits Birds in Its War on Bugs</HD>
<DH>Vector control: Hoping to reduce pesticide use, the agency
installs 100 homes for insect-eating tree swallows along the Santa
Ana River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Central American swallow with a ravenous appetite for insects is
being courted by water quality officials who hope the tiny birds will
take up residence along the bug-rich Santa Ana River.</LD>
<LD>   To make the swallows feel welcome, Orange County Water District
officials on Tuesday unveiled a master-planned community for the
birds--a group of 100 blue-gray birdhouses in an area where the river
curves through Anaheim and Orange.</LD>
<LD>   It is hoped the tree swallows, which eat three times their weight
in insects a day, will breed and raise their young in the area. The
natural insect control program, which is already underway in
Riverside and San Bernardino counties and is being coordinated by the
water district, is intended to reduce the amount of pesticides needed
to combat the spread of insects.</LD>
<TE>   Just in time for the swallows' March and April breeding season,
biologists are hanging the nesting boxes about six feet off the
ground on posts as well as on eucalyptus, pine and willow trees along
the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can start building a master-planned community of
tree swallows this spring," said Patrick Tennant, an environmental
specialist with the water district.</TE>
<TE>   The small circular entrances on the boxes are designed for western
blue birds and tree swallows. The tree swallows--a greenish-blue bird
that grows to 6 inches in length--are common in wooded habitat near
water and where dead trees provide nest holes. They migrate in huge
flocks and linger farther north in the fall than other swallows.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically after tree swallows," said Dick Zembal, natural
resources director for the water district. "They're aerial acrobats.
They take insects right out of the air and eat hundreds and hundreds
a day.</TE>
<TE>   "When they're feeding their youngsters, they can really put a dent
in the insect population," Zembal said.</TE>
<TE>   Zembal said the bug population along the riverbed has been growing
at an annoying rate.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, we get complaint after complaint about mosquitoes and
gnats," Zembal said. "The gnats fly right up around your face, swarm
in numbers around your mouth, nose and eyes. And the mosquitoes are
the disease carriers."</TE>
<TE>   Biologists will monitor the wood bird boxes to ensure that bees
and even small mammals have not taken up residence in them. The water
district is asking residents to help build the start-up community by
hanging boxes themselves. The birdhouses cost about $20.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great Scout project or one for a homeowners
association," Zembal said. "Wherever there are people living [near]
the river in Orange County is where we are targeting."</TE>
<TE>   Zembal said it will probably take some time to evaluate whether
the program has been successful.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to perpetuate the program," Zembal said. "The
evaluation window is probably at least 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The district plans to put bands on the young swallows' legs to
track how many return the following year.</TE>
<TE>   But tree swallows might not be the only weapon against pesky
insects. The water district is considering installing shelters for
bats, which are also insect eaters. The district is also considering
constructing archways along the river to attract another
insect-loving bird--the cliff swallow, the same ones that return to
San Juan Capistrano every year.</TE>

<LD>New Jersey Net Coach Byron Scott was 22 in 1983 when he was the
first-round pick of the Clippers (then in San Diego) in the NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   When asked to whom he might compare his game, Scott replied, "Magic
Johnson," then added, "Except I'm quicker and can shoot better from the
outside."</LD>
<LD>  Mike Vaccaro of the Newark Star-Ledger recalls the conversation, about
four months later, when Scott was traded to the Lakers and showed up for
his first day in training camp.</LD>
<TE>  "You have a high opinion of yourself," Johnson told him. Scott replied,
"I was asked a question and I answered it."</TE>

<TE>  Trivia time: What do former NFL quarterbacks Joe Germaine, Paul Justin
and Chris Redman have that Dan Marino, Warren Moon and Jim Kelly don't?</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Straight talk: Shannon Sharpe, who had his NFL record of being on the
winning side in 12 consecutive playoff games come to an end Sunday, said
of the Baltimore Ravens' 27-10 loss to Pittsburgh that included four
costly turnovers:</TE>
<TE>  "You can't turn the football over like we did and expect to beat a
football team of that caliber. I'm not going to say that we were turning
the football over. They were turning us over."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Say what? After throwing six interceptions, three returned for
touchdowns, in the Green Bay Packers' 45-17 thrashing by the St. Louis
Rams, quarterback Brett Favre said: "I guess we can talk about, if we had
done this, or if we had done that, but if a chicken had lips, he'd
whistle."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Some slam: Karrie Webb will win the women's grand slam this year,
predicts Mike Lupica in T&amp;L Golf magazine.</TE>
<TE>  "That's the good news for women's golf," he wrote. "The bad news is
that no one, at least no one outside of women's golf, actually has any
idea which four tournaments that is."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Fair warning: The Southern Ute Indian tribe has pulled out of the
Winter Olympics opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>  Tribal spokeswoman Edna Frost said she feels the ceremony is a
potential terrorist target.</TE>

<TE>  Big job ahead: From an Indy Racing League release: "Lincoln Welder ...
has been named the Official Welder of the Indy Racing League and a
sponsor of the Indianapolis 500-mile race."</TE>
<TE>  Maybe it can weld the IRL and CART back together.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  It will happen: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle put his
stamp on referee Walt Coleman's instant-replay reversal of Tom Brady's
apparent fumble in the Oakland Raiders' overtime loss to the New England
Patriots:</TE>
<TE>  "It's two days later, and the real Miracle on Ice is that Al Davis
hasn't sued the NFL yet."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Corporate talk: Sports Illustrated Managing Editor Bill Colson
announced that he is leaving his job, but not until next month because he
wants to oversee one more Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>  "I guess that sounded better than one more swimsuit edition," quipped
Jay Leno.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Trivia answer: NFL championship rings.</TE>

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,

<LD>\f7    What: 1960: The Last Pure Season</LD>
<LD>   Who: Kerry Keene Sports Publishing Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Price: $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Bill Mazeroski's jubilant romp around the bases in Game 7 of the World
Series inspired Massachusetts baseball historian Kerry Keene to
reconstruct the 1960 season. A member of the Society for American
Baseball Research, Keene's workmanlike prose diligently unearths the
details of the season best remembered for Mazeroski's memorable home run
off Ralph Terry. But Keene's overall material is strictly for the slow
dance, and rather than place the season in a broader historical spectrum,
the book becomes bogged down in detail. The 1960 season, in fact, did not
signal the end of the Yankees' dynasty. Behind Roger Maris and Mickey
Mantle, New York won the World Series in 1961 and 1962. Mazeroski's home
run simply delayed the Yankees' decline, which started in 1964. The
Yankees did not win another pennant until 1976.</TE>
<TE>   However, Keene scores points for his passion. It was prime season for
a generation of hero-worshiping Baby Boomers. Maury Wills was redefining
the leadoff role, and Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax finished atop the
league in strikeouts. The Giants ushered in Juan Marichal. Ted Williams
left the game in poetic style, hitting a home run in his last at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   It's a solid effort, but don't look for perspective to prevail over
nostalgia. Keene's book reads like the back of a bubble-gum card, which
is OK if you don't mind the aftertaste.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Swimmer Moses Sets Two World Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Olympian Ed Moses set short-course world records in the 50-and
200-meter breaststrokes in a World Cup swim meet Tuesday at Stockholm.</LD>
<LD>   Moses was timed in 26.28 seconds in the 50, an impressive improvement
on the previous record of 26.70, set by Mark Warnecke of Germany on Dec.
11, 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Less than an hour later, Moses broke his 200 breaststroke mark by
finishing in 2:03.28. He had set the previous record of 2:04.37 on Friday
in a World Cup meet at Paris.</LD>
<TE>   "I warmed down and stayed focused [between the races]," Moses said.
"I'm surprised that I had both speed and strength tonight. The pool felt
very fast and the crowd was very supportive. I was shocked when I saw the
[200] time."</TE>
<TE>   Moses, 21, holds all three short-course records in the breaststroke.
He set the 100-meter record of 57.66 nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Three-time Olympian Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong were among seven
skiers selected to the U.S. Nordic combined team for next month's Salt
Lake City Olympics. Also selected were Johnny Spillane, Kristoffer
Erichsen, Matt Dayton, Jed Hinkley and Carl Van Loan.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bergoust, who last weekend clinched his second consecutive World
Cup aerials title, and moguls gold medalist Jonny Moseley will defend
their Olympic titles at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Bergoust and Moseley on the U.S. freestyle ski team are Brian
Currutt, Joe Pack, Evan Dybvig, Travis Mayer and Jeremy Bloom, a
scholarship football player who delayed his enrollment at Colorado for a
shot at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Park City residents Brenda Petzold and Tracy Evans will join Emily
Cook on the women's aerials team. The women's moguls team features Hannah
Hardaway, Shannon Bahrke, Jillian Vogtli and Ann Battelle, a 34-year-old
who made her fourth Olympics team.</TE>
<TE>   Cook may not be able to compete, however, because she dislocated two
bones in her foot last week.</TE>
<TE>   If she can't go, she probably will be replaced on the team by men's
aerialist Jeret Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   Not making the team was 36-year-old Donna Weinbrecht, the five-time
World Cup champion who was hoping to compete in her fourth Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   American Bode Miller won his third slalom race this season, finishing
with a combined time of 1:44.60 at Schladming, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is third in the overall World Cup standings, with 820 points,
and second in the slalom standings, with 480.</TE>
<TE>   Austrian Stephan Eberharter leads overall with 1,032 points.</TE>
<TE>Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Manager Tony La Russa, 57, agreed to a three-year contract and will
return for a seventh season with the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Angel right-hander Derrick Turnbow underwent surgery to have a pin
permanently inserted in his broken right forearm. Turnbow, 23, had a 4.74
earned-run average in 20 appearances for the Angels in 2000 and was
injured while pitching for double-A Arkansas last season.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Brian Daubach and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a
one-year contract worth $2,325,000, avoiding salary arbitration. Daubach
batted .263 last year with a career-high 22 home runs, 71 runs batted in
and 28 doubles. Daubach had asked for $2.5 million in arbitration and had
been offered $2.15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Jeff Weaver agreed to a $22-million, four-year contract
with the Detroit Tigers. Weaver, 13-16 with a 4.08 ERA last season, had
agreed Friday to a $2.35-million, one-year deal.</TE>
<TE>   Tuffy Rhodes, who tied Japan's season home run record with 55 last
season for Kintetsu and was the Pacific League's most valuable player,
agreed to a one-year contract with the Buffaloes for about $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>College Sports</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the NCAA board of directors opposes any suggestion
that student-athletes be paid or unionized because it would violate the
mission of colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   William E. Kirwan, president of Ohio State, called pay-for-play
proposals "a nonstarter."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a bad idea and it has nothing to do with cost," Kirwan said.
"Intercollegiate athletics were founded on the principle of students in
extracurricular activity. That principle has worked well for the most
part.</TE>
<TE>   "To pay athletes puts universities in the position of hiring people to
do a job, not to carry out the mission of the university."</TE>
<TE>   Kirwan supports stipends, perhaps $2,000 per athlete, for costs not
included in traditional scholarships that cover only tuition, fees, books
and board.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something I will continue to work on," Kirwan said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been suggestions that college athletes might be unionized.
Kirwan dismissed that suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Unions are perfectly respected in American society, but they have no
place in the university environment." Kirwan said.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback John Rattay, a backup at Arizona last season, has
transferred to Pasadena City College, Lancer Coach Tom Maher said.</TE>
<TE>Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Defender Marcelo Balboa of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, a
five-time Major League Soccer all-star and three-time World Cup player,
had arthroscopic surgery to remove torn cartilage from his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   German forward Birgit Prinz, 24, who finished fourth in the voting for
FIFA's 2001 world player of the year, signed with the Women's United

<HD>Rumsfeld Strongly Denies Mistreatment of Prisoners</HD>
<DH>Military: U.S. responds to growing world criticism of suspects'
conditions at Guantanamo prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rising to counter mounting criticism after months of favorable
world opinion for the war effort, U.S. officials forcefully denied
Tuesday that Al Qaeda suspects are being treated inhumanely at a
makeshift military prison in Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   In the last few days, critics ranging from members of British
Parliament to U.S. civil rights groups have accused the United States of
mistreating the detainees, who are being held in 8-by-8-foot wire cages
at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, and said they should be turned over to
legal rather than military authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The latest round of complaints apparently was triggered by photographs
released over the weekend by the Defense Department showing prisoners
bound and kneeling, wearing masks, earmuffs and goggles. The pictures
were taken as new prisoners were brought from a plane to a corridor near
their cells, and then asked to kneel so soldiers could remove their
earmuffs and other articles, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said
at the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   The restraints are used only in transit, he said, "where bad things
happen," citing the case of Al Qaeda fighters who recently killed the
Pakistani guards who were moving them.</TE>
<TE>   Those wearing masks were suspected of having tuberculosis, Rumsfeld
said. As for the earmuffs, some defense officials have voiced concern
about communication between the prisoners giving rise to a revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "Let there be no doubt," a visibly perturbed Rumsfeld said. "The
treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay is proper, it's humane, it's
appropriate and it is fully consistent with international conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "No detainee has been harmed. No detainee has been mistreated in any
way. And the numerous articles, statements, questions, allegations and
breathless reports on television are undoubtedly by people who are either
uninformed, misinformed or poorly informed."</TE>
<TE>   At the base, 158 detainees have been flown in and are being housed in
wire cages in what is dubbed Camp X-Ray, because the military guards can
see them at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Bill Costello said that, despite the continuing criticism,
the detainees are being fed well, treated by doctors when necessary and
soon will be ministered by a Navy Muslim cleric being dispatched to the
Caribbean base.</TE>
<TE>   Costello said the cages are temporary, adding that contractors and
Navy Seabees are busy erecting enough of the two-man cells to hold 2,000
detainees. He said that no orders have been received to build permanent
holding cells or courtrooms, should any military tribunals be held there.</TE>
<TE>   "We are constantly adding new things," he said. "Things are maturing
to a point and, while we've taken a few tumbles [in the press], things
are still moving along."</TE>
<TE>   The criticisms challenge the way the U.S. military is going about the
imprisonment, interrogation and prosecution of war prisoners, who are to
be tried by military tribunal--more than 50 years after military
tribunals were held at the end of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights has accused the Bush
administration of ignoring fundamental due process rights for the
detainees. The American Civil Liberties Union has argued the detainees
should be tried in the federal court system because the White House has
not shown that military tribunals will "advance justice or preserve
national security."</TE>
<TE>   Similar complaints have been raised overseas.</TE>
<TE>   In London, some government authorities have expressed concern about
the treatment of three British nationals incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay,
although a team of British observers reported to Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Monday that the British citizens had no complaints about their
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "If the British subjects are not accused of crimes in the United
States, they should be tried in the United Kingdom," said Kevin McNamara,
a Labour Party official. "And if they are tried in the United States,
they should not be subject to the death penalty or to a military
tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   In the Netherlands, some officials have begun demanding that the U.S.
afford the detainees the same rights as prisoners of war under the Geneva
Convention. "In the fight [against terrorism] we need to uphold our norms
and values," said Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Jozias van Aartsen.
"That applies to prisoners today."</TE>
<TE>   German authorities issued a statement criticizing the handling of
detainees, and in the Philippines, tensions are mounting over an
increased U.S. military presence to help local authorities combat
terrorism there.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross and other groups insist that the U.S. treat the
detainees under the Geneva Convention for war prisoners, which would
preclude American authorities from interrogating them. But Rumsfeld and
other Pentagon officials argue that the 158 males at Guantanamo Bay don't
qualify as POWs.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross officials visited the base late last week but have yet to
discuss publicly what they found.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, in the room where half-hour briefings usually start
and end on time, Rumsfeld spoke for more than an hour in a briefing
dominated by the detainee issue and volunteered to stay until all
questions were answered, although he eventually cut off remaining
questioners.</TE>
<TE>   The current prison is a makeshift affair to be replaced by
prefabricated units that would be more durable but not permanent, he
said. A contract now being considered by senior defense officials calls
for walled facilities with one wall of mesh wire that opens into a common
hall, like a standard prison.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even now, Rumsfeld said, the detainees have warm showers,
toiletries, water, clean clothes, blankets, "culturally appropriate
meals," prayer mats, medical care, exercise and writing materials.
Critics who liken their treatment to "torture" are spouting "utter
nonsense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon refuses to call them "prisoners," a status Rumsfeld and
others said confers legal rights on them. When questioned about that,
Rumsfeld repeatedly said he would defer to "the lawyers" at the Pentagon,
at one point noting that he had dropped out of law school.</TE>
<TE>   "We are giving them the treatment that is appropriate under the Geneva
Convention," he said. "I think that the legal questions I'm going to
leave to the lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, the military cleared a hurdle Tuesday when
a federal judge expressed "grave doubts" about whether he has
jurisdiction to act on a lawsuit challenging the detention of these
suspects in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, officials said John Walker Lindh of
California, the "American Talib," was en route to the United States,
where he will be turned over to the Justice Department. He has been
charged in federal court in Alexandria, Va., with conspiring to kill U.S.
nationals in the fight in Afghanistan, and also with providing support
and material to the Al Qaeda and other foreign terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   He has been held on the warship Bataan. Because he will not be tried
by the military, he won't be sent to Cuba. "He will go where they want
him," Rumsfeld said.</TE>

<HD>'Safe,' Though Smelly, Senate Offices Reopen</HD>
<DH>Attacks: Workers return to freshly scrubbed Hart building. Anthrax
forced its closure in October.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When Dianne Feinstein's staff walked back into their third-floor
suite Tuesday morning, it was as though time had stood still. The
calendars were turned to Oct. 17, the day the California Democrat and 49
of her colleagues were evacuated from the Hart Senate Office Building in
the throes of an anthrax attack.</LD>
<LD>   The fax machine had spent weeks spitting out a mountain of missives
that no one was there to read, finally sputtering to a stop when the
paper ran out. A wooden wall of shoebox-sized slots was stuffed with
correspondence three months old. Five hundred fifty e-mails had amassed
in one staffer's computer. Most of the plants were dead.</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing that kept moving was the clocks," said Jim Hock,
Feinstein's press secretary. He studied a curious residue on a piece of
paper that sat on a desk during the cleanup, which was ordered after a
letter laced with anthrax was opened in the office of Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's return marked a passage for Washington as the
million-square-foot complex reopened for business, a testament to the
resiliency of a federal government that endured a terrible autumn.</TE>
<TE>   When the doors closed that October day, no one imagined it would be
for so long. Thirteen Senate offices were ultimately deemed contaminated
in an attack in which deadly spores were sent through the U.S. mail,
killing five people across the East.</TE>
<TE>   Left behind in the rush to get out were senators' briefcases, computer
files, personal checkbooks and half-empty cups of coffee. The Washington
work force that serves half the U.S. Senate was abruptly displaced, flung
all over the Capitol complex. Republicans lent space to Democrats, and
vice versa. Workers made do with borrowed computers and not enough
phones. Some wondered whether life here would ever feel normal again.</TE>
<TE>   "Wooo-hoooo!" rejoiced Michele Hall, communications director for Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), as she walked back in, a trolley of boxes, files and
a roll of wrapping paper in tow. "I cannot put into words how good it is
to be back. It feels like going into the dorms after summer
vacation--except it smells a lot like a swimming pool."</TE>
<TE>   The smell was unmistakably abnormal, and people sniffed the air as
they cleared the security X-ray machines, endeavoring to describe it.</TE>
<TE>   "It smells like bleach," said one.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a new plastic toy."</TE>
<TE>   "It's that new car smell."</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the remains of the chlorine dioxide gas used to
decontaminate the place, or maybe the thorough scrubbing delivered this
weekend by work crews trying to restore a building weeks in hibernation.
Whatever it was, it was giving some people a headache and others a sore
throat, and some aides said they were less concerned about the anthrax
than the stuff used to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   "You know anthrax is a strong bacteria, so what took it out had to be
strong too," said Dan Kunsman, press secretary to Sen. Craig Thomas
(R-Wyo.). Kunsman returned to the office to find a 12-week-old apple and
banana that looked nothing like they did.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention declared the building "safe and clean,"
although they would not go as far as to say it was "risk-free."</TE>
<TE>   "Extraordinary measures have been taken using the safest technology
available to us . . . for the lowest possible risk that can be achieved,"
Dr. Patrick Meehan of the CDC said at a news conference. "But as with any
public health problem, we cannot eliminate any risk entirely."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the staffers came back. Daschle said he knew of no one in the
Hart building's 5,000-member work force to resign out of safety concerns.
But a twinge of ambivalence was in evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said he was going in "with
confidence and a prayer."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) led his office entourage into the building in
a demonstration of his good faith, however measured. "It feels fine. This
is good for government," he said, adding later, "I think we are all
waiting for the next shoe to drop."</TE>
<TE>   The worker sentiment was probably best described by the ebullient
Hall, who whooped for joy to be back herself but had no intention of
letting her children visit any time soon: "They are 5 and 7, and they
were concerned about me going back. I told them I felt safe--but I won't
be bringing them back here for a long, long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   The building's reopening was delayed several times, most recently last
week when a bag with gloves and a protective suit--left behind by the
cleanup crew--was discovered above a hallway ceiling outside the Daschle
suite, prompting another flurry of precautions. The delay made Tuesday's
homecoming all the sweeter.</TE>
<TE>   "So this is a great day. It's good to be back," Daschle said. "It's
good to be confident that we can return to normalcy. And it is good that
the Senate is working again with all eight cylinders."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle made the pronouncement at noon as he officially reclaimed the
building but not his infected office. Stripped of all furniture, the
walls knocked down, it is free of spores but will take weeks to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   After 45 minutes inside, a lot of people said they felt as though they
had never left. The phones started ringing again. The cafeteria churned
out chili.</TE>
<TE>   But the day-to-day rituals remained small reminders that something is
different. Hall's job description now includes opening the mail, a task
now deemed too dangerous for a volunteer or an intern like the one who
opened the Daschle letter Oct. 15. "My job went from mundane to
life-threatening overnight," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the building's closure, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) lost
two plants he was given at the funerals of his parents years ago. The
palms that graced the building's sun-splashed atrium also died of thirst.
The California flag in Feinstein's conference room is an odd yellow now;
her aides wonder whether it's from the gas. And just last week they
received Christmas invitations that were not only late but discolored and
brittle from post office irradiation.</TE>

<HD>The Coal Miners' Dark Fate</HD>
<DH>China's pits, the world's most productive, have become the
deadliest as Communist controls give way to private enterprise and lax
safety standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PODI, China
</DL>
<LD>It happened on the 4-to-midnight shift.</LD>
<LD>   Above ground, there was only a muffled sound and a jerk on the pulleys
that move coal up from the earth. Underground, there was an inferno.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw two people run out screaming, 'The people at the bottom are
done for!' " said Ren Tao, 19, who ran the pulleys the day of the
explosion here in November. "Their faces were covered in black. Some of
them were so shaken they kept throwing up and crying. Their brothers and
uncles were still down below."</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Ren's pulleys brought up carts filled not with coal but
with corpses. "I was terrified," he said.</TE>
<TE>   China leads the world in coal production--and in lives lost in the
mines. About 5,400 coal miners perished in explosions and other accidents
during the first 11 months of last year, the government reported last
week. Some estimates put the annual death toll at 10,000. That compares
with about 30 mining deaths a year in the United States, which ranks a
close second to China as a coal producer.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage reflects the troubled state of some heavy industries in
China as the Communist government loosens control of the economy and
allows more private enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   The miners of yesterday were state employees, relatively well-paid and
well-respected pillars of the socialist motherland. Today, more and more
are working for private mines with minimal or no safety standards,
subsisting on the dark side of the new economy, lucky to have jobs at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "Coal miners' lives are pure heartache," said Li Ziqi, who escaped
death in the November blast because he had worked an earlier shift.</TE>
<TE>   Li lives in China's coal mining capital--the mountainous Shanxi
province in the north. This impoverished region produces one-third of the
roughly 1 billion tons of coal that China mines each year, feeding an
insatiable demand for low-cost energy and generating desperately needed
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In November, at least 100 workers died in five accidents in Shanxi's
mines. The biggest blast, at the Podi mine Nov. 15, killed 33 miners and
wounded 12.</TE>
<TE>   For China as a whole, mining deaths declined slightly last year
compared with 2000, according to government figures. Yet tragedies remain
commonplace. Last week, at least 50 miners were reported killed in
accidents in three provinces.</TE>
<TE>   The high number of accidents "indicates that an uphill battle to
improve work safety still awaits us this year," Zhang Baomin, general
director of the State Administration of Work Safety, told the China Daily
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   In the days of the centrally planned economy, large state-owned coal
mines, though inefficient, guaranteed steady incomes for the nation's 8
million miners and provided social services.</TE>
<TE>   The shift toward a more competitive economy in the last two decades
forced many of these money-losing enterprises out of business, throwing
as many as 2 million men out of work.</TE>
<TE>   In place of many state mines came smaller, profit-driven operations
that capitalize on an abundant supply of cheap labor made up of the
laid-off miners and impoverished farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Many private mines reduce not only wages but also safety standards.
They tend to carve out more workstations underground, have fewer exits
and operate fewer of the ventilation fans needed to remove natural gas
fumes--responsible, according to one report, for half the explosions in
Chinese mines. Private mines also tend to have fewer safety inspections
and less safety training for employees.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, as many as 80,000 small coal fields were burrowed
across this vast land, making government oversight extremely difficult.
Beijing has shut down thousands of facilities--including the Podi mine
after the explosion--but at least 23,000 remain open, most of them
private.</TE>
<TE>   The more mines the government closes, the more profitable it is to
break the law. When production goes down, the price of coal goes up. To
avoid detection, some small unlicensed mines operate only at night.
Others don't bother with such precautions and run 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   Local governments do little about the illegal operations because they
provide jobs--and, at times, bribes.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, China can go only so far in shuttering unsafe mines
because it is the world's largest consumer of coal, using more than
one-fifth of the global total each year, slightly above U.S. consumption
levels. Until cheaper alternative sources of energy become viable for
homes and businesses, China will depend on coal to power its breakneck
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the fear of social unrest. As dangerous as the jobs are,
they are the best employment most miners can find.</TE>
<TE>   Li, the Podi miner, said the November disaster would not deter him
from working underground.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I plan to go back down," the 33-year-old father of two
said. Since he lost his job a few years ago at a large state mine, where
he had worked since he was 17, Li has toiled at several private
operations and narrowly skirted death in two explosions.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already found a new job at another mine," Li said. "My family
needs the money. I don't know how to do anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The Podi mine had been a bustling enterprise. It cranked out more than
100 tons of coal a day running three full shifts without an operating
permit. Locals say the mine suffered a deadly accident a couple of years
ago but reopened last year without any improvements in safety.</TE>
<TE>   Poor ventilation and a lack of sufficient exit routes contributed to
the November accident and deaths, according to local mine workers. "If
they are supposed to have 10 ventilators, you would be lucky if there
were five," Li said.</TE>
<TE>   The larger state-owned mines could afford more sophisticated equipment
and better safety procedures. "Now we work with 1950s technology," Li
said. "It's like going back in time." Even private mines that inherited
more advanced technology often find it cheaper not to use it.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is heaven and earth," said Li Yansheng, a former coal
industry official in Shanxi, comparing the old state mines with the
private ones. "Think of a fancy four-star hotel restaurant versus a snack
stand at a train station."</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors are supposed to check for safety violations at all mines at
least once a month.</TE>
<TE>   "If they came several times a year, that would be a lot," said Li
Jiesheng, 53, a retired miner. "And when the inspectors do come, they are
often whisked straight away to a banquet and stuffed with red envelopes
of money."</TE>
<TE>   "Deng Xiaoping said, 'Let some people get rich first,' " he said,
referring to the late architect of China's economic reforms. "They got
rich all right, by breaking the law. We miners have no human rights. We
don't even have the right to exist."</TE>
<TE>   The pay at most mines is based on how much coal the worker digs. The
strongest and most experienced miners can make more than $120 a month,
about double the average local wage.</TE>
<TE>   At the state mines, the veterans recalled, recruits received at least
three months of training and workers were given a new set of uniforms
each year. Now, newcomers start work the day they arrive and learn as
they go.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Podi, the mine remains closed. The shaft is nailed shut. The
tracks leading out of the abyss have been torn up. Snow drapes large
mounds of abandoned black coal. The workers, most of them migrants from
elsewhere in China, have left.</TE>
<TE>   Guo Junxian lost her husband, Li Jicheng, in the accident. "The whole
family depended on his wages, the young and the old," Guo, 39, said from
her threadbare home in a snow-covered village near Podi. "Who told us to
be poor? He had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   The onetime farmer turned to mining because he could not harvest
enough crops to support his wife and three children. After working at
three mines, he was hospitalized with a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he could get out of bed, Li went to work at the Podi mine.
At first he was a cook, but the pay was low, his wife said. So he put on
a helmet and went underground.</TE>
<TE>   Other men in his family--his brother, father-in-law and two
brothers-in-law--made the same choice. They have survived so far.</TE>
<TE>   The day of the accident, Li left for work after lunch. Guo was
expecting him back sometime after midnight, when he would eat his second
hot meal of the day. She had packed him a salty pancake for the road.</TE>
<TE>   The next time he emerged from the mine, it was as one of the 33 bodies
burned beyond recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "Their faces were torched. Their torsos were blood-red," Li Ziqi
recalled as Guo sobbed in the next room, warmed by a coal stove. "The
only way you could tell who they were was by reading the tag on their
belt."</TE>

<HD>GOP Rivals for Governor Debate Their Differences</HD>
<DH>Politics: Televised event is first prolonged statewide exposure for
the three candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE
</DL>
<LD>The three top Republican candidates for governor Tuesday night
steered a civil course through their first debate, politely parsing their
differences over issues ranging from abortion to campaign finance to
illegal immigration.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-minute encounter offered Californians their most prolonged
exposure to Richard Riordan, Bill Jones and Bill Simon Jr. since the
campaign began.</LD>
<LD>   Each used the opportunity to deliver well-honed lines. Former Los
Angeles Mayor Riordan called for greater inclusiveness. Secretary of
State Jones touted his record at the state level. Businessman Simon
extolled his performance in the private sector and as a former federal
prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   Each had to defend himself at different times. Riordan sought to
minimize his past contributions to Democratic campaigns and came out
forcefully against gay marriage, just days after indicating he had an
open mind on civil unions such as those legalized in Vermont. Jones tried
to explain how he would pay for a costly new anti-terrorism program
during an economic slowdown. Simon defended his failure to vote in
several past elections.</TE>
<TE>   For the candidates, Wednesday's debate represented a rare opportunity
in a short statewide primary campaign. The race only began in earnest in
early January, and it concludes on March 5, leaving the Republican
contenders with nine weeks to establish themselves in the minds of
voters.</TE>
<TE>   That creates especially difficult challenges for Simon and Jones, who
trail Riordan in polls and in cash on hand to pay for advertising in the
campaign's final, crucial weeks. Those two, however, carry a message more
in line with the sentiments of conservative Republicans--both oppose
abortion rights, for instance, while Riordan takes the opposite view--and
either might benefit from a low turnout election in which only more
committed party stalwarts make it to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The debate was broadcast live across the state, making it by far the
biggest event of the little-noticed campaign so far.</TE>
<TE>   Although not participating in Wednesday's debate, Gov. Gray Davis and
his record were pilloried from the outset. The three GOP hopefuls used
their opening statements to paint an unremittingly grim portrait of
California: a place where schools are failing, the economy is tanking,
traffic is choking the roadways and the future is mortgaged to exorbitant
energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis "fumbled, fiddled and failed our state," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although they agreed on that much, the quibbling among the
Republicans--all of them dressed in dark suits and white shirts--began
from the first question. Simon called himself "the candidate of ideas"
and claimed to be the first one to talk about the state's projected
budget shortfall. "Dick has not yet come out with a budget plan," said
Simon, a friend of Riordan who has generally stayed away from criticizing
him.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan replied by citing his intention to hire "the best and
brightest" to solve California's problems, which brought a tart rejoinder
from Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not good enough just to hire the best and the brightest," said
Jones, the most aggressive of the three candidates for most of the
evening. "You have to have some vision and leadership, and you have not
given the people of California in this campaign so far any indication of
what are the issues and how you believe we should deal with those."</TE>
<TE>   After months of tussling at long distance, each candidate entered the
University Theatre at San Jose State with a distinct objective.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, the goal was to avoid the kind of gaffe that has plagued
him on the campaign trail and led even supporters to fret about his
political durability.</TE>
<TE>   He did misspeak at one point, referring to the minimum wage as "the
minimum tax" in coming out for the first time against an increase at the
state level.</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared ill at ease for much of the debate, frequently
stealing glances at a yellow legal pad on the table in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, the candidate with the thickest government resume and the
thinnest wallet, the hourlong session was an opportunity to raise his
profile and try to knock Riordan off his front-running stride.</TE>
<TE>   He used his closing statement to concisely articulate his vision for
California: "Fewer crime victims, better educated children, healthier
families and an economy that's strong enough to generate jobs for all
that want them."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his personal fortune and well-known family name, Simon entered
the debate as the least known of the three GOP hopefuls. As a result, the
debate presented a chance to prove himself a serious contender waging
more than a vanity campaign. He offered by far the most detailed
explanation of how he would seek to make up the state's estimated
$12-billion budget gap. He proposed, as he has in less well-attended
sessions, a 15% across-the-board reduction in the state's operating
budget, with law enforcement exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the debate, Riordan was forced to defend a number of
positions that stray far from GOP orthodoxy, on issues such as abortion
and public benefits for people who are in the country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   He called for removing anti-abortion rights language from the state
GOP plank. "We need a platform that's going to respect differences of
opinion if we're going to get Republicans elected."</TE>
<TE>   Jones steered clear of the question, suggesting that there was little
a governor can do on abortion now that the issue has been largely settled
at the federal level. But Simon stated flatly, "We need to stick to our
principles" and said he opposed removing the anti-abortion language from
the party platform.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates differed slightly on campaign-finance reform, with
Jones and Simon embracing the concept and Riordan sounding a cautionary
note. "We have to take a hard look at it," he said, because so many
proposals tend to favor incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates disagreed more explicitly on providing health care to
immigrants who have come to California illegally. While all stated the
importance of enforcing the nation's immigration laws, Riordan said
everyone in California--regardless of how they arrived--"has a God-given
right to have a quality education and quality health care."</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Simon both voiced their sympathies for children, but said it
was the wrong time to discuss expanding the availability of health care.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not make promises we cannot keep," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must make sure that we prioritize in the proper fashion," Simon
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   In his first campaign for public office, Simon was forced to defend
himself for failing to vote in several of the state's primary elections.
Jones, who is California's chief elections officer, said politicians are
role models for young people and chided Simon, "It's not enough to just
talk about [voting]. You have to exercise that right."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who has given more than $1 million to various Democratic
campaigns and causes, repeatedly asserted his GOP credentials and
explained his actions as necessary to help Los Angeles, where Democrats
are the overwhelming majority.</TE>
<TE>   "As mayor of Los Angeles, I had to get along with Democratic
administrations in Washington and Sacramento for the benefit of my city,
and I'm not sorry that I did."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates have two more debates set, one on Feb. 9 at the state
GOP convention in San Jose and the second on Feb. 22 at Cal State Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is running essentially unopposed on the Democratic side and will
face the winner of the GOP primary in the Nov. 5 general election.</TE>

<LD>Peggy Lee, whose soft, rhythmic voice and purring sensuality made
her a favorite of jazz and pop audiences for half a century, has died.
She was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Lee, who had been in declining health since a stroke three years ago,
died of a heart attack Monday night at her home in Bel-Air, said her
daughter, Nicki Lee Foster.</LD>
<LD>   She was best known to a broad audience for songs that became her
trademark, such as "Fever," and the Grammy-winning "Is That All There
Is?" But Lee also was a gifted songwriter and arranger.</LD>
<TE>   She also was the well-known voice of Peg in the Disney film "Lady and
the Tramp" and won a $2.3-million lawsuit against the Walt Disney Co. to
recoup royalties from videocassette sales of that movie.</TE>
<TE>   A fine actress, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as
an alcoholic blues singer in the 1955 film "Pete Kelly's Blues."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the voice that captivated generations of audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't feel a thrill when Peggy Lee sings, you're dead, Jack,"
jazz critic Leonard Feather said some years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz singer Cleo Laine said Lee "came from a big-band era and knew how
to swing. She knew how to sing on the beat when necessary. A lot of
people don't know how to do that. Her simplicity had a lot of nuances
that other people just couldn't grasp, that they just couldn't imitate to
save their lives," Laine said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Krall, one of the leading singers in jazz today, offered similar
praise.</TE>
<TE>   "I love everything about her: her elegance, her wit. And she is one of
the greatest influences in what I do as an artist," Krall said in a
statement released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's work seemed to transcend changing tastes.</TE>
<TE>   "She was never part of any kind of fashion," said jazz critic Nat
Hentoff. "She never engaged in pyrotechnics. She was subtle and enticing
in contrast with the belters who show off everything but their
musicianship.</TE>
<TE>   "She had some of [Maurice] Chevalier's ability to connect with the
audience to make them think she was singing just to them."</TE>
<TE>   Born Norma Dolores Egstrom in Jamestown, N.D., Lee was the seventh of
eight children. Her mother died when she was 4, and her father, a railway
agent, married a woman who by all accounts was physically and emotionally
abusive to her stepchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted by the abuse at home and encouraged by the recognition she
received in her school glee club and the church choir, Lee decided to
pursue singing. Still a teenager, she found work on a radio station in
Fargo, N.D., where the station manager changed Norma's name to Peggy Lee.</TE>
<TE>   At the age of 17, she left Fargo for Hollywood, arriving with $18 in
her pocket. She got small singing gigs, but took jobs as a waitress and
worked in a carnival midway.</TE>
<TE>   Discouraged, she returned to the radio job in Fargo and eventually
made her way to Chicago, where she got her break.</TE>
<TE>   Lee was singing at the Ambassador West Hotel when Benny Goodman, on
the advice of his wife, stopped in to hear her one night.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe he was sitting there listening to me," she
recalled years later in an interview with Howard Reich of the Chicago
Tribune. "See, I was a big fan of his. . . . So here was Benny Goodman in
the room . . . and Benny had a funny way of chewing on his tongue and
staring at you at the same time. So when you were performing, you
couldn't really think that he loved it. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Of course at the time, I didn't realize that I was really
auditioning, that Benny was looking for a replacement for Helen Forrest,
who had left the band. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "When I was told that Benny was offering me a job, I thought it was
some kind of joke."</TE>
<TE>   After some initial unpleasantness with Goodman fans who wanted to hear
Forrest, the 21-year-old Lee settled into her new job.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a beautiful dream," she told Reich. "I would sit there on
the bandstand, night after night, just reveling in the music. I could
hear the arrangements over and over and never got tired of them."</TE>
<TE>   Lee's work with the Goodman band yielded several hits, including
"Blues in the Night," "The Way You Look Tonight," and "Why Don't You Do
Right."</TE>
<TE>   Her time with the Goodman band also yielded another benefit: her first
husband, Dave Barbour, a guitarist with the band.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Goodman band in 1943, she had hits with records such
as "That Old Feeling," and with three songs she composed with Barbour:
"It's a Good Day," "Don't Know Enough About You" and "Manana (Is Soon
Enough For Me)."</TE>
<TE>   The 1950s were a particularly active time in Lee's career. She made
several popular recordings for Capitol, wrote the title song for the 1954
film "Johnny Guitar," and wrote songs for other films, including "Tom
Thumb."</TE>
<TE>   "Fever" with its spare jazz arrangement was released in 1958 and
helped establish her as an artist who could cross into the pop field.</TE>
<TE>   She had film roles as well, appearing in the 1953 version of "The Jazz
Singer" opposite Danny Thomas. She was nominated for an Academy Award for
best supporting actress for "Pete Kelly's Blues."</TE>
<TE>   "I loved acting." she later said, "But my agents never brought me
another script. I was worth a lot more to them on the road."</TE>
<TE>Legal Battle Over Royalties</TE>
<TE>   Her most memorable role of that period came in her off-screen work on
Walt Disney's "Lady and the Tramp." With Sonny Burke, Lee co-wrote the
song "He's a Tramp" and provided the voice for "Peg" as well as three
other characters: Darling, the woman who owns Lady, and Si and Am, the
malicious Siamese cats.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt asked if I would mind if they named the character [Peg] after
me, then explained the reason for the request," Lee told The Times some
years ago. "Mamie Eisenhower was our first lady at the time, and she
always wore bangs. . . . The little dog has bangs and her name in the
script was Mamie, so Walt was afraid someone might think we were being a
little less than polite about the first lady. That's why I have the honor
of having the character named after me."</TE>
<TE>   It was her work in "Lady and the Tramp" that led decades later to one
of the biggest fights in her life.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, she won a legal judgment against Disney after she sued for a
portion of the profits from the videocassette sale of the movie, citing a
clause in her contract with the studio barring sale of "transcriptions"
without her consent.</TE>
<TE>   And just last week, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge gave
preliminary approval to a $4.75-million settlement between Vivendi
Universal's Universal Music Group and as many as 300 artists in a battle
over royalties. Lee was the lead plaintiff in that suit, stemming from
her years recording for Decca, which Universal now owns after a series of
takeovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised if she thought, 'I accomplished that. That
was the last big thing. Now I can go,' " her attorney, Cyrus V. Godfrey,
said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lee had told him, Godfrey said, that "the case was important to
resolve the issues not only for herself but for other artists."</TE>
<TE>   Though Lee will be remembered for her sultry, sophisticated stage
presence, she was still a North Dakota farm girl.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of down-to-earth that was part of her too," said
Foster, her daughter. Until her health began to decline, she was an
excellent cook and an avid gardener.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a terrific sense of humor, an absolutely fabulous one,"
Foster said. Her mother even expressed that sense of humor in a song
about her childhood abuse in her song, "One Beating a Day."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it took her a long time to get over and deal with that part
of her life," Foster said. "But once she was able to put it behind her,
she was even able to joke about it. And of course, there's very little
humor in something like that."</TE>
<TE>   But her real gift was the music and her ability to connect with an
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Her phrasing and her style musically were impeccable," said Jerry
Leiber, who with Mike Stoller wrote one of Lee's Grammy-winning songs "Is
That All There Is?"</TE>
<TE>   'She was very measured, even mannered, but still a great swinger. So
much was contained, and yet you could sense the wildness in the swing."</TE>
<TE>   Lee once told an interesting story about the imagery that her voice
elicited.</TE>
<TE>   Songwriter "Alan Wilder used to make a strange analogy about my
voice," Lee said. "He said I had a voice like a streetwalker you'd walk
past, but if you ever stopped, you'd never leave. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I don't exactly think of myself as a streetwalker, but I think I
know what he means: the sensuousness."</TE>
<TE>   Her marriage to Barbour ended in divorce, as did marriages to actors
Brad Dexter and Dewey Martin and musician Jack Del Rio.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, Lee is survived by grandchildren David
Foster, Holly Foster-Wells and Michael Foster, and by three
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Enron Audit Fee Raises Some Brows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fee Enron Corp. paid the Andersen accounting firm to audit its
books was one of the richest in corporate America, a fee that reflects
the complexity, and possibly the risk, inherent in the job.</LD>
<LD>   Enron paid Andersen $25 million for the year 2000 audit, a figure
higher than all but one of the companies in the Dow Jones industrials
that reported their audit fees. The average charge among the blue chips
was just $9 million, according to a review of such fees by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   It also was large compared with the fees other energy companies paid
their accountants, even Andersen. In a review of fees listed in
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, The Times found that audit
contracts averaged $3 million at nine large energy companies, including
Andersen clients Mirant Corp., UtiliCorp United Inc., Dynegy Inc. and
Calpine Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's fee was a red flag to some experts and critics who say it
could have clouded the company's judgment as it examined Enron's tangled
financial structure. The high fee no doubt reflected the difficulty of
the audit, but it also may have hinted that Enron's finances contained
unknown risks. Indeed, Andersen executives debated internally whether the
audit and other fees would be perceived as a breach of the firm's
independence.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman defended the fee, saying it reflected the size
and complexity of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very sophisticated business," Andersen spokesman David
Tabolt said. "The fee is set by the scope of the audit and the kind of
people that have to be brought in to do the work. There are a whole lot
of factors that go into it."</TE>
<TE>   Tabolt said the audit fee was in line with those of Enron's peers--the
top 10 companies in the Fortune 500. But even by that standard, the fee
was large.</TE>
<TE>   The nine other companies at the top of that list paid an average of
$14.5 million for their audits. Only Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest
financial services company, paid more than Enron: $26.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Enron were looked at as a financial services company, the fee
it paid was unusual. The Times examined the fees of seven large financial
services companies--including Citigroup, American International Group,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.--and found that the
average audit charge was $15.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Several accounting professors and industry insiders said the high fees
could be an indicator of the complicated nature of the Enron audit or the
perceived risk of the account.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship between a client and its auditors is a complicated
thing because auditors get paid by the client but are supposed to be
independent," said Rick Antle, an accounting professor at the Yale School
of Management.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell your client 'no' too many times, you don't have a client.
But if you go along with everything they suggest, you could end up in
jail," said Antle, who added that there is insufficient information yet
to determine whether the high fees Andersen collected influenced its
judgment.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics of the accounting industry say the fees Enron paid
Andersen--including an additional $27 million for consulting work--and
the scandal arising from the audit highlight problems that include the
independence of auditors and how the business is marketed and sold.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that the fee clouded the minds of auditors, who were loath
to endanger Andersen's contract by forcing Enron to adhere to stricter
financial standards.</TE>
<TE>   The audit--and its failure to more fully disclose internal conflicts
of interest of Enron executives, billions of dollars in hidden debt and
hundreds of millions of dollars in losses--is now the subject of multiple
federal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Even top Andersen executives debated the propriety of the fees it was
collecting from Enron--which, including the consulting work, reached $1
million a week.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting almost a year ago, a group of the firm's top partners on
the Enron engagement and at Andersen headquarters in Chicago discussed
"whether there would be a perceived independence issue solely considering
our level of fees," according to a Feb. 6 internal e-mail summarizing the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The partners estimated that the combined take on the Enron audit and
consulting contracts could reach $100 million annually. Ultimately the
partners decided that they were not troubled by such a figure "as long as
the nature of the services was not an issue."</TE>
<TE>   The amount a firm charges for accounting services can be a warning
sign for audit problems, said Mark Cheffers, who operates the
AccountingMalpractice.com Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the Enron fee was large enough to have the potential to
color the judgment of the firm's staff, Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   But there is equal danger at the other end of the scale, where low
audit fees are designed to gain an accounting firm entry to a large
company so it can sell a host of profitable consulting and other
services, Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies only last year began disclosing what they paid auditors, and
there is not enough information yet to interpret what differences in fees
mean, said Lawrence Revsine, a Northwestern University accounting
professor.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say that when there is a $25-million audit versus a
$15-million audit, something rotten is afoot here, but we will be able to
as more information about audit fees comes out now and it is studied," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Revsine said researchers will look at how differences in a company's
number of locations, employees, complexity of transactions and other
factors can affect an audit.</TE>
<TE>   Audits are intended to provide independent verification that a company
is giving investors an accurate picture of its finances and that it is
following consistent and generally accepted accounting rules and
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's downfall, caused in part by the accounting treatment of a
series of partnerships and ventures affiliated with the Houston energy
trader, has thrown thousands of employees out of work and has cost the
company's pensioners and investors billions of dollars in stock value
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it would be a mistake to assume that all audited financial
statements go through the same type of scrubbing and are comparable, said
Ira Solomon, who heads the accounting department at the University of
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   For example, two identical companies with the same level of sales and
cost structures could have different profit figures based upon the way
they construct their financial statements. The cost of inventory can be
calculated by two methods that yield different results in the short term.
Each approach is an accepted practice, and each produces a different
profit figure, Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   J. Terry Strange, vice chairman, assurance and advisory services, for
accounting firm KPMG, which audits Citigroup, said it makes sense that
financial services companies pay higher audit fees than other companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The size of the fee is directly related to the size, and more
importantly, the complexity of the enterprise being audited," Strange
said. "Financial services companies are, generally speaking, the most
complicated businesses. The reason they are complicated is that they are
in the financial risk business.</TE>
<TE>   "So risk enters into [calculating an audit fee]--the nature of risk
that the enterprise takes and the amount of work that must be done to
become comfortable that the auditor understands and agrees with the
accounting and believes that the enterprise has controls in place to
manage the risk they are taking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By those standards, it would make sense that Enron would be an
expensive audit. The company in many ways operated as a financial
services business, developing new trading mechanisms and markets for
everything from energy to telecommunications services--in the process
inventing transactions that were new to the business world.</TE>
<TE>   With that came high risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly this was a very high-risk client. They were doing things in
an industry that had never been done before," said Randolph Beatty, dean
of USC's Leventhal School of Accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen spokesman Tabolt said the company does not build a "risk
premium" into its audit fees.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the five largest accounting firms conducts the audits of 2,000
to 3,000 publicly traded companies in the United States, according to the
Public Accounting Report, an industry newsletter. They so dominate the
business that the No. 6 firm in the country, BDO Seidman, has only 325
SEC-reporting clients.</TE>
<TE>   Although companies occasionally change auditors for such reasons as
fees or arguments or service issues, most companies stay with the same
auditor for years, occasionally putting their contracts out to bid.</TE>
<TE>   Certain firms specialize in industries. Andersen, which audits only
two of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average,
has a large energy business practice. PricewaterhouseCoopers specializes
in large companies and audits 14 of the Dow 30.</TE>

<HD>Federal Agents Probe Shredding Inside Enron</HD>
<DH>Energy: Inquiries will widen after wastebasket full of material is
discovered in Houston. Bush expresses outrage over harm to investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal agents opened an investigation Tuesday into the destruction
of documents at Enron Corp. headquarters in Houston after company
executives found a wastebasket full of shredded material in the company's
19th-floor accounting offices.</LD>
<LD>   The action came as President Bush for the first time expressed outrage
that employees and shareholders had not known all the facts about the
company's precarious position.</LD>
<LD>   "My own mother-in-law bought [Enron] stock . . . and it's not worth
anything now," he said. "If she had known all the facts, I don't know
what her decision would have been . . . but she didn't know all the
facts. And a lot of shareholders didn't know all the facts. And that's
wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Enron representatives disclosed Tuesday that they notified the Justice
Department after finding the shredded material late Monday. The company
searched the accounting offices after a former executive told news
organizations she witnessed shredding as recently as the second week in
January.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be an extensive investigation done under the auspices of
the Justice Department," said Ken Marks, an attorney representing the
company. He said there may be "completely innocent" explanations.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment. Bush
administration officials, however, said they understood that FBI agents
in Houston had gone to Enron headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators and the Securities and Exchange Commission
said Tuesday that they will widen their probes into the Enron collapse to
review the allegations of document shredding.</TE>
<TE>   "We are including the most recent document-destruction issue within
the scope of our investigation," Stephen Cutler, SEC enforcement chief,
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said his panel
also plans to examine the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   The president made his comments in response to reporters' questions as
he toured the Walker Machinery Co. plant in Belle, W.Va., during a day
highlighting efforts to right the struggling economy. His remarks were
among his most extensive on the unfolding Enron bankruptcy case and
reflected both a political sensitivity and a personal anger about the
course it is taking.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody has got an accusation about some wrongdoing, just let me
know," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   A deputy White House press secretary, Claire Buchan, said later that
Jenna Welch, Laura Bush's mother, lost more than $8,000 investing in
Enron. She bought 200 shares of Enron stock Sept. 21, 1999, paying $40.99
a share. She sold them for 42 cents each Dec. 4, 2001, two days after
Enron's declaration of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the case was creating a negative impression of his
policies, Bush said: "Our administration has done the exact right thing."</TE>
<TE>   The White House announced two weeks ago that Enron's chairman, Kenneth
L. Lay--a major donor to Bush's gubernatorial and presidential
campaigns--had contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce
Secretary Don Evans in October and November as his company's position
worsened.</TE>
<TE>   "My Cabinet officers said, 'No help here,' " Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely confident the American people know that my
administration has acted the right way," he added.</TE>
<TE>   He said the government must tackle the problems brought to the fore by
Enron's failure--particularly the way shareholders and employees were
kept in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "Our government must do something about it, must make sure that the
accounting practices that have been going on for quite awhile are
addressed, make sure there's full disclosure and the corporate governance
issues are wide-open for everybody to understand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm outraged about is that shareholders and employees didn't
know all the facts about Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 on the heels
of increasingly dire financial reports, including the fact that it
overstated earnings dating back to 1997 by nearly $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, congressional investigators said they would subpoena the
chief executive and other current and former executives with Andersen,
Enron's accounting firm, which previously acknowledged shredding
documents.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas signal a tougher stance by congressional investigators
looking into the collapse of Enron, ranked in the Fortune 500 as the
seventh-largest U.S. company.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know what documents were destroyed and who destroyed
them," Greenwood said, referring to the Andersen documents.</TE>
<TE>   A committee spokesman, Ken Johnson, said a subpoena was necessary
because fired partner David B. Duncan has indicated through his attorney
that "in all likelihood," he would invoke his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that he has important information," Johnson said. "We are
going to continue to insist on his appearance. Certainly, he provided
some detailed information to our investigators last week, and we would
like him to repeat his story under oath."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's attorney, Robert J. Giuffra Jr., said Tuesday night that he
had not received a subpoena from the committee and had made no final
decisions about Duncan's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood said the committee would frown on any refusal by Duncan to
answer questions under oath. He said Duncan's attorney requested, but did
not receive, immunity in exchange for his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly puts him in a bad light to profess his innocence and
then all of a sudden plead the Fifth," Greenwood said. He said the
committee might respond by seeking a resolution to find Duncan in
contempt of Congress, which carries a $100,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Duncan, Johnson said subpoenas would be served today on
Andersen Chief Executive Joseph F. Berardino, attorney Nancy Temple and
risk manager Michael C. Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said the CEO had not received a
subpoena but has told the committee that he would testify.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of when," Dorton said.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson said: "Mr. Berardino found the time to make his case
before the public last week on 'Meet the Press.' We believe it's
important that he find the time to make the same case before Congress as
well."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the committee was sending "friendly subpoenas" to Temple
and Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them have agreed to appear before the committee and cooperate
with our investigation," Johnson said. "They have confidentiality
concerns and would welcome the protection provided by a subpoena."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood's panel is trying to determine whether Enron or Andersen
officials destroyed evidence in an effort to obstruct investigations.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Thursday, members of Congress are expected to push
current and former Andersen employees to account for discrepancies in
their explanations for why thousands of documents related to Enron were
destroyed last fall, even after it was disclosed that the SEC was
investigating the energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who was fired by the accounting firm for allegedly
orchestrating the destruction, has told congressional investigators he
was following orders from Andersen's legal department.</TE>
<TE>   He said Andersen's Houston office received an "unusual" Oct. 12 e-mail
from Temple, reminding employees about the firm's policy regarding the
destruction and retention of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Temple and Andersen have insisted that the e-mail was a routine
"reminder" and should not have been interpreted as an instruction to
delete files.</TE>
<TE>   The document destruction by Andersen apparently ended after Duncan's
assistant sent a "stop the shredding" e-mail Nov. 9, the day after
Andersen received an SEC subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   The shredding of documents by Andersen was already a key issue in the
investigation when it was disclosed that documents had apparently also
been destroyed by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   William Lerach, one of the many attorneys who have filed lawsuits
against Enron's officers and directors, said Tuesday that the wastebasket
of destroyed documents found late Monday suggests "they were shredding
documents over there yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Lerach brought a big box of shredded Enron documents to display in
federal court Tuesday. He and other lawyers are seeking a ruling to
prevent further destruction of documents by Enron and Andersen, but no
ruling was immediately issued.</TE>
<TE>   Lerach got the ribbons of paper from Maureen Castaneda, an Enron
executive laid off Jan. 14. In television interviews, Castaneda said she
had taken the box of shreds home to use as packing material and then
realized its significance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearly accounting documents," Castaneda said on CNBC, saying
she noticed such words as "Jedi" and "Chewco," both of which are the
names for Enron partnerships at the center of the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, said: "We invited [the FBI] to
come to the building. We thought it was more appropriate for the FBI to
conduct an investigation than for the plaintiff's attorney to do so."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 22, the SEC began a formal inquiry into the company's
accounting practices. Three days later, Enron sent a series of four
e-mails to employees about preserving documents, which said that the
company's "normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately" and that employees should retain all documents related to
LJM and LJM2, two of its controversial partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the company specifically mentioned that any documents
related to its broadband services division should be saved. On Oct. 31,
the scope again was widened to many other deals, and employees were told
that company lawyers would be collecting all sorts of documents for
possible production in litigation, including "accounting for any Enron
investments."</TE>
<TE>   Marks, the Enron lawyer, said employees "were allowed in ordinary
course of business to discard business records that were not related to
the issue in this case."</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 14, an e-mail was sent to remind employees that "no company
records, either in electronic or paper form, should be destroyed."</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills Two in Jerusalem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: 14 injured as Palestinian fires wildly on a busy street.
Hamas vows 'an all-out war' after Israeli special forces kill four
militants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Choosing the busiest time of day on this city's busiest commercial
street, a Palestinian marched into downtown Jerusalem on Tuesday and
raked pedestrians, shoppers and people waiting at bus stops with bursts
of automatic gunfire until police shot him to death.</LD>
<LD>   Two Israelis were killed and 14 others seriously wounded in the
attack, which came hours after Israeli special forces killed four Islamic
militants in the West Bank city of Nablus and the dead men's
organization, Hamas, vowed "all-out war" on Israel.</LD>
<LD>   A conflict that has already claimed more than 1,000 lives in nearly 16
months is escalating to one of its most dangerous levels yet. With mutual
threats of harsh retaliation, each side accuses the other of pushing the
cycle of violence, hatred and revenge to the brink.</LD>
<TE>   In Nablus, Palestinian anger wasn't directed at Israel alone. After
the four Hamas activists were killed, hundreds of sympathizers stormed
the downtown Nablus prison and tried to scale the gates to demand the
release of about two dozen Palestinians held there by the Palestinian
Authority. At least one Hamas supporter was killed by Palestinian police
who opened fire on the rioters.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, rush hour was in full swing on bustling Jaffa Street
when a Palestinian later identified as Saeed Ramadan walked up to a cell
phone store and began shooting at people waiting for buses. The gunman
fired indiscriminately for up to 10 minutes before police chased,
confronted and killed him.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed Ramadan as
one of its own and said he was acting to avenge the recent killing of one
of the group's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Liat Moshe, a 24-year-old salesclerk at the phone store, said the
gunman carried his M-16 rifle slung across his back as he walked down
Jaffa Street, apparently not attracting much attention in a society that
is so security-conscious and so well-armed.</TE>
<TE>   "Until he shouted, 'Allahu Akbar' ['God is great'] and began shooting,
I thought he looked like a regular person," Moshe said. She immediately
took cover behind a counter as the gunman fired wildly, "like a maniac,"
she said. She saw an older woman across the street in a clothing shop
fall, stricken. The glass door of her own store shattered into thousands
of pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "It was scary, scary, scary," Moshe said, still trembling.</TE>
<TE>   Next door at the Koresh boutique, customers and salespeople ran to
hide in the back when the shooting started. The store's plate-glass
windows were peppered with bullet holes, but inside only the mannequins
had been hit. Bullets had severed the hand of one mannequin and pierced
her red suit jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrians dived for the sidewalks, and a number of civilians whipped
pistols from their belts and joined police in shooting at the gunman. He
sprayed bus shelters on both sides of the street, as well as at least one
bus loaded with passengers. Victims' blood was splattered on the
rain-drenched pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Police Sgt. Hanan Ben Naim was identified as the officer who killed
Ramadan. He said he heard the shooting and ran to an alleyway off Jaffa
Street where the gunman was trying to escape through a parking lot. At
about 20 feet apart, the two men shot at each other until Ramadan fell
dead, Ben Naim recalled. The 26-year-old policeman had been close enough
to the attacker to make eye contact, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw hate in his eyes," Ben Naim told reporters. "Calm, but full of
hate."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Naim is a member of a special team of police officers who work in
civilian clothes and patrol city centers on the lookout for terrorists.
He was dressed in jeans and tennis shoes, and he killed the Palestinian
with nothing more than a Jericho semiautomatic pistol.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw something tonight that it's better not to see," said Arie Zini,
40, who runs a health food store on Jaffa Street. "To know people do such
crazy things, to shoot at defenseless people. It's a pity that people can
sink to this level."</TE>
<TE>   Zini, who was in the Star cosmetics shop when the shooting started
nearby, said numerous Israelis charged the gunman, throwing him into a
panic and causing him to aim his gun wildly. Otherwise, Zini said, the
toll might have been higher.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred about half a block east of a pizzeria where a
Palestinian suicide bomber killed 15 people in August, and about half a
block west of the strip of cafes and snack shops where two suicide
bombers killed 11 young people last month.</TE>
<TE>   Each attack in this conflict has been answered by bloody payback, and
more violence is expected. Now, however, there is a sense of dread among
Israelis and Palestinians that the next phase of violence will be harsher
than before.</TE>
<TE>   An informal and less-than-perfect truce that Islamic militants were
observing has been shelved, and Arafat is saying he will no longer
restrain his forces because Israel has continued its offensive against
Palestinian positions. Since Israeli forces killed one of their leaders
last week, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade has shifted its attacks from the
West Bank and into Israel proper.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has made it clear he believes that
he has veritable carte blanche to fight the Palestinians; in recent days,
he has ordered the largest-ever incursions into Palestinian-controlled
territory and mounted a siege on Arafat the likes of which have not been
seen since the Palestinian leader's guerrilla-warrior days two decades
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat says his forces are fighting Israeli occupation. Sharon says
his forces are combating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In their raid Tuesday into Nablus, Israeli special forces backed by
tanks converged on a 26-unit apartment building about 3 a.m. and killed
four members of Hamas whom Israel had identified as notorious
bomb-makers. The Israeli army said four soldiers were wounded in a gun
battle with the Hamas men, who the Israelis said had started the exchange
by hurling an explosive at them.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials dispute the Israeli account and claim that at
least some of the men were shot in their beds as they slept.</TE>
<TE>   An examination of the bottom-floor apartment where the men were killed
suggests that the Israelis lobbed grenades or other explosives into the
bedroom. Shrapnel pockmarks and smoke smudges covered the ceiling and
walls, and two mattresses were soaked in blood; scores of spent M-16 and
lower-caliber cartridges were littered outside, below the windows.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it discovered an arsenal of explosives and
devices for rigging bombs inside the apartment. There was even a bottle
of shampoo with an explosive rigged inside, an army officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers had removed all of this, plus a computer, by the time
reporters were allowed inside.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the four men who were killed were on "most-wanted" lists that
Israel had given the Palestinians. Jasser Samaro and Nassim abu Ros had
been named by Israel as bomb-makers who supplied the weapons used in
attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   After news of the killings spread, hundreds of Hamas militants and
supporters stormed the prison.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas later issued a short, sharp statement: Tuesday's "massacre" will
open the door "to an all-out, deadly war" against Israel "everywhere, by
all means."</TE>

<HD>Volcano Survivors Begin Do-It-Yourself Recovery</HD>
<DH>Africa: Aid is still only trickling in to the disaster area in
Congo, and residents realize that 'all we have is each other.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOMA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>With aid from the international community slow to arrive in the
wake of a devastating volcanic eruption, residents set about to rebuild
their city Tuesday, constructing roads, restoring electricity and helping
one another restart their lives.</LD>
<LD>   "Nyiragongo can cover our homes with fire, but it cannot kill our
spirit," said Salome Kabasele, a 22-year-old Goman. "After all, we're
Congolese."</LD>
<LD>   Kabasele was referring to the nearby volcano that erupted last week,
covering nearly half of this lakeside city with burning lava, killing an
undetermined number of people and displacing hundreds of thousands of
others.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the day Tuesday, Kabasele hawked loaves of kwanga, a bread
made from cassava, to thousands of people who had crossed a sea of hot
lava rocks to reach their homes. By late afternoon, she had sold only one
of her 24 loaves.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people don't have money," she said, "so I'll have to give it to
my neighbors tonight. Most of them have not eaten in days, so maybe my
bad day is their good fortune."</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the disaster, the United Nations World Food Program
began distributing limited amounts of food outside Goma. Today, the
relief workers plan to distribute food rations, including high-protein
biscuits, inside the city.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials acknowledged Tuesday that they were slow to respond to
the disaster because they didn't know if Goma was safe after Thursday's
eruption.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said distributing food in the city would send a message to
Gomans that it is safe to return to an area that is being rocked dozens
of times a day by earthquakes, some as large as magnitude 5.</TE>
<TE>   U.N.-hired volcanologists said that the eruptions from Mt. Nyiragongo
are over for now but that it isn't possible to predict when the volcano
will strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "Nyiragongo is taking a small rest," said Dieudonne Wafula, the local
volcanologist who predicted last week's eruption a few days before it
happened.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, there was evidence that some people had suffered horrific
deaths. Reporters saw what appeared to be the skulls of two young
children lying in a bed surrounded by charred bones. Outside their home,
the carcass of the family dog rested on another pile of lava, a grimace
frozen on its face.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, young men swinging sledgehammers smashed massive lava
rocks, clearing a path where trucks dumped loads of black gravel. By
day's end, a new road was built, bridging a city sliced in two by the
lava flow.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Despines, who heads the International Rescue Committee in
Goma, said the relief group will use the new road to transport large
tanks of water to a once inaccessible area. "People are hungry and
thirsty," Despines said. "We're trying to move 100 mph to help them get
food and clean water."</TE>
<TE>   There were signs that despite the disaster, many Gomans were trying to
bring some sense of normality to their lives. A man barbecued his
family's dinner, a goat, on the hot lava. Another family swam in Lake
Kivu, not far from where lava was still seeping into the water, creating
large clouds of steam.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials in Geneva said they will ask donors for $15 million to
help victims. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees plans
to distribute 75,000 blankets, cooking sets, plastic sheets and other
supplies for families who have been forced to sleep outside, said Paul
Stromberg, an agency spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Many victims shared what little food and shelter they had with friends
and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Kabwe Tshingoma, a 22-year-old law student, said he and his
nine-member family returned home from Gisenyi, Rwanda--a border town to
which hundreds of thousands of Congolese had fled--to find all their
furniture, food and clothing looted. Since then, the family has had to
rely on neighbors for food. In return, the family has provided shelter
for other neighbors whose homes were covered by the fast-moving lava.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to help each other," Tshingoma said. "Aid may come, but in
the end, all we have is each other."</TE>

<HD>Fight Is Vowed by Russian TV Staff</HD>
<DH>Media: But the mood is funereal as the outspoken station's
frequency goes to another channel hours after its closure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Crestfallen staff of the last nationwide television network free of
Kremlin control vowed Tuesday to fight to reopen it, but within hours of
TV6's closure, the station's frequency was allotted to an all-sports
station tempting viewers with the promise of live coverage of the
upcoming Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Mass Communications Minister Mikhail Y. Lesin said the frequency used
by TV6 until it was shut down early Tuesday had been given temporarily to
NTV Plus pending a formal March 27 tender to determine the final
licensee. The quick transfer of the frequency suggested that a plan had
been in place even before TV6 was ordered closed.</LD>
<LD>   TV6 staff members, some of whom continued to broadcast news Tuesday
over the Echo of Moscow radio station, said they will seek to line up
investors and mount a bid for the new license. But the mood was funereal
in the aftermath of the station's abrupt demise.</LD>
<TE>   "Frankly speaking, after what has happened overnight, I have no
particular illusions as to the outcome of the tender," said station
director general Yevgeny Kiselyov, interviewed on his former station,
NTV. "The license will most likely be granted to someone else, because
the authorities have demonstrated that they cannot abide this very team
of journalists."</TE>
<TE>   Closure of TV6 set off a mild debate among the nation's politicians,
but there was no sharp public reaction like the demonstrations of support
that occurred last March and April when the state-controlled gas monopoly
moved to take over NTV, which was owned by anti-Kremlin oligarch Vladimir
A. Gusinsky. (Many journalists who resigned in that controversy moved to
TV6.)</TE>
<TE>   There was a general mood of resignation that the Kremlin was
determined to get rid of TV6, which is owned by oligarch Boris A.
Berezovsky, an avowed political enemy of President Vladimir V. Putin. Its
journalists had long been a thorn in the side of the government for
sometimes caustic satire and a willingness to present an unauthorized
view of the government's war against rebels in the republic of Chechnya
and on other delicate issues.</TE>
<TE>   Boris Y. Nemtsov, head of the Union of Right Forces, a pro-market
party, said the journalists were bystanders in the fight between Putin
and Berezovsky. "Putin was fighting Berezovsky, but it is TV viewers and
the journalists who have fallen victims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   TV6, whose closure came about after a legal campaign by the Lukoil
pension fund, a minority stockholder, employed about 1,200 people and had
160 affiliate stations across Russia. On Tuesday, the local stations were
at a loss to decide what to air, but most were expected to opt for
Lesin's choice of NTV Plus.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky, speaking from London, where he moved to avoid Russian
prosecutors, complained in a televised interview that his access to his
company has been blocked and that he is not even able to send money to
help pay expenses and salaries.</TE>
<TE>   He praised the ousted staffers, saying they "with fortitude created a
super-professional TV company over a very short period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Eduard M. Sagalayev, president of the Russian National Assn. of TV and
Radio Broadcasters, said the blacking out of TV6 should be kept in
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not say that the freedom of speech in Russia has ended today.
There are too many respected journalists who work for other channels and
companies--and there are 2,500 of them in Russia--to make it possible to
say that only one channel is the embodiment of the freedom of speech,"
Sagalayev said on NTV. "However, there may be a domino effect. After this
channel and that channel have been finished off, the same may happen in
the regions."</TE>
<TE>   One small group of people affected by the TV6 closure were the
participants in Russia's first graphic TV reality show, "Behind the
Glass." The wildly popular program had just launched a new series four
days ago with 12 fresh contestants.</TE>
<TE>   Told that TV6 was no longer on the air, the contestants decided to
keep playing for prizes anyway. But now they will only be seen in the
Internet edition of the show.</TE>

<HD>China Keeps Lid on Plane Bugs</HD>
<DH>Asia: An apparent media blackout tells analysts that the
allegations about Jiang's U.S.-made aircraft reflected badly on the
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>China enforced a strict silence domestically about the reported
bugging of its U.S.-made presidential plane Tuesday but indicated that it
won't let the allegations get in the way of an upcoming visit by
President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't see this affair having an impact on any other issues,"
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said.</LD>
<LD>   He would neither confirm nor deny reports last week by the Washington
Post and London-based Financial Times that Chinese authorities had found
more than 20 eavesdropping devices in the upholstery of a Boeing 767 that
had been luxuriously customized in the United States for President Jiang
Zemin.</LD>
<TE>   "China is a peace-loving nation that doesn't pose a threat to anyone.
It is completely unnecessary to eavesdrop on China," Sun told reporters
at a routine news briefing.</TE>
<TE>   An apparent blackout continued in China's state-owned media, with
censors quickly deleting postings about the reports in Internet chat
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Please maintain order and do not discuss the bugging incident," wrote
the chat room monitor of the Strong Country Forum Web site, which is
maintained by the Communist Party-controlled People's Daily newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts generally agree that the bugging reports reflected badly on
Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's "sweet dream of riding China's first presidential plane may
have evaporated before his retirement--no wonder he was infuriated," said
a signed commentary in the independent Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Before retiring next year, Jiang is expected to designate his
successor at a key Communist Party Congress this fall. Some analysts
believe that Jiang's critics leaked the alleged bugging to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Most observers point to several possible explanations for the official
silence on the incident:</TE>
<TE>   * According to the reports, China detained several military officials
for questioning in the case, raising the embarrassing possibility that
official negligence or corruption was involved. The plane was reportedly
outfitted in the United States under the constant watch of Chinese
security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   * Because the bugs were reportedly discovered before Jiang used the
plane, China may have averted security leaks while reaping a potential
intelligence windfall in the miniature satellite-activated eavesdropping
devices.</TE>
<TE>   * With anti-graft regulations barring officials from even riding in
imported cars, accounts of the president spending millions on a luxury
U.S. jet could irk Chinese taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Any way you look at it, it doesn't make them look good," one veteran
China watcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also agree that both countries want Bush's upcoming visit to
Beijing, postponed after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, to
capitalize on improving bilateral relations and a common cause in the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The symbolism of the visit's timing could hardly be more upbeat: Bush
is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Feb. 21, 30 years to the day after
President Nixon's historic trip that led to the establishment of U.S.
diplomatic relations with Communist China.</TE>
<TE>   "Jiang Zemin is at that point in his term where he's thinking about
his legacy," said Steven Goldstein, a China expert at Smith College in
Massachusetts. "And he wants his legacy to be closely associated with
improved ties with the U.S."</TE>

<HD>Dollar's Day in Argentina Fades in Fiscal Crisis</HD>
<DH>Finance: To salvage the economy, billions in deposits will be
converted into pesos. But many fear they will lose money if paid in the
devalued currency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Three weeks after a wave of demonstrations brought him to power,
Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde finds his administration at a
critical juncture, caught between the demands of millions of his citizens
and the expectations of the international finance community.</LD>
<LD>   Every day brings a new protest in a nation beleaguered by unemployment
and a banking freeze that has crippled economic activity. Hoping to lift
the freeze and jump-start the economy, Duhalde is moving this week to
convert billions of dollars' worth of deposits and loans into the
nation's devalued currency, the peso.</LD>
<LD>   Until last month, U.S. dollars could be traded 1 to 1 for the peso.
About $45 billion in Argentine bank deposits--more than two-thirds of the
total--were made in dollars. But with the peso now floating on the open
market at about half its former value, the government is saying the
banking system simply doesn't have enough dollars to pay all depositors
at a rate of exchange that they would consider fair.</LD>
<TE>   Acknowledging that the era of the dollar had ended in Argentina was
such an explosive admission that the president first spoke of it Saturday
night in an interview with a small news agency here. Depositors would be
able to get their money from the banks, Duhalde said, but "not in the
currency [the dollar] that isn't there anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The government expects to detail its plan to "peso-fy" the economy in
the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the International Monetary Fund expressed optimism
Tuesday that Argentina is moving forward. The government is counting on
more loans from the agency to help the nation out of its four-year
recession and fiscal crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It is legitimate that the Argentines take the necessary time to
define a strategy that will last," the fund's managing director, Horst
Koehler, said in an interview in the French daily Le Monde. "The IMF is
ready to support such an approach."</TE>
<TE>   A delegation from the fund was due in Buenos Aires on Tuesday to hash
out a comprehensive rescue plan and to review Argentina's monetary and
banking policies, as well as its 2002 budget. IMF officials have said the
new policies must be in place before they can deliver an aid package.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Duhalde's government removes dollars from the economy, it
faces the prospect of unleashing any one of a number of nightmarish
scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   A misstep could easily wipe out the savings of millions of Argentines
or force tens of thousands of debtors into bankruptcy. The value of the
dollar might skyrocket beyond its current value of 1.95 pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Hovering over the heads of Duhalde and his advisors is the possibility
of igniting a social explosion such as the one that brought down
President Fernando de la Rua on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Every day sees a new cacerolazo, the banging of pots and pans in
protest by middle-class residents of Buenos Aires and many provincial
cities. A national cacerolazo is planned for Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't allow them to rob you and bring down our country," reads one
e-mail being circulated by Buenos Aires residents who are organizing the
protests via a Web site, http://www.elcacerolazo.org.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a group of protesters that included senior citizens
surrounded a Lloyd's Bank branch in the provincial city of La Plata.</TE>
<TE>   Many Argentines fear that the government might convert their dollar
deposits at a 1-to-1 value, in effect cutting their savings nearly in
half.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde's spokesman, Eduardo Amadeo, said Tuesday that Argentines
"will not lose the buying power of their money."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the government say Duhalde's administration will
likely model its conversion plan on a system used in Chile and Brazil,
where authorities converted deposits--and loans--from dollars into a
local currency based on a formula derived from cost of living indexes.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis here has already dealt a crippling blow to the nation's
banking sector, composed largely of American and European banks.</TE>
<TE>   Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander Central Hispano, said in
Madrid on Tuesday that the Spanish bank had set aside a fund for probable
losses in Argentina totaling more than $1 billion, nearly two-thirds of
the equity it has here.</TE>
<TE>   Botin made it clear that he was pressuring the Argentine government to
act in defense of the troubled banking sector. He said the bank otherwise
might abandon the country altogether--an option that several foreign
banks are said to be considering--rather than invest more money here.</TE>
<TE>   "Our presence in Argentina is subject to certainty of being able to
continue developing our activities in a viable system," Botin said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Chris Kraul in Mexico City contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Berenson Sentence Appealed</HD>
<DH>S. America: Lawyer for American convicted of aiding Peruvian rebels
asks judges to overturn her 20-year term.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for imprisoned American Lori Berenson asked Peru's highest
appeals court Tuesday to overturn her 20-year prison term for
collaborating with rebels in a plot to seize Peru's Congress, saying she
was convicted for her leftist ideas.</LD>
<LD>   Berenson's defense attorney, Jose Luis Sandoval, made the plea before
a five-judge panel of the Supreme Court. Berenson was not present during
the hearing.</LD>
<LD>   The panel has up to 15 working days to reach a decision, Supreme Court
spokesman Andiolo Zevallos said. The court can uphold, overturn or reduce
the sentence, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Berenson considers herself a political prisoner and has said that
authorities unfairly portrayed her concern for social justice for the
poor as a terrorist agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Ysaias Tamayo, an anti-terrorism advocate from the Interior
Ministry, asked the court to confirm the sentence. Berenson's open
civilian trial "was carried out with the maximum guarantee of due
process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berenson, 32, a New York native, was convicted in June of terrorist
collaboration in a failed bid by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
to take over Peru's Congress in 1995. She was acquitted of being a member
of the rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   She was sentenced to 20 years in prison but is due to be released in
2015 because she had already served five years under an earlier terrorist
conviction by a secret military tribunal of hooded judges.</TE>
<TE>   The tribunal had sentenced her in 1996 to life in prison without
parole on charges she was a rebel leader. But a higher military tribunal
overturned the ruling in August 2000 and remitted her case to a civilian
anti-terrorism court.</TE>
<TE>   That court ruled that Berenson had aided the Tupac Amaru rebels by
renting a house that served as their hide-out and posing as a journalist
to enter Congress to gather intelligence.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Seeks to Quell Kurd Language Demands; 17 Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>In a move likely to further jeopardize Turkey's hopes of joining
the European Union, authorities imprisoned 17 students Tuesday as a
crackdown continued against Kurds demanding the right to study their own
language.</LD>
<LD>   The students were accused by a special state security court of
"promoting separatism and inciting racial hatred" by signing a petition
calling on their local university to introduce a course on the Kurdish
language. They were jailed pending trial in the largely Kurdish province
of Malatya in eastern Turkey and face a minimum sentence of three years
in prison if found guilty.</LD>
<LD>   The students were acting in concert with about 11,000 ethnic Kurdish
students, their families and sympathizers across Turkey who have signed
petitions during the last two months in a bid to end constitutional bans
on Kurdish language education.</LD>
<TE>   Education in Kurdish is forbidden under the Turkish Constitution, and
Education Minister Metin Bostancioglu reaffirmed the government's
position against Kurdish language courses Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The government is under pressure from the European Union to offer
ethnic Kurds the right to express themselves freely in their own language
as a precondition for Turkey's entry into the economic bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Use of the Kurdish language was banned during military rule in 1980
and has emerged as the main political battleground between Kurdish
nationalists and the Turkish government.</TE>
<TE>   The ban on using Kurdish in public places was eased in 1991, but
restrictions on broadcasting, publication and education continue to be
enforced. Turkish authorities fear that granting such broader language
rights would be followed by further demands for autonomy from the
country's estimated 12 million ethnic Kurds and the establishment of an
independent Kurdish state in the largely Kurdish southeastern provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's three-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit charges that the Kurdish language campaign, which began in
November, is being orchestrated by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
to rekindle separatism.</TE>
<TE>   Abdurrahman Demir, a 20-year-old student at Dicle University in the
largely Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, said in a recent interview that
security forces arrested him last month after he joined the Kurdish
language campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stripped naked and beaten by security forces until I signed a
confession saying that I had been acting under orders from the PKK," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Demir signed the confession and is awaiting trial on charges of
promoting separatism.</TE>
<TE>   Not all students who have signed the petition have been jailed, but
many of them have been expelled by their universities.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes that Turkey would work toward accommodating Kurdish demands rose
after the 1999 capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. A Turkish court
sentenced Ocalan to death by hanging the same year, but the government
stayed his execution pending a review by the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg, France. In return, Ocalan called off the PKK's
15-year armed campaign for an independent homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Ocalan, who is the sole inmate of an island prison off the coast of
Istanbul, now says that lifting bans on Kurdish language education and
broadcasting will satisfy the Kurds' demands for more cultural rights.
However, some of his former followers now regard him as a traitor to the
cause.</TE>
<TE>   The Ankara government has brushed aside Ocalan's overtures as a ploy
to place the Kurdish issue on an international platform in the context of
Turkey's bid to join the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's parliament passed legislation in October that eased bans on
Kurdish language broadcasting but left the education ban in force.
Despite the new law, at least two radio stations in Diyarbakir province
and the southern Mediterranean port of Mersin received heavy fines in
recent months for airing Kurdish songs.</TE>

<HD>$27 Million Pledged for De-Mining</HD>
<DH>Aid: The funds are a start, but the sum is far below the $668
million the U.N. says is needed to make Afghanistan safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Officials from 24 nations and international organizations pledged
$27.2 million--including $7 million by the U.S.--for de-mining
Afghanistan, as a two-day conference on rebuilding the country came to a
close Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the funds were welcomed by Afghan officials, they are a
fraction of the $668 million over seven years that U.N. experts say is
needed to eliminate the nation's land mine and unexploded ordnance
problem.</LD>
<LD>   Ridding Afghanistan of these time bombs, or at least minimizing their
ability to inflict damage, is an ambitious goal. By some estimates, as
many as 10 million land mines and other unexploded munitions litter the
Central Asian country after decades of war and instability.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 300 Afghans are killed every month by the deadly
leftovers, including children scavenging for the 25 cents' worth of metal
in each mine, according to the United Nations. Half of the victims die
instantly or succumb to their wounds on the way to doctors, who are often
several days of hard travel away, land mine experts here say. That
compares with about 30 people a month killed nowadays in Cambodia, a past
poster child for anti-mine campaigns, the U.N. says.</TE>
<TE>   At the conference in Tokyo, officials from contributing nations and
Afghanistan pressed for a fast, concerted de-mining campaign. "The need
for action is great," said interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.
"Our citizens are falling victim to them daily."</TE>
<TE>   Experts argue that the $668-million price tag compares favorably with
the more than $700 million spent de-mining Kuwait after the 1991 Persian
Gulf War and the $70 million spent so far in Kosovo, the Serbian province
that sparked a battle between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
Yugoslavia in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Kosovo is a postage stamp," said Richard Daniel Kelly, mine action
program director with the Office of the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan.
"It's the size of one province in Afghanistan, and Afghanistan has 31
provinces."</TE>
<TE>   Money spent to de-mine the country has secondary benefits. With nearly
5,000 Afghans now working to identify and deactivate mines, the campaign
ranks as the nation's largest single source of employment, U.S. and U.N.
officials say. A portion of the money pledged Tuesday by the United
States, which is to be routed through the HALO Trust, a nonprofit
de-mining group, is expected to employ 800 more.</TE>
<TE>   Torek Farhadi, an economic advisor to the interim government, said
mines take a huge psychological toll on Afghans, killing people years
after fighting has stopped. In addition to preventing such tragedies,
mine clearing allows refugees to cross back into Afghanistan, helps put
farmland back into production and gives children and adults the
confidence to walk roads to schools and markets, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the money pledged Tuesday is expected to go to UNICEF for an
intensive education campaign timed to coincide with the scheduled
reopening of schools in March. The campaign will cover what mines look
like, how to avoid them and how to report them to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six months, about $10 million in land mine detection
equipment has been stolen, vandalized or destroyed in Afghanistan,
officials said. Japan will spend $15.4 million to pay for new equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has refused to sign a 1997 international accord banning land
mines, arguing that the weapons are necessary in certain places such as
the border between North and South Korea. But Washington is reviewing its
position, with a decision expected within a few months, a senior U.S.
official said. He added that the government has destroyed about 3.3
million of its own stockpiled land mines and banned the weapons' export.
Karzai said Monday that his government plans to sign the accord.</TE>
<TE>   The de-mining effort in Afghanistan comes amid a long-standing debate
over the relative benefits of using people to defuse mines--creating jobs
but putting workers at risk of injury or death--or spending scarce
resources on new technology. At least 60 Afghans have been killed in
de-mining operations in recent years, and several hundred have been
wounded, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the Tokyo conference, Japan weighed in with a
strange-looking contraption that it said was a prototype robot capable of
clearing mines. But a Japanese official at the gathering said a working
model could be a decade away.</TE>
<TE>   Searchers using metal-detecting devices often dig up soda cans and
empty shell casings, and the problem has gotten worse as mine
manufacturers use less metal and more plastic and ceramic in the devices.
This has sparked research into X-ray and microwave technologies,
ground-penetrating radar and a system that would turn microbes in the
explosive material a luminescent color.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding where to start de-mining in Afghanistan is a problem. The
Russian government gave 350 battle plans, showing some minefields, to the
Afghan government in the early 1990s, but they were lost. The Russians
have now found 150 more maps that will be handed over to the U.N.
de-mining authority, a senior U.N. official said. The U.S. has provided a
list of 188 locations where it dropped cluster bombs, the official added.</TE>
<TE>   According to U.N. estimates, more than 320 square miles of the country
are riddled with mines, with nearly half that in heavily populated areas.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, surveyors catalog where land mine accidents have
occurred, and computers correlate the data with road, electricity and
water grids. This allows planners to identify the worst dangers in the
most populated areas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to clear every ordnance in Afghanistan," said Donald
K. Steinberg, deputy director of policy planning with the State
Department. "The goal is to figure out where you're going to get the best
results quickly and also where there are no land mines."</TE>
<TE>   Unpopulated areas with lots of land mines may not be worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "There are supposedly 20 million land mines in south Egypt, but no one
ever goes there. So you put signs up and focus on higher priorities,"
said a senior U.S. official.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM KANDAHAR</KH>
<HD>Afghan City Begins Waking Up to Hope</HD>
<DH>Asia: Though residents are just starting the transition from the
hard-line rule of the Taliban, expectations for the future are high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Just six weeks after the Taliban's rule collapsed and the U.S.
bombs stopped falling here, a mixture of anticipation and optimism is
growing in the birthplace of the extremist regime.</LD>
<LD>   No one says it out loud, but there is a distinct feeling among
long-suffering residents that Afghanistan's nightmare--one that began in
1979 with an invasion of Soviet troops and then brought civil war,
isolation and U.S. military power--may be over.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, this optimism was buoyed as news from Tokyo filtered
through this southern city that the world's richest countries had pledged
$4.5 billion toward rebuilding the shattered country.</LD>
<TE>   Even the heavens made a contribution Tuesday: It rained in Kandahar in
the evening, marking the second rainy day in a week for a region where
drought has been war's twin plague over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think good things will happen now," said 19-year-old Shah Mohammed,
who is jobless but hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   Although expectations for a better future are high, Kandahar is still
very much a city at the start of a long and difficult transition.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory at one grocery store is enough to underscore that.
Shopkeeper Obaidullah, who, like many Afghans, uses only one name, sells
Dutch nonalcoholic beer--something he wouldn't have dared offer during
the Taliban era. But a few feet away, he still offers a large selection
of individually wrapped candies anchored in Afghanistan's past: bonbons
wrapped in colorful paper sporting a likeness of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "They still sell well," Obaidullah said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he believes that his country--and its new government--is
on the right track. Here in the heart of Afghanistan's "Pushtun Belt,"
Afghans are proud of the country's interim prime minister, Hamid Karzai,
who, as a Pushtun, is one of their ethnic brethren.</TE>
<TE>   "A wise and literate man," Obaidullah summed up. "I think he'll give
us a good government. It's already better than before."</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic tensions persist, however. Rumors swept the city Tuesday that a
new conflict might be around the corner, this time with forces loyal to
warlord Ismail Khan, a Shiite Muslim leader in the western city of Herat.</TE>
<TE>   Word that Shiites were persecuting ethnic Pushtuns, who are Sunni
Muslims and make up the country's largest ethnic group, was so strong
that city officials had to address them. Mohammed Yusef Pushtoon, a
senior aide to provincial Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai, denied reports that an
armed force was being dispatched to march on Herat.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai has launched a campaign to curb a law-and-order situation that
clearly had gotten out of hand in the wake of the Taliban's demise. The
governor has worked to curtail the number of weapons toted around in
public, although he personally cruises the city in a white sport-utility
vehicle trailed by two pickup trucks loaded with uniformed guards
bristling with weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   Police have donned new uniforms--but outside the city, in rural areas,
officers appear uncertain about what to wear with the camouflage shirt
and trousers.</TE>
<TE>   Not far from the border with Pakistan on the arterial road that links
Kandahar to the southern hinterland, reporters were halted by freshly
uniformed police, including one sporting pink socks and sandals.</TE>
<TE>   There are other signs of transition along the road--signs that serve
as a reminder of just how desperate conditions are in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Beggars are replacing bandits, making for a safer if more depressing
journey into the city. On Tuesday, small groups of young boys and the
occasional elderly man stood, braced and squinting against the wind,
holding out hands to passing cars. Invariably, the beggars got only more
dust kicked in their faces.</TE>
<TE>   Those who stand for more than a few minutes by the road are coated in
dirt, almost invisible except for the eyes and teeth that shine through
the dull coating like reflectors. The road itself, once a model of
U.S.-financed know-how, in some places hardly exists anymore after years
of war and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   "With God's help, maybe this will be a good road again someday," said
a security guard, Mohammed. "But we first have many other things to do."</TE>
<TE>   On his fingers, he ticked off a long list. It began with education and
jobs and went on for several minutes.</TE>

<HD>Amnesty Foes Point to Tally From Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The number of illegal immigrants from the Middle East--more than
100,000--would not normally jump out from a census report that estimates
8.7 million people are in the United States unlawfully from all regions
of the world.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, advocates for reduced immigration seized on the
preliminary findings--criticized as unreliable by other experts--as
ammunition in the debate over U.S. immigration policy and whether
undocumented workers should be granted some form of amnesty.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the estimate of the number of illegal immigrants from the
Middle East, although far lower than that of many other places, may
provide a new rallying cry for those who wish to restrict entry into the
United States.</LD>
<TE>   "It is difficult to overstate the implications of this new report for
the security of our nation," said Steven A. Camarota, research director
at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that
advocates greater restrictions on immigration. ". . . We can't protect
ourselves from terrorism without dealing with illegal immigration."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, with little fanfare, the Census Bureau for the
first time released estimates of the illegal immigrant population in the
United States. The largest number, 3.9 million, came from Mexico, with
significant numbers from Central America, South America, Europe and Asia.
The 8.7 million total reflected a jump from 3.8 million just 10 years
earlier. Although the Mexico figures tower over those from other nations,
the estimate of 114,818 from the Middle East is also drawing interest.</TE>
<TE>   "While the vast majority of illegals from the Middle East are not
terrorists, the fact that tens of thousands of people from that region
and millions more from the rest of the world can settle in the United
States illegally means that terrorists who wish to do so face few
obstacles," Camarota said.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are considered less than authoritative. For example, it is
possible that some foreign students and others with legal status might be
counted as illegal, said Cynthia Davis, a census statistician who worked
on the report.</TE>
<TE>   The Census Bureau even offered a disclaimer, noting that the data had
undergone less review than "official Census Bureau publications" and
adding that it was releasing the report to encourage discussion among
researchers. "These are not final numbers," Davis cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, Egypt and Algeria were not included in the Middle East
totals but rather were counted as part of Africa. Census analysts did not
publish individual numbers for them.</TE>
<TE>   One outside researcher suggested that at least some of the census data
appear questionable. "I have trouble accepting that there are 100,000
illegals from Yugoslavia," said Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographic expert
with the Urban Institute in Washington. "I have trouble with the finding
that there are more illegals from Russia than from El Salvador. I don't
think all the numbers in there are gold-plated by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Center for Immigration Studies said Tuesday that Justice
Department efforts to deport about 6,000 Middle Easterners "barely
scratch the surface" of the illegal Middle Eastern population in this
country.</TE>
<TE>   The center's report argues that lax U.S. border controls and
permissive policies toward illegal residents make it "inevitable that
millions of illegal aliens will settle in the United States, including
tens of thousands from the primary terrorist-sending countries."</TE>
<TE>   But others assailed the center as sensationalizing the census data for
its own political purposes. "This is just another attempt to confuse the
issue of fighting and preventing terrorism with the issue of
immigration," said Helen Samhan, executive director of the Arab American
Institute Foundation, deriding what she described as "scare tactics."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Fund Cup Runneth Way Over</HD>
<DH>Money: Officials urge people to redirect donations from terrorist
attack relief to other charities, which are going begging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months after the terrorist attacks spurred a record outpouring
of charity donations, the managers of the Sept. 11 Fund have a new
appeal: Stop giving us money.</LD>
<LD>   Or to be more precise, they recommend people redirect donations to the
many American charities that have been starved of cash since the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The reason? Fund managers say their donation pool--combined with money
people have given to other charity recipients, such as the Red Cross--is
adequate to meet the fund's goals.</LD>
<TE>   "As these efforts continue, the philanthropic community must refocus
on the unmet needs in our communities," said Lorie Slutsky, the president
of the New York Community Trust, which co-manages the fund.</TE>
<TE>   "The hungry and the homeless, schoolchildren, the elderly, all need
our attention," Slutsky said in the official statement announcing the
fund's shift.</TE>
<TE>   Ani Hurwitz, senior consultant to the trust, said some large donors
still plan to send money to the $425-million fund for job training and
other needs that might arise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we're sending back checks," Hurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fund's available funding, plus grants still in the
pipeline, seem capable of meeting its goals of providing for the
immediate and longer-term needs of individuals, families and communities
affected by the disaster, Hurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think $425 million was a lot of money, and we want to spend it
effectively," Hurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   That does not mean, Hurwitz said, that the fund believes it has enough
money to meet all the needs of the victims. But that was never the
intention, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a fund that was trying to pay for emergencies--for college
tuition, for rent, for food--until all the other sources of money kicked
in," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Victims will also get indemnification from the federal Victims'
Compensation Fund, the Twin Towers Fund, the Salvation Army and other
funds started in the wake of the tragedy, and in some cases insurance and
pension payments for survivors of those killed, Hurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 Fund has distributed $160 million so far. Most of the
money was used to provide cash assistance and services to 27,717 victims
and families in 50 states and 20 countries. A smaller amount--about
8%--went for rescue and recovery, and grants and loans to rebuild
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The fund will still make a special effort to help victims who are
ineligible for compensation from many charities.</TE>
<TE>   Many illegal immigrant workers or their survivors, as well as people
who worked off the books, have been unable to get their employers to
write letters stating that they employed some of the victims. In other
cases, victims had remarried, and only family members are eligible for
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a lot of people falling through the cracks," Hurwitz
said "We're trying to help them."</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofit organizations praised the announcement as a responsible move
at a time when safety-net organizations are struggling to help people who
lost their livelihoods in the economic downturn that followed the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Marco Gonzales, spokesman for the United Way of Greater Los Angeles,
said he hopes donors will redirect their contributions to the homeless
shelters, food banks and social service agencies that are helping some of
the 100,000 Californians who have lost their jobs since September.</TE>
<TE>   More than 750,000 Californians are expected to seek some kind of
safety-net services as a result of the attack and the economic downturn,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will definitely encourage people to really take a good look at
our local community to see how we are being affected by the aftershocks
of this tragedy," Gonzales said. "Philanthropic giving tends to increase
after a tragedy. We're certainly hopeful Angelenos will step up to the
plate."</TE>

<HD>Deadly Shooting in Calcutta May Be Linked to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: New Delhi blames kidnapping ring for assault at U.S.
center. Police suspect funds were sent to Mohamed Atta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>Tying its own fight against extremists to Washington's war on
terror, India charged Tuesday that gunmen who attacked a U.S. cultural
center in Calcutta belong to a kidnapping ring that local police suspect
used ransom payments to help bankroll the Sept. 11 strikes in America.</LD>
<LD>   Indian officials also claimed that the people behind the early-morning
assault, which killed five Indian police guards, could have links to
Pakistan's military intelligence and two Pakistan-based groups fighting
Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   No U.S. citizens were killed or injured in the attack outside the U.S.
Information Service building, which is near the U.S. Consulate in the
eastern city.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan's government dismissed the Indian allegation of links to its
military intelligence as "baseless." Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf
has won strong international praise for a crackdown on Islamic
extremists, but India insists that the Pakistani general, who took power
in a bloodless 1999 coup, hasn't done enough to stop what New Delhi calls
cross-border terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian allegation about the Calcutta attack further complicated
efforts to defuse a volatile military standoff between the two
nuclear-armed neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged connection between kidnappers in Calcutta and the worst
terrorist attack in U.S. history may be difficult to prove. The man who
claimed the link, accused kidnapping ringleader Asif Raza Khan, was shot
dead by police Dec. 7. They said he was trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert Mueller, in New Delhi on a previously scheduled
visit to meet leaders and discuss cooperation in counter-terrorism, said
it was too early to lay blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that there have been claims of responsibility for the
attack," he said. "I also understand that the investigation is ongoing,
and my experience shows that making particular comments about what
occurred eight hours ago is premature.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to wait to see what the facts bear out to see responsibility
and motivation for the attack. I am unaware of specific information in
recent days relating to attacks on particular [U.S.] facilities," Mueller
told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity that they
don't believe the incident was an anti-American terrorist attack, noting
that no Americans were present at the center when it occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Tuesday's attack, police in Calcutta said a passenger on a
motorcycle pulled an AK-47 assault rifle from underneath a shawl and
opened fire on the building's security detail during a shift change. At
least one gunman in a car also fired, Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna
Advani said. Other reports say four men on two motorcycles carried out
the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Several passersby and security guards from a private firm were among
20 people wounded, Advani said. The attackers escaped.</TE>
<TE>   A Dubai-based man identified as Farhan, and also known as Aftab Malik,
called to claim responsibility for the 6:30 a.m. attack, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Nirupama Rao told reporters in New Delhi, the Indian capital.</TE>
<TE>   "This person, Farhan, is believed to be in close touch with some
Pakistani agencies and could have tie-ups with Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami
and Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen," Rao said.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups are among several battling Indian troops in the state
of Jammu and Kashmir and, India's government charges, are also
responsible for terrorist attacks in the state and elsewhere in India.</TE>
<TE>   Harkat Moujahedeen is a Pakistan-based militia fighting in the Kashmir
region. Until a year ago, it was headed by Fazlur Rehman Khalil, whose
signature appeared on Osama bin Laden's February 1998 fatwa, or religious
edict, calling for attacks on U.S. and other Western interests.</TE>
<TE>   Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami is a small separatist group fighting in Jammu
and Kashmir. According to India's government, its cadres are mostly
Pakistani mercenaries. India is accusing a Bangladesh-based faction of
the organization for Tuesday's attack.</TE>
<TE>   The main organization's commander in chief, Mohammed Ilyas Kashmiri,
has accused the U.S. and Israel of supporting the division of Kashmir,
according to a government briefing document on terrorist groups prepared
for Indian members of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Advani, a powerful hard-liner in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
Cabinet, accused Pakistan's military spy agency, the Inter-Services
Intelligence, of involvement in the Calcutta attack.</TE>
<TE>   Rao did not give any details to support the link with Kashmir and
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Advani also said he had spoken to the chief minister of West Bengal
state, Buddhadev Bhattacharya, who said a caller from Dubai phoned police
in Calcutta to claim responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the "information till now indicates that a group which
kidnapped a Calcutta businessman some time back and was able to extract
ransom from him" was behind Tuesday's attack.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to Calcutta shoe tycoon Partha Roy Burman, who was
abducted last summer and held captive near India's border with
Bangladesh, which runs the length of West Bengal state.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers freed Burman after 15 days for a reported ransom of
about $830,000. Indian police investigators suspect that some of the
money eventually reached Mohamed Atta, the Egyptian who is believed to
have led the terrorists who flew planes into New York's World Trade
Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe a man named Aftab Ansari, an alias for Aftab Malik, now
runs the kidnapping operation from Dubai, India Today, the country's
leading weekly newsmagazine, reported earlier this month. A senior
Calcutta police investigator, speaking on condition he not be named due
the sensitivity of his work, confirmed the report.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani militant named Ahmad Sayed Omar Sheikh wired $100,000 of
the ransom money, which he received from Ansari in Dubai, to one of
Atta's bank accounts, India Today reported.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine said Indian investigators "have been able to decode
intercepted e-mails" that point to the link between Khan, who led the
kidnapping ring, and Ansari in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh is one of three Pakistani militants that India released from

<LD>The Pentagon contends that the men taken into custody in
Afghanistan and transferred to the makeshift prison at Guantanamo Bay
Naval Base in Cuba are not "prisoners of war" as defined by the third
Geneva Convention, a 1949 international gathering of nations to agree on
the rules of war. Instead, they are "unlawful combatants" who lack the
specifically listed rights given POWs.</LD>
<LD>   POWs, for example, must be held in conditions that are "as favorable"
as those of soldiers; are required to divulge only their name, rank,
serial number and date of birth; cannot be tried simply for taking up
arms against an enemy during wartime and must be given access to Red
Cross representatives. Denying POWs a fair trial is itself considered a
war crime.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's reasoning goes like this: The third Geneva Convention
refers to a 1907 standard, known as Hague 4. Article 1 of the annex to
Hague 4 sets forth what appears to be a clear standard. It states that to
qualify as POWs, combatants must:</LD>
<TE>   * Follow a chain of command.</TE>
<TE>   * Have a "fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance."</TE>
<TE>   * "Carry arms openly."</TE>
<TE>   * Abide by the international laws of war.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Taliban fighters would appear not to qualify because they
clearly did not wear any insignia, and the closest thing to a uniform was
the black turbans that many wore.</TE>
<TE>   But Amnesty International officials note that the next paragraph,
Article 2, contains an exception for "the inhabitants of a territory
which has not been occupied, who, on the approach of the enemy,
spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading troops." This, they
argue, could be construed to include the Taliban militia.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumsfeld is wrong on at least two fronts," said Curt Goering, deputy
executive director of Amnesty International in New York.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said, the Geneva Convention rules require that if there is a
dispute about the prisoners' status, a "competent tribunal" needs to
declare anyone a noncombatant or else they must be presumed to be POWs.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the Guantanamo detainees live in 8-foot-square caged cells,
with wooden planked roofing but only wire-fence sides. That, Goering
said, clearly violates a convention requirement that prisoners be
"protected from the elements."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about that, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday,
"To be in an 8-by-8 cell in beautiful, sunny Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not
inhumane treatment."</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles federal judge expressed "grave doubts" Tuesday about
whether he has jurisdiction to consider a petition demanding that
suspected Al Qaeda terrorists being held at Guantanamo Naval Base be
brought before a civilian court.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz ordered lawyers in
the case to submit legal briefs on the jurisdictional issue and set a
Feb. 14 hearing date to consider the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The habeas corpus petition was filed over the weekend by attorney
Stephen Yagman on behalf of a coalition of clergy, academics and civil
rights lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   It is the first court challenge to the Bush administration's detention
of Al Qaeda suspects taken into custody in Afghanistan and transferred to
the U.S. Navy base in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The petition contends that the detainees are being held in violation
of the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Convention governing the
treatment of war prisoners. It demands that U.S. officials produce the
prisoners in a U.S. court and accord them due process guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing was devoted exclusively to the jurisdiction
question.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Douglas Axel asked the judge to throw out the
petition because none of the detainees or their captors is within the
jurisdiction of the Los Angeles court.</TE>
<TE>   In an order issued later in the day, Matz directed government lawyers
and Yagman to answer a number of questions, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Must Guantanamo be within the territorial jurisdiction of the United
States for the court to exercise authority? Does the United States'
leasehold on the base make it subject to the court's jurisdiction?</TE>
<TE>   * If U.S. authorities convene a military commission to decide the
detainees' fate, would the court have the right to intervene?</TE>
<TE>   * To what extent do the detainees have rights under the Geneva
Convention?</TE>
<TE>   * Assuming they are "unlawful combatants" rather than "prisoners of
war," what rights do they have?</TE>
<TE>   * Even if the federal court has jurisdiction, is there a more
appropriate or convenient forum for adjudicating the case?</TE>
<TE>   Matz gave the government until Jan. 31 to file a brief answering those
questions and raising any further objections to Yagman's petition. Yagman
has until Feb. 8 to respond.</TE>
<TE>   In a highly unusual procedure, Yagman served the petition Saturday at
the home of U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi. Matz was selected at
random to hear the case in accordance with federal court procedures.</TE>

<HD>Pilots Helped Save Crew, Marines Say</HD>
<DH>War: After helicopter crashed in Afghanistan, one captain pulled
the other from the burning wreckage. Cause of the accident is unclear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>The death toll in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Sunday that
killed two Marines and injured five others might have been higher but for
the quick action of the two pilots, Marine Corps officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Indications are that Capt. Douglas V. Glasgow and Capt. William J.
Cody kept the CH-53E Super Stallion as stable as possible after it
developed a mechanical problem while on a resupply mission, said Lt. Col.
David L. Spasojevich.</LD>
<LD>   And Glasgow apparently saved Cody's life by pulling him out of the
burning wreckage after the crash, said Spasojevich, commanding officer of
Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, known as the Flying Tigers.</LD>
<TE>   "Capt. Glasgow did perform heroic acts there and probably is
singularly responsible for anyone surviving the crash," Spasojevich said.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar here,
Spasojevich said there is no indication that the mechanical problem that
struck the helicopter is the same one that led the Marine Corps to ground
the entire Super Stallion fleet in 2000 for inspection and retrofits to
the rotor assembly. The helicopters were grounded after a similar Navy
helicopter crashed off the coast of Texas, killing four sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Spasojevich said the CH-53E was particularly suited for the
Afghanistan mission, where it is being used to carry heavy loads over
long distances and rough terrain. "It was the best aircraft we could
provide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Sgt. Walter F. Cohee III, 26, of Mardela Springs, Md., and Staff
Sgt. Dwight J. Morgan, 24, of Willits in Northern California, were killed
in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Glasgow, Cody and three enlisted crew members were slightly injured.
The five are at a U.S. military facility in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Glasgow, 33, a graduate of the Naval Academy, is stationed at the
Marines' air station in Yuma, Ariz. The other six crew members were from
the Miramar base.</TE>
<TE>   The crash came just 11 days after seven Marines from the Miramar base
were killed when their KC-130 transport and refueling plane crashed while
attempting a night landing in Pakistan. No cause has been determined.</TE>
<TE>   In the helicopter crash, officials have said only that the aircraft, a
workhorse of the Marine Corps, made a "hard landing" at about 9,000 feet
above sea level in the mountains outside Bagram air base, north of Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Flying at that altitude can be difficult for helicopters because the
thin air provides less for the rotors to "bite into," Staff Sgt. Bret
Ziegler said.</TE>
<TE>   Marines from the Flying Tigers squadron said they were shocked when
they learned of Sunday's crash.</TE>
<TE>   "I was all right on the phone when they called me, but I lost it after
that," Ziegler said. "I was just glad I was at home with my wife instead
of at work."</TE>
<TE>   Cohee was remembered as a devotee of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and
NASCAR auto racing. Morgan, who was promoted to staff sergeant
posthumously, was "a great Marine who was always looking out for the
Marines in his squad," said Lance Cpl. Ken Keown.</TE>
<TE>   "I want everybody to know he was the best, and he'll be in our hearts
forever," said Morgan's widow, Teresa, who is expecting the couple's
second child in July. "He will be in our thoughts forever."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was on a six-month deployment to the Middle East last year.
Normally, that would have meant he would have been assigned stateside
duty, but when the war on terrorism was declared, he was selected to go
to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was a helicopter mechanic, and Cohee was a communications
navigation technician. A memorial service is to be held at Miramar next
week.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. military, in a policy reversal, will no longer require
servicewomen in Saudi Arabia to wear Muslim-style head-to-toe robes when
venturing off base.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, wearing the robe, known as an abaya, "is not mandatory but is
strongly encouraged," according to an order by Gen. Tommy Franks, head of
the U.S. Central Command, sent to commanders in the region Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Air Force's highest-ranking female fighter pilot challenged the
rule. Lt. Col. Martha McSally's lawsuit calls the policy unconstitutional
and says it improperly forces American women to conform to others'
religious and social customs.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit did not inspire the policy change, a Central Command
spokesman said Tuesday.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas jury ordered drug maker Pfizer Inc. to pay $1.5 million in
punitive damages in addition to an earlier $23.46-million award to the
family of a woman who died after taking the diabetes drug Rezulin, a
spokesman for Pfizer said.</LD>
<LD>   Pfizer spokesman Robert Fauteax restated the company's intention to
appeal the verdict. In a release last week, Pfizer said the state court
had limited its defense time, excluded relevant evidence and improperly
admitted evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The Edinburg jury awarded the compensatory damages last week in the
death of Rezulin patient Beatrice Herrera, based on arguments that
company officials failed to properly warn consumers about risks tied to
the diabetes drug.</LD>

<HD>Dean of Skiing Isn't Ready to Pass the Olympic Torch</HD>
<DH>Sport: Popular former gold medalist, 74, will be an unofficial
roving ambassador when the Games come to his turf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>Cameras click when Stein Eriksen enters the room. Groupies surround
him. Children beg for autographs. People--very, very wealthy
people--plead for the privilege of paying quite dearly to spend an hour
on the snow with him.</LD>
<LD>   "Ya," he says, sounding like he maybe left Oslo the day before
yesterday, "this is very exciting."</LD>
<LD>   What the 74-year-old dean of American freestyle skiing is referring to
is both the XIX Winter Olympics and the 50th anniversary of his own
Olympic medals. The former puts his adopted home of Utah on the
international forefront of skiing. The latter gives Eriksen an occasion
to celebrate his status as the embodiment of style and elegance on
American slopes.</LD>
<TE>   As director of skiing at the Deer Valley resort here, Eriksen also is
an unofficial roving ambassador as the region welcomes athletes and
spectators from around the world. On Feb. 7, he will carry the Olympic
torch.</TE>
<TE>   Hatless even on the coldest winter days, his silver hair flowing
behind him as he flies down the trails, Eriksen is so familiar that he is
known to all by his first name alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Stein!" a woman in a mink coat calls out. She is blond and
glamorous, dripping in diamonds. Just an average guest here at Stein
Eriksen Lodge. The most exclusive, most expensive auberge at Utah's most
exclusive, most expensive ski area named for the resident superstar.</TE>
<TE>   The woman sees that Stein is busy talking. She blows him an air-kiss.
"I'll give you a real kiss later," she promises.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in front of a massive case filled with medals and statues and
commemorative plaques, Eriksen describes a childhood stolen from a
Scandinavian ski fable.</TE>
<TE>   In the country where skiing was invented more than 1,000 years ago,
Bitten Eriksen, his mother, was president of the local ladies' ski club.
His dad, Marius, was the first manufacturer of Alpine skis in Norway.
Stein cannot remember a winter when he did not step into heavy, lace-up
boots and strap on long wooden skis.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oslo Olympics in 1952 and the 1954 World Championships in Aare,
Sweden, Eriksen raced on skis made by his father. In Oslo, he won a gold
medal in the giant slalom and a silver in the slalom. In Aare, he
captured three gold medals: slalom, giant slalom and the combined--making
him the first Alpine skier to win triple gold at a world championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so proud, being able to achieve what I did, and to do it on
father's skis," Eriksen said.</TE>
<TE>   Skis, by the way, that according to the technique of that time were
220 centimeters long. As new, parabolic technology revolutionized ski
equipment and shortened skis a decade or so ago, Eriksen transferred his
signature style--skis impossibly close together--to the new gear.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I will never ski on under 200,' " Eriksen said. "And of
course now I am on 190, and they want me to go to 185. I have learned
never to say never."</TE>
<TE>   Another admirer approaches him: "It is an honor to meet you, Mr.
Eriksen," says Dr. Aaron Strefling, a physician from Los Altos, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Strefling gives the ski icon a long look.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were 74 years old, I would change bodies with him," confesses
Strefling, who is in his 40s. "Right now I would like to swap his
shoulders and his thighs."</TE>
<TE>   Eriksen glides back to his discussion of skiing. His trademark
position leaves snow tracks that on any degree of steepness almost look
like a single ski. He developed the technique to maximize control and
accuracy. When he turned pro in 1954, he set out to teach others.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a technically correct form of skiing, Eriksen had
another aim: "If I could make it look graceful and easy and aesthetically
nice, people would say: 'Gosh, I'd like to ski like that.' "</TE>
<TE>   But almost no one can.</TE>
<TE>   "Well I hope not," says Eriksen.</TE>
<TE>   From Boyne Mountain, Mich., to Sugarbush, Vt., to Heavenly Valley,
Calif., Eriksen set up ski schools and shops. He taught at Snowmass,
Colo., and at Sun Valley, Idaho. When Deer Valley opened 21 years ago,
Eriksen was part of the celebrity package, lending his name to a
four-star hotel where room rates range from $500 to $5,000 a night.</TE>
<TE>   Every day at Deer Valley, Stein's wife, Francoise, displays his "suit
du jour" on a mannequin at her Bjorn Stova boutique. What started as a
joke now helps Eriksen's fans locate him on the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "It never ceases to amaze me," says Marion Wheaton, a Deer Valley ski
guide, stopping to introduce a client to Eriksen. "No one can ski like
Stein."</TE>
<TE>   In his native country, says Halvor Kleppen, Eriksen's best friend from
Norway, skiing is a way of life. Long ago, when communications were poor,
Norwegians simply skied from town to town when they wanted to see each
other. Now, the sport is a national passion for tiny children and
grandparents alike.</TE>
<TE>   Eriksen, says his pal, "is an Olympic hero. And in Norway, winter
heroes are heroes for this life, the next life and for thousands of years
to come."</TE>
<TE>   While that praise may be a bit over the top, Eriksen will take it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 10 years," he reveals, "I've had more requests for
autographs than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   His appearance doesn't hurt. A former gymnast, Eriksen is trim and
muscular. His hair is thick, his eyes bright blue. The man who has spent
a lifetime in wind, snow and sun credits daily applications of Nivea
cream for the impressive condition of his skin.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the fact that Eriksen has spent his life doing precisely
what he wanted. He found his inspiration as a child, growing up in a home
surrounded by athletes--champions who were always happy, Eriksen
recollects, always telling jokes, always having a good time.</TE>
<TE>   "I said," Eriksen remembers, "that's exactly what I want."</TE>
<TE>   Eriksen has skied all over the world. But mostly these days, he's
right here in Deer Valley, where celebrities, executives and overly
indulged teenagers call to book ski time with him. Recently, a woman from
Sacramento "bought" Eriksen for a day as a gift to her husband. The
couple flew to Salt Lake City one morning, drove 45 minutes to the
resort, skied with Stein, then flew home the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to mention the price," Eriksen says. "But it was not
cheap."</TE>
<TE>   A family from Illinois interrupts to ask Eriksen to pose for a
picture. A lawyer from New York sidles over for a handshake. The air-kiss
woman waves from across the room.</TE>
<TE>   "To go through life like this," says Stein, "is an almost unbelievable
privilege."</TE>

<HD>Budget Likely to See Deeper Shade of Red</HD>
<DH>Economy: CBO report is expected to show that the federal
government's much-touted surplus has disappeared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Soothsayers beware. This year's federal budget debate is about to
begin by making a mockery of the forecasting business.</LD>
<LD>   Just one year ago, after decades of unrelenting budget deficits, the
government was predicting 10 years of dazzling surpluses totaling $5.6
trillion.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to make it
official: The government has returned to the deficit-spending habit it
labored so hard to kick.</LD>
<TE>   It is a sobering milestone in the government's remarkably rapid march
from last year's black ink to this year's red, from prosperity to
recession, from peace to war.</TE>
<TE>   An even deeper shade of red will color the budget President Bush has
prepared to send to Congress in two weeks. That will envision deficits
hovering around $100 billion for this year and next, and no return to
surplus until at least 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO is expected to project smaller deficits and a return to
surplus in 2004, but only because it is measuring the budget situation as
it stands now--before the inevitable spending increases Congress has in
store for defense, homeland security and agriculture, just for starters.</TE>
<TE>   So whatever government analysts foresee now, reality will almost
certainly drag the government even deeper into deficit. Congress this
year will face numerous temptations to throw fiscal restraint to the
wind. It is an election year. The nation is waging a war and in the
throes of recession. And in an obscure but potent change, some
belt-tightening budget requirements are about to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who as Bush's budget director is the
government's foremost tightwad, now says some things come before
balancing the budget and paying down the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   "There are at least three things more important," Daniels said:
increasing defense, bolstering homeland security and stimulating the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Few dispute those priorities for now, but they mark a sea change for
federal policymakers who for years have followed the lodestar of
balancing the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will embrace that shift Feb. 4, when he unveils his budget for
the coming fiscal year. That budget will project a deficit of about $100
billion this year and $80 billion in 2003, sources familiar with the
budget say. That assumes Congress enacts his entire legislative agenda,
including proposed tax cuts to stimulate the economy, which is far from
certain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, those are larger deficits than some in Congress had expected
from Bush. And it is a far cry from the $231-billion surplus that Bush
proposed a year ago for the 2002 budget year, or the $242-billion surplus
that his Office of Management and Budget was projecting for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, congressional analysts also were unreserved in their cheer:
"The outlook for the federal budget over the next decade continues to
brighten," CBO said in its January 2001 report.</TE>
<TE>   Today, when CBO Director Dan Crippen testifies before Senate and House
budget committees, his message will be quite different. "What the economy
gives, the economy can take away," he said in an interview. "A good share
of the surplus has disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   The bad budget forecasts spring in part from bad economic forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the CBO predicted that the economy would grow by 2.4% in
2001. In fact, it grew by only a little more than 1% and shrank over the
last six months.</TE>
<TE>   Such slip-ups helped keep alive the notion that the government could
continue operating in the black. As late as October, Federal Reserve
officials were still warning that surpluses could eventually soak up so
much federal debt there wouldn't be enough around for the central bank to
run its monetary policy. The Fed pumps money into the economy or draws it
out by buying or selling Treasury bonds, the IOUs Washington issues when
it's running in the red. The central bank was so concerned that it
conducted an 18-month study of what to do when the debt dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   The conviction that the surpluses would continue indefinitely can also
be seen in lawmakers' policy ambitions:</TE>
<TE>   * Republicans wrote Bush's $1.35-trillion tax cut last spring assuming
that it was just the beginning. A second tax cut seemed around the
corner, and business groups compiled their wish lists. It never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   * Democrats last year believed that a surplus-financed prescription
drug benefit for Medicare was within grasp; now it seems a pipe dream.</TE>
<TE>   * A year ago, both parties hoped to use the surplus to help shore up
Social Security for the baby boom generation. Without a surplus, it seems
almost impossible to find a painless way to bolster the retirement
program for the long term.</TE>
<TE>   The surplus has vanished almost before Congress got used to the idea
of having one. Lawmakers had labored through the 1980s and most of the
1990s with deficits burgeoning. The dragon was slain, thanks mostly to a
booming economy, when Congress wrote the 1997 balanced budget act, which
plotted a course to eliminate the deficit by 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But revenues poured in faster than anyone predicted, and in 1998 the
government posted its first budget surplus since 1969. Then in 1999 it
balanced the budget without dipping into the Social Security surplus. In
2000, it balanced the budget without using Social Security or
Medicare--and politicians pledged to keep their hands off those programs
for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   That pledge was one of the first casualties of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, as the economy plunged deeper into recession and government
spending spiked.</TE>
<TE>   A political debate is already raging over who is to blame for the
evaporation of the surplus. Democrats blame Bush's big tax cut, which
phases in over the next 10 years; Republicans say it's because of the
recession and the cost of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   There is partial truth in both arguments. For the next few years, most
of the change in surplus projections is attributable to increased
government spending and the deterioration of the economy. But toward the
end of the decade, the tax cut accounts for more of the reduction in
surplus projections.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is held responsible, it is clear that both parties will face
new obstacles to eliminating the deficit. For one thing, Congress will be
freed of some of the budget-balancing rules that applied through the
1990s, including a soon-to-expire requirement of offsets for any new
spending or tax cut to avoid adding to the budget total.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, there is now broad agreement within both parties that war
and recession justify--and even require--running a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But if Congress spends too freely this year, in the name of war or the
economy, it may drive up spending for years to come. "If people go hog
wild this year, it's going to take us longer to get out of deficits,"
said Brenna Hapes, spokeswoman for the House Budget Committee. "When we
get in deficit, it's usually a check on spending, but that's not the case
this year."</TE>
<TE>   That's why some lawmakers are concerned that the Bush administration
is starting the bidding with a deficit as high as $100 billion. Even if
Congress does not enact all the Bush policies that underlie that deficit,
it may embrace its deficit target as a starting point.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Some foreign Olympic entourages have used diplomatic channels to
avoid Utah's strict, costly liquor regulations.</LD>
<LD>   When Italian Olympic officials tried to arrange for the import of 360
cases of wine for next month's Winter Olympics, state officials said that
only Utah's Alcoholic Beverage Control Department can import any booze
with an alcohol content greater than 3.2% alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of paying the 78.6% markup the state charges for special
liquor orders, the organizing committee for the 2006 Winter Games in
Turin, Italy, enlisted Italy's foreign consulate in San Francisco. The
consulate agreed to sponsor a private hospitality suite in the same
office tower used by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Italy is not alone, Earl Dorius, licensing attorney for the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland also are using
diplomatic privileges to import alcohol, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign consulates, however, must pay the $1 per bottle the ABC
charges for a no-resale stamp.</TE>
<TE>   Italy will pay the fee on 4,376 bottles of wine, Dorius said.</TE>

<HD>High Court Tightens Rules for Confining Sex Offenders</HD>
<DH>Law: States must show freed criminals have a mental disorder and a
behavioral problem before they can be kept in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court made it somewhat harder Tuesday for states to
lock up sex criminals after they have served their prison time, ruling
that states must prove these inmates have both a mental disorder and a
"serious difficulty" in controlling their behavior.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-2 ruling clarifies the standard for defining who is a "sexual
predator."</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts predicted that the decision will allow some of the more
than 1,200 men now being held in California and 15 other states to seek
their release through a new hearing. Currently, 301 people are confined
as sexual predators in California.</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutors in several states said they were confident they would
be able to convince a jury that these dangerous offenders must not be
released, regardless of the higher standard set by the court.</TE>
<TE>   The "sexually violent predator laws" were an innovation of the early
1990s. They were designed to cope with serial rapists and child molesters
who appeared to have an irresistible impulse to commit sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   State laws authorized officials to keep these sex criminals in custody
after they had served their prison terms. They were transferred from a
prison to a prison-like treatment center, sometimes located within the
prison grounds. There they could be held indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the high court upheld these laws in principle on a 5-4
vote in the case of Leroy Hendricks, a Kansas pedophile. Forced
confinement of such offenders was not double punishment for the same
crime, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote then, because the inmates were being
treated, not just incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   The court majority also said that the government has long had the
power to commit mentally ill people who are judged to be a danger to
themselves or others.</TE>
<TE>   But until Tuesday, the court had not said what state prosecutors must
prove to win a civil order that confines an inmate due to be released
from prison.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer announced something of a middle-ground
position.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to distinguish between ordinary criminals, who may
choose to commit crimes after they are released, from sexual predators,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Criminals, whether they are burglars, drug dealers or rapists, should
be imprisoned and punished for their crimes but released once they have
served their term, he said. This is so even if prosecutors think an
inmate is dangerous and is likely to commit further crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual predators, he said, are in a different category. They are not
just criminals who have committed sex crimes; they also have been
diagnosed as suffering from a "serious mental illness (or) abnormality"
and show "a special and serious lack of ability to control their
behavior," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State prosecutors must prove both of these elements to a jury, Breyer
said, before the inmates can be incarcerated in a treatment center.</TE>
<TE>   However, his opinion did not go as far as civil libertarians
preferred. The Kansas Supreme Court, taking an even more liberal
position, said prosecutors should be required to prove that these
offenders "cannot control" themselves, a standard that incorporates the
notion of an irresistible impulse.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer conceded that his opinion did not draw a clear "bright line"
but said an "absolute approach is unworkable." Even the worst of
pedophiles do not try to molest a child if a police officer is standing
nearby. They can control themselves to some degree, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said juries
will have a hard time deciding whether someone has a "serious difficulty"
in controlling himself.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling came in the case of Michael Crane, a 39-year-old
former landscaper who was arrested for two attempted assaults on store
clerks. In both instances, he grabbed a female clerk, exposed himself,
demanded oral sex and threatened rape, but then fled.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual battery and served
a five-year prison term. When his term ended in 1998, state prosecutors
moved to confine him in a treatment center, saying he suffered from an
"antisocial personality disorder." A jury agreed to order his commitment.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, the Kansas Supreme Court ordered a new civil hearing
for Crane in which prosecutors would have to prove that the "defendant
cannot control his behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision in Kansas vs. Crane, 00-957, overturns the state
court's ruling, but it is nonetheless likely to lead to a new hearing for
Crane under the standard announced by Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas Atty. Gen. Carla J. Stovall said she was pleased with the
outcome. "It's a good decision for victims' rights, and it's a workable
standard. If they had upheld the Kansas court, we would have been put out
of business."</TE>
<TE>   Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman for California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer,
also predicted the ruling will cause little trouble for the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We require evidence of a mental disorder that predisposes someone to
commit sexually violent acts. We think that pretty much meets the test
set in Crane," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   But J. Clark Kelso, law professor at the McGeorge Law School in
Sacramento, said that the court's criterion of a "serious difficulty in
controlling their behavior" is likely to lead to new hearings for some
inmates now being confined.</TE>
<TE>   A Minnesota law professor who has closely tracked these cases agreed
that inmates in a number of states will be able to get new hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "The key message here is that they have to prove something more than
the person has a mental disorder. It's a separate element to show a real
lack of control," said Eric Janus, a professor at the William Mitchell
College of Law in St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>Court to Take Up Utah Census Issue</TE>
<TE>   In other action Tuesday, the court said it would hear Utah's complaint
that a sampling technique used by the Census Bureau cost it one seat in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the justices said census officials could not adjust
the state population totals through sampling. But that ruling was not
seen as restricting the Census Bureau from estimating the size of some
households based on their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Utah officials say that process violates the Constitution's call for
an "actual enumeration" of the population. The justices may not consider
the issue until the fall (Utah vs. Evans, 01-714).</TE>

<HD>Bush Promotes His Energy Plan as Good for the Bad Economy</HD>
<DH>Politics: President keeps the focus on domestic matters as a
preview of next week's State of the Union speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELLE, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>Carrying a message of job protection to a state where the economy
is often perilous, President Bush on Tuesday touted both the White House
energy program pending in Congress and the tax cut he pushed into law as
vital to fighting the nation's recession.</LD>
<LD>   In speeches at an airport rally and to assembly-line workers in West
Virginia, Bush continued the aggressive effort he launched earlier this
month to defend his domestic policies--and to lay the groundwork for the
State of the Union address he will deliver Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   His energy proposal, which stresses finding new sources of energy and
includes a controversial plan to explore for oil and natural gas in the
Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge, "is in the best interests of people
trying to find work and the best interests of the United States of
America," he said at the Cecil I. Walker Machinery Co.</LD>
<TE>   Cheaper, reliable energy enables companies to create jobs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also sought to rebut growing criticism by Democrats of the 10-year,
$1.35-billion tax cut that took effect in June. Some Democrats, most
notably Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), have proposed delaying or
rolling back parts of the law that would benefit wealthy taxpayers later
this decade.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has argued that such changes would be tantamount to a tax
increase, and he pressed that case Tuesday. "There is kind of a wacky
theory going around Washington. It says, the more [government agencies]
take in your taxes, the better off you'll be," Bush said. It doesn't make
any economic sense. It doesn't make any dollars and cents. . . . If you
want to encourage an economy to recover, you let people keep more of
their own money."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush focused on economic issues, he reiterated his
administration's commitment to the war on terrorism. "We're ready, we're
steady, we're resolved and we will rout out the terrorists no matter what
cave they think they can hide in, and we will bring them to justice,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks underscored the larger message he has been sending in a
series of stops across the country this month: Offer reassurance that the
recession can be vanquished while drawing attention to his leadership in
the counterterrorism effort.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Bush has chosen to deliver such speeches in
politically potent states.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia, for instance, proved surprisingly crucial in the 2000
election. In winning the state with 52% of the vote, Bush became the
first Republican presidential candidate to carry West Virginia since
Ronald Reagan in 1984. And without the five electoral votes from the
traditionally Democratic state, Bush would have lost the White House to
Al Gore, regardless of the contested outcome in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The president's travels since the first of the year have spotlighted
such political calculations. Among the states he has visited are Oregon,
which Gore won narrowly in 2000, Ohio, routinely a crucial state in
presidential elections, and New Hampshire, the only Northeastern state
Bush won and the site of a closely watched Senate race this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's interest in courting West Virginia was clear early last year
when he made it the fourth state he visited after taking office.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he paid close heed to West Virginia's perennial economic
worries, promising he would propose a significant increase in funds for
job training.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state's unemployment rate, at 4.5%, remains below the
national average of 5.8%, it lost an estimated 4,400 jobs last year. In
addition, the steel industry, long an important part of West Virginia's
economy, is struggling.</TE>
<TE>   With an eye on the industry for which the state is best known, Bush
linked increased coal production to both an improved national economy and
national security.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech at Yeager Airport in Charleston, W.Va., Bush said, "In
order to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy, we've got to
find and produce more energy at home, including coal."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he believes that can be accomplished in an
environmentally acceptable manner.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that we can have coal production and enhanced technologies
in order to make sure the coal burns cleaner," he said. "Now, I know
there are some in Washington who don't want to concede that. But they
must not have much faith in the technology that's coming on line."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), in a letter Tuesday to
President Bush, proposed setting aside some Democratic and Republican
priorities to immediately approve parts of an economic stimulus package
with broad bipartisan support.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle would extend unemployment benefits, give tax rebate checks to
people who missed out last year, increase new investment tax write-offs
for businesses and give cash-strapped states more federal Medicaid money.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats would drop plans to raise unemployment benefits and
subsidize health care premiums for the newly jobless. Daschle would omit
GOP priorities such as accelerating the income tax cuts enacted last year
and repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax.</LD>
<TE>   Daschle's proposal would cost the federal treasury $69 billion this
year and $7 billion next year. The GOP plan would cost $200 billion over
five years.</TE>

<HD>Pedophile Suspect Is Back in News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS
</DL>
<LD>More than five years after Marc Dutroux's arrest on charges of
abduction, rape and killing of young girls, Belgium's most notorious
prisoner and his infamous pedophilia scandal were back on the front pages
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Belgian weekly Humo published correspondence that Dutroux had with
a journalist over the last year, in which he denied killing four of the
girls he is accused of kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday night, the VTM television network aired a prison interview
with Dutroux in which he suggested that Belgian authorities did not want
to investigate pedophile networks.</LD>
<TE>   Although Dutroux divulged no new information on the cases, the sudden
media spotlight has brought one of Belgium's biggest postwar scandals to
the fore again.</TE>
<TE>   Dutroux's case led to an overhaul of Belgian law enforcement agencies
after revelations of inept police work in the search for the missing
children provoked widespread outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Dutroux is serving a five-year sentence for a 1998 escape. His trial
on the kidnapping, rape and murder charges is expected to begin early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Dutroux was arrested Aug. 13, 1996, while on parole after serving less
than half of a 13-year sentence for abducting and raping five girls in
the mid-1980s.</TE>
