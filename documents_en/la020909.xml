<HD>Innards Can Be a Treasure Chest of Semiprecious Stones</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Folks can treasure strange things--even things that originated in
people or animal innards, sometimes causing excruciating pain and
complications in the unfortunates who grew them.</LD>
<LD>   Take bezoars, slimy glops of foreign matter that form blockages in
stomachs. Queen Elizabeth I proudly wore a gold ring sporting a dried
bezoar--and she wasn't alone in this odd love. The growths, first
found in stomachs of wild goats, were long believed to have medicinal
properties. In ages past, you could even rent a bezoar for the day if
you couldn't afford to own one yourself. (The word "bezoar" comes
from the Persian word for "antidote.")</LD>
<LD>   Or take gallstones, which form farther down the gut, in the
gallbladder. They've been found in the innards of 3,000-year-old
Egyptian mummies--and exist in an estimated 15 million people in the
U.S. today, many of whom suffer no symptoms and may never know they
are there.</LD>
<TE>   Gallstones are not just treasured by folks who've had them removed
and taken them home to keep in a jar. Long considered curative,
animal gallstones are still used in Oriental medicine (one Chinese
medicine Web site promises to supply "dried ox gallstones of finest
quality, freshly harvested, all year round.")</TE>
<TE>   Gallstones, what is more, are rather attractive. They're mixed in
hue--beige, brown, gray, yellow and white--and sometimes resemble ice
crystals or tree rings when sliced through. They can consist of
various kinds of chemicals in different ratios, but in this country,
most have cholesterol as their major ingredient. That isn't
surprising, because there's lots of cholesterol in the
gallbladder--the bladder's job is to squeeze a mix of
cholesterol-derived chemicals called bile into the gut to help digest
fat. Normally, the cholesterol stays dissolved. But sometimes it
starts forming tiny crystals--known as sludge--and, eventually,
stones.</TE>
<TE>   In some people, the stones may sit there indefinitely and cause
nary a twinge, says Dr. Salam Zakko, professor of medicine in
gastroenterology and director of the gallstone evaluation and
management center at the University of Connecticut. In others,
because of the positioning of the stones, it hurts like the bejabbers
when a fatty meal is eaten. The gallbladder squeezes and strains
against the stones, which sometimes block the opening to the small
intestine--causing discomfort for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment, these days, can involve anything from the mildest
intervention (eat less fatty food) to actual removal of the
gallbladder, Zakko says. But Zakko frowns on the holistic health
practice of attempting to "flush" the stones out of the gallbladder
by consuming giant meals and a copious quantity of olive oil--because
besides being rather painful, it can be dangerous. "I have seen
patients who have been through that and run into major trouble," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Gallstones come in various shapes and sizes. So, too, do bezoars
(which are found in people as well as wild goats) and which appear as
dark brown, green or black masses.</TE>
<TE>   The textbooks classify bezoars according to what they're made
of--which can be hair, insoluble vegetable matter, even certain
medications (sometimes still with visible bits of pills embedded in
them).</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, hair-based bezoars are most common in kids with
psychological compulsions to chew hair. Vegetable-based bezoars often
crop up in people whose stomachs don't churn normally, allowing the
fibrous material to stay put and build up. Overindulging in
persimmons, in particular, is a known bezoar-inducer: Tannin in the
fruit starts coagulating in the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, bezoars are totally without symptoms--but can induce
feelings of fullness, nausea, vomiting, pain and weight loss when
they cause a blockage. They can often be dealt with by deftly snaking
endoscopes down into the stomach and breaking down the mass, bit by
bit, with forceps, little nets or by flushing, Zakko says. Sometimes
they require surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Other remedies are on the wane, Zakko says--such as plying the
patient with meat tenderizer to try and break up the mass. "It
tenderizes the stomach wall as well."</TE>
<TE>   One of the oddest-sounding bezoars occurs when hair not only forms
a clump in the stomach but meanders into the small intestine too,
forming a long, black stringy mass--a condition known as the
"Rapunzel syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   We doubt if Queen Elizabeth would have opted to adorn herself with
that.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Natural remedies to relieve menopausal symptoms are attracting lots
of attention since the recent news that hormone replacement therapy
carries a slightly increased risk of heart attack and stroke.</LD>
<LD>   But few natural therapies, such as herbs and other plant products,
have been rigorously tested for their effects on menopausal
women--and fewer have been examined in comparison with hormone
therapy. A new study, however, is among the first to do just that,
and the results show that natural doesn't always mean better.</LD>
<LD>   The study found that flaxseed supplementation and hormone therapy
were equally effective in treating mild menopausal symptoms such as
hot flashes. But only the hormone regimen (estrogen, or estrogen plus
progesterone) was helpful in lowering the women's cholesterol.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers at Universite Laval in Quebec, Canada, assigned 25
postmenopausal women with high cholesterol levels to a four-month
cholesterol-lowering diet followed by two months on either flaxseed
supplements or hormones. After a two-month break, the groups switched
treatments. The 40 grams per day of flaxseed was provided in bread
and in ground flaxseed that was added to other foods.</TE>
<TE>   Flaxseed comes from the flax plant and contains the most
concentrated food source of lignan, a type of plant hormone that is
similar to estrogen. Among postmenopausal women, the supplement,
which can be purchased as crushed grains or oil, is popular for hot
flashes and to reduce the risks of heart disease and osteoporosis,
although those uses are unproved.</TE>
<TE>   While other studies have suggested that flaxseed can alter
cholesterol levels, the Canadian study found that LDL (or "bad")
cholesterol fell 15.9% on hormones but only 1.6% after flaxseed use.
Hormone use also boosted other favorable markers related to
cardiovascular health in comparison with flaxseed.</TE>
<TE>   Flaxseed remains of interest to researchers in other fields.
Preliminary studies have shown it may help protect postmenopausal
women against breast cancer. Other studies have shown it might curb
prostate cancer growth.</TE>

<TE>   Low-Dose Birth Control Pill May Reduce Side Effects</TE>
<TE>   Women who are troubled by birth control pills' side effects, such
as breast tenderness, bloating and nausea, may benefit from a
lower-dose oral contraceptive.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration has approved a variation of the
nation's bestselling birth control pill. The new pill, Ortho
Tri-Cyclen Lo, contains 25 micrograms of estrogen, which is 10
micrograms less than the original Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Both versions
contain the same dose of progestin. The lower-dose pill was approved
Aug. 23 and is expected to be available this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Some birth control pills currently on the market contain even less
estrogen, and they are effective at preventing pregnancy, says Dr.
Ronald T. Burkman, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Baystate
Medical Center in Springfield, Mass. The downside of these very
low-dose pills is that there is a greater risk of bleeding between
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Adding just a little more estrogen, Burkman says, lowers the
chances of breakthrough bleeding and spotting. Burkman has been
involved in several clinical trials of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.</TE>
<TE>   There is another birth control pill on the market that also
contains 25 micrograms of estrogen, but a different type of progestin
than Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. "Progestins play a role in bleeding as
well," says Burkman, "and the properties of the different types of
progestin vary."</TE>
<TE>   Depressed Teens More Likely to Become Obese</TE>
<TE>   For teenagers, depression may be as great a contributor to obesity
as temptingly large portions of fast food or soft drinks in the
school lunchroom.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 9,374 adolescents found that those who were obese and
depressed were likely to be even more overweight a year later. The
researchers, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital, also found that a
depressed mood doubled the risk of obesity in those who were not
obese when the study began. The risk of obesity in depressed teens
remained high even when researchers eliminated physical activity,
smoking and parental obesity as factors.</TE>
<TE>   When the study of seventh-to 12th-graders started, there was no
difference in the incidence of depression among the obese, overweight
and non-obese students. One year later, most of those who were obese
at the start of the study were still obese, and the incidence of
obesity increased in the overweight and normal groups. The
researchers found that 12.4% of those who were depressed at the start
of the year were obese the following year, compared with 9.4% of
those who were not depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have been unsure whether obese children tended to be
depressed or if depression led to obesity. Other studies had
suggested that the feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment
associated with the stigma of obesity could lead to depression. And
some research had shown that depression was linked to the development
of obesity in women. But this investigation, which followed teenagers
of both sexes for a year, led the researchers to believe that in many
cases the depression comes first, even in boys.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people think that obesity leads to depression, not vice
versa. But there is emerging evidence that mood disorders can, in
fact, predispose individuals to become obese because both mood and
weight share regulatory pathways in the brain," says Dr. Elizabeth
Goodman, the study's lead author and professor of child and
adolescent health at Brandeis University.</TE>

<TE>   The Complex Links Between Exercise and Arthritis</TE>
<TE>   Regular exercise helps relieve the pain of arthritis, but some
people with achy joints have a hard time getting started. They try to
become more active, but then pain kicks in, forcing them to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Now research on men and women with osteoarthritis in one or both
knees has confirmed that that there is a "pain hump" after exercise.
But quitting doesn't help. In fact, inactivity could make pain worse.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two overweight older people participating in a larger study
at Wake Forest University in North Carolina agreed to keep track of
the pain caused by their arthritis for six straight days. Every other
day, the previously sedentary people exercised from 11 a.m. until
noon--warming up, doing two 15-minute walks and 20 minutes of
strength training, and then cooling down.</TE>
<TE>   Their pain followed a typical pattern, peaking in intensity
between 3 and 4 p.m. and then gradually decreasing throughout the
rest of the day. The exception was on the exercise day, when the pain
intensified immediately after their workouts.</TE>
<TE>   But usually within an hour after exercise, the discomfort began to
subside and continued diminishing over the remaining day. Since the
pain didn't remain high, the researchers concluded that the exercise
triggered it.</TE>
<TE>   Warning people to expect this temporary spike in pain when they
first start to exercise may help them stick with their exercise
program, researchers say. Eventually, the regular exercise is likely
to decrease their discomfort.</TE>

<HD>The Call to Action</HD>
<DH>At last, lifestyle advice we might actually follow</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As weight-loss guru Richard Simmons once trilled on his TV show,
"Never say diet!"</LD>
<LD>   Now the experts who provide the country with health and lifestyle
advice have heard the call. They've apparently figured out that
constant, conflicting advice about food is neither appetizing nor
effective. We're tired of reading food labels, and we don't want to
deprive ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Far better--and perhaps, far easier--to hear the drill sergeant's
command: Get moving.</LD>
<TE>   In this spirit, a panel of top nutritionists last week released
guidelines that urged Americans to obsess less about food and more
about moving their bodies. The recommendations, prepared for the
government by the Institute of Medicine, allow for a broad range of
diets, while doubling to one hour a day the amount of exercise
previously thought necessary to stay healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "To exercise takes one, single decision: You go and do it," said
Paul Thompson, director of preventive cardiology at Hartford Hospital
in Connecticut. "Following a diet takes hundreds of decisions a day.
Every minute you're thinking that maybe you'll have a chocolate bar,
maybe you'll have a doughnut. And the worst of it is that one
slip--and you've canceled all the benefit."</TE>
<TE>   We're not home free. We're told to keep our diet within certain
bounds--only 20% to 35% of calories from fat, for example. But
there's more flexibility here than was to be found in previous
reports, which focused on the dangers of junk food, overeating and
high-fat foods. Such warnings didn't prevent the rate of obesity from
nearly doubling--to 22% of American adults in 2000, about 38 million
people. Millions of Americans continually on diets are fat; millions
of others eat like horses and are fit as jockeys.</TE>
<TE>   "The report acknowledges what we've known for a long time, that
some of the fittest people also eat the most calories," Thompson
said. "The reason they can get away with it is that they exercise."</TE>
<TE>   The report also gives a nod to our long-standing frustration with
nutrition advice--one day all fats are declared a scourge, and pasta
a healthy alternative; the next, carbohydrates are suspect. Instead,
the new advice makes clear that components of food behave in complex
ways: Eating some kinds of fat appear to worsen cholesterol readings
and increase the risk of obesity; eating others may improve
cardiovascular health.</TE>
<TE>   And no more blanket recommendations to eat 2,000 calories a day.
"The message on diet is: One size does not fit all," said Alice H.
Lichtenstein, a nutrition professor at Tufts University and a panel
member. "Your optimal intake depends on physical activity you get,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics have expressed doubts that an hour a day of exercise is a
realistic expectation for many working Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Previous guidelines advised that half an hour of walking, swimming
or cycling was enough to maintain a normal body weight. But for those
who can find the time, exercise requires far less discipline than a
strict diet, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "What I say is that exercise means only one change--in your own
life. A diet usually means changes for the whole family; it's a much
harder thing to do. You can enjoy exercise," he said. "No one enjoys
deprivation."</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who don't have the hour to devote to activity,
following the new guidelines will mean many small decisions. "It
means shifting your patterns throughout the day," said Lichtenstein.
"It means thinking about carrying a note up the stairs to a colleague
rather than e-mailing; or parking some distance from the grocery
store rather than sitting there letting your car idle waiting for a
parking spot right in front."</TE>
<TE>   Never say diet--and keep those arms moving!</TE>

<HD>Gum Could Be What the Dentist Ordered</HD>
<DH>Prevention* When it contains plaque- and cavity-fighting
ingredients, elderly people could benefit from chewing some daily.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of pieces of medicated gum a day may keep the dentist away,
at least for frail senior citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Dental care is a particular problem among the elderly. Many take
medications that decrease the production of saliva, which has natural
antibiotic properties and helps wash away food debris. That leaves
them more prone not only to cavities and mouth infections, but to the
accumulation of bacteria and yeast that can cause serious infections
elsewhere, such as pneumonia from microbes that live in the mouth.
They're even more vulnerable because tooth and denture cleaning often
take a back seat to other types of physical assistance.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers studied 111 seniors living in 16 residential homes in
West Hertfordshire, England. They divided them into three groups. One
group chewed gum with a combination of chlorhexidine acetate and
xylitol (called ACHX in the study ); another chewed xylitol gum
(called X); and the third group chewed nothing. Those who got either
of the gums chewed one piece after breakfast and another after
dinner.</LD>
<TE>   Xylitol, a sweetener, plaque fighter, cavity fighter and saliva
stimulator, was discovered in 1891 by the German chemist Emil Fischer
and began to be used in the 1960s in the manufacturing of foods,
drugs and oral health products. Chlorhexidine acetate, which kills
yeasts and bacteria, has been found to reduce plaque formation even
more effectively than xylitol, but when used in mouthwash form, it
can stain the teeth, so researchers sought to find out if it can work
effectively in gum form.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Beighton and his colleagues from the Dental Caries
Research Group at Guy's, King's and St. Thomas's Dental Institute in
London, examined the groups every three months for a year. They
reported in the August issue of the Journal of the American
Geriatrics Society that both gums stimulated the flow of saliva, but
that test subjects who got the xylitol gum or no gum had higher
levels in their mouths of three microorganisms--the mutans group of
streptococci, which are most associated with tooth decay,
lactobacilli and yeasts.</TE>
<TE>   Both chewing gums reduced the amount of denture debris, sores
around dentures, and cracks at the corners of the mouth, although the
ACHX gum did it better.</TE>
<TE>   Neither gum produced any side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Because gum containing both chlorhexidine acetate and xylitol is

<HD>Closer to a Cure for Diabetes?</HD>
<DH>Research* Transplants of insulin-secreting cells show
promise. But even if the technique catches on, donor cells are hard
to come by.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daily insulin injections are lifesaving for diabetics, but to many
people they rep-resent a heavy burden that can interfere with their
professional and social lives. The wide swings in blood sugar levels
that can occur when injections are given only once or twice a day,
furthermore, are now known to be the cause of virtually all the
complications of diabetes, ranging from nerve damage to heart disease
to blindness.</LD>
<LD>   But the hunt for a cure--rather than just an ongoing
treatment--has yielded few results. Pancreas transplants are such a
cure, but surgeons are reluctant to perform them because of side
effects from the powerful drugs required.</LD>
<LD>   For at least two decades, scientists have believed that
transplanting only insulin-secreting islet cells from the pancreas
might present a better alternative, but it proved difficult to keep
the transplants alive and functioning and only a few diabetics have
benefited.</LD>
<TE>   Then, three years ago, researchers developed a new technique
called the Edmonton protocol that has revolutionized islet cell
transplants, promising to bring a cure to much larger numbers of
patients with Type 1 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 200 patients have been treated so far using the
protocol, but the results have been remarkable. Three-quarters of
patients who have received the transplants have remained
insulin-free--not requiring injections of the hormone--for at least a
year, according to researchers, a dramatic increase from the 10% to
15% success rates reported before the development of the technique.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely past the proof-of-concept stage," said Dr. Craig
Smith of the UCLA Medical Center. "Now we need to take the field
forward and make it more applicable to a wider population."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the key problems impeding the transplants is the lack
of sufficient donor pancreases, which are the source of the islet
cells. Only about 6,000 donor pancreases are available each year,
according to Dr. Robert Goldstein, chief scientific officer for the
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, while as many as 1 million
Americans with Type 1 diabetes could potentially benefit from the
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   People with Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes are unlikely to
benefit. Most with this form of the disease continue to make insulin,
but their cells become resistant to its effects for reasons that are
not clear. Instead, they use drugs that stimulate the production of
more insulin or make their bodies more sensitive to insulin.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are thus looking at alternative sources for islet
cells, such as growing them in culture, producing them from stem
cells, or even using islets from other species. Most of these
approaches are still far from use in humans, but Mexican and Canadian
researchers startled fellow scientists recently by revealing that
they had successfully implanted pig islets in adolescent
diabetics--without using immune-suppressing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   If the research can be replicated, "it's truly the most remarkable
result ever following an islet transplant experiment," said Dr.
Camillo Ricordi of the University of Miami. But, he added, the
scientific community will remain very skeptical "until more data is
available and more patients are studied."</TE>
<TE>   Islet cells make up only about 1% of the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes
results when the islets are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction for
reasons that scientists do not yet understand. Although insulin pumps
can deliver a steady dose of the hormone, these devices are
relatively new and most patients still rely on injections of insulin
to control their disease.</TE>
<TE>   The "gold standard" for curing diabetes is a pancreas transplant,
which is successful in about 80% of cases. Only about 1,200 such
transplants are performed every year worldwide, however, because the
pancreas produces a strong immune response in the recipient and
powerful immunosuppressive drugs must be used to prevent rejection.
Most doctors do not think the benefits outweigh the risk associated
with the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons thus transplant a pancreas only when a patient is also
receiving a kidney transplant, and thus has to take the drugs anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Islet cells alone do not trigger such a powerful rejection
reaction, and researchers had hoped they would be easier to work with
than an intact pancreas. That did not prove to be the case, however,
until 1999. In that year, Dr. James Shapiro of the University of
Alberta reported that the first eight patients his group treated
using a new protocol remained insulin-free for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The key to his success was the use of a new combination of
anti-rejection drugs--sirolimus, tacrolimus and daclizumab.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro's team used a combination of enzymes to remove the islet
cells from two donor pancreases for each recipient. After the islets
were purified, they were immediately infused into the portal vein
leading into the liver, where the cells took up residence, began
producing insulin and releasing it into the bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health and Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation quickly began sponsoring studies of the Edmonton protocol
at 10 U.S. centers, and early results from those centers were
reported last month at a Miami meeting of the Transplantation
Society.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro's group reported that 70% of its patients have now been
insulin-free for two years and one has been insulin-free for three
years. Dr. Bernhard Hering of the University of Minnesota reported
that 14 of 16 patients his team had treated were now insulin-free.
Ricordi's team in Miami reported that all nine patients it had
treated using the new protocol were insulin-free, and researchers
from other NIH-sponsored centers reported similar early results.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Edmonton protocol "is wildly successful, we could
only be helping a couple of thousand people every year" because of
the shortage of donor pancreases, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason people were intrigued by the pig cell study
reported by Dr. Rafael Valdez of the Children's Hospital of Mexico.
Valdez and colleagues in Canada and New Zealand implanted pig islet
cells in 12 diabetics who were 10 to 15 years old. The key to their
effort was the simultaneous implantation of Sertoli cells from the
pigs.</TE>
<TE>   Sertoli cells, found in the testes, are thought to protect sperm
from attack by the immune system by selectively deactivating key
immune cells. Many researchers have previously speculated that the
cells could provide a similar protection in transplants, and some
animal experiments seem to support that.</TE>
<TE>   Valdez told the Miami meeting that one of the recipients was now
insulin-free and that half still had functioning grafts--meaning that
they required less insulin than before the procedure. He said that
the team is now gearing up to expand the study with another 24
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Critics noted, however, that the transplants could not have been
performed in the United States because the Food and Drug
Administration would not permit them until more animal studies had
been performed, especially in primates. Many researchers also fear
that such xenograft recipients will become infected with animal
viruses--especially the pig endogenous retrovirus, or PERV--which
could then be spread to others.</TE>
<TE>   Valdez said that none of the children have shown evidence of such
an infection.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein also questioned why the study had been done in
adolescents. "Why not practice it in adults or sicker people?" he
said. "Supposing it really is harmful. The children could become
sensitized to islets." If the children later received a transplant of
human islets, he said, they could reject them as well.For the long
term, researchers are looking at ways to convert stem cells into
islets, which offers the potential for yielding unlimited supplies.
"In animal experiments, we get something that looks like an islet,"
Goldstein said. "If we could do it with human cells, that would be a
giant step forward." But virtually everyone agrees that it will be
several years at minimum before researchers can even contemplate
human trials of such an approach.</TE>

<LD>No American will ever forget where he or she was on the morning of
Sept. 11, 2001. I'm no exception, though that date will always mark
two major events in my life. When the first plane struck the World
Trade Center, I was at a funeral home, preparing to act as a
pallbearer at my father's memorial service and burial.</LD>
<LD>   It was a duty I assumed with sadness but also some ambivalence. My
father left home when I was 15. He had been cheating on my mother for
years, it turns out, and had decided to start a new life. For the
next quarter-century, I saw him only once or twice a year. Now and
then he seemed to take an interest in my life and the lives of my
siblings. But it was also clear that he had a new family, new friends
and new priorities. If pressed, for example, I'm sure he couldn't
have named half of his grandchildren without some coaching. One of
the most painful moments at his funeral occurred when several people
I had never seen before that day stood up and shared loving memories
of their charming, funny and devoted friend Bob.</LD>
<LD>   When I learned my father's prostate cancer was incurable, I
realized something about myself: I had never forgiven him for
deserting our family. I still sent Father's Day cards, but on the
inside I remained a rejected, bitter teenager. Which, trust me, is a
lousy way to live--bad for both the mind and the body, it turns out.</LD>
<TE>   The clergy has long preached the importance of forgiveness, but in
recent years scientists have produced evidence that letting go of
anger toward the people who hurt us is good for mental and physical
health.</TE>
<TE>   Forgiveness isn't easy for anyone, but according to a 2001 study,
men may cling to grudges a little more tightly than women do.
Psychologist Loren Toussaint and colleagues at the University of
Michigan Institute for Social Research interviewed 1,423 Americans
and rated 54% of women as forgiving types, versus 49% of men.
Meanwhile, 48% of women said they had asked forgiveness of others
they had hurt, but just 37% of men had done the same.</TE>
<TE>   The study, published last year in the Journal of Adult
Development, also found that people with forgiving personalities have
fewer psychological problems, feel more satisfied with their lives
and are generally healthier than grudge holders.</TE>
<TE>   The same trend has turned up in other studies, including one with
particular significance this week. A team led by Toussaint, now an
assistant professor of psychology at Idaho State University in
Pocatello, recently asked 400 Americans to rate how willing they were
to forgive the terrorists who committed the Sept. 11 attacks.
Toussaint's group found that the least forgiving people were also the
least healthy.</TE>
<TE>   They were more likely to suffer from depression or post-traumatic
stress disorder, have trouble sleeping or report some kind of health
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Holding on to anger about an old hurt can also mess up your
marriage or other relationships, says psychologist Fred Luskin,
author of "Forgive for Good: A Proven Prescription for Health and
Happiness" (HarperSanFrancisco, 2001). "It's harder to let down one's
defenses and achieve intimacy if you're carrying mistrust and
mistreatment from the past," says Luskin. "You tend to act that out
in the present relationship."</TE>
<TE>   A grudge, of course, is nothing more than bottled-up, simmering
anger. There's not much doubt among scientists that, over time,
hostility harms the human body, especially the cardiovascular system.
For example, a 2000 study by researchers at the University of North
Carolina found that people who are most prone to anger are nearly
three times more likely to suffer a heart attack than people who are
the least hotheaded. According to one theory, stress hormones may
cause deadly clots to form in the arteries that feed blood to the
heart. With that in mind, some scientists believe forgiveness may
actually reduce the risk of heart disease. "Is there an antidote to
anger?" asks Toussaint. "Forgiveness may be it."</TE>
<TE>   In one study, psychologist Charlotte van Oyen Witvliet and her
colleagues at Hope College in Holland, Mich., asked 71 college
students to think about someone who had hurt them and focus on the
anger they felt toward that person. Then they asked the subjects to
try to feel forgiveness toward the offender. All the while, the
subjects were wired with electrodes that measured how their bodies
responded to their emotions. While the students were nursing their
grudges, their blood pressure surged and heart rates increased. Their
muscles tensed, and they perspired more. Thinking about forgiveness,
meanwhile, caused the subjects' cardiovascular systems and nerves to
calm down.</TE>
<TE>   Some guys are probably thinking: What am I supposed to do, become
a doormat? Let jerks walk all over me, then let them off the hook?
Witvliet says the old saying is wrong--you don't have to forgive and
forget. In other words, you can let go of your anger toward someone
who has wronged you but then choose not to associate with him or her
anymore. After all, Witvliet says, "it's wise to stay away from
people who have proven themselves abusive or untrustworthy." The key,
she says, is to free "yourself from the shackles of rage and
resentment."</TE>
<TE>   Toussaint says it's not clear what makes some people more
forgiving than others. But research hints that receiving an apology
from the offender makes it much easier for a grudge holder to drop
the charge, he says. Empathy helps too. "If you can begin to
understand what caused that person to harm you," says Toussaint, "you
can begin to process some understanding and forgiveness."</TE>
<TE>   I visited my father several times in the months before he died.
Gradually the disease robbed him of the glib confidence he had relied
on throughout his career as a salesman. On one occasion he wept while
talking about his fear of death, the first time I had ever seen tears
in his eyes. Another day, near the end, my father lay in bed
muttering nonsense, his once-nimble mind addled by painkillers, the
cancer or perhaps both. Suddenly he turned to me and asked, "Where
did I go wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   It was the closest thing to an apology he would ever offer. As his
life slipped away, I found myself thinking less about my father's
selfish, unrepentant side. Instead I was able to focus on his
humanity, flaws and all, and realized that I could forgive him. I
still have mixed feelings about my father. But the anger is mostly
gone, and I no longer waste time and energy raging at the past.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a typical day at the new house, which meant I was busy dealing
with, variously, Carpenter Guy, Plumber Guy, Handyman Guy and, for a
change of pace, Computer Guy, when Dr. James Waisman, otherwise known
as Oncologist Guy, called.</LD>
<LD>   "Your tumor markers came back high," he said, referring to a blood
test, taken a few days before, that detects a protein made by cancer
cells.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh yeah?" I responded, absently juggling the phone while writing
checks and pointing. "And high is what?"</LD>
<TE>   "Normal is 0-40. Yours are 252."</TE>
<TE>   "Dear me, that is high," I said, attention having been seized.
"And that means what now?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's back."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, gentle reader, it, and I, are back. "It" would be the breast
cancer I had diagnosed (I forgo the verb "battled" since, to my way
of thinking, all I did was lie back and let stuff be done to me) in
1997 and thought banished forever by July 1998, chronicled right here
in a monthly series called "brave and inspirational" by some and
"obliviously and freakishly cheerful" by others.</TE>
<TE>   Though my doctors, Waisman and Melvin Silverstein (both once at
the Van Nuys-based Breast Center, now still together fighting the
good fight at USC Norris' Lee Breast Center) had thought it entirely
likely I had seen the back of cancer for good, they had also warned
me there were chances of a recurrence. So I'd like to say this wasn't
entirely unexpected. But that would be a lie. It was completely
unexpected, as was the initial breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   And I certainly didn't expect Waisman to say what he did--that not
only was it back, but it was actually not in the breast but
elsewhere--and thus much more difficult to treat.</TE>
<TE>   But after a number of tests--CT, PET (positron emission
tomography), bone scan and then way too many needle biopsies under
only local anesthetic--it was confirmed; the cancer had returned, and
set up shop in my liver. Fortunately, the tumor was tiny, and most of
it was blood and not cancer cells, but still. Stage 4 metastasized
cancer, they call it (there is no stage 5). All sorts of four-letter
words, I call it.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly, let's clear up a misconception: Having breast cancer in
your liver means you still have breast cancer, not suddenly liver
cancer. Breast cancer is not life threatening while in the
breast--breasts are not vital organs except in relation to matters
like Pamela Anderson's career. But have it spread to your liver and
you learn that 85% of patients die within five years of diagnosis and
the rest don't live much longer.</TE>
<TE>   OK, said Waisman upon the confirmation, we are going to go for the
home run here--total cure. He thought this possible because of new
drugs (and new combinations of drugs), all of which had come into
play since I was last treated, and because my cancer seemed confined
to a solitary site. And a triple would be what? "We get rid of it, it
comes back in five or six years and by then we have the Magic
Bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Fine, said my husband, Steve, and I, so what's the plan? A
relatively new protocol, combining two different chemos every three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Day 1 delivers, via IV, Taxotere, a newish chemo that seems to
pack a serious wallop but without massive side effects. Starting also
that day will be two weeks of oral chemo Xeloda, which also doesn't
cause too many problems. A week off, and then repeat, for a total of
six rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, that sounds great! we said. Except, he continued, when you
combine the two chemos, the results are super-ultra toxic.</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course they are. And that means? Body aches, bad ones.
Mouth sores. Fatigue. "But no nausea?" I said, having priorities. No,
it doesn't seem to affect the GI tract. Swollen, tingling, peeling
hands and feet. But no nausea!</TE>
<TE>   I can do that, I said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and uh, just out of curiosity, what if we did nothing? I
asked. What are we talking here? "About a year and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Righteo! Here I go! Off to do something! You betcha!</TE>
<TE>   So I did what anybody would do--I dyed my hair platinum. After
all, it would fall out before I would have to deal with roots.</TE>
<TE>   Waisman warned me at the outset, this stuff will--and this is the
scientific term here--"kick your butt."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, I sniffed, not my butt. Nothing kicks my butt. And
indeed, I felt rather spiffy for a long time. The regimen didn't seem
like much at first. Chemo day passed in an amnesiac blur thanks to
the medicinal cocktail that went along with it, as would the
following day. Day 3 brought the predicted body aches; think flu
aches, only sharper. No matter, my new best friend Vicodin (good
enough for certain celebrities, good enough for me) wiped those out.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of rounds (including an increased dosage of my
twice-daily oral chemo), my taste buds took a vacation, and the
inside of my mouth grew not exactly mouth sores, but a fuzziness that
made everything I ate taste as one would imagine fiberglass
insulation tastes. And eating only made my mouth feel like said
insulation. Did that stop me from eating? Heck, no; I was also on
steroids, which are notorious for causing weight gain, as is chemo in
general. And forget the exercise I vowed to maintain; I had swollen
legs, feet and hands, and a stiffness that gave me the limping gait
of an elderly Quasimodo.</TE>
<TE>   And so, within a short time, there were precisely five items of
clothing in my closet I could fit into. Five.</TE>
<TE>   This particular chemo combo also, only in part due to the
accompanying pain pills, dulled my brain enough so that, unlike
during my previous treatment, I had to stop working for a couple of
months. And so we learn one of cancer's dirty little secrets: It's
boring. Really boring. I read voraciously because it was a way of
passing the time that didn't hurt, and also because it was an escape,
but even so--books, pills, figuring out what I could possibly eat
that might have taste and wouldn't hurt, making Steve fetch whatever
that would be, more books, more pills, naps, and you've got my
summer.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, I did find dubious entertainment in the
spectacle of my fingernails and toenails; another side effect caused
each to gradually loosen from the nail bed, oozing disgusting and
creative bodily fluids, giving off a smell even more vile, and though
none dropped off, precisely, they were only attached by generous
definition. I amused myself grossing Steve out by shoving my leprous
digits into his face, shouting, "Unclean! Unclean!"</TE>
<TE>   But put all that together--dodgy mental functions, foul nails, no
hair, constant mouth grief, and fat--and there came a day I had to
admit that while thus far I had at least wrestled the Kick Butt Combo
to a draw, it now had me in a chokehold. Which is to say, I cried
self-piteously on the phone with my doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, though," said Waisman, "of the five patients I've given
this to so far ..." Excuse me, did you say five? "Yes. I told you it
was experimental." But you didn't say you had invented it Tuesday! "
... you are handling it the best, if that makes you feel any better."
And sadly, it did.</TE>
<TE>   But all good things come to an end, and sometimes with an odd
conjunction of events. And so it was the morning of Sept. 11, when I
was scheduled for a CT and bone scan (and the following day, a PET
scan), to see if those six rounds of chemo had worked. I called the
hospital and asked, "Can it be? I should still come in for my tests?
The world is coming to an end, should I still bother having tests?
Can it matter anymore?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they said, and so there it was, a symbol that, in small ways,
everything would continue after all, personified by Steve glued to
the waiting-room TV, finding out the world's future, while I lay in a
humming machine a few feet away having a CT scan, finding out our
future. "Like my stuff matters anymore," I said to my friends a week
later. "But in case you were wondering, I'm in total remission." And
bless them, each and every one shouted hosannas, considering that
news one bit of light in a week of impossible dark.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to early detection (via the tumor markers) and new
medication protocols, I have indeed been pushed into total remission.
(Most patients who have a recurrence in their liver get, at best,
about 50% remission.) As a clincher, I spent another few months on
that two-week oral chemo--an extra precaution--keeping my mouth
strange and my limbs stiff, swollen and aching, the latter a
condition that continues, though considerably decreased, to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Currently I take that newfangled aromatase inhibitor, Femara (like
tamoxifen in its estrogen-suppressing qualities, though it appears to
be more effective), and once-a-month shots of Lupron, to shut my
ovaries down permanently (no estrogen, no estrogen-produced breast
cancer, so goes the theory). My figure is gradually being coaxed back
from the hinterlands. My formerly wavy hair has returned with a curly
vengeance. And my tumor markers, which prompted this whole nonsense,
remain in the normal range.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't write all this at the time because, well, I didn't want
to bum you out in case the news wasn't good. But it is, and it
remains so, 12 months in total remission and counting.</TE>
<TE>   Because I'm not so much back as still here.</TE>

<DH>DANCING ON QUICKSAND: A Gift of Friendship in the Age of
Alzheimer's, By Marilyn Mitchell, Johnson Books; 189 pages, $16</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overview: Marilyn Mitchell's book recounts the friendship that
evolved when she responded to a request to provide three adventures a
week for an 89-year-old Denver retired businessman and philanthropist
who could no longer drive. A job that was supposed to last a month
lasted eight years, as Mitchell, a divorced single mom who ran an
odd-jobs business, learned to tailor a friendship to the special
needs of an aging person struggling with dementia.</LD>
<LD>   What Works: Mitchell, who had no professional care-giving
experience, writes a moving narrative recounting the trust and
respect that developed between her and a bright, refined,
old-fashioned man. She managed to accommodate the dementia as David
Touff's moments of enthusiasm and childlike wonder alternated with
moments of confusion and irritability. Focusing on the positive
without whitewashing the difficulties, Mitchell made every day a
celebration.</LD>

<HD>How to Pick the Right Stability Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE OAKES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'd like to purchase a stability ball, but I'm confused
about the different sizes. Could you offer advice on which one I
should use?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It largely depends on your size and your reason for using
the ball. These large balls (often known as Swiss balls or stability
balls) were first used in rehabilitation exercises and are now
popular for strength training, balance training and stretching.
Choosing the right size will ensure the most effective and safest
workout for you.</LD>
<LD>   Most exercises, such as lower back exercises, balance workouts,
stretches and weight work should be done with the recommended
size/height stability ball. If you're 5 feet to 5 feet, 8 inches, for
example, try a 55-centimeter ball. If you're 5 feet, 9 inches to 6
feet, 3 inches, then a 65-centimeter ball; 6 feet, 4 inches to 6
feet, 9 inches, 75-centimeter; and 6 feet, 10 inches or taller, the
85-centimeter ball.</LD>
<TE>   To increase the intensity of certain exercises, you can use a
smaller ball, such as when doing ab crunches or holding a plank pose.</TE>
<TE>   These exercises are more difficult on smaller and harder balls
because secondary balance muscles are recruited into these exercises.</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to use a ball for cardio exercises or for strength
exercises that require additional weight, such as dumbbells or
barbells, select a ball that is especially designed for these
purposes.</TE>

<HD>Warts Aren't Easy to Catch or Cure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're afraid of toads because you've heard that touching them
causes skin warts, you can relax around the little creatures. Warts
are simply an overgrowth of skin cells caused by infection with the
human papilloma virus. Toads have nothing to do with their
spread--humans do.</LD>
<LD>   The virus is spread either through direct skin-to-skin contact, or
indirectly, through contact with a surface that has been contaminated
with the virus that has been shed from a wart.</LD>
<LD>   But you don't have to fear human contact either, because even if
you come into contact with the virus that causes warts, the risk of
becoming infected is small.</LD>
<TE>   We're not sure why some people develop warts and others don't
after exposure to the virus, or HPV. You don't develop a wart every
time you shake hands with a person who has one, just as you don't
become sick every time you come into contact with someone with a
cold. And although people of all ages can get warts, infection is
significantly more common among children and young adults (immunity
to the virus may develop with age).</TE>
<TE>   Several things can increase the likelihood of infection.
Individuals with poorly functioning immune systems, such as people
with AIDS or those taking immunosuppressants, are at higher risk of
infection than those with healthy immunity. Infection is also more
likely to occur to damaged skin. Habitual nail-biters, for example,
tend to develop warts on their fingers more frequently than
non-biters.</TE>
<TE>   Even seemingly mild trauma to the skin, such as walking on a rough
surface like a pool deck, appears to disrupt the integrity of the
skin sufficiently to increase the risk of infection. For this reason,
public pools are commonly blamed for the spread of warts on the feet.
A simple way to prevent this is by wearing water sandals or other
protective footwear around pools and in communal bathing areas like
locker rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Warts may be diagnosed as "common" or "plantar" warts, according
to their location (although they are all caused by the same virus).
Common warts usually involve the hands. They are typically
skin-colored lesions that protrude from the skin's surface and are
rough to the touch; they're frequently described as having a
"cauliflower-like" appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Plantar warts involve the bottoms of the feet and are sometimes
confused with calluses. Unlike common warts, they do not stick up
above the surface of the skin because the pressure of walking
flattens them, pushing them back into the skin. Although unsightly,
common warts generally present no real discomfort or problem; plantar
warts, on the other hand, may be uncomfortable, even painful.</TE>
<TE>   (Genital warts are also caused by the human papilloma virus but
typically involve different strains. They are spread by sexual
contact and are treated differently than common or plantar warts.)</TE>
<TE>   Because of their characteristic appearance, most warts can be
diagnosed easily. Treatment, however, is not nearly as
straightforward. In many cases, doing nothing at all--"watchful
waiting," as it is sometimes called--is a perfectly acceptable
option. Given sufficient time, many warts will resolve on their own,
especially in children and adolescents. Nearly one-third of all warts
in children will resolve spontaneously within three months; about
two-thirds will disappear within two years (perhaps because the body
develops immunity to the virus). Although there is a small risk of
spreading the infection to another part of the body or to someone
else, there is no other downside to waiting. Warts that don't
disappear on their own can be treated later.</TE>
<TE>   More immediate treatment is necessary when warts--for example, on
the hands--present a cosmetic problem or interfere with daily
activities. Plantar warts may need attention if they are very
uncomfortable or painful.</TE>
<TE>   When treatment is indicated, most physicians agree that it is best
to start with simple therapies. Although no treatment is 100%
effective, over-the-counter products do fairly well, producing cure
rates as high as 70% to 80%. These products contain chemicals such as
salicylic acid, which works by destroying the virus-infected skin
cells. These types of products are not generally recommended for
warts on the face because of the potential for scarring.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to use these preparations exactly as directed.
Daily application is usually required and may need to be continued
for up to three months. To promote penetration of the product into
the wart, the skin should first be rubbed lightly with an emery board
or pumice stone and immersed in warm water. To protect healthy skin
surrounding the wart, petroleum jelly or another type of protective
coating should be applied.</TE>
<TE>   For warts that fail to respond to these self-treatment measures,
more aggressive therapies are available. For example, stronger
prescription medications can be applied to the wart by a physician,
or the infected cells can be killed by freezing them with a procedure
called cryotherapy (although a recent British study has questioned
the effectiveness of this method). When all else fails, warts can be
excised, or cut out.</TE>

<HD>When Situations Heat Up, Most of Us Keep Our Cool</HD>
<DH>A review of social behavior concludes that during crises,
such as terrorist attacks or earthquakes, societal rules and order
prevail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the rescue workers who rushed into the World Trade Center
buildings a year ago will always be revered as heroes, the more than
10,000 people who fled down stairwells and out of the New York City
towers embodied another selfless and deeply rooted instinct--to
preserve social order.</LD>
<LD>   "They filed down those stairs, helping the disabled, passing water
bottles, calling loved ones on cell phones," said Lee Clarke, a
sociologist at Rutgers University and author of a recent review of
social behavior during disasters. "Something in their gut was telling
them to get out, but they didn't lose control. It could have been
much worse."</LD>
<TE>   The review compared victims' response to the terrorist attacks
with a variety of disasters that had the potential to provoke
widespread panic among large groups of people, from nightclub fires
to rock concert hysteria to wartime bombings. In five decades of
disaster research, social scientists have found one common
thread--civil decency almost always carries the hour. Although some
individuals are overwhelmed by fear and "lose it," most of us remain
calm amid the chaos and help care for one another and restore order,
according to Kathleen Tierney, director of the Disaster Research
Center at the University of Delaware. After the floods in Europe this
summer; the Northridge earthquake in 1994; the Loma Prieta quake of
1989; and even in the midst of extended bombing campaigns such as
those of London and Berlin during World War II, citizens as a rule
shared food, clothing and shelter, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to predictions of selfish panic and mass hysteria,
moreover, a disaster can bring out decency that might not otherwise
have been evident.</TE>
<TE>   "When the crunch comes, and the world begins to fall apart, the
true, raw self comes out--and we find it's essentially humane," said
Clarke. "The point is that altruism is not all that exceptional; it's
the rule."</TE>
<TE>   The review, which appears in the fall issue of the sociology
journal Contexts, used testimony of eye witnesses, as well as
reported behavior of the group during and just after the calamities,
all of which included deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists find that certain well-defined predicaments are more
likely than others to send people into flights of wide-eyed screaming
and trampling over their fellow citizens. A confined space, filling
with smoke or flames, whose exits are quickly closing is more liable
to spread panic than the first rumblings of an earthquake, for
example. The sense that some will survive at the expense of others,
the time pressure and the apparent need for decisive action make for
a powerful combination, say those who study panic response.</TE>
<TE>   But even tragic firetraps evoke a wide range of behavior from
those caught inside. On Memorial Day weekend in 1977, 165 people died
trying to escape a fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in
Southgate, Ky. When they first heard of the fire, 1,200 or so
visitors moved calmly toward the main room's three exits, according
to eyewitnesses. After smoke and fire cut off one of the exits and
poured into the room, some people began jumping over chairs and
tables and pushing. But they did not overpower those weaker than
themselves, or violently shove others away, according to an
investigation of the fire, said Clarke.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the rules of behavior during crises are very much the
same as in ordinary life, researchers say. "Social relationships are
very durable," Tierney said. "During disasters gender roles are very
strong: Men do what men are expected to do, the heavier work; women
do what they're expected to, helping care for others. Even leadership
roles persist, with people looking to their superiors for direction."</TE>
<TE>   One reason many of us remain levelheaded, especially in the first
moments after disaster has struck, is kind of denial, social
psychologists surmise. We're attached to our routines; we'd rather
make one more phone call than deal with a fire drill; we don't want
to panic. "We call this the bias toward normalcy," Tierney said.</TE>
<TE>   This longing for social order not only helped thousands of attack
victims in New York and the Pentagon save themselves and others; it
has brought some semblance of "normal" back to those cities in just
one year. "It's a very hopeful thing to think about," said Clarke,
"that the people who are most likely to save me during a crisis are
those right next to me."</TE>

<HD>Science Can't Predict Cancer's Return--Yet</HD>
<DH>Tests under development would identify risks with more
certainty and eliminate needless treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though they've defeated the disease that could have taken their
lives, cancer survivors are often haunted by the specter of a fatal
recurrence.</LD>
<LD>   The fears are especially keen for patients with slow-growing
malignancies, such as those of the breast, because they never know if
their cancer has been truly eradicated. They can suffer relapses
five, 10, even 20 years later.</LD>
<LD>   Although the risk of recurrence declines over time, it never
disappears. "When it comes back, patients are devastated because they
thought they had it licked," said Dr. Susan M. Love, a breast cancer
surgeon at UCLA. And when cancer recurs, it's usually more aggressive
and more difficult to treat.</LD>
<TE>   Even using today's most precise prognostic tools, doctors are
never sure which cancers will remain dormant and which ones will
spread. That may change soon.</TE>
<TE>   Screening techniques now under development may be able to identify
the worst malignancies. Such tests, which examine the cancer cells'
genetic makeup, would free people from this terrible uncertainty
while sparing patients with indolent tumors from undergoing needless
treatments that often have horrific side effects.</TE>
<TE>   "These tests will revolutionize all cancer therapy," said Dr.
Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, chairman of the breast medical oncology
department at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that about 25% to 33% of women with operable breast cancer
will have a recurrence within five years of diagnosis, doctors
currently must gather circumstantial evidence, such as the size,
shape, location and microscopic appearance of cancer tumors, said Dr.
Patricia A. Ganz, director of Cancer Prevention and Control Research
at UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center. Age can be a factor too:
Premenopausal women tend to get more aggressive cancers than older
women.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic clues can also indicate which breast cancers are more
deadly. The her-2 neu oncogene, for instance, which sparks virulent
tumor growth, is present in about 25% to 30% of women with breast
cancer. Also, the more advanced the cancer is (i.e., the higher its
stage), the more likely it is to recur.</TE>
<TE>   Women with tiny tumors confined to the milk ducts, called ductal
carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, are often considered Stage 0 and are
usually considered cured after treatment. While the highest risk of
recurrence is in the first two years, even small Stage I cancers can
reappear years later in a more lethal form.</TE>
<TE>   Stage IV breast cancer has the poorest prognosis; it involves
tumors that have spread to other parts of the body, such as bone,
lung, liver and brain.</TE>
<TE>   But even these factors don't provide a clear map of the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Some women with the most favorable tumors will relapse, while
some women with breast cancer that looks just awful will survive
without a recurrence," said Hortobagyi. "Each case is different."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that remnants of cancer may remain after a
tumor has been cut out, triggering a relapse years later. Breast
cancers also grow slowly. Consequently, tumors may sit in the breast
for seven to eight years before they're large enough to be detected.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have no way of knowing if, during that time, malignant
cells have already hitched rides in the lymphatic system or blood
vessels and set up colonies in bones and vital organs such as the
liver or lungs. When cancer does recur, "the cells may have been
continuously growing, or they became dormant for a while and
something wakes them up," Love said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this unknown, most women receive chemotherapy after
their surgery to prevent the cancer from spreading, even though
studies have shown that three-quarters of patients would do fine
without this toxic therapy. "With chemotherapy we can reduce risks of
recurrence by about a third," Ganz said.</TE>
<TE>   Use of the drug tamoxifen, which blocks estrogen, a hormone that
nurtures the growth of about half of all breast cancers, also cuts
relapse risk by more than one-third. But again, it's unclear which
women are being helped and which ones are being subjected to
unnecessary treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Such uncertainties could be resolved through the use of the new
technology, called molecular profiling. In a study reported in
January, scientists at Merck &amp; Co. and the Netherlands Cancer
Institute studied the genetic characteristics of 70 breast cancer
patients, half of whom had a recurrence. They discovered that a
different set of genetic patterns occurred for those with tumors that
had spread throughout the body.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of 25,000 genes, we were able to isolate several dozen genes
that were clues to recurrence," said Dr. Stephen H. Friend, a study
coauthor and a researcher at Merck in West Point, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   It will take several years to refine this test, which probably
won't be used on patients for four to five years. "But with this
technology we hope to be able to forecast whose cancer will recur
with a 90% degree of certainty," said Friend.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, doctors have made significant inroads in treating
women who relapse, and increasingly, their cancer can be managed like
any other chronic disease.</TE>

<HD>Mind the Ps of Stretching, Starting With Positioning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What goes through your mind when you watch stretches by people who
are a little more flexible than you at the gym or on the jogging
path? Do you get inspired? Or do you simply want to give up?</LD>
<LD>   Even though comparing our own performances with that of others is
human nature, it's important to realize that this can lower our
confidence level, undermining our potential for progress.</LD>
<LD>   But proper stretching is a skill we all can learn. Sure, there
will always be those naturally flexible people who never have to work
at it. But for those who walk around all day with stiff lower backs,
tight hamstrings and not-so-limber hips, stretching may be what they
need the most but do the least.</LD>
<TE>   To become good at stretching, remember to practice the three Ps:
positioning, patience and persistence.</TE>
<TE>   First, you'll need to learn how to position your body so that the
stretches are safe and effective.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to teach your mind and muscles to relax. For
those of us with type-A personalities, this might be the hardest part
because we have to develop patience. Unfortunately, our bodies won't
ever react as quickly as instant messages; it takes time for our
muscles to release tension.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, you must be persistent. If you can stick with it without
getting discouraged or bored, you'll have a better chance of becoming
more flexible. Doing a few stretches now and then doesn't do much
good. Our bodies respond much better to a regular routine.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a couple of great stretches for the backs of your legs
that you probably won't see many other people doing. Introduce
yourself to these moves by doing the standing position first; then,
as you get comfortable with it, progress to the more advanced, seated
version.</TE>
<TE>   Standing Forward Bend</TE>
<TE>   Stand next to a sturdy surface and place your left hand on it for
balance while resting your right hand on your right hip. Cross your
right leg in front of your left leg so your right heel is next to
your left little toe. Keep both knees straight and point your toes
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Inhale, lifting your chest and pulling your abdominals in toward
your spine. On the exhale, hinge forward at the hips. Make sure that
your back and knees stay straight.</TE>
<TE>   Once your body forms a 90-degree angle, begin to slowly shift your
weight forward toward your toes. Move your hips directly above your
ankles. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds and breathe
comfortably as you focus on releasing tension in the backs of your
hips, thighs and calves.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure your back does not round forward. If you feel any
discomfort, ease up on the forward bend. When you are ready to come
out of the stretch, lift yourself upright, uncross your legs and
repeat with the left leg crossed in front.</TE>
<TE>   Seated Forward Bend</TE>
<TE>   Sit on a mat or a soft surface with your left leg extended in
front of you. Bend your right knee and place it over your left leg.
Bring your right foot close to your left hip with your right knee
over your left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Hold both ends of a towel, belt or stretch band as you wrap it
around the ball of your left foot. Inhale as you sit tall and move
your shoulders away from your ears. Feel your buttocks and thighs
sinking into the ground as you lift up from the base of your spine to
create a straight back.</TE>
<TE>   On the exhale, hinge forward at the hips, bringing your chest
toward your feet. If you find yourself rounding your back, ease up
and don't bend so far forward.</TE>
<TE>   Stay in this stretch for 15 to 30 seconds as you breathe and
release tension in your lower back, your hips and the back of your
straight leg. Relax your jaw and shoulders. When you are ready to
come out of this position, release the band and slowly walk yourself
up with your hands.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat by crossing the other leg on top and bending forward.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of these moves is that you are stretching a variety of
muscles at the same time. Gravity assists you as you bend forward, so
you get a deeper stretch without having to bounce or jerk your way
into position.</TE>
<TE>   Flexibility differs from day to day, so always work at a level
that feels right for you. If you don't get caught up in expectations
and can resist the temptation to compare yourself with other people,
you'll reap the rewards of having a more limber and supple body.</TE>

<HD>Using a Condom Is an Acquired Skill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider the condom: It is simple. It seems easy to use. It is cheap
and available. More important, it rarely fails as a birth control
method and effectively prevents the spread of most sexually
transmitted diseases. But the maximum protection of a condom is
afforded only if it is used properly.</LD>
<LD>   This may seem uncomplicated. It isn't. "The problem with using
condoms," said a 23-year-old UC Santa Barbara student, "is you pretty
much put them on that moment, right before you have sex. First you
have to find it. Then either you put it on really fast because it is
a vibe killer and so you don't think about what you are doing. Or you
do it when you are drunk or you put it on in the dark. Obviously, it
is a little bit of trial and error."</LD>
<LD>   It is the trial and error aspect of condom use that a team of
researchers explored in a new study that some public health experts
are calling one of the most comprehensive investigations into the
many mistakes and problems young men experience when using condoms.</LD>
<TE>   The research, published in this month's issue of the journal
Sexually Transmitted Diseases, found that among the subjects--158
Indiana University undergraduate, heterosexual men--condom use error
was common. Forty-three percent of the men reported putting a condom
on after sex had begun; 40% did not leave space at the tip; 30%
placed the condom on inside out and had to reverse it; nearly
one-third reported experiencing breakage or slippage during sex; and
32% reported experiencing sexual dysfunction because of a condom.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty percent of the participants who filled out a questionnaire
said they did not talk about condom use with their partner before
sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Very little research has focused on the correct use of condoms,"
said the lead author of the study, Richard A. Crosby, professor of
behavioral science and health education at the Rollins School of
Public Health at Emory University.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, researchers have looked at the question of
consistent condom use and how to promote consistent condom use. We
looked at whether men used condoms correctly."</TE>
<TE>   Crosby said the study results cannot be generalized to the broader
population because the study sample was small and was based on
self-reported information. Nevertheless, public health experts said
the findings are significant.</TE>
<TE>   "Those numbers are alarming especially among college-aged men whom
you would assume are older and smart," said pediatrician Mark
Schuster, director of the UCLA/Rand Center for Adolescent Health.
"These are men who are having a lot of regular sex, and even though
they are using condoms, they are using them incorrectly. They
obviously need to learn how to use them."</TE>
<TE>   Tina Hoff, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation,
dedicated to research about reproductive health, cited a recent
survey of 1,500 sexually active youth in which 25% of the respondents
said they need more information about how to use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, 80% of the young men who participated in the condom error
study said they had been instructed in how to use condoms. "Our
suspicion is that programs that claim to be giving proper condom-use
instruction may not be doing a thorough job," said Crosby. "Teaching
correct condom use can be quite involved and certainly requires
extensive, well-designed instruction by professionals rather than
cursory instruction [such as reading a pamphlet]. It could happen in
clinics, schools and community-based programs. It is a skill, and it
requires knowledge and actual practice."</TE>
<TE>   Even when condoms are used correctly, they aren't always fail
proof. Condoms won't prevent sexually transmitted diseases such as
viral herpes and human papilloma virus, which are spread by
skin-to-skin contact. About 3% of women whose partners use condoms
consistently get pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   One woman who teaches what might be called Condom 101 to
undergraduates said that she has heard students complain of the
condom errors and problems cited in Crosby's study. "Students say
those things happen all the time," said Jane Bogart, director of the
Center for Health Promotion at New York University's Health Center.
"If a student comes in and says, 'I don't like condoms because they
break,' I teach them about correct condom use. They are always
convinced it is the brand. It would be helpful if there were
directions on individually packaged condoms, which are the ones most
people have, but there aren't any."</TE>
<TE>   Bogart said that most breakage is due to user error. She gives
classes and seminars on campus about how to use condoms properly.
Along with clearing up misconceptions--such as two condoms are better
than one--and teaching how to prevent breakage, she asks student to
put a condom on a model of a phallus.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart said she often blindfolds students to simulate the fumbling
in the dark that is the backdrop to many campus sexual encounters.
"There is this magical thinking about condoms," said Bogart, "that
people will just know how to use them."</TE>

<LD>STEP ACROSS THIS LINE</LD>
<LD>   Collected Nonfiction</LD>
<LD>   1992-2002</LD>
<TE>   By Salman Rushdie</TE>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   404 Pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Step across this line," and you've crossed a frontier. Or
committed a transgression. Or perhaps both.</TE>
<TE>   The question of lines and what it means to cross--or refuse to
cross--them resonates throughout this collection of nonfiction by
Salman Rushdie, who, merely by writing a work of fiction, committed a
transgression amounting to a capital crime in the eyes of the
Ayatollah Khomeini, who, in turn, exhorted his followers to commit a
far greater transgression than Rushdie ever dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   The title Rushdie has given this collection, "Step Across This
Line: Collected Nonfiction 1992-2002," comes from its concluding
essay: a far-reaching and imaginative meditation on
boundaries--physical, geographical, intellectual, legal, artistic and
ethical. Beginning in prehistoric times, when the first sea creature
heaved itself past the water's edge onto dry land, Rushdie takes us
on a colorful journey through history. Highlights include a medieval
Sufi legend about birds, some thoughts on "transgressive" art, a
reconsideration of Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis about the
importance of the frontier in American life and reflections on the
tides of human migration across borders.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the pieces in this collection written over the past 10
years include other essays, opinion columns, speeches, lectures and
letters to the editor. Many are quite short; some, little more than
quick reactions to events. Others are more thoughtful and considered.
Most are informed by their author's unimaginably frightening
firsthand experience of being singled out as a human target by the
fatwa issued against him in 1989. But there are also some on utterly
different topics, such as the opening essay, a rumination on one of
Rushdie's favorite stories, "The Wizard of Oz." Midway through the
collection, there's a long and fascinating account of Rushdie's
tension-filled but ultimately joyful return to his native India,
after many years of being unable to travel there.</TE>
<TE>   This book is full of so much that is "relevant" that the very word
seems inadequate. Rushdie discusses Islamic fundamentalism,
terrorism, the uneven response of the West to these threats, the
plight of writers and artists in Muslim countries, the dangers of
Hindu fundamentalism, the scandal of the 2000 American presidential
election, the vexing question of Kashmir and the continuing turmoil
in his native land, which he sees as part of the tragic and
unfinished story set in motion by its 1947 partition, an artificial
line that he believes led to greater divisiveness and alienation.
Although decidedly pro-India, he deplores its anti-Muslim violence,
is deeply suspicious of the Hindu nationalists there, and is
generally dismayed at the level of poverty, corruption and
callousness.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the pieces, written in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001,
express Rushdie's outrage, not only at the terrorists' mass murder,
but also at the unfairness and stupidity of the anti-American
sentiments expressed in its wake, not only by Islamic
fundamentalists, but also by Britons and Europeans. Hardly an
uncritical admirer of U.S. policy himself, Rushdie nonetheless
deplores the moral relativism that would shift responsibility for the
crime to the victim: "To excuse such an atrocity by blaming U.S.
government policies is to deny the basic idea of all morality: that
individuals are responsible for their own actions."</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, Rushdie returns to a point that may seem very
obvious, but clearly needs to be made, again and again: To be in
favor of intellectual, artistic and personal freedom is not the same
as conceding that no limits on behavior should be imposed. "The evil
that men do, in Shakespeare," he reflects, "is always a kind of
excess. It has to do with the denial of limits, the willingness to
cross any moral frontier. Goneril and Regan, Lady Macbeth, Iago....
Whereas Hamlet is the opposite: a man so beset by moral qualms that
it takes him an eternity to act. The great question ... [h]ow far is
too far, how far is not far enough?--is at the heart of Shakespeare's
world; also, now, of ours.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem of limits is made awkward for artists and writers,
including myself, by our own adherence to, and insistence upon, a
no-limits position in our own work. The frontierlessness of art has
been and remains our heady ideology. The concept of transgressive art
is so widely accepted ... as to constitute, in the eyes of
conservative critics, a new orthodoxy."</TE>
<TE>   Much has been said and written about Rushdie's perceived vanity,
irascible temper and various other traits. This, alas, is part of a
broader media trend to reduce serious political and social issues to
gossip and cocktail party chatter. It has clearly not escaped
Rushdie: "Even now, in Britain, there is a powerful lobby that
regularly denigrates my character. It is hard for me to be my own
advocate in this matter, hard for me to insist on my own value."</TE>
<TE>   But, as Rushdie goes on to remind us, the value at stake is not
the question of one man's personality or even the quality of his
work: It is a question of how much--or little--we value freedom of
expression. "[W]e are witnessing a war against independence of mind,
a war for power," he warns us. "Religious persecution is never a
matter of morality, always a question of power."</TE>
<TE>   Intellectual freedom, in Rushdie's view, is "not in itself the
answer to the question of morals but the conversation about that
question .... [I]t is much more than mere relativism, because it is
not a never-ending talk-shop, but a place in which choices are made,
values defined and defended."</TE>

<LD>People are used to seeing Janet Winston with her two Old English
sheepdogs. So much so, when she stopped into a local Dunkin' Donuts
recently for a morning cup of joe, another customer wanted to know
why the dogs weren't in tow. Bella and Boswell are hard to miss when
Winston runs with them at or allows them to play along the river.</LD>
<LD>   "People love these dogs," she says. "They're a big hit wherever we
go because there's two of them."</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to business, Boswell stands alone. He is the
logo for Winston's Kennel Club Collection for her company, Chipp 2.
The line is a designer collection of neckwear, watches, belts,
suspenders, wallets and other items. Each piece can be emblazoned
with one of more than 100 dog breeds. So whether you've got an Afghan
hound, Yorkshire terrier or just about any breed between, chances are
Winston has it covered.</LD>
<TE>   She sells her line through Chipp custom-clothing line, owned by
her husband, Paul.</TE>
<TE>   Chipp has been a New York City fixture for 47 years, perched on
44th Street between 5th and Madison avenues.</TE>
<TE>   At an age when most people are thinking about retirement, Winston,
60, is gearing up for the line to take off. Besides starting the
company this year, Winston's a peace activist and recently ran her
ninth marathon in Rockland County, N.Y. (She began jogging at 50.)</TE>
<TE>   "The important point is that life sometimes begins when your
children are grown," Winston says. "It's a way for me to spend more
time with my husband, it keeps me busy and I'm doing something that I
really love. It's amazing to see the amount of people that really
love their dogs and the unconditional love [dogs] give to people."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a love of animals," she says. "My love of dogs is from
childhood. I would often bring home stray animals. Fortunately, I
married a man who shares my love. With my children gone, these are my
pride and joy."</TE>
<TE>   Winston shows her wares at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show
and the International Kennel Club Dog Show in Chicago. She allows
others to represent her line at other dog shows.</TE>
<TE>   The ties ($24), are her biggest sellers. Belts are priced at $40,
hip wallets and pillows at $85.</TE>

<HD>But I Transgress</HD>
<DH>While searching for truth in love, novelist Thomas Farber
pushes the envelope beyond sex into art in 'Beholder'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Transgressive" is a word used often in the world of literature. In
that safe haven, it is used to describe anything outside the
stylistic or moral norm. It's a roguish word but also heavy. If
"transgressive" were a person, it would be a large old man in an
ascot and beret sitting on a park bench, leering at 10-year-old boys.
There's always an aspect of ugliness.</LD>
<LD>   "The Beholder" (Metropolitan Books), Thomas Farber's new novel
about a love affair, has already been called transgressive. Farber
himself uses the word to describe the book, which he gave to several
close women friends to see how badly it would offend them. None of
them took the bait.</LD>
<LD>   Truth is, "The Beholder" is too engaging, too gentle and loving to
be truly transgressive. Publishers Weekly called it "a dance of
flesh." Booklist, over horn-rimmed glasses, claimed it "limns the
perils of Eros." Isabel Allende spoke, in her blurb, of "the beauty
of desire," and the "irrevocable loneliness of the heart." If
anything, the book inspired a kind of overheated, highbrow
response--more to the questions of art and inspiration than the
incessant sex. It stands to reason that if we've become a less
prudish audience for the arts, we are also less prudish readers.</LD>
<TE>   Here are the traditional morals that Farber's 17th book breaks:
Thou shalt not sleep with another man's wife. Thou shalt not sleep
with people half your age. Thou shalt not while away entire weekends
taking erotic photographs of your lover. Thou shalt not characterize
a romantic relationship as a father-daughter relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Farber is one of those hidden pillars of literature: the
mentor of hundreds of young writers, such as Dan Duane, Ishmael Reed,
Thom Gunn, Dan Barden, Kate Braverman and many others. He has been
writing fiction in between teaching creative writing at Berkeley for
generations. But he is also a surfer, and his books on water, on the
world's oceans and on surfing are some of his most beautiful
creations (read his "On Water"). He writes in waves, unfinished
sentences rising to pitch and then crashing or rolling to shore. He
rarely names his characters; in this novel they are referred to as
"the writer" and his "daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Farber grew up in Boston, the son of a famous professor of
pathology who pioneered the use of chemotherapy to treat cancer, Dana
Farber (the Dana Farber Hospital is named for him). His mother was a
singer and a poet. "My father was a Christlike figure," he says,
"with a huge sense of social justice. We were well-to-do, but there
were not many outward signs of it."</TE>
<TE>   Farber, who was born in 1944, had a romantic idea of becoming a
writer. In those days, this meant heading west, to the land of
freedom, to California. "It was a typical vision," he admits. "I
believed in Art. My parents knew the hazards of the artist's life. We
were supposed to accomplish things. It was all right to take a risk,
but I had to fully understand that I was going to have to pay to do
it well. Can you find truth and beauty in your voice? Can you create
art in a bourgeois culture where the arts are undervalued? These were
the questions I had to ask myself."</TE>
<TE>   And these are questions, 50 years later, that Farber asks his
students at Berkeley. "Do you have the courage? The heart is full of
these incredible things. Can you express them?"</TE>
<TE>   Farber dropped out of Yale Law school after one week. "I just said
no thank you," he says chuckling. "As a matter of fact, I kept on
saying no thank you until I found myself with nothing left to do but
write." He worked for years at social-justice foundations before
saying no thank you to higher paying jobs with more responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   After publishing several books, he taught as a visiting professor
but said no thank you when offered more permanent positions. It
wasn't until 1994 that he accepted a position teaching one semester a
year. "I had to leave myself free of all other obligations before I
could actually call myself a writer."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was surfing, which could not be cut out. He first
went to Hawaii in 1970. "I was mesmerized by the great bodysurfers;
the pure form. And the Pacific Ocean was a dream that made me
nervous. Life, writing, surfing; all of these things, to Farber,
possess an element of danger. There is the danger of not doing the
things you wanted to do; there is the danger of drowning; there is
the danger of not telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Farber hit the Bay Area in the mid-'60s, "ready for anything." He
began writing for an underground paper, the San Francisco Express
Times, along with Greil Marcus and Marvin Garson. They let him write
what was then called "personal journalism." He wrote about commune
life and crazy weddings in Big Sur.</TE>
<TE>   "The world was insane, and journalism forced me to take its
measure. I had this enormously conservative impulse to tell a story,
to witness. The antiwar movement was bitter but full of great
patriotism. I was fully engaged with the world then."</TE>
<TE>   It's a hunger Farber sees now and then in young writers, but not
often. Sometimes it takes the form of a blind faith in art to tell
the story or change the world. "I don't have that same faith," Farber
admits. "I don't rank art above surfing, planting a garden. Sometimes
the effort to be good, to be the best bends people out of shape. I
love to see a young writer go for it, but it's a trapeze act, the
artist's life. I was lucky. I had other vocations, and I had women
who sustained me."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until he began writing about love in 1977's "Who Wrote
the Book of Love?" that he began to call himself a writer. He never
felt it was important to live in New York. "I didn't want to take on
the competitive part of the writing life. I just wanted the power of
writing. For years I was determined to be in remote places. My
stories about men and women were brief and intense." Still, Farber's
style has a quick, to-the-point, essential quality. "I intend it to
be densely packed. I really didn't find my style until 1993, when I
wrote "Learning to Love." I wanted to leave the reader wanting more.
I compressed my style so that the reader could connect the dots, what
they call jump-cutting in the movies."</TE>
<TE>   Farber believes that men will find "The Beholder" more unsettling
than will women. "Passion is unsettling and destructive. If there are
no tears in the writer, there will be no tears in the reader. This is
the demonic power of prose. It may be transgressive, but it's nothing
compared to what people find online."</TE>
<TE>   He is also one of those purists who shows his manuscript to no one
before it is finished. He will not be swayed by editors or readers
when he is writing. "A manuscript is very different from a book," he
says. "You want readers to respond and react to a book; the writer in
'The Beholder' refers to his writing as a form of male peacock
display. One wants to be admired. One wants the reader to be moved."</TE>
<TE>   Farber received a letter after his 1988 book, "Compared to What."
"Dear Thomas Farber," it read, "I love you." "She wanted to give me
what I'd asked for."</TE>
<TE>   "The Beholder" begins with the phrase "Once upon a time," which is
the author's way of distinguishing between real life and art, or
fairy tale. The epilogue reads, "Dear one: here we are. Book you said
you wanted. Book we've become."</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying," Farber explains, "to make the reader understand
that the book had been a piece of art, that the whole thing was
artifice." Farber's writing is very much inspired by his reading in
art history and Greek mythology. It is inspired by the Bacchae. "Can
we live up to our passions? If we do, what will happen. If we don't,
what will happen?</TE>
<TE>   "Art is a wake-up call. How do you control passion and desire?
There are some things more important than law and order. Then again,
a book is not life. Without the gods, art is just art. It isn't
exactly the living thing."</TE>

<CX>   Wrong name--A story in Monday's Southern California Living section
about novelist Thomas Farber incorrectly identified his father and
the cancer institute he founded. The writer's father was the late
Sidney Farber, not Dana Farber, as was reported. The Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, incorrectly called the Dana Farber Hospital in the
story, is named for Farber and the Charles A. Dana Foundation.</CX>

<HD>Volunteers Pitch In on Farms and Watch Themselves Grow</HD>
<DH>Sometimes from afar, they travel to gather in organic
crops, reap happy experiences</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a 57-acre valley, where the traffic consists mostly of deer and
rattlesnakes, 19-year-old Christophe Devlies and the four other
unpaid farm workers take a break. Their morning began at 5 a.m. with
yoga or meditation; now, the fields of organic eggplant and other
crops can wait.</LD>
<LD>   Lanky, with a blond ponytail, Devlies ducks into the four-bedroom
farmhouse to escape the heat in the foothills of the Angeles National
Forest. He shrugs off the calluses that line his palms, testimony to
two weeks of field work and other duties at Ananda Marga Lake Hughes
Peach Farm. His bare feet are dirty, his legs are cut up, his wallet
is empty--and his summer vacation is turning out to be just grand.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm working in the house and the field, but the house and the
field are working on me," said Devlies, who flew in from Belgium for
a one-month volunteer stint at the nonprofit farm and yoga-meditation
retreat. "All the things they give me back are more important than
money because you help humanity, and also you develop yourself ....
It's a really good place because it's basic, but that's the only
thing we need." Later this month, he will return home to finish his
high school equivalency exams.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of organic farms throughout California--and throughout the
country--rely on volunteers such as Devlies who sometimes travel
thousands of miles to help out during the summer harvest or beyond.
In exchange, volunteers usually receive meals and housing, which
could be a yurt, tent or bedroom in a farmhouse, and occasionally, a
small stipend.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the number of California listings on
www.organicvolunteers.com is higher than that of any of the other 40
states that are represented, said Ethan Schaffer, who created the Web
site in June 2001. (California ranks second, after Idaho, in the
number of acres--96,851--dedicated to certified organic cropland,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.) The site has 2,000
registered users, though Schaffer doesn't track how many of them
actually end up on farms. (Paid farm jobs also are listed).</TE>
<TE>   The growing consumer interest in organic foods has led to a
curiosity about such harvests, Schaffer said. And in late October,
Schaffer anticipates another surge of interest, when the USDA's
National Organic Program takes effect. The program sets standards for
products labeled "organic."</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the volunteers are recent high school graduates or
college students. And what pulls them toward organic farms seems to
be the same sense of commitment and idealism that energized college
campuses in the '60s--but with a key difference, said UC Berkeley
professor Arthur I. Blaustein, author of "Make a Difference: Your
Guide to Volunteering and Community Service" (Heyday, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   "It's comparable in a moral sense but not in a political sense,"
he said. "It's comparable in terms of the pervasiveness of it, but it
doesn't involve confrontational activities."</TE>
<TE>   In the early '60s, when civil rights issues dominated the news,
Blaustein volunteered for CORE, the Congress of Racial Equity, and
signed up to work with migrant laborers in the potato and corn fields
of Long Island. These days, he pointed out, a driving concern is the
environment, as well as a sense of anti-materialism--both of which
could explain the growing number of young farm volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Schaffer, who doesn't screen the farms he lists on his site, said
he leaves it up to volunteers to investigate the postings before
agreeing to pay their own travel expenses and work for free--an
arrangement, he acknowledged, that could raise questions. "People
wonder what they're getting into, so we really encourage them to get
a good dialogue going beforehand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He helps that process along by including a space for volunteer
reviews. A volunteer's posting about the Ananda Marga peach farm, for
instance, noted: "Though you're free to participate or not
participate in their spiritual practices, there is an expectation
that you'll join in the thrice-daily mantra chantings and meditation
sessions .... The workdays are definitely long, though rarely
backbreaking. All in all, I've very much enjoyed my time there...."</TE>
<TE>   Some volunteers are looking for ways to become involved in
community service and travel. Others want to learn how to run their
own organic farms. Professionals also take on two-week or longer
positions, saying they need a break from full-time jobs--or life in
the big city.</TE>
<TE>   Even the farm's customers ask if they can come out for a day or
weekend to work, said Chelsea Jacobo, whose husband co-owns Winter
Creek Gardens. The family-run farm is 90 miles northeast of the Bay
Area in Capay Valley, bordering a creek that draws blue herons, bald
eagles and rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so much interest, mostly via e-mail, tons of people from
all over the world and the country ... willing to do anything to
spend time on the farm, offering to work for no pay," Jacobo said. "A
lot of people ... have a fantasy about farming and how wonderful it
would be to live off the land ... and then they come and some
realize, oh, gosh, this is really, really hard work."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobo has noticed that agricultural issues in the news can pique
interest in farm work, as can something as simple as a visit to the
local farmers' market. "They want to see, where did [the food] come
from? Who grew it?" she said. "There has been so much discussion on
GMOs [genetically modified organisms] and pesticides and how clean is
your food.... There's a wanting to connect to something that maybe is
bigger, maybe is smaller, than you. A wanting to connect and be part
of a community."</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to Winter Creek Gardens, a 34-acre organic fruit and
vegetable farm, one prospective volunteer recently wrote: "I'm 30
this year, and have been going through a lot of barriers to keeping
or maintaining a mask of who I am. I started out by quitting my job
and am now living less stressfully as a freelance writer, marketing
consultant and trainer. I looked out and read about people out there
like you, working toward a world without poison and greed. My heart
is filled.... Life had meaning again."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the draw for volunteers at StarBrite Farm is its location
in Humboldt County, on the banks of the Trinity River, owner Dezh
Pagen said. "Humboldt has a reputation of sorts, a counterculture
place behind the redwood curtain," he said with a laugh. Volunteers
stay in tents overlooking the river from which they can watch osprey
diving for salmon.</TE>
<TE>   None of the volunteers, most of whom are in their 20s, has been a
problem, except for one who ran up his phone bill, Pagen said. In
fact, without volunteers, he would be hard-pressed to keep his farm
alive. "It's hard finding people to work," Pagen said. "There's not a
ready pull of labor here. This is a tiny farm community."</TE>
<TE>   Pagen runs the business with only three part-time paid workers to
help him pick and pack fruits and vegetables, transplant seedlings
from the greenhouse to the field and sell tomatoes, cucumbers, Asian
pears and other produce at farmers' markets. On busy days, volunteers
spend 12 to 14 hours in the field, and, on slow days, Pagen gives
them time off for canoeing, kayaking or taking advantage of the
private swimming holes. He expects them to put in 40-hour workweeks.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty miles northwest of Los Angeles, at the 57-acre farm run by
Ananda Marga--a global social services and spiritual
organization--none of the workers or administrators is paid. The
farm, which has been run by Ananda Marga since 1993, sells its fruits
and vegetables to major wholesalers and grocery stores such as Wild
Oats and Whole Foods. But the main goal isn't to rake in profits,
said Allen Thurm, who helps manage the operations and coordinate
volunteers from Southern California and elsewhere. Rather, the
intention is to provide a "spiritual environment that combines
farming with yoga and meditation ... and build a self-sustaining
community."</TE>
<TE>   Field hands put together their meals from the day's harvest. On
Sunday, the volunteers set up a table in downtown Los Angeles from
which they serve okra, eggplant and other cooked farm vegetables to
the homeless. The farm's assistant director, Dadaji Gananathananda,
is an Ananda Marga yogic monk who oversees the workers.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the farm accepts about 20 to 30 volunteers for stints
of up to 18 months, said Thurm, a special education teacher for the
Los Angeles Unified School District. Most stay for two to three
weeks, typically during the summer, though the farm has a need for
volunteers year-round, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers are screened through applications and phone
interviews. Only one has been a problem--a college student who, after
a night of drinking, totaled the farm's van. (Alcohol is not allowed
on the farm.) Over the years, the volunteers have included families,
teachers and public relations experts.</TE>
<TE>   Devlies, who lives with his parents, worked odd jobs to help cover
his travel expenses to California. (His father, an accountant, paid
his air fare.)</TE>
<TE>   After his volunteer stint, he will take some time off for travel
throughout the state to places such as Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Erik Prochazka, 25, had worked as a driver in the Czech
Republic's army and as a caregiver to an elderly man in England
before arriving at the farm six months ago. He had planned to stay
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was strictly spiritual," he said. "I really just
wanted some kind of quiet place where I had some time to myself.
Actually, when I would think of farming or gardening, I hated it.
Then I came here. I saw people happy doing the things that they do,
and I was, 'What's that?' I tried, and I think I fell in love with
the earth. And just realizing for the first time, it's a miracle, you
know--you just put something in [the ground], and it grows....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually thinking about staying for a long, long time."</TE>

<LD>Ice Cream, From the Cow to the Cone</LD>
<LD>   Raise your hand if you love ice cream! You are not alone. In fact,
each American eats an average of nearly 24 quarts of ice cream or
other frozen dairy treats each year. Have you ever wondered how ice
cream is made? Most ice cream-making plants are filled with huge
equipment, large mixing tanks and dairy scientists.</LD>
<LD>   * The first basic ingredient put in the mixing tank is cow's milk.
It contains fat that is a very important part of making ice cream.
The fat helps to make the ice cream smooth and creamy. The protein
part of milk is also important and helps to add to the nutritional
value of ice cream.</LD>
<TE>   * The most crucial ingredient is then added to the mixing
tank--the sweet stuff. Sugar is the most popular sweetener used in
making ice cream, but some people also use honey or corn syrups.</TE>
<TE>   * The ice cream maker turns the mixing tanks on, and the milk and
sugar are blended and agitated (or mixed up, like in a blender).</TE>
<TE>   * The mixture is pumped into a pasteurizer, where it is heated to
kill any bacteria that may be in the milk.</TE>
<TE>   * The pasteurized mixture is shot through a homogenizer, where
pressure is placed on the mixture. This breaks the milk fat into
smaller particles, causing the mixture to stay smooth and creamy.</TE>
<TE>   * The mixture is quick-cooled to about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
While it is freezing, revolving blades called dashers whip the
mixture to prevent it from becoming a solid frozen mass.</TE>
<TE>   * The flavorings are added. These could be vanilla, chocolate,
fruit bits, nuts and all kinds of crazy additions. The most popular
flavor of ice cream in the United States is vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   * The ice cream mixture is all mixed up once again and then placed
in tubs, molds or containers, where it is frozen until it has
hardened. It is now ready to be shipped and sent to stores for you to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   You can see how your favorite frozen, creamy treat goes from the
cow to your cone and lots more at the 2002 L.A. County Fair, starting
Friday through Sept. 29 in Pomona. For more information call (909)

<HD>Harried Teachers Try to Fit In a Good Word</HD>
<DH>Competitive college admissions increase the burden for
letters of recommendation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE STRAUSS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The frenzy otherwise known as the college admissions process is
fueled by pressure to write the perfect essay, wow the interviewer,
score close to 1600 on the SAT, cram a resume with activities and
acts of kindness--and, increasingly, secure the pivotal
recommendation.</LD>
<LD>   That explains why dozens of 11th-graders at Bethesda, Md.'s
Whitman High School lined up last semester--well before the crack of
dawn and months before they needed them--to inscribe their names on a
list so their favorite English teacher would write a recommendation.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a disaster," said English department head Suzanne Coker,
who found the halls filled at 6:45 a.m. Coker had told juniors that
teachers were limiting the number of recommendations they would write
and would start a first-come, first-served list May 1.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't expect them to get there at 5 a.m. It got to be like a
rock concert, with kids saying, 'How early can I get there?' " she
said. "We have to come up with a better system, because this is
important."</TE>
<TE>   As college admissions become ever more competitive,
recommendations can make a difference in an applicant's prospects.
Although many wind up having no impact, one that thoughtfully
explains why a student's grades dipped, or that reveals a thirst for
learning not obvious in the transcript, could be the thing that turns
the decision, said Jack Blackburn, admissions director at the
University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they are important," said Ted O'Neill, admissions
director at the University of Chicago. "In the whole process, you are
looking for something you can understand in human terms. We say we
want it in the essays, but sometimes the students don't know how to
write about themselves or are too modest or too scared."</TE>
<TE>   With more students applying to more colleges, teachers are being
crushed under the weight of requests, making it harder for them to
write the personal letters that colleges seek. Teachers usually know
students better than counselors do, and budget cuts in many states
have reduced the ranks of counselors to the point where, in some
districts, there is one for every 800 or more students.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some schools, such as Virginia Commonwealth University
and each institution in the University of California system, don't
seek recommendations, because "most are pro forma," said VCU
Undergraduate Admissions Director Delores Taylor. But even those
schools will sometimes request a recommendation in a borderline
decision.</TE>
<TE>   At colleges that do require recommendations--often asking for two
or three--admissions offices get buried. The University of Virginia
received 34,000 undergraduate recommendations last year.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers read every one more than once, although they often ignore
unsolicited recommendations that students add for effect. And veteran
readers have mastered the art of reading between the lines--a
requirement, since virtually no recommendation will call someone a
stinker outright.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and counselors say they put much time and devotion into
the task. It can take two to three hours to write the first draft.
Ellen Fay, a counselor at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Va.,
wrote 140 letters last year, working on weekends and nights--and even
on her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   But Fay said she and her colleagues don't feel it is an
imposition. "It is such an incredible thing to play such a role in
someone's life and know that you can have such an impact," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who taught the student in 11th grade are most commonly
asked to write recommendations, since applications must be sent
before many students get to know their senior teachers. English
teachers seem to be the most burdened, not only because some schools
require recommendations from them, but also because students feel
they open up in these classes.</TE>
<TE>   "You get to know the soul of the kids," Whitman English teacher
Beth Rockwell said.</TE>

<HD>Hey, Loser, Got a Message for You</HD>
<DH>Don't want to date that jerk? Give out this phone number
and let the recording do the dirty work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAYLE POLLARD-TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You're standing by the pool at the hot rooftop bar at the Downtown LA
Standard hotel, dressed in your lowest-riding jeans, brand-spanking
new Manolos and the perfect Birkin bag. When here he comes.</LD>
<LD>   Obnoxious. Too old. Too loud. Too short. Stuffed into cheap jeans
that look like he bought them at a 99 Cents Only store. Mr.
Needs-a-Breath-Mint wants your phone number.</LD>
<LD>   Give him the digits, not the real ones, of course. Hand him this
number--(310) 217-7638--and let the rejection hotline handle it.</LD>
<TE>   He'll get the message when instead of hearing your voice he
listens to this message: "The person who gave you this number
obviously did not want you to have their real number."</TE>
<TE>   There's more.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you're just not this person's type.... This could mean
short, fat, ugly, dumb, annoying, arrogant or just a general loser.
Maybe you suffer from bad breath, body odor or even both. Maybe you
just give off that creepy, overbearing, psycho-stalker vibe. Maybe
the idea of going out with you just seems as appealing as playing
leapfrog with unicorns."</TE>
<TE>   The voice belongs to Jeff Goldblatt, a Web consultant and graduate
student working on an MBA at Emory University in Atlanta. He's 25,
single and swears he's never needed anything like the rejection
hotline because he can see the signs and "know when someone's not
interested." He answers the rejection hotline (via recorded message)
in 14 U.S. cities--Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco,
Washington, Denver, Seattle, Cleveland, Boston, Charlotte, Las Vegas,
Miami, New Orleans, Indianapolis--and as of the first of this month,
Dublin, Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Each city averages 50,000 phone calls per month, sometimes at a
pace fast enough to crash the hotline. Boston and Charlotte went down
in August overloaded by calls from guys getting the brushoff and
others who heard about the message and couldn't resist calling.</TE>
<TE>   It started out as a joke last summer after Goldblatt and a group
of friends watched "an old, fat, bald guy walking up to a young,
attractive blond girl," he said in a telephone interview from
Atlanta. "We kind of looked at each other and said, 'This can't be
good.' We watched her shoot him down in a blunt, rude way. She sent
him back to his friends with his pride in his hands. That started a
discussion about whether it's better to give out a fake phone number
because it delays the rejection or does a fake phone number give
people hope because they thought they got a digit wrong."</TE>
<TE>   He set up a residential voicemail account that cost $10 a month.
He told a few friends, who told a few friends, who e-mailed a few
friends, who overwhelmed the line.</TE>
<TE>   He increased the capacity of the service and started expanding to
new cities in May. The service arrived in L.A. in June.</TE>
<TE>   To get the money he needs to upgrade the system, Goldblatt is in
discussions with potential corporate sponsors. He identifies them as
a couple of alcoholic beverage companies and a national magazine. The
Los Angeles line is sponsored in part by LASinglesClub.com.</TE>
<TE>   Goldblatt doesn't want anyone to take his rejection hotline too
seriously, although he believes the number provides a service. "The
rejecter can get someone off their back who is not taking a hint."
The rejectee can save face as he listens in the privacy of his home
to this: "Accept the fact that you're rejected. Get over it. And,
please do your best to forget about the person who gave you this
number because trust us, they've already forgotten about you."</TE>

<LD>   Kaci didn't have enough money to buy the fashion-model software
that she wanted for her computer. Her mother suggested, "Why don't
you get a little job, honey? Earn the money."</LD>
<LD>   "What can I do for you, Mom, that would earn me $25?" she asked.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have any jobs like that," her mom said. "Why don't you go
next door and ask our new neighbor? There are always hundreds of
little things to get done when you move into a new house."</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Collins, the neighbor, asked, "Would you like to rake up all
these leaves?"</TE>
<TE>   (Too many leaves, Kaci thought.) "I'm probably allergic, ma'am,"
said Kaci.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to wash my windows?"</TE>
<TE>   (And ruin this manicure?) "My mom doesn't like me to climb on
ladders."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, can you take care of my little puppy, Nya, while I'm away
for three days?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure!" exclaimed Kaci. (There's nothing to taking care of a
puppy. I can pretend she's my dog for three whole days!")</TE>
<TE>   "Great!" said Mrs. Collins. "I'm leaving the day after tomorrow,
so it wouldn't hurt if you two got acquainted before I left." She
opened her back gate. "There's a fresh bag of dog food. Give her a
scoop in the morning and a scoop each evening. Fill her water bowl
with clean, fresh water both times."</TE>
<TE>   Before Mrs. Collins could finish her instructions, Kaci heard a
thunderous rumbling sound. Then the back screen door flew open, and
in one swooping motion of paws and slobbering tongue moving faster
than the speed of light, a bundle of black fur and muscle jumped onto
Kaci's chest and knocked her to the ground. "What on earth was that?"
asked the girl when she finally could catch a breath.</TE>

with her identical 63-year-old twin, Sheila, she selects what the
sisters will wear that day. "Letty's the early bird, there's no doubt
about it," Sheila said.</LD>
<LD>   When Sheila awakes, she dons the exact outfit Letty's wearing. And
we mean exact. Besides the same denim dress, she'll match down to the
pearl ring on the identical finger, the thick black plastic
eyeglasses, the blue eye shadow. The sisters' wavy black hair also is
styled alike.</LD>
<LD>   The lone clue they allow: Sometimes Letty wears a gold pin shaped
like an L, while Sheila's is an S. Think Laverne and Shirley. Letty
and Sheila.</LD>
<TE>   The twins have been dressing this way all their lives--including
each school day for the 38 years they taught kindergarten and then
first grade, side by side, in the Brentwood School District on Long
Island. After the duo reluctantly took an early retirement incentive
from the district in 1998--an offer too financially enticing to pass
up, they said--they searched for new hobbies and decided to write
children's books.</TE>
<TE>   And, naturally, they did it together.</TE>
<TE>   Their first book is due out this month. The old writing adage
advises authors to write about what they know--and Sheila and Letty
have done just that. They penned "The Teacher Who Would Not Retire."</TE>
<TE>   The hardcover picture book is about the gray-haired Mrs. Belle, a
first-grade teacher who is forced out of teaching but refuses to go
quietly. She sneaks back to the school as a window washer, then as a
food service worker and as a firefighter during a school fire drill.
Each time her disguise is given away by the trademark colorful ballet
slippers she wears. In the end, the district compromises and allows
Mrs. Belle to return every Friday to read to the children in the
library.</TE>
<TE>   "When we told the children in school we were retiring," Letty
said, "the first-graders had no concept of retirement. This is how we
started talking about writing this story. In many ways it paralleled
our lives. Mrs. Belle feels the way we felt."</TE>
<TE>   "Although we don't look like Mrs. Belle," Sheila joked. "Not yet.
Maybe in 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The original idea of a children's book about retirement is what
led the twins' publisher, Blue Marlin Publications, to accept their
manuscript and have artist Thomas H. Bone III illustrate it, said
Francine Rich of Blue Marlin. "The concept of teaching young children
about retirement has never been covered," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The twins said they worked together well in part because they are
so accustomed to each other--neither has married or had children, and
they've always lived together. They enjoy the attention they get by
being carbon copies, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Two heads are better than one," said Sheila, even though those
heads sometimes butt. "We have our moments," said Letty. "But it
blows over, and we'd do anything for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Their condo is peppered with pictures, refrigerator magnets and
knickknacks of Scottish terriers. They have had five Scottish
terriers over the years, including their current black dog, Dundee.
In addition to spending time with Dundee, in retirement they've been
playing golf and piano and crocheting hats and blankets for pediatric
cancer patients. They cared for their mother, who died in March.</TE>
<TE>   They've also been working on a sequel to their first book,
tentatively called "Mrs. Belle Goes to Camp."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the sisters have been returning regularly to
volunteer their time and to visit faculty, friends and students at
their most recent Brentwood school, Laurel Park Elementary. They
don't, however, go dressed as window washers or firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go in disguise," Sheila said, "but we do go back, and we
will continue to go back as long as they need the help."</TE>

<HD>Cinema's Best Year? '62 ... Perhaps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'll excuse Mike McClellan if he puts an asterisk beside the year
1939, which many film historians and movie buffs proclaim to be the
greatest year in the history of American cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, McClellan concedes, 1939 was the best year for Hollywood
movies--with "Gone With the Wind," "Stagecoach," "The Wizard of Oz,"
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Wuthering Heights" among others--but
he casts his vote for 1962.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone thinks 1939 is the greatest year, and you can make a
case for that in Hollywood, but I am talking internationally," said
McClellan, vice president and film buyer for Landmark Theatres. "If
you put those two together, then you come up with, arguably, a very
strong case for 1962."</LD>
<TE>   To that end, McClellan has assembled some of 1962's more memorable
movies in a 40th anniversary retrospective titled "1962: The Greatest
Year in Motion Picture History," which will screen Friday through
Sept. 19 at the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the selections: "The Manchurian Candidate," "To Kill a
Mockingbird," "Sweet Bird of Youth," "The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance," "Sundays and Cybele," "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"
and "Lolita."</TE>
<TE>   He said the screenings coincide with the reissuing of "Lawrence of
Arabia," starring Peter O'Toole, at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.
But he laments that he was unable to obtain prints of some of 1962's
other unforgettable films, such as "Advise &amp; Consent," "Ride the High
Country" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."</TE>
<TE>   What criteria did he use to crown 1962 as the greatest year in
movies? "I think the criteria were that these were films about
serious subjects, intelligently made," McClellan said. "They had
depth and they had breadth and some, like 'Lawrence of Arabia,' had
them all."</TE>

<KH>Venice Film Festival</KH>
<HD>Movies About the Downtrodden Prevail</HD>
<DH>Peter Mullan's 'The Magdalene Sisters' and Todd Haynes'
'Far From Heaven' take honors amid turmoil about the event's
declining status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY COLBERT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>English-language films about oppression fared well at the 59th Venice
Film Festival, with Peter Mullan's powerful drama, "The Magdalene
Sisters," an expose of the order's cruel regime in 1960s Ireland,
winning the Venice Film Festival's top laurel, the Golden Lion.</LD>
<LD>   Julianne Moore's bravura performance as a 1950s housewife (modeled
vocally on Doris Day), trapped in a racist and homophobic society in
Todd Haynes' melodrama, "Far From Heaven," garnered best actress. It
was a role written specifically for her by the writer-director, her
collaborator in "Safe."</LD>
<LD>   Both were press and public favorites in a year when other fancied
contenders failed to score. "Far From Heaven's" cinematographer, Ed
Lachman ("Erin Brockovich") was honored with the inaugural Technical
Award on Haynes' film, scheduled for release in the U.S. in November.</LD>
<TE>   Less expected were the Grand Jury prize to Russian-born director
Andrei Konchalovsky, who returns to the spotlight for "House of
Fools" (Dom Durakov) and best actor award to local actor Stefano
Accorsi in "A Journey Called Love" (Un Viaggio Chiamato Amore).</TE>
<TE>   Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong's "Oasis" won three awards, with a
best director prize and International Film Critics' award. In their
proclamation on the trophy, the critics saluted the film "for its
brave and audacious exploration of the difficulties of communication
for its protagonists"--a mentally retarded ex-prisoner and a woman
suffering from cerebral palsy-- "and for its excellent performances."
The Marcello Mastroianni laurel for best new actor went to its lead
actress, Moon So-Ri.</TE>
<TE>   Press favorite and crowd-pleaser Dylan Kidd's debut feature,
"Roger Dodger," a dark comedy about a schoolboy's attempt to lose his
virginity in the Big Apple--a thinking man's "American Pie"--won the
international press award on non-competition sections.</TE>
<TE>   "The Magdalene Sisters," based on true events, is a raw and angry
cry from the heart against the evils perpetrated on the order's
charges in the name of God. "But it's not specifically an attack on
Catholicism--rather the danger of the power of theocracy, be it rural
Ireland in 1964 or the Taliban now," said Mullan, whose debut
feature, "Orphans," was a prize winner here in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In a year of less spark than before, the issue is the currency of
the Golden Lion or, for that matter, any Venice awards, when the once
prestigious festival has receded into crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Even its latest director, former Berlin Festival head Moritz de
Hadeln, the fourth to run Venice in the past six years, candidly
remarked to local press that the top laurel had lost its cachet in
recent years. "I told them that according to American distributors,
unfortunately it had lost its impact with the public," he said. "I
used it as a symbol that the whole event needs a shake-up."</TE>
<TE>   But part of the problem has been the recent instability and
constant shake-ups at the oldest of the major festivals that counts,
or used to, along with Cannes, Berlin, Toronto and Sundance as one of
cinema's grand slams.</TE>
<TE>   The real challenge for the 59th Venice Film Festival has been
whether the on-screen dramas could match the intrigue off-screen.</TE>
<TE>   There has been unanimous agreement about the need for a revamp.
But a complete lack of consensus about its new direction and image
has left a trail of political casualties to rival corpses in a
Tarantino film noir.</TE>
<TE>   Think cinematic Venice, and images of Luchino Visconti's "Death in
Venice" or Nicholas Roeg's "Don't Look Now" spring to mind.
Malevolence, treachery, threat, danger, intrigue; metaphorically,
these titles could depict the fortunes of many of the event's key
players.</TE>
<TE>   For decades the film arm known as the Mostra Internazionale D'Arte
Cinematografica has been the show pony of the Biennale--Italy's
cultural organization umbrella that embraces visual art,
architecture, dance, theater and music, as well as cinema. In recent
years it has become Italy's political football.</TE>
<TE>   Its dramas rather than glories have dominated the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Machiavellian intrigue has prevailed with accusations of
conspiracies, political meddling and nepotism at the highest
political level, compounded by the departure of three film festival
directors in quick succession. The son of the festival's business
mogul founder, aristocrat count Giovanni Volpi has openly denounced
the event.</TE>
<TE>   Former Biennale President Paul Barratta, appointed by the previous
center-left government, was dismissed months before the end of his
mandate and replaced by one of the country's business leaders,
entrepreneur Franco Bernabe.</TE>
<TE>   But the normally regarded dream job of festival director had come
to be regarded as a poisoned chalice, passed by all local contenders.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-March, four months prior to the announcement of the
program, the post of film festival director was still vacant. In an
11th-hour master-stroke, the Biennale appointed De Hadeln after a
22-year term he had dismissed before the end of his contract at
Berlin. He, at least, was used to treacherous waters.</TE>
<TE>   The bespectacled 62-year-old is an unlikely action hero. But the
quest required of him--to pull together a program of over 100 films
for several sections in four months--called for a miracle worker.</TE>
<TE>   As a Swiss citizen, however, he was the first foreigner in the
post, generating threats of a boycott from the producers' union,
which felt he has not been kindly inclined toward local cinema.</TE>
<TE>   The junior secretary of culture, Vittorio Sgarba, an art critic
entrusted with overseeing the Biennale, made no secret that he hoped
the festival would fail. A month prior to the Mostra's opening, he
too was axed. Amid these intrigues, it's no wonder then that
on-screen activity has appeared somewhat flat.</TE>
<TE>   De Hadeln used his address book and international contacts to
compile, on paper at least, a vibrant film lineup. Chinese actress
Gong Li as head of the jury, "Frida" star Selma Hayek, Sophia Loren,
appearing at only her second Mostra in 44 years, and Catherine
Deneuve all provided glamour and international appeal in the first
few days. Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, veteran French icons Jean
Rochefort and Johnny Halliday rolled out male star power. But in the
business end of event, the Mostra began to run out of ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   True, Larry Clark and Lachman used Harmony Kourine's screenplay to
provide the festival with its shocker, the controversial, explicit
"Ken Park," an anarchic trip into teen sex.</TE>
<TE>   The political centerpiece of this year's Mostra was "September
11," a compilation of 11 films commissioned from 11 filmmakers around
the globe in response to last year's tragic terrorist attacks on New
York. British filmmaker Ken Loach's contribution, a moving letter
from a Chilean exile about the horrors to his country in the
'70s--considered by some as anti-American--was singled out for praise
by the international press in its awards.</TE>
<TE>   While compilations of this kind sometimes suffer from
self-conscious artificiality, this collection has been praised by
most press here for cultural and stylistic diversity. As one of the
filmmakers pointed out, "Tragedy spawns some of the greatest art in
history."</TE>
<TE>   The newly introduced "screenings" section in the festival,
targeting buyers, has had logistical problems. And speculation
continues about the festival's top job. De Hadeln's reappointment is
uncertain and he claims he will only stay in the post if granted the
power and authorization to modernize the event and acknowledge market
forces at the Lido.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest bout of intrigue, there is speculation in the
Italian press that Locarno chief, former La Republica journalist
Irene Bignardi, is being lined up for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Franco Bernabe, the new Biennale president, agrees with De Hadeln
about the need for refurbishment and redevelopment. With his
corporate clout, he's likely to attract a lot of corporate
sponsorship to the event, but both concur that the physical
constraints of the Lido, the summer resort island off Venice, limit
the festival's potential scope.</TE>
<TE>   Bernabe would like to see an international event modeled on the
World Economic Forum, an informal gathering in a safe, relaxed
atmosphere, a cultural get-together for networking. "You know, a
Martha's Vineyard for cinema," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "This event's been floundering for some time," he said. "It's a
complex place; we need to find a position for it as a niche product.
Armani is not Gap. It's elite, it's not a mass product. We have to
choose a brand name that we can build on."</TE>
<TE>   But further reinvention could be a dangerous gamble. At the moment
the heads of other sections are appointed for one year only. The film
festival, however, requires innovation and development accompanied by
stability.</TE>
<TE>   It's an expensive outing for international press and buyers. And
as overlapping Toronto's reputation grows, unless the revamp is more
than cosmetic, this once mighty festival may, for non-Europeans at
least, become a luxury item that, in a world of belt-tightening, they
can no longer afford.</TE>

<HD>Jobim Tribute, Like a Brazilian Breeze</HD>
<DH>Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto ensemble offers a dazzling
interpretation of legendary composer's music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why have jazz musicians and singers been so drawn to the music of
Antonio Carlos Jobim? For many reasons, all of them valid.</LD>
<LD>   There is, first of all, the marvelous arc of his melodies; add to
that the manner in which those melodies are inextricably linked to
the sort of lush, chromatically moving harmonies favored by jazz
improvisers; and don't forget the undercurrent of bossa nova
rhythms--a sophisticated blend of body-moving samba and propulsive
jazz swing.</LD>
<LD>   Pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto and cellist Jacques Morelenbaum are
uniquely qualified to interpret Jobim's compelling music--the former
via his diverse credentials as a genre-crossing performer and
composer, the latter as a superb instrumentalist-composer and close
personal and professional associate during the last years of Jobim's
life.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday night at the Knitting Factory, their five-piece
ensemble, Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto, offered a dazzling tribute to Jobim,
displaying an impressive cross-section of the great Brazilian
artist's extraordinary body of work. The songs, reaching from such
familiar items as "Insensatez" and "Desfinado" to the lesser-heard
but no less forceful "Chanson pour Michelle" and "Sabia," were
virtually all drawn from the ensemble's just-released CD, "Casa,"
recorded at Jobim's home studio in Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pieces were sung with stunning artistry by Paula
Morelenbaum (Jacques Morelenbaum's wife), with further accompaniment
by guitarist Luiz Brazil and percussionist Marcos Suzano. The vocal
passages by Morelenbaum's cool but intensely personal soprano curled
intimately around the mostly Portuguese lyrics, enhanced by the
subtle movements of her elegant physical presentation.</TE>
<TE>   She was so effective that it was easy to overlook that many of the
Jobim tunes were filled with difficult, chromatically moving melody
lines, but all were rendered by Morelenbaum with a passionate
intelligence that reached into the very heart of the songs.</TE>
<TE>   Sakamoto and Morelenbaum played their well-designed arrangements
with consummate ease. Like Brazil and Suzano, they allowed air and
space to move freely through the music, producing deceptively complex
musical results from a startling economy of notes and rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in short, an utterly marvelous evening of music-making and
a brilliant acknowledgment of Jobim, a composer whose work easily
places him in a 20th century pantheon of songwriters embracing such
immortal entries as (to name only a few) Irving Berlin, Cole Porter,
Jerome Kern, the Gershwins and Rodgers &amp; Hart.</TE>

<HD>'Bear' Special Offers Reassurance to Children</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents concerned about their young children's inevitable exposure to
9/11 anniversary media coverage will appreciate the gentle approach
taken by Jim Henson Television's two-part "Bear in the Big Blue
House" special, "Welcome to Woodland Valley," airing at 1 p.m. each
weekday this week on the Disney Channel.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong special is crafted with care to give children a sense
of security by showing how a community can be like a family, pulling
together in times of crisis, as Bear and his neighbors work together
to rebuild the Woodland Valley library, which has been badly damaged
by a storm-toppled tree.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers learn the meaning of "community" and "together" as Bear, a
member of the town's Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company, invites all
the residents to a rebuild-the-library planning session, and Tutter
the mouse and his little pals assuage their concerns by collecting
donated books to restock the shelves.</LD>
<TE>   Bear cub Ojo, however, needs extra cuddling and comfort from
fatherly Bear; when she feels more secure, she helps out with the
solution to the biggest rebuilding challenge: what to do with the
tree.</TE>
<TE>   Reassurance, the kind that adults can offer a child, is what the
program--which incidentally expands the setting beyond the Blue House
to the surrounding town for the first time--is all about. It's
delivered from start to finish within the show's trademark gentle
framework: Bear's paternal warmth; charming, safe-haven sets;
terrific music that's both sophisticated and child-friendly; informed
writing; and realistic reflections of children's emotions.</TE>
<TE>   The "Welcome to Woodland Valley" episode of "Bear in the Big Blue
House" airs Monday through Friday at 1 p.m. this week on the Disney
Channel.</TE>

<LD>Searching for metaphors? How about a prime-time season that opens
with a remake of "Family Affair"?</LD>
<LD>   You know, those moldy cadavers Uncle Bill, Mr. French and Buffy,
Jody and Sissy, exhumed from an America of decades past when only
laugh tracks found humor in sitcoms.</LD>
<LD>   That low wit applies also to this century's "Family Affair," which
joins the WB schedule Thursday, then a week later gets paired with
another WB newcomer appropriately titled "Do Over." It's about a man
reliving his past.</LD>
<TE>   Many viewers will be doing the same when in front of their TV sets
this season. Returning shows deliver their own deja vu. TV's annual
fall slab of new series, however, finds broadcast networks at their
most derivative and incestuous in 2002, while crossing bloodlines
like the royals of old Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Originality equals obscenity in this programming scenario, as
nearly everything appears to be an extension of everything else.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be the age we're in? Instead of challenges and
uncertainty, nostalgia may be exactly what most Americans desire from
TV as they slog through dire economic times and depressing news from
abroad while contemplating 9/11 and a possible hot war with Saddam
Hussein and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Take Fox's "American Idol" (Puleeeeeeze!). As a phenomenon, the
summer's most popular series reeks of staleness. Its striking
vapidity aside, "American Idol" is a close cousin of televised talent
searches that have filled the small screen for a half a century. It,
too, will return, of course, someday perhaps even in triplicate.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Dick Wolf's "Law &amp; Order" fleet travels NBC, the huge CBS
hit, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," has spun off the new season's
"CSI: Miami." If it's a hit, what, "CSI: Fairbanks"? The
possibilities are endless.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is wrong with using oldies as templates, and then
improving or updating them smartly. Arriving on PBS next month, for
example, is an elegant revival of John Galsworthy's "The Forsyte
Saga." The original was a 19th century British serial that became a
signature work for infant public TV in the U.S. about the time
"Family Affair" was making its infantile mark on CBS. The first
"Saga" was somewhat deadly in black and white, this new one livelier
and in color.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the fall's most intriguing new series offers its own
whiff of familiarity. It's Fox's "John Doe," which each week sends
its hero--a man of infinite knowledge who knows everything about
everything, except who he is--on a search for his identity and
origins.</TE>
<TE>   Prime time's Character On a Weekly Quest--going back nearly 40
years to Dr. Richard Kimble's pursuit of his wife's one-armed killer
in "The Fugitive"--is one of TV's most utilized premises. Viewers
will benefit, however, if "John Doe" adapts it innovatively to 2002,
as it does in its pilot.</TE>
<TE>   If only the rest of the new season appeared as promising.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, just as the WB's "Do Over" zooms its 34-year-old hero
back in time to age 14, ABC's "That Was Then" has its 30-year-old
salesman waking up one morning to find himself 15. Which reportedly
is the median age of today's TV writers.</TE>
<TE>   As for more blasts from the past, UPN has resurrected "Twilight
Zone" tediously this season, ABC has Wolf's new "Dragnet" scheduled
for midseason, and Fox's "Fast Lane" brushes the cobwebs from a pair
of cops who will somehow succeed magnificently as partners--bank on
it--despite not getting along at all.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the WB's "Everwood" has a famed New York neurosurgeon
and his kids finding fulfillment in the Colorado Rockies. Exchanging
urban for rural does wonders for TV characters. And if you think
you've already seen the WB's "What I Like About You," you have. Only
in 1986-88 it was called "My Sister Sam."</TE>
<TE>   What we have here is TV's antique, all-purpose, ever-available
Moving In Creates Havoc theme. In "What I Like About You," a chaotic
teenager shows up unexpectedly and immediately destroys the routine
of her adult sister. In "Family Affair," the surprise arrival of
6-year-old twins Buffy (Sasha Pieterse) and Jody (Luke Benward, only
in the premiere, then he's replaced by Jimmy "Jax" Pinchak), and then
their teenage sister, Sissy (Caitlin Wachs), jolts the orderly lives
of carefree bachelor Uncle Bill (Gary Cole) and his dignified English
butler, Mr. French (Tim Curry). To the accompaniment of an
ear-splitting laugh track.</TE>
<TE>   Buffy on the butler: "His name's French, but he's really English."</TE>
<TE>   Laugh track: HAHAHAHAHAHA.</TE>
<TE>   Only an electronic box could laugh at this. With Buffy speaking
overly precious kid talk, your impulse instead is to gag. And the
high jinks really start when the twins use the microwave to heat soup
for caustic Mr. French. But do it in the can!</TE>
<TE>   Laugh track: HAHAHAHAHAHA.</TE>
<TE>   "Family Affair" is rooted like weeds in TV's little tykedom of the
'60s. It's so out of tune with the times that when the twins
disappear from Uncle Bill's swanky Manhattan apartment, hand-wringing
is minimal. In the real world, CNN would have the story in five
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Can this creaky concept for a series succeed today? Sure. Think
"The Bernie Mac Show" on Fox, mingling hilarity with universal truths
about parenting as Uncle Bernie sweats out his young nephew and two
nieces, whom he reluctantly took in at the start of last season.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bernie Mac Show" has imagination and, well, Bernie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   "Family Affair" has something else. It's maudlin and saccharin
yet, in spite of that, also witless. After all these years, it's lost
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Family Affair" will be shown at 8 p.m. Thursday on the WB. The
network has rated it TV-PGL (Parental guidance suggested due to
infrequent coarse language).</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be

<DH>Retooled Doors find new magic in old hits before revved-up
fans at Harley fest</DH>

<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A strange tension gripped the California Speedway in Fontana on
Friday night as the Doors, circa 2002, took the stage. Striding up to
the microphone in black jeans, cowboy boots and lace-up blouse shirt
was not Jim Morrison but his doppelganger, British rocker Ian
Astbury, complete with a head of natural black curls.</LD>
<LD>   As original keyboard player Ray Manzarek and guitarist Robbie
Krieger stepped up to a roar of approval from the 5,000 bikers and
classic-rock fans gathered in the dusty infield for a concert
celebrating the 100th anniversary of Harley Davidson, the legacy of
the Doors hung for a moment in the balance.</LD>
<LD>   When they last left the stage at the Hollywood Bowl on Sept 10,
1972, almost 30 years ago to the day, Manzarek said, "Next time we'll
be back with Jim" --meaning they'd never be back (Morrison died in
1971). So the songs have remained as they were then, unsullied museum
pieces of FM rock radio, perfect, the past. But as Krieger laid into
the loping opening riff to "Roadhouse Blues," it suddenly seemed that
the band's risky endeavor could work: there could be a new Doors.
Astbury's rich baritone picked up the verse with Morrison's
inflections--"Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the
wheel"--and the crowd began to roar.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, it was the Doors' greatest hits, with all that that implies.
But it was more too. It wasn't Morrison, it wasn't a tribute act, it
was Astbury revealing that the familiar songs --"L.A. Woman," "Break
On Through (to the Other Side)," "Five to One"-- held new potential.</TE>
<TE>   Manzarek, visibly moved by what was happening before him, couldn't
help but shout out what he'd been waiting 30 years to say: "Ladies
and Gentlemen, this is the Doors! We're here to witness the new Doors
for the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the rock audiences, young or old, will accept a new Doors
is a major question. It's not, for instance, likely to be embraced by
either radio or MTV, and none of the four principals--including
ex-Police drummer Stuart Copeland--have been involved in high-profile
rock projects for years.</TE>
<TE>   Manzarek and Krieger are comfortable in using the Doors' name
again. Not as a nostalgia act, not playing the rock revival circuit,
but to step into a spiritual leadership void that has haunted rock
music since at least the mid-'90s with the demise of Nirvana and the
movement of rap toward R&amp;B, which has become acute in post-Sept. 11
America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of comin' back around to how it used to be," said
Krieger, 56, sitting in the lounge of a rehearsal studio in Hollywood
last week. "In the '60s we had the Vietnam War, and now we have the
war with Iraq and terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "So we're going to offer Doors passion and Doors spirituality to a
new generation," said Manzarek, 63, breaking in with his rapid-fire,
youthful enthusiasm, "that looks like right about now could really
use a dose of truth and reality and making music just for the sheer
love of making music."</TE>
<TE>   During an afternoon in the cool dark of the black-walled rehearsal
studio, with Stone Temple Pilots thundering in the next room, it
became clear just exactly how the original members of the Doors see
themselves having an impact. The revolutionary aspects of the '60s,
for instance, the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, are
still largely communicated through the music of the time. The Doors
albums from 1966 to '71 did not shy away from the bloody, menacing
news of those days, but transformed them truthfully with the poetic
and theatrical sensibility of "The End" or "When the Music's Over."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a spiritual crisis in light of what happened last year,"
said Astbury, 40, his intense eyes almost mocking his Mickey Mouse
T-shirt, his light English accent deepened by hours of singing.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we seem to be in this void where there's no real
patriarchal figures that we can depend upon," he said. "I think
Morrison was a great, strong model for masculinity--how to carry
yourself without being phony baloney and hippie about it."</TE>
<TE>   While Astbury and his hard-rock stance with the British band the
Cult might seem like a strange fit for the Doors, he suits the
combination of romantic poet and spiritual warrior that drove the
original band members. Manzarek and Krieger, who met drummer John
Densmore when all three were part of the original Transcendental
Meditation group of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1965 (later
popularized by the Beatles), are committed to preserving the
shamanistic and poetic tradition embraced by Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   "I read principally because of Morrison," said Astbury. "I studied
native cultures because of Morrison, I went to Tibet because I was
introduced to indigenous and shamanistic cultures through the Doors'
work. Even when I was a longhaired rock guy, I've constantly pushed
Native American philosophy, indigenous philosophies, Buddhist
philosophies."</TE>
<TE>   Now it looks as if the new Doors will give him the opportunity to
write new lyrics as well. After a bit of touring, Manzarek and
Krieger plan to work on the first new Doors material since 1978's
"American Prayer," which featured Morrison vocals and poems recorded
before his death. Krieger says they've been writing for six months,
the first time they've written together in decades, and have eight to
10 new songs. The core band will be the one that appeared in Fontana:
Manzarek, Krieger, Astbury, explosive drummer Copeland and young
bassist Angelo Barbera. Densmore may work on the project if his
current bout of tinnitus, a ringing in the ears common to rock
musicians, improves.</TE>
<TE>   They'll also be be working with other poets such as musician-actor
John Doe of the seminal Los Angeles rock band X and "Basketball
Diaries" author Jim Carroll, whose 1980 rock album "Catholic Boy"
remains a touchstone of urban punk poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Doe came out at Fontana to read "Ghost Song," Morrison's poem
about an apparent car accident that killed a group of native
Americans, later immortalized in Oliver Stone's film "The Doors" as a
formative experience in Morrison's artistic life.</TE>
<TE>   Copeland, whose virtuoso drumming pushed the old songs toward a
new aggression, says his new role couldn't have been more natural. "I
already knew all the songs," he said with a laugh. "I used to play
Doors songs when I was 14 years old in a cover band in Beirut. These
are such great songs, so well structured, I haven't had this much fun
since the Police."</TE>
<TE>   For Danny Sugarman, the Doors' longtime manager, the new Doors are
the culmination of a long struggle. Standing backstage, he said,
"I've been trying to make this happen with Ian for 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The only Doors song they won't do, say Manzarek and Krieger, is
"The End." That song was Jim's. Everything else is being put back in
the lineup, and they're finding the old feelings are flooding back.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's any different 30 years ago than it is today,"
said Manzarek. "Human beings are sentient, they want to be hit in the
loins with a good beat, and they want to stimulate their brain, and
they want to feel their heart chakra just pumping love. We all want
exactly the same thing: We want to get off. We want to rock."</TE>

<HD>Balance Is Elusive at the Liquid Mix Festival</HD>
<DH>The hip-hop-centered fest has an uneven day, topped off by
Jay-Z on the sidelines too often. But N.E.R.D. is a revelation and
311 shows focus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great thing about festivals is that you hear a whole slew of acts
all in one place. The downside is that you hear a whole slew of acts
all in one place.</LD>
<LD>   That paradox becomes more obvious as pop festivals
proliferate--hardly a week has gone by this summer that didn't offer
at least one somewhere in Southern California, making it ever more
challenging for promoters and musicians to strike that ideal balance
of musical variety and quality that can sustain interest and momentum
for hours.</LD>
<LD>   The Sprite Liquid Mix Tour on Saturday at Verizon Wireless
Amphitheater in Irvine landed considerably short of that ideal by the
time headliner Jay-Z stumbled across the finish line, seven hours
after the 10-act, hip-hop-centered bill started.</LD>
<TE>   But there were enough highlights--the bar-raising performance by
N.E.R.D. at the top of the list--to give fans something worth talking
about on their way home.</TE>
<TE>   Jay-Z is one of the most celebrated figures in rap, but his set
was too democratic. The Brooklyn rapper generously shared his stage
time with other members of his Roc-A-Fella Records family, including
rappers Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek. But his own performance lost
any semblance of cohesiveness and direction, devolving into a rap jam
session at which he was often observing on the sidelines. That the
session was conducted over recorded backing tracks further drained it
of spark.</TE>
<TE>   Omaha-reared, L.A.-based rap-rock group 311 showed more focus and
polish in an hourlong set that preceded Jay-Z. Having been around for
a dozen years also helped 311. The group's experience and deep
catalog gave it plenty of ammunition, from the early "Down" through
the group's modern-rock hit "Amber" to a new song, "Reconsider
Everything,"--about not taking life at face value.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation of the day was N.E.R.D., the latest project of
Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, a.k.a. the red-hot production team
the Neptunes. Williams and Hugo trotted out some high-powered pals to
wave to the crowd, including 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake and
skateboard star Tony Hawk, but their inspired blend of hip-hop, pop,
R&amp;B balladry, space rock and jazz was all that really mattered.</TE>
<TE>   The two were backed in songs from their debut album, "In Search of
...," by Spy Mob, a jazz-funk-rock quartet they discovered. Their
approach to the meeting of rock and rap is the musical equivalent of
Mohammad Ali's butterfly grace rather than Mike Tyson's sledgehammer
assault. Each number seemed to be all about possibilities, not
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other main-stage performances, Calabasas-based
Hoobastank, which played the same venue earlier this summer at the
KROQ-FM Weenie Roast, cranked up the crowd with fairly conventional
heavy rock tinged with punk thrash. Kentucky-based rural rap outfit
Nappy Roots was less interesting live than on its critically praised
debut album, "Watermelon, Chicken &amp; Gritz," because the organic
touches of guitar and organ that distinguish the album were mostly
missing from the sextet's live set.</TE>
<TE>   Of the acts on a second stage outside the amphitheater,
Sacramento's veteran Blackalicious delivered a particularly
invigorating set, spicing positive-minded raps--some dissing the
gangsta mentality--with lively touches of reggae, old-school soul and
Afro-pop.</TE>

<LD>How refreshing that in its Sunday Calendar, The Times chooses to give
such prominent attention to a local theater and its artistic
director, Jon Lawrence Rivera, who has dedicated his efforts over the
past decade to producing only new plays by L.A. writers ("What's Next
for His L.A. Story?" by Don Shirley, Sept. 1).</LD>
<LD>   As Shirley rightly asks, what could be a more losing financial
proposition than presenting works almost exclusively by little-known
authors?</LD>
<LD>   Yet speaking as one of the little-known playwrights in that
theater's stable, I do feel the article overlooks a couple of key
points while applying a standard of judgment that may not pertain to
a theater such as Rivera's Playwrights' Arena.</LD>
<TE>   First, it keeps homing in on the theater's box-office returns and
ongoing financial woes, implicitly holding Rivera's new-plays-only
policy accountable, as though 90% of theaters across the
city--regardless of their programming--don't function on the brink of
fiscal catastrophe. (To be fair, the hook to Shirley's story is
Rivera's inability to pay the bills at a venue with more than 99
seats, and the consequent strain with Actors Equity.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet from the article, one is left with the impression that Luis
Alfaro's "Straight as a Line" is the only Playwrights' Arena
production in 10 years that had any merit, since it was able to hop
from a 35-to a 99-seat theater. "Black Dawn" at the Ivar Theater lost
money, Shirley remarks. Alfaro's "Bitter Homes and Gardens" launched
the theater's LATC residency "on a high note," Shirley says, before
sounding a lower note: "Although the play never sold out."</TE>
<TE>   Though this is all true, the article contains not one sentence
about the quality of the work on the stage, the respect it has
engendered over the decade, the top-flight designers Rivera has
attracted, the stream of favorable reviews (some even by Times
critics), or the awards that the company has accrued--and not only in
Los Angeles. In addition to a love-letter review of Alfaro's
"Straight as a Line" (directed by Rivera) in the New York Times, Nick
Salamone and Maury R. McIntyre's musical, "Moscow," received a Fringe
First Award from the Edinburgh Festival--one of only 15 such nods in
a docket of more than 1,500 productions. It, too, lost money in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   How, then, do we measure accomplishment in a field that has never
thrived without patronage or subsidy, or at a theater with no
advertising budget?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, The Times' function is to report the news impartially.
And the newsworthy question posed by the article is a potent one: If
Playwrights' Arena goes under, what will be lost?</TE>
<TE>   A lot more, I suggest, than Shirley was willing to credit.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Leigh Morris is a Los Angeles-based playwright whose
"Atomic Quintet" and "Wet Snow" were produced at Playwrights' Arena
in 1997and 1994, respectively.</TE>

<HD>'Swimfan' Spoils 'Wedding' Plans</HD>
<DH>Box Office* Independent upstart 'Greek' has to settle for
being a bridesmaid as a panned thriller creeps into first in its
debut weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ateenage psycho-stalker drama overcame critics' pans and the momentum
behind the summer's biggest indie hit this weekend as 20th Century
Fox's "Swimfan" finished in the top spot, ahead of "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding."</LD>
<LD>   "Swimfan," which stars Erika Christensen ("Traffic") and Jesse
Bradford ("Bring It On") in the story of a girl who stalks a high
school swim star, was panned by nearly every critic in America but
made an estimated $12 million, thanks to a large showing by the
25-and-under crowd. More than 60% of the film's audience was teenage
girls.</LD>
<LD>   But the film's opening at No. 1 surprised even 20th Century Fox
Studio executives, who said the movie found an audience with the kids
who had already seen the spy action picture "XXX" and the girl-surfer
drama "Blue Crush," and were looking for something new.</LD>
<TE>   "Kids gobble things up very quickly and they move on to something
else," said Richard Myerson, executive vice president and general
sales manager for Fox. "It's one of those things, which honestly, we
said, 'Whoa!' "</TE>
<TE>   Even though it didn't reach No. 1, "Greek Wedding" continues to
cash in at the box office, making an estimated $10.6 million over the
weekend for a cumulative total of $96 million.</TE>
<TE>   The film has been in release since May, and has slowly crept its
way up the charts, making it one of the most profitable independent
hits of all time. It is expected to cross the $100-million domestic
threshold by next weekend, particularly impressive for a film with a
production budget of just about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' drama "City by the Sea," starring Robert De Niro and
James Franco, came in at No. 3 with $9.1 million on its opening
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Vista's "Signs" continued to do well, making $8 million over
the weekend for a total of $205.8 million since its release six weeks
ago. It joins "Austin Powers in Goldmember" as the only films
released during the summer months to gross more than $200 million
domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Diesel's action thriller "XXX" rolled down the charts to No.
5, bringing in $5.5 million over the weekend for a domestic total of
$131 million since early August.</TE>
<TE>   Dimension's "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams" came in at No.
6 with $2.7 million over the weekend and a total to date of $73.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Searchlight's "The Good Girl" continued to show strength at
the box office, grossing $1.5 million over the weekend, making $9.7
million since its release five weeks ago. Another limited-release
film, Robin Williams' creepy drama "One Hour Photo," is showing that
thrillers about stalkers work well at the box office, making $1.4
million on only 173 screens nationwide. The movie has made $5.9
million since its release three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The total box office for the weekend's top 10 movies was $57.5
million, down 32% from last week, but up slightly from the same time
last year.</TE>

<HD>'Mafia' Music Poised to Hit U.S. Charts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's gory art and a slice of pop culture that drips with the passion
and pain of Mafia culture. No, it's not the new season of "The
Sopranos". It's a far less famous work: "Il Canto Di Malavita," a
collection of Calabrian folk songs that hits the U.S. music charts
Wednesday--or maybe it won't.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't really expect to see it make the charts at all," says
music executive Kevin Wortis, among the project's lead figures. "That
is fine. Short-term sales we could get with titillation or by
portraying this as a novelty. We are emphasizing the music. And this
is astonishingly beautiful music."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, a buzz is building that "Il Canto Di Malavita" (it
translates loosely to "Songs of a Life of Crime") has the archival
purity, craft and cultural resonance to join "Buena Vista Social
Club" or the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack on the list of
recent commercial successes from unlikely music landscapes.</LD>
<TE>   This is no new take on "Mob Hits," the CD advertised on late-night
TV that is more bada-bing than it is omerta. Newsweek and the New
York Times have already visited Italy for features on the rich
Calabrian fount tapped by the album, and Wortis says National Public
Radio is pouncing on the disc for upcoming features. Rolling Stone
has weighed in that the disc is "more darkly romantic than Nine Inch
Nails."</TE>
<TE>   The May 2000 release of the music in Europe drew cheers for the
artistry but also some shouts that it spreads ugly stereotypes of
Italians. It has sold 60,000 copies in Europe but has never been
released in Italy, where it remains taboo.</TE>
<TE>   If the new album does become a U.S. hit, Wortis hopes for a tie-in
tour of the aging musicians who perform the music.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the disc does find success in the U.S. (and the ambient
Mafia interest stirred by "The Sopranos" certainly couldn't hurt),
just the release adds an unexpected chapter to the music story begun
more than a century ago in the mountain villages of southern Italy.
The music was passed down as an oral tradition, but in recent
decades, Calabrian bandleader Mimmo Siclari began producing and
selling the songs via cheap cassettes. One tape reached Francesco
Sbano, a German journalist born in Calabria, and he became an
architect of the album project.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about the Mafia today; it's a document about the
history of Calabria, a history you cannot find in books," Sbano says.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people do not think it is a good thing to have out ... but
it is a history you cannot conceal."</TE>

<HD>Bard and Ballet in Duet at the Bowl</HD>
<DH>The program included Michael York's deft spoken performance
and a misfired Balanchine experiment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not every actor can be equally credible as Romeo and Mistress
Quickly, but Michael York performed more than half a dozen
roles--well spoken with good accent and good discretion--during the
first half of a multidisciplinary program titled "Much Ado About
Something: Shakespeare at the Bowl" on Friday and Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With John Mauceri leading the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, passages
from film scores by Nino Rota ("Romeo and Juliet") and Miklos Rozsa
("Julius Caesar") accompanied speeches from the plays that inspired
them.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on "Greensleeves" launched
odes to Sir John Falstaff, and an excerpt from Mendelssohn's
incidental music to "A Midsummer Night's Dream" found York deftly
switching from Oberon to Puck to bid us goodnight.</LD>
<TE>   But the evening had more Mendelssohn, and more "Dream" in store:
the authoritative Pacific Northwest Ballet dancing most of Act 1 and
the finale of Act 2 from George Balanchine's 1962 Shakespeare ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the experiment misfired. Deleting Balanchine's
magnificent Act 2 divertissement and reducing his discursive
full-evening work to a plot-driven one act only highlighted its
inferiority as a story-ballet to Frederick Ashton's one-act "Dream"
from 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Balanchine lack Ashton's sense of comedy (a real loss
in the scenes involving the young lovers), but he inserted bombastic
Mendelssohn scores ("The First Walpurgis Night," for instance) that
didn't always suit his expressive purposes.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest lapse may have been his use of the majestic "Dream"
Nocturne for an extended comic flirtation between Bottom and
Titania--nice, if you can accept sight gags to this music, but no
match for the passionate Oberon-Titania reconciliation duet that
Ashton created to the same accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   Balanchine's greatest strength here involved the interplay of
soloists and corps--always breathtaking, whether two dozen local
children impersonated various insects or the Pacific Northwest Ballet
ensemble flew across the narrow forestage dressed as butterflies and
hounds.</TE>
<TE>   Two sets of principals danced at the Bowl, none more impressively
than Patricia Barker as a superbly regal, delicate and dynamic
Titania on Saturday. Her diligent Friday counterpart, Louise Nadeau,
looked more brittle in the role and tended to get lost in the busy
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's charismatic Ober- on, Astrit Zejnati, made more of the
fiendishly exposed beaten steps, turning more combinations in his
solos than the comparatively easygoing but elegant Paul Gibson on
Friday. But Jonathan Porretta made Puck surprisingly volatile and
sexy Friday, in contrast to the cooler, nastier Timothy Lynch the
following night. Nicholas Ade (Bottom) and Ariana Lallone (Hippolyta)
lent skill and flair to both performances.</TE>
<TE>   It made no appreciable difference, however, who danced which young
lovers on which night--the roles proved interchangeable, defined more
by Martin Pakledinaz's costume colors than Balanchine's choreography
or the energetic, well-coached portrayals by Melanie Skinner, Carrie
Imler, Kaori Nakamura, Olivier Wevers, Christophe Maraval and Jeffrey
Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   The evening held more than a few fanfares, and the brass section
of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra did itself proud. As usual, Mauceri
left some of the music sounding directionless (on Rota and Vaughan
Williams, especially), but he capably attended to the unusual
challenges of underscoring dramatic recitations and accompanying
dancers with his back turned to them.</TE>

<HD>'Joy' Hides Its Darker Issues</HD>
<DH>A new play by Jon Marans at the Laguna Playhouse revolves
around a family's future problem, revealing some unsettling traits
about characters, story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title "Jumping for Joy" is a misleadingly cheerful portal into
Jon Marans' new play at Laguna Playhouse. When Emily Mavin, a 40ish
schizophrenic, starts jumping on her bed, it's from frustration, not
joy.</LD>
<LD>   Emily's latest round of bed-jumping is set off by a visit from her
younger brother Michael, a New York lawyer who forces a discussion of
what will happen to Emily after her 70-year-old father and caretaker,
Samuel Mavin, dies.</LD>
<LD>   It's a potentially poignant situation. But the play--in its
premiere--has yet to achieve its intended power.</LD>
<TE>   Marans, best known for "Old Wicked Songs," grew up in the
Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Md., and the play is set there.
In a short essay, Marans wrote that much of the play "is not remotely
autobiographical." But he cites "one small moment, almost
inconsequential to the play, which is so peculiarly personal to me
that it hits me in a joyous yet oddly uncomfortable, almost
unsettling way."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't identify that moment. But "oddly uncomfortable, almost
unsettling" sums up Marans' attitude toward his own characters,
particularly Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Michael advocates investigating the possibilities of long-term
institutional care for his sister. But his father wants Michael to
move Emily into the New York home Michael shares with his (unseen)
wife and daughter. Emily has mixed feelings--she sometimes declares
she can take care of herself, but she clearly relishes her father's
solicitous attention.</TE>
<TE>   In Richard Stein's staging, Daniel Nathan Spector's Michael
appears level-headed and reasonably caring and affectionate.</TE>
<TE>   If he hasn't been around the old homestead very often, the
pressures of job and family in New York offer a ready explanation.
His attitude that his father hovers too much over Emily and that she
should live more independently, even if it's in a halfway house,
seems defensible.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Marans gives Michael a couple of odd mannerisms that, in a
heavy-handed way, point an accusatory finger back at him. His face
sometimes twitches, and worse, he occasionally closes his fingers
around Emily's throat as if he's going to strangle her.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether this throat business is a little game the
siblings play, whether we're supposed to take it seriously as a
symptom of Michael's repressed feelings, or whether it's just Marans'
attempt at black comedy inside a play that isn't a black comedy.
Whatever the motivation, the fake strangling doesn't seem to ruffle
either Emily or Samuel, even though Samuel is depicted as fussy and
overprotective of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the amiable Spector hasn't captured Michael's toxic side.
But perhaps the playwright hasn't figured out the character. The
stage directions in the script refer to Michael's "acid core," which
seems like sheer hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Van Valkenburgh, as Emily, has more justification to go
through sudden mood changes than her brother and handles them with
aplomb. Marans and actor Allan Miller depict Samuel's controlling
personality with affection. He's a nervous eccentric--who loves to
bring out his big map in which he crosses out those countries that
have insulted Israel--more than a domineering tyrant, even though
Emily's and Michael's language suggests otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Marans and Stein's company depict the undercurrent of familial
love well, most evident in a winsome second-act revival of an old
play-acting routine from the kids' childhood. But the play isn't as
successful at bringing its darker feelings about the past and the
future out into the open.</TE>

<HD>A Former Underdog Has His Work Cut Out for Him</HD>
<DH>Taking over the Berlin Philharmonic, Simon Rattle tried to
lead the sedate group in a mix of tradition and innovation.</DH>

<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERLIN--In his excellent, newly updated biography of Simon Rattle,
Nicholas Kenyon begins with the words "This could change the musical
world." The "this" is Rattle's becoming music director of the Berlin
Philharmonic. Saturday night, amid a town festooned with cheerful
"Welcome Sir Simon" billboards, the changing began with impressively
played and enthusiastically received performances of Thomas Ades'
"Asyla" and Mahler's Fifth Symphony. Impressive, but not
earthshaking. Changing the world is never easy, and Rattle has his
work cut out for him.</LD>
<LD>   The elevated status of the Berlin Philharmonic is based as much on
mythology as it is on reality. It is often said that player for
player, this orchestra is without equal, and that may be. But more
significant than these players' ability to lord over the orchestra
world has been their willingness to succumb to the cult of
personality.</LD>
<TE>   They were there to support the mystically transcendent Wilhelm
Furtwangler between the wars and briefly in the early 1950s after his
de-Nazification. They were Herbert von Karajan's enthusiastic
collaborators, at least until things turned bitter at the end,
producing an unceasing cycle of perfectly played if increasingly
slick and soulless recordings, from the mid-'50s through the '80s.
Over the past dozen years, the less charismatic Claudio Abbado helped
modernize the orchestra and hired younger players, but he failed to
generate excitement or a feeling of relevance.</TE>
<TE>   With Berlin not yet quite living up to its promise of becoming the
capital of the new Europe, and with much of its ballyhooed rebuilding
now feeling like the sterile corporate equivalent of Karajan's
monstrous vanity, the city has hoped that at least one once-potent
symbol of cultural superiority would become a revolutionary model for
the 21st century. Rattle's Philharmonic appointment was
uncompromising and it was made more than three years ago, when he was
44, allowing him time to get to know the players and the city (he
didn't speak German when he accepted the job) as well as to carefully
map out a new vision for the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   He has greatly expanded the repertory with unprecedented amounts
of new and ancient music. Guest conductors now include the likes of
early-music specialist William Christie and British composer Oliver
Knussen. Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct his recent orchestral work
"Foreign Bodies" in June.</TE>
<TE>   Rattle, moreover, comes to Berlin as an admirable outsider, chosen
over the ultimate insider, Daniel Barenboim.</TE>
<TE>   The British conductor remained loyal to his City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra for 18 years, steadfastly refusing offers in
London, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. The most important orchestra
with which he has been closely associated is the Los Angeles
Philharmonic; he was a principal guest conductor in L.A. in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin learned quickly just how uncompromising Rattle can be when
he withheld from signing his contract until the city government,
which supports the orchestra, agreed to wage hikes for the players
and until the orchestra changed its policies so that artistic
priorities would overrule its lucrative media enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   But Rattle has used the prominence of the Berlin post to lash out
at the British as well. Two weeks ago, he angered many Brits by
attacking such media darlings as the visual artists Damien Hirst and
Tracy Emin. His "music is boring," replied Dinos Chapman, one of
Rattle's BritArt brat-pack targets.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Rattle's strongest first statements in Berlin come
from the classical BritMusic brat pack. The surrealist percussion
tones that open Ades' "Asyla" were the first sounds of the Rattle era
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The third movement, an ode to the drug Ecstasy, takes the sedate
orchestra into the techno world of the club scene. Later in the
month, Rattle will conduct Mark-Anthony Turnage's extremely
hard-edged, Miles Davis-besotted "Blood on the Floor," inspired by a
heroin overdose. The conductor will introduce the concert with
commissioned films by local directors and teenagers about drug
addiction. Two days before that concert, he conducts an all-Mozart
program with pianist Mitsuko Uchida as soloist.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact is that neither Rattle nor his new orchestra does
everything equally well. Rattle can be awkward when he tries to get
too jazzy.</TE>
<TE>   And the orchestra has a long way to go if it ever wants to be
cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   EMI has just released a crossover CD of the 12 Berlin Philharmonic
cellists, who proudly browbeat their new music director into rapping
a laughably lame song about the divine Mozart. It is a challenge to
admire any orchestral musicians that profoundly clueless.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the orchestra clearly did its best to bring off "Asyla,"
which made a brilliant impact in the Philharmonie, the yellow,
geometrically intricate hall with "vineyard" seating that was an
inspiration for the Walt Disney Concert Hall acoustical design. But
sensing how hard the Berliners tried meant one's attention was drawn
to sensing how hard the Berliners were trying. When the Los Angeles
Philharmonic played the same piece under Rattle at the Ojai Festival
two years ago, the score just seemed to take off, despite a far less
engaging acoustical setting.</TE>
<TE>   Mahler's Fifth, of course, is in the orchestra's genes. It first
performed it in 1905, a year after its premiere. But for a very long
time, it didn't play any Mahler, what with the Nazi ban on his music
and the composer generally being out of fashion. In any case, the
execution Saturday was extraordinarily beautiful. The trumpet solo at
the beginning (the players are not identified in the program) was as
pure as it could be. The strings in the famous Adagio movement were
exquisitely sumptuous and tender.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Rattle exhibited much passion, offering his
musicians something they had not known in a music director for a very
long time, if ever--simple joy. But if the Berliners again responded
not so much with joy in the music as joy in the mastery of it,
goodwill and stunning virtuosity were enough to thoroughly wow a
listener. The audience applauded loud and hard, even calling Rattle
back after the orchestra had marched offstage, but there was no
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   For years, many of us have respected Rattle as the underdog, a
conductor more concerned with art than career. Now that he has risen
to the top, the top has yet to rise to him.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Berlin will welcome Rattle's combination of tradition and
innovation, or whether he will divide the audience, won't be apparent
until after an inevitably long honeymoon wears off. Nor will we know
for a very long time to what degree the players can and will follow
Rattle.</TE>
<TE>   Time, however, is something Rattle is willing to give, if his 18
years in Birmingham are any indication. But most listeners are hardly
willing to wait that long. EMI recorded the Mahler live Saturday and
will rush the release out by November.</TE>

<HD>Retooled Life and Times of 'Drew'</HD>

<LD>Football announcer John Madden isn't the only change to ABC's Monday
night lineup.</LD>
<LD>   A retooled "The Drew Carey Show" launches its eighth season at 8
tonight with a new female co-star and a new workplace along with its
new time slot. The rest of Carey's familiar ensemble returns,
including the glasses, the dopey pals and the annoying archenemy.</LD>
<LD>   With cast member Christa Miller departing the sitcom, the writers
are marrying off her character, Kate, in a two-part story that
concludes next week.</LD>
<TE>   Even before Drew learns that the woman he loves is leaving his
life forever, Drew is down on his luck. The department store has gone
bust, costing him his menial job, and his ex, Nicki (Kate Walsh), is
mooching off him.</TE>
<TE>   Drew's prospects perk up when he begs his way into a job as an
"internal expediting analyst"--he doesn't know what it means,
either--alongside rival Mimi (Kathy Kinney) at the dot-com retailer
that has taken over the store.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cynthia Watros (from "Titus") joins the cast as Drew's
childhood chum Kellie, who returns to Cleveland after a divorce. When
Drew and his friends Oswald (Diedrich Bader) and Lewis (Ryan Stiles)
find the homeless Kellie working in a strip club, Drew rescues her by
offering his "spare" room.</TE>
<TE>   But Kate's surprise engagement spoils Drew's bliss, and next week
he resorts to desperate measures ranging from reason to kidnapping in
an effort to thwart her marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, this new "Drew" is hardly innovative, but fans of his
silly, self-deprecating humor won't object. The amiable Watros steps
easily into her role as this troupe's straight man. Who is she, or
anyone, to argue with Drew when he explains, "If you saw me start to
strip, you'd stop me, right?"</TE>

<KH>A YEAR AFTER</KH>
<HD>Even the Green Lights Flash Caution in Today's Hollywood</HD>
<DH>In film, what's notable are the stories that aren't being
told while on TV dramas have tackled terror even as nostalgia takes a
greater role in programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS, ANITA M. BUSCH and DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fledgling screenwriter Jason Rothenberg was prowling the streets of
New York late last summer, researching a script about a Manhattan
skyscraper that collapses under the brutal onslaught of a raging
storm.</LD>
<LD>   The project, "The 69 Story Crisis," had all the earmarks of a
"Towering Inferno"-like disaster thriller with office workers
scrambling down crowded stairwells, heroic firemen rushing in to save
those trapped on upper floors, and worried officials racing against
time before the high-rise building came crashing to earth in gigantic
plumes of smoke and dust.</LD>
<LD>   But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center, Rothenberg's script has been blown off course by
Hollywood's prevailing winds. Even though the plot had nothing to do
with terrorism, officials at Paramount Pictures recently informed the
writer they would not go ahead with the project.</LD>
<TE>   "I respect their decision that they do not want to exploit the
emotions of 9/11," Rothenberg remarked afterward. "They said,
'Obviously, we can't make this movie now.' "</TE>
<TE>   In television, the instincts were quite different. NBC had been
developing "War Stories," a television series in which Jeff Goldblum
would play a fictional foreign correspondent from the Baltimore Sun
who is covering the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We loved the script prior to 9/11, but we didn't think the
country was ready for it," NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker
said. After 9/11, the network reconsidered the show, and it will air
this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Following the terrorist attacks, many in the creative and business
sides of the media and entertainment community shared the belief
rippling through the rest of the country that nothing would be as it
was before.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, that appears to be only partly true.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Sept. 11, the film community predicted that the
action-adventure genre would tone down the violence while the
consensus in television was that "reality TV" was doomed because
real-life footage made such programs seem petty and pointless.</TE>
<TE>   But reality TV programs rebounded within months, from ABC's "The
Bachelor" to NBC's success this summer with unscripted series like
"Dog Eat Dog" and "Meet My Folks."</TE>
<TE>   In film, though, some of what was forecast after Sept. 11 has come
to pass.</TE>
<TE>   On-screen terrorism has become less overt in films green lighted
after Sept. 11, and studios have also become more reliant on period
pieces and comic-book-based fare.</TE>
<TE>   The big action films green lighted in the last year have been
largely period pieces, such as Warner Bros.' "The Last Samurai" with
Tom Cruise, and Disney's "The Alamo," or comic-book-based projects
like 20th Century Fox's "Daredevil" with Ben Affleck and the studio's
"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" with Sean Connery.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, in the film industry, the changes are largely in what
kinds of stories aren't being told, while in TV, with its hundreds of
channels, the networks have served up sometimes contradictory fare.
Highly rated New York-based sitcoms such as "Friends" and "Sex and
the City" have shunned direct mention of terrorism while in the
dramatic arena the roots of terrorism have been tackled by such hit
series as NBC's "The West Wing," "Third Watch" and "Law &amp; Order," and
ABC's "The Practice."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the prime-time spectrum are nostalgic series
that previously might have seemed overly sentimental but now are
accepted and, more important, bankable.</TE>
<TE>   For example, later this month, NBC will roll out "American
Dreams," a new prime-time drama about a family coming of age during
the heyday of "American Bandstand" and President John F. Kennedy's
assassination. It will air during the network's family time slot at 8
p.m. Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   On ABC, an hourlong drama/comedy about a guy who returns to high
school for a year of "do overs" will hit the airwaves next month as
"That Was Then."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a softer show than we've picked up in the past," said the
network's president of entertainment, Susan Lyne. "The theme of that
show is, what if you could go back to a time in your life when you
made a mistake and could fix it, knowing all you know now? I think
that whole idea of wanting to make things right, and lost
opportunities, came after 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   As for the movies, out for the foreseeable future are "Die
Hard"-type projects that depict terrorists taking over high-rises,
hijacking planes and setting off bombs to kill innocents. In are
escapist films with fantasy or comic-book violence a la this past
summer's "Spider-Man" and the upcoming "Matrix Reloaded" and "Hulk."</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that involves bombs and terrorists, people are very
cautious about, primarily because they don't know when it stops being
fun for the audience," said Robert Newman, an agent at International
Creative Management representing directors and writers, who noted the
decisions are being "motivated by economics."</TE>
<TE>   John Fogelman, who heads the motion picture talent division of the
William Morris Agency, also cited financial considerations. "The
emotional chord that dictates what the public desires to see has
shifted," he said. "No longer do people want to watch [realistic]
terrorism, because it is reminiscent of a sad reality."</TE>
<TE>   The reason studios have avoided Sept. 11 as fodder for big-screen
entertainment while the networks have laced some of their top shows
with terrorism themes is both practical and economic. Television--as
well as the magazine and book publishing businesses--can more easily
address ripped-from-the-headline tales faster and at less cost than
movies, which typically take from two to four years, and often
longer, to get from script to screen.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing a studio executive wants is to shoulder the costs
associated with a $100-million action film when no one knows how the
current war on terrorism will play out.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a long time to get a film out there, and who knows what
the mind-set of the public might be and who knows what the realities
of terrorism might be by the time you get the film made?" said Rick
Jewell, associate dean of the USC School of Cinema-Television. "If
I'm the money man at a studio who is ultimately going to green light
something, I am going to green light escapist fare like 'Spider-Man
2' or 'Austin Powers 4' before anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Studios found themselves shouldering heavy interest costs after
Sept. 11 when they shuffled release dates for such big-budget
pictures as "Collateral Damage" and "Windtalkers."</TE>
<TE>   One film studio chief admits that fear also plays into his
decision making.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to say 'yes' and 'no' to entertainment projects," said
the studio head, who requested anonymity. "I don't want to antagonize
these people further.... We don't want to go there."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the FBI privately briefed executives from the seven
major film and TV studios and told them their companies were on the
list of potential attack targets.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told there was a threat--that a suicide bomber might blow
up a studio," said one executive who attended the meeting. "Some
people hired personal bodyguards."</TE>
<TE>   One security expert who works for studios, however, called the
meeting a "dog-and-pony show" and suggested it was designed to rally
support among media moguls for the Bush administration's war on
terrorism. Nevertheless, security companies benefited as movie lots
became virtual fortresses.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the attacks, Karl Rove, a top strategist for the
administration, met with Hollywood's power elite to discuss possible
areas of cooperation. The meeting was controversial; some in the
creative community were concerned about government influence over
content and cited the 1st Amendment. The result, however, is what
some in the industry describe as a form of self-censorship, though
others call it a responsible reaction to dangerous times.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is caught in a bind," added a former studio
executive-turned-producer. "Executives are very wary of the word
'terrorist' in screenplays. In fact, it's being excised. It's almost
a dirty word. They don't want to use Arabs as villains, but why can't
we show the truth? The answer has still not been reached."</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman John Calley countered, "I
don't think we are censoring ourselves. We have not had that meeting
that says, 'Here is what we are not going to do' because we have to
be open to all possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Among the few feature-film projects on the front burner at major
studios dealing directly with Sept. 11 or the war on terrorism is one
at MGM. It's based on a New Yorker magazine article about the life of
John O'Neill, the former hard-charging FBI counter-terrorism chief in
New York who died in the World Trade Center, two weeks after being
hired as chief of security at the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who spent four years pursuing Osama bin Laden, had tried
to warn his bosses at the FBI of the danger posed by Al Qaeda and
also urged the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency to collaborate in
battling international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   According to MGM President and Chief Executive Michael Nathanson,
the deal was struck because O'Neill is a heroic and principled figure
"whose story deserves to be told."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Wright, who penned the New Yorker article and is writing
the screenplay, said: "It's going to be about real events as much as
possible. I'm going to people it with real characters. That's what
[MGM] bought. I believe that American artists, whatever form we work
in, have an obligation to examine reality, to look at the world the
way it really is. I think the failure of Hollywood is, we turn our
eyes away from life as we know it."</TE>
<TE>   But Wright is still mulling whether to include scenes of hijacked
planes crashing into the twin towers. "Maybe it will be implicit or
explicit," he said. "I haven't decided yet."</TE>
<TE>   It may not be up to him to decide anyway. As with any screenplay's
development process, it will have to be approved by the studio and
could go through various incarnations, depending on the director,
star or green-lighting process.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't Wright's first experience dealing with the complicated
politics of writing a story involving Arab characters. He co-wrote
the 1998 thriller "The Siege," in which Arab terrorists set off bombs
around New York City. The film was roundly criticized by Arab
Americans as fostering negative stereotypes. Executives at 20th
Century Fox reported death threats.</TE>
<TE>   That film is credited with making Arab terrorists politically
incorrect as film villains. Since "The Siege," Hollywood has, for the
most part, relied on Russian renegades, European neo-Nazis and even
corrupt businessmen as villains. In the next James Bond film, "Die
Another Day," the archenemy is North Korean, according to sources
close to the production.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's bad guys are these nefarious, unspecified, non-real,
exaggerated villains," said producer Bill Mechanic, who oversaw
production on "The Siege" while a senior executive at 20th Century
Fox. "They're not 'out of the headlines' characters."</TE>
<TE>   Movies that try to portray realistic villains have, he said,
become "taboo."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Marc Abraham, whose credits include "13 Days" and "Spy
Game," said that as a filmmaker he doesn't want anything to be taboo.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a script with a hijacking, now you see if there is
another way to present it, not because it is politically correct,
it's just that people prefer not to be reminded of those events,"
Abraham said. But realistic terrorism in film, he said, "will
eventually come back."</TE>
<TE>   The action-adventure genre is not the only kind of films being
affected by the terrorist attacks. The Warner Bros.' comedy " 'Til
Death Do Us Part," starring Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, had to
change its terrorist subplot, which included the destabilization of
the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "The old script bore too much of a resemblance to Sept. 11," noted
producer Bill Gerber. "We had a rehearsal dinner for the wedding in
Windows of the World [the restaurant atop the World Trade Center] and
the bad guy's subplot concerned the destabilization of the Nasdaq. It
was totally inappropriate for a comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Cohen, who directed this summer's action spy thriller "XXX,"
said he, too, made a concession after Sept. 11 in his film which
involved a hydrofoil/submarine doomsday machine dubbed "Ahab."</TE>
<TE>   "I was five weeks into prep when 9/11 happened," Cohen said.
"Whereas I had the Ahab device originally look functional, I made it
look a little more Buck Rogersy, as if to say, 'You cannot do this at
home. You cannot build a submarine and deliver binary nerve gas
rockets at home.' I made it a little more fantasy so it didn't have
some ugly vibe of reality."</TE>
<TE>   Prior to Sept. 11, filmmakers John Woo and Terence Chang pitched a
film to MGM about an Osama bin Laden-like villain blowing up an
airplane carrying the daughter of the biggest mobster in America.</TE>
<TE>   "A Tony Soprano mobster goes after him because the government
can't get the job done," recalled one studio insider. "Here we have a
case where the studio has two really great filmmakers but now it's
very conflicted. It's like having an angel on one shoulder and devil
on the other. But whoever comes out and does the first movie about
this will probably make something like $500 million worldwide."</TE>

<HD>On the Lot, Security Remains Tight</HD>
<DH>Safety* Studios are poor targets, experts say, but
vigilance continues. Some say the measures are an overreaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH and ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Sept. 11, Hollywood studios went into a virtual lock-down.</LD>
<LD>   At Warner Bros. in Burbank, concrete barriers were erected around
the executive office building. At 20th Century Fox in Century City, a
cement maze had cars zig-zagging into the lot. At Paramount Pictures,
traffic was lined down Melrose Avenue as guards methodically used
hand-held mirrors to check the undersides of cars for bombs. Cars
entering the Universal Pictures lot got the same once-over. And, at
Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Michael
Eisner even drove around the perimeter of the lot to see that cars
were not parked illegally.</LD>
<LD>   Today, while Hollywood's rank-and-file may make light of the
heightened security at studio gates, many security measures remain in
place: Car trunks are searched, photo IDs are checked, and guards
with mirrors circle cars and trucks.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the mirrors under the cars, it's more for perception,"
said producer Marc Abraham, whose credits include "The Family Man"
and "Spy Game." "The only way they'd know there is a bomb under there
is if it was built by Wile E. Coyote."</TE>
<TE>   In truth, security experts point out, movie lots make poor targets
for terrorists because the buildings are so spread out and production
bungalows and sound stages are not always occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Although some may discount the security steps Hollywood has taken
as self-absorbed or arrogant, security experts note that brand names
such as Disney and MGM are highly recognizable symbols of America to
people around the globe and could be tempting targets.</TE>
<TE>   Only last week, two Islamic militants who were indicted in Detroit
were found to have "surveillance" videotape footage of Disneyland in
Anaheim and the MGM Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, according to the
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, studios have beefed up the presence of uniformed
guards on movie sets both here and abroad, celebrities rely more
heavily on personal bodyguards, and at least one studio--Paramount
Pictures--has gone so far as to institute background checks of
vendors doing business on the lot, from cleaning and maintenance
crews to delivery people.</TE>
<TE>   "We are assisting Paramount in that," acknowledged Henry
Kupperman, senior managing director in charge of the Western region
for Kroll Associates, an internationally known security company hired
by the studio shortly after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kupperman would not discuss security measures specific to
Paramount, he said vendors often have pass keys that can give them
access. "By doing background checks," he said, "you're heightening
security, making sure no one has something in their background that
might be problematic."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount no longer rents out its lot for parties and has limited
the number of screenings on the lot. "We feel that it's important
that members of the Paramount family and our guests be safe and feel
secure," said Rob Friedman, vice chairman and chief operating officer
of Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Sept. 11, the FBI met with the heads of most major
studios to brief them on security concerns. Two security chiefs who
run their own companies told The Times that when the FBI briefed the
studios, there had been no direct threats.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the security we are seeing at the studios was an
overreaction," said Robert Newman, an agent at ICM who regularly
attends meetings on various studio lots. "The government has handled
the whole thing hysterically and, in some ways, the studios have
followed suit."</TE>
<TE>   One studio head who requested anonymity said: "The FBI was
probably overly cautious and gave us too much information. People say
we're overreacting and don't need to be doing this. It's expensive,
but we have a responsibility to our employees."</TE>
<TE>   "They are the authority figures, and when a somber guy [from the
FBI] comes in and suggests that we need to increase security, you
listen," said Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman John Calley. "We
have to make sure our back doors are closed."</TE>

<HD>Lionel Hampton 'Goes Home' in Style</HD>
<DH>Memorial* A procession of jazz musicians gives the
legendary vibraphonist, who died Aug. 31, a New Orleans-style
send-off on the streets of New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As the sun rose over Manhattan on Saturday morning, several musicians
wearing crisp white shirts and impeccably pressed black suits and
ties warmed up on their horns, their random notes piercing the early
morning quiet and quickly drawing a crowd outside the Cotton Club in
Harlem.</LD>
<LD>   After a few minutes, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis--sporting the ebony
hat that marked him as the leader of the band--called a tune, put his
horn to his lips and let out a glorious cry, while a horse-drawn
carriage just ahead started rolling. It carried the body of jazz icon
Lionel Hampton, who had died a week earlier at age 94.</LD>
<LD>   For as long as anyone has played this music, jazzmen have taken
their final journey this way, though more often in slow-and-easy New
Orleans than in frantic Manhattan, which typically does not have time
or space for such extravagances.</LD>
<TE>   But Hampton--who grew up in Chicago, lived mostly on the road and
died in New York--deserved special attention. As the first jazz
musician to champion the vibraphone and as a charismatic member of
the first integrated band to perform publicly (Benny Goodman's
quartet, in 1936), Hampton ranked as a certifiable jazz legend. Even
in a city crowded with celebrities, his death called for a grand
gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the spectacle of these splendidly attired
musicians wailing their blues-tinged dirges while slowly marching in
the middle of the street--oblivious to traffic lights and even to
traffic--caused a stir. New Yorkers who had been watching from
curbside fell in behind the band. Television crews and newspaper
photographers, who had been tipped off that a New Orleans-style
parade would unfold on this morning, crowded in front of the parade
and walked backward, so as to capture the action head-on.</TE>
<TE>   As the funeral procession wended its way through the Morningside
Heights neighborhood, "St. James Infirmary" and "Flee as a Bird to
the Mountain" rang out, performed just as black and Creole musicians
have played this music for more than a century, the notes and chords
and phrasings handed down through the generations by oral tradition.</TE>
<TE>   This emotionally wrenching music awoke many of the locals, and as
the band approached each block--bass drum pounding, clarinet
squealing, trombone pumping almost without pause--folks got out of
bed, opened the windows of their walk-up apartments and leaned
outside, half-dressed, staring at the proceedings in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Hampton's casket and Marsalis' musicians approached
historic Riverside Church, the crowd had swelled to more than 2,000,
church officials estimated. Meanwhile, the musicians played a searing
version of "Just a Closer Walk With Thee," and though they didn't
sing the words, you practically could hear the sublime lyrics coming
out of their horns: "Just a closer walk with thee/Grant it, Jesus, is
my plea," the song declared, urging Hampton's entry into the
hereafter.</TE>
<TE>   In case anyone missed the significance of the hymn, the preacher
at Riverside Church spelled it out for the standing-room-only crowd
(the kind that Hampton long had become accustomed to).</TE>
<TE>   "Officially, this is called a funeral service," said Rev. James A.
Forbes, Jr., senior minister at Riverside, "but really it's a service
of 'home-going.' "</TE>
<TE>   That belief--that life on earth eventually yields to a spiritual
eternity--dates much further back than even the jazz funerals. Still,
in New Orleans perhaps it was inevitable that death, immortality and
music would intermingle in the form of the jazz funeral. Any jazz
musician worthy of the name wanted one.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, the band stopped playing once the casket had been
placed at the altar and covered in a white-and-gold cloth. A variety
of speakers took to the podium to praise Hampton, among them former
President George Bush, tenor saxophone master Illinois Jacquet (who
achieved his first great hit recording Hampton's "Flying Home" in
1942) and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   None, however, articulated the link between jazz and its spiritual
undercurrent as eloquently as Rep. John Conyers (D.-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   "We have to ask the question, as we celebrate this great
'home-going': Where did this music come from?" asked Conyers, who
knew the answer all too well.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't come out of Africa," he continued, warming to the
subject. "It came out of the African experience in America--and out
of that pain, out of that suffering, out of the church, came the
music that became jazz."</TE>
<TE>   Though he didn't say it, Conyers knew that Hampton, too, felt that
pain, if only because he was a prodigiously gifted musician who early
in life was not allowed to enter through the front door of clubs
where he was performing, was not allowed to drink from the same water
fountains or stay in the same hotels as his white colleagues. Perhaps
worst of all, he was not allowed to perform before the public on
stage with the white musicians he admired.</TE>
<TE>   But Hampton, with Goodman's help, defied the unspoken rule keeping
black and white musicians apart, thereby opening a new era in race
relations in America long before anyone heard of Jackie Robinson or
Rosa Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Between speeches, some of the most exalted jazz musicians on the
East Coast played a rousing number or two, among them Jacquet,
pianist Hank Jones and trumpeters Roy Hargrove, Jon Faddis, Clark
Terry and Marsalis. When the speechifying ended, Marsalis and the
band stepped to the front of the church nave and led the casket back
outside.</TE>
<TE>   But this time the music turned up-tempo, exuberant and
optimistic--the antithesis of the dark, mournful sounds that first
had accompanied Hampton to the church. In this regard, too, the
Hampton funeral mirrored age-old New Orleans traditions.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier era, once the horns started swinging, listeners
assumed that the body had been "cut loose" so it could be taken to
the cemetery for eternal rest and so the soul could be freed of
earthly pains and travails.</TE>
<TE>   The drummer inside Riverside Church banged his huge, bass drum so
hard it was a marvel the skin didn't tear, at which point the crowd
in the church erupted into noisy conversation and laughter, as if the
tension had been broken and Hamp had made his final passage.</TE>
<TE>   Though the throngs followed the band and the casket outside, most
folks couldn't bring themselves to leave the church grounds entirely.
So they lingered in front, reminiscing about the great jazz musician
who had been making music swing for as long as they could remember.</TE>
<TE>   They recalled that Hampton played a controversial concert in 1957
that raised funds for several black South Africans who were charged
with treason and lacked funds to hire attorneys. The cash that
Hampton drummed up provided them a defense and spared them death. One
of those men was Nelson Mandela.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to show respect to a man who did a lot more for this
country than people may realize, even though he was famous just as a
jazz musician," said Ronald Lonesome, a retiree who said he lived in
the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd milled outside the church, the casket carrying
Hampton's body was eased into a black limousine bound for Woodlawn
Cemetery, in the Bronx, where Duke Ellington and Miles Davis also are
buried.</TE>
<TE>   The band, meanwhile, paraded away, its lusty music becoming
fainter with each step, until only the beat of the drum rumbled
softly in the distance.</TE>

<HD>Convenience Stores to Tap Chinese Market</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Two of Japan's largest convenience store chains--Seven-Eleven and
FamilyMart--plan to bring their 24-hour, one-stop shopping to China
as early as next year, a newspaper reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which bought the U.S. 7-Eleven franchise
in 1991, plans to open 500 stores in China over the next five years,
according to the Japanese business daily Nikkei Shimbun. It will open
its first store in Beijing next year.</LD>
<LD>   The Seven-Eleven move will be a joint venture with Uni-President
Group, a Taiwanese company that operates Seven-Eleven stores in
Taiwan. It also is one of the island's largest investors in mainland
China.</LD>
<TE>   FamilyMart Co., Japan's third-largest chain, intends to open 300
stores in China by 2010, with the first planned for Shanghai. It
already has stores in Taiwan and Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   The Nikkei Shimbun said the companies want to tap China's rapidly
expanding market of consumers. The companies' officials were
unavailable for comment Sunday.</TE>

<HD>AOL Bracing for Release, Revamp</HD>
<DH>Net: Firm to launch 8.0 next month. Meanwhile, new CEO may
reshuffle some top managers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DULLES, Va.</DL>
<LD>At America Online headquarters these days, there's a mix of
excitement and anxiety.</LD>
<LD>   After enduring one of the roughest stretches in the Internet
company's history, employees are preparing to launch next month the
latest software version of AOL's proprietary online service, AOL 8.0.
Throughout the company's Dulles offices, signs encourage workers to
test the beta version to help find bugs and remind them that "Members
Rule." A mock construction site in the lobby counts down the days
until launch.</LD>
<LD>   But to many, the more important date will come as soon as this
week, when the newly installed Chief Executive Jonathan Miller is
expected to announce a companywide restructuring.</LD>
<TE>   No more layoffs are expected, but some senior managers probably
will be shuffled around, perhaps leading to more departures,
according to an AOL official. Miller also may tinker with certain
units, such as the broadband division, in an effort to show Wall
Street that the company is taking high-speed Internet service
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   And the business-affairs unit, whose head, David Colburn, recently
was fired, will be disbanded and workers reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner Inc. have plummeted 59% this year amid
slowing subscriber growth, an advertising slump and an ongoing
criminal investigation into accounting practices and some of the
deals struck by the business-affairs unit. Miller is the third top
executive to lead the online company over the last five months.</TE>
<TE>   Inside and outside the company, attention is beginning to shift
toward the new software release. AOL badly needs to hit a home run
with 8.0.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the fickle market and the company's unclear path to
broadband, it's important for AOL to implement this correctly," said
Denise Garcia, an analyst at Gartner G2.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, AOL could use some good news.</TE>
<TE>   The new version includes 100 new features that allow members to
personalize the look and feel of the service and update e-mail and
chat features. Miller, who took the helm last month, arrived too late
to give much input into AOL 8.0, but last week he was briefed on AOL
9.0, which is underway.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting the buzz back in the brand," said Jimmy De Castro,
who heads AOL's interactive services group and does not expect his
duties to change in the restructuring. Upon his arrival in April, De
Castro--at the urging of David Gang, executive vice president of
product marketing--redoubled the company's efforts on AOL 8.0 to
include more sweeping changes than originally planned.</TE>
<TE>   A former radio programmer, De Castro said AOL can no longer get by
on just making the Internet easier to use.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't win on ease anymore. We can't win on simple. We have to
win on features," De Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   To him, that means programming AOL more like a TV show, whether
it's a Sept. 11 tribute or offering an exclusive performance by Mick
Jagger.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's release of version 7.0 was met with tepid reviews. At
the time, AOL still was focusing its energy on signing ad deals and
finding ways to partner with its sister companies in the newly merged
AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials now acknowledge that the last few software upgrades
offered too little in the way of new features. As the No. 1 Internet
provider, with about 28 million users, AOL had been afraid to make
changes that might upset subscribers, Gang said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a comfort zone," he said. "But we've put a lot more
money and energy into this launch than we have in the past. It's way
better."</TE>
<TE>   New features include six new themed welcome screens, individual
sounds and icons to represent users' instant messages, tighter
parental controls that tell which Web sites their children visit and
the ability to search chat conversations by keywords.</TE>
<TE>   In response to member complaints about being unexpectedly logged
off, AOL 8.0 features a new reconnect feature that automatically
redials and returns users to whatever Web site they were visiting.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the launch of 8.0 has provided AOL employees with
a much-needed diversion from the constant management changes and
sagging stock price, which has left many employee stock options
underwater.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great rallying point," Gang said.</TE>
<TE>   AOL also is gearing up for another round with Microsoft, which has
many features similar to AOL's on its own MSN service.</TE>
<TE>   MSN's latest version features new parental controls, a download
manager for easier file downloads and expanded e-mail features that
permit the use of graphics and photos in e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   MSN, which has about 8 million U.S. users, also is offering a
TrueSwitch service to AOL members, helping them close their old
accounts, move their address books and e-mail to the new MSN account
and even forward mail from their old AOL accounts for 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   AOL fired back recently, announcing that its latest AOL software
for Apple computers will no longer include the Microsoft Internet
Explorer Web browser, which AOL had used exclusively since 1996.
Instead, AOL is using its own Netscape Gecko browser for AOL service
on Macintosh machines.</TE>

<LD>Here's a look at some of the features in AOL's 8.0 version, scheduled
for launch next month.</LD>
<LD>   More personalization--Users can choose among six new welcome
screens, with themes ranging from kids to nightlife. Users can select
among scores of icons (or use a personal photo) to represent
themselves in instant messages and pick distinct sounds (various
bells, a cow's moo, etc.) to alert instant-messaging partners to
their messages.</LD>
<LD>   E-mail--New spam filters make it easier to block or hide bulk
e-mail or e-mail from unknown senders. An e-mail sender can be added
to an address book with one click. Automatic messages alert senders
when users are away or unable to respond. There is no forwarding or
folders, but those features may be included next year.</LD>
<TE>   Music--CD-quality sound on AOL Radio. Instant-messaging partners
can listen to the same music at the same time. But the long-delayed
MusicNet subscription service won't be offered until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Chat--Sign up to be automatically matched with other users based
on similar interests listed in member profiles. Real-time searches of
conversations in AOL chat rooms by keywords (such as "Iraq invasion"
or "Martha Stewart") allow subscribers to be linked with chat
sessions of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Alerts--Expanded alerts to remind users of calendar items, TV
shows, birthdays, etc. New Caller-Alert notifies users of incoming
telephone calls while users are online and records a message from the
caller, which is played as an audio file.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Version--First major overhaul of AOL software specifically
targeted at Mac users since 1996. Moves standard toolbars and
drop-down menus to places where Mac users would expect to find them.
Removes Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the standard Web browser and
replaces it with AOL's own Netscape Gecko. Uses Apple's QuickTime for
video streaming, rather than Real Player.</TE>

<HD>Report: Arab World Stagnant</HD>
<DH>Middle East: Reforms are urgently needed to keep the
economies from falling further behind, a private group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARE NULLIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>Archaic, inefficient and inward-looking state policies have condemned
most Arab economies to prolonged stagnation despite relatively rich
natural resources and high investment rates, a report released Sunday
said.</LD>
<LD>   The World Economic Forum report said reforms were urgently needed
to open the region to outside investment, privatize state-dominated
economies, improve the quality of government, tackle corruption and
modernize the education system.</LD>
<LD>   "The Arab world has suffered a 20-year growth slowdown," concluded
the report, firmly blaming governments rather than outside
influences.</LD>
<TE>   The Arab World Competitiveness Report focused on 16 countries and
was published to coincide with a two-day meeting of Arab business and
political leaders organized by the World Economic Forum, a nonprofit
organization funded by corporate contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world has relied far too heavily on capital accumulation
as the engine for growth and has been left behind by globalization,
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, the region accounted for 10.7% of world exports. In 2001,
it was down to 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "The export structure of the region as a whole is still primarily
based either on its absolute advantage in petroleum products, as in
the case of the major oil-producing countries like Kuwait and Qatar,
or on its comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufactures, as
in the case of Morocco and Tunisia," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Successful export diversification, the report said, hinges on a
long-term strategy based on promoting domestic entrepreneurship and
encouraging foreign direct investment.</TE>
<TE>   But would-be businesses suffered from stifling regulatory burdens,
and potential investors were deterred by Middle East tensions and by
excessive government regulation and protection, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The report described private investment in the Arab world as
"insufficient and inefficient."</TE>
<TE>   "Although the banking system is the most important part of the
financial sector, its extraordinary inefficiency does not lead it to
allocate national savings to their most productive uses," it said.
"Without proper channeling of savings into productive and efficient
investment, economic growth is impossible."</TE>
<TE>   "With the exception of Egypt, Oman, Syria and Tunisia,
productivity growth in the Arab world has been negative; that is, the
efficiency of the economy has markedly deteriorated," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the rest of the world, the Middle East has little
access to telecommunications, partly because of the limited efforts
at reform in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the region had huge labor reserves, there was a dearth
of systems to prepare young people for the rapidly evolving global
economy, it said. In most countries, women were marginalized. About
40% of the Arab world is younger than 15.</TE>

<HD>Car Buyers Believe They're Getting More for Their Money</HD>
<DH>Survey: No-interest financing, better quality have led to
heightened perception. Toyota wins in six of 17 categories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Incentives by auto makers after last September's terrorist attacks
and higher-quality cars and trucks have elevated buyers' perception
of their vehicles' value, according to an annual survey by an
automotive consulting group to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota Motor Corp. had the most winners of the 17 vehicle
categories with six, and Korean brands had three, continuing their
improvement in the so-called total value index calculated by San
Diego-based Strategic Vision.</LD>
<LD>   "The Korean brands gained a firm foothold," the study says.
"Backed by a strong warranty and improved products, Hyundai and Kia
offer their owners real value, not just cheap pricing."</LD>
<TE>   The index takes into account overall quality and the
purchasing/ownership experience and adds factors that can be measured
such as incentives, affordability, standard equipment and warranties,
as well as "perceived resale values, perception of good durability
and reliability, fuel economy and economy of operation," said
Strategic Vision Vice President Dan Gorrell.</TE>
<TE>   "Value has increased because of better product and immediate
pricing gains from things like zero-percent financing and other
things manufacturers have rushed to provide after Sept 11."</TE>
<TE>   Many auto makers introduced interest-free loans last September to
boost sales, which plummeted after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The free financing, which lowered costs to consumers by thousands
of dollars per vehicle, and other deals such as longer war- ranties
and early lease cancellations gave a strong boost to auto sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Three in particular have continued interest-free loans at
various times in the last year and are engaged in another round of
such financing.</TE>
<TE>   The Mini Cooper, which is made by BMW and went on the market this
year, came in with the highest overall score.</TE>
<TE>   "A vehicle from the BMW family starting under $20,000 gets people
really excited," Gorrell said.</TE>
<TE>   It was followed by the Volkswagen New Beetle and the Lexus LS 430
luxury sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the deep and wide-ranging incentives, American brands did
not come in at the top of any category except that of larger cars,
which was made up only of U.S. brands. The Oldsmobile Aurora took
first place in the category. General Motors Corp. is discontinuing
the Oldsmobile brand because of poor sales.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota dominated the truck categories, taking top honors among
medium, large and luxury sport utility vehicles as well as among
compact and full-size pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota also won in the luxury car category with one of its Lexus
models.</TE>
<TE>   A surprise came in the minivan category, won by the Kia Sedona, a
relatively new entry to the segment, where minivans by Honda Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. generally top the quality and popularity
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Sedona it's not resale value but the overall experience,
which is boosted by its warranty," Gorrell said, noting Kia's
10-year, 100,000-mile warranty. "So it got its position through a
variety of factors. You pull the warranty plug, and a lot of that
equation falls away."</TE>
<TE>   The sense of getting more for one's money is a key factor in the
research firm's total value index study, first conducted in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "When consumers feel they got their money's worth, it's about a
lot more than price," Strategic Vision President Darrel Edwards said
in the study.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel they're winners when they get a lot for their money, so
the quality of the ownership experience has to be calculated into the
value equation."</TE>
<TE>   Strategic Vision surveyed more than 76,000 purchasers who bought
their cars and trucks between October 2001 and March 2002 and have
owned their vehicles for 90 days or more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   And the 2002 Winners Are ...</TE>
<TE>   A study by Strategic Vision found that incentives offered by auto
makers over the last 12 months have helped boost new owners'
perception of the value of their cars. The winners for the 2002 model
year are:</TE>

<HD>Boeing Facing Roadblocks on Airport Safety</HD>
<DH>Security: Hired to install explosive-detection machines,
firm is hampered by a lack of places to put them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN BERR</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. was given what some call a near-impossible task three
months ago of helping the U.S. government meet a congressional
mandate to install thousands of machines to detect explosives in
luggage by Dec. 31.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Security Administration, created after the
Sept. 11 attacks, won't have enough machines ready in as many as 30
airports, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said last week.</LD>
<LD>   While early stumbling blocks included getting manufacturers to
make enough machines in time, Boeing and subcontractors such as
Siemens that were hired to install the devices can't find places to
put them. An explosive-detection machine, which uses CAT-scan
technology to analyze bags, is the size of a minivan.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing's team has a "tremendously difficult job," said Hans Weber,
an aviation-security consultant based in San Diego. "Every airport
has its own design and operational idiosyncrasies."</TE>
<TE>   Denver International Airport, with 36 million passengers a year,
would need to install 50 of the systems.</TE>
<TE>   Even with more than 6 million square feet of space, that would
violate local building codes, said Amy Bourgeron, Denver's deputy
manager of aviation. "There would be no room for the passengers," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other airports will have to reinforce floors to support the 6-to
8-ton machines, and McCarren International Airport in Las Vegas will
need additional electric supplies for its terminals, said Randall
Walker, director of aviation for Clark County, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Miami International Airport's security chief, Mark Forare, said
retail space would have to be scaled back to accommodate the
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing told Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport it
needs to build additions to two of its terminals, said Ernest DeSoto,
a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   As of Aug. 1, only 217 of the 1,100 explosive-detection systems
U.S. airports need had been installed, according to the
Transportation Department. About 275 of the 6,000 smaller machines
required to detect explosive traces were in use.</TE>
<TE>   As of Aug. 20, Boeing's team had visited 250 airports to discuss
equipment location with officials, according to the Transportation
Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Boeing has submitted proposals to the Transportation
Security Administration for 62 of the airports, said Fernando
Vivanco, a Boeing spokesman. The government has yet to approve any of
the proposals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   TSA spokesman Robert Johnson declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing expects to be able to complete the work on time, said
Richard Stephens, the Boeing executive in charge of the project. He
wouldn't provide more details.</TE>
<TE>   Others aren't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Poole of the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation public
policy research group estimates that the companies may need six more
months.</TE>
<TE>   "TSA doesn't have the staff to review all of these" plans, Poole
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plans may be moot if the machines never arrive. Only two
companies, InVision Technologies Inc. and L-3 Communications Holdings
Inc., are government-certified makers of the explosive-detection
machines. InVision has hired a contractor to help it fill the orders,
InVision Chief Operating Officer Donald Mattson said. L-3 spokesman
Evan Goetz declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the government's need to respond to security concerns
after Sept. 11 led it to expect too much too soon and to rely on
unproven technology and small companies with little capacity to match
large orders for equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing was awarded a $508-million contract in June to help fulfill
the congressional mandate.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the deadline, the government will have to use a
combination of $1-million explosive-detection machines and manual
trace detectors. Smaller airports may get trace detectors only.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Announces Management Overhaul</HD>
<DH>Finance: The changes amid ongoing probes include the
removal of Salomon unit's chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup announced major management changes on Sunday that
apparently are aimed at speeding up resolution of investigations into
the bank's handling of loans to Enron Corp. and of initial stock
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial institution, said that
Michael Carpenter has been removed as chairman and chief executive of
the Global Corporate and Investment Bank unit, which operates the
Salomon Smith Barney brokerage.</LD>
<LD>   He will be replaced by Charles Prince, 52, who has been Citi's
chief operating officer.</LD>
<TE>   Carpenter will head Citi's Global Investment Group, which manages
more than $100 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The changes were announced in a rare Sunday statement.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement, Citigroup Chairman and Chief Executive Sanford
I. Weill referred indirectly to the investigations underway, saying:
"As a result of recent events, we have recognized that we need to
reexamine our business practices and make appropriate changes."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "While important changes have already been made under
Mike Carpenter's leadership--including important reforms in research
and structured finance--we are today announcing steps to accelerate
this process of change and to assure that Citigroup is a leader in
setting the standards for appropriate business conduct and corporate
governance."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the management changes, the bank also said that its
board of directors approved the formation of a Business Practices
Committee, reporting directly to Weill. Citi had announced last month
that it planned to set up the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup has faced a growing list of legal and regulatory
challenges, including federal and state investigations of its
handling of loans to energy trader Enron, which collapsed last year.
Government officials have alleged that Enron used the financing to
conceal its deepening debt.</TE>
<TE>   There also have been allegations in Congress that Citi's
investment unit, Salomon Smith Barney, doled out shares of hot
initial public offerings of stock to WorldCom Inc. executives in
exchange for investment banking business. And, critics have charged,
its analysts were not operating independently.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nation's leading bank analysts, Michael Mayo of
Prudential Securities, last week downgraded the company's shares to
"sell" from "hold" and said Citigroup's legal exposure could run as
high as $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's statement, Weill made no specific reference to the
allegations. He said, however, that "there are certain industry
practices that we should all be concerned about, and although we have
found nothing illegal, looking back, we can see that certain of our
activities do not reflect the way we believe business should be done.
That should never be the case, and I am sorry for that."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said Prince has been with the company or its predecessor
for 23 years. He previously was general counsel.</TE>

<HD>Lessons From the Recovery</HD>
<DH>Though the comeback was painful, IQ Financial Systems says
the firm is better for it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Each time news reached Edward Ho that another missing employee was
found safe, he would open his spiral-bound notebook and cross off the
name.</LD>
<LD>   There was little else that Ho, a director and soon to be chief
executive of IQ Financial Systems Inc., could do to help, stuck as he
was on a business trip to Japan while the horror of Sept. 11, 2001,
played out in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Ho opened his battered tan notebook last week for the first time
in nearly a year. There, in his cramped handwriting, amid phone
numbers and to-do lists, were the four names he was never able to
cross off: Melissa Doi, David Rathkey, Karen Schmidt and Courtney
Walcott.</LD>
<TE>   "It was very difficult," Ho said. "In a company this size,
everybody knows everybody."</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,800 people lost their lives in the World Trade Center
assault. Beyond the human toll was a shock wave of economic
devastation that hit New York City's securities, tourism and
commercial real estate industries with full force. Property damage
and loss of revenue has been estimated as high as $80 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The attack blew a $5-billion hole in the city budget, largely due
to lost tax receipts. More than 80,000 jobs were lost, including an
estimated 13,000 shifted to other locations, according the Fiscal
Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of businesses failed, but IQ Financial Systems, or IQFS,
survived. Although the comeback trail has been painful, a year after
the disaster, Ho and his colleagues say the company may be stronger
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Among the lessons they have learned are that dislocated workers
need to get back together quickly to recover their sense of shared
purpose; no manager should be without an up-to-date list of employee
phone numbers and e-mail addresses; customers need reassurance nearly
as much and as soon as workers do; and, despite the outpouring of
support that a crisis may bring, business is still business, and not
everyone wishes you well.</TE>
<TE>   IQFS makes software that helps banks and securities firms manage
their commercial-loan portfolios. The private firm is about 70% owned
by Deutsche Bank's venture-capital arm and the rest by company
management. At the time of the attack, IQFS was based on the 83rd
floor of 2 World Trade Center, the second tower to be struck and the
first to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Many Avoided Attacks</TE>
<TE>   Of about 110 IQFS employees who worked in the trade center, Ho
estimated that no more than 40 reached the office that morning. That
was not unusual. Some workers often began their day at client sites.
Many also took advantage of flexible starting hours to cut commuting
time.</TE>
<TE>   Two people who did reach the office were sales manager Lisa Stone
and software development chief Ken Katz, who told their stories in
interviews last week. Like others who made their way down from the
83rd floor, they have harrowing memories of seeing the explosion and
fire in the north tower and of escaping through crowded stairways
while their own building shuddered from the impact of the second
plane.</TE>
<TE>   Katz walked north amid the dust and fluttering paper, finally
catching a cab and persuading the driver to take him all the way home
to Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   On her way home to the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Stone stopped
at a SoHo publishing house where a friend worked. She recalled people
staring at her because, dressed in a sharp suit for a client meeting
that afternoon, she somehow arrived "without a hair out of place."</TE>
<TE>   Ho, who had watched the attacks on CNN in his Tokyo hotel room,
quickly began the frustrating task of trying to reach colleagues in
New York by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "About one in 20 calls was going through," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was near midnight in Tokyo, and it would be the first of five
straight sleepless nights for Ho. With international flights
grounded, it would take him that long to get home.</TE>
<TE>   Phone service was spotty in New York as well, but IQFS executives
managed to contact one another that afternoon and evening.</TE>
<TE>   They realized their first task was to determine who was missing.
Nobody seemed to have a complete employee list, but everyone had at
least a few names and numbers. By pooling their information, they
cobbled together a phone and e-mail tree, assigning each manager a
group of employees to contact.</TE>
<TE>   It was important to be sensitive and not bombard anxious or
grieving families with calls, Ho said, but it also was crucial not to
rely on second-or third-hand information about people's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to know, 'Did you personally talk to so-and-so?' before
we could say for sure they were safe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Within two days, the list of missing employees in Ho's notebook
had shrunk to fewer than 20 and by the weekend, to four, the number
that became final.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Need for Foresight</TE>
<TE>   Even as they were arranging for grief counselors and dealing with
stricken relatives, IQFS managers realized they needed to look ahead.</TE>
<TE>   While making his rounds of phone calls, Katz discovered that after
hearing about co-workers' well-being, most people had the same
question: "They were asking, 'What's next?' Did they have a company
to come back to?"</TE>
<TE>   It was hardly an idle question. IQFS did not have a backup work
site. Its only other U.S. location was in Williamsburg, Va. The
hardware in that office would play a crucial role in restoring the
company's computer systems, but it was not an option as a
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Before thinking about a new workspace, Ho realized IQFS needed to
quickly reassure its customers. The giant banks and brokerages that
buy IQFS' complex software packages also rely on the firm for ongoing
support and consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 13, Ho sent a two-page memo to customers, describing the
recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the grief and the turmoil that [IQFS employees] are
currently experiencing, they have, as a team, stepped in to restart
the company's operations very rapidly," Ho wrote. "These individuals
are the foundation of IQFS and the reason why you should feel
confident that your company is in the best of care. We may be down,
but we're not out by any stretch."</TE>
<TE>   USC business professor Ian I. Mitroff, a crisis-management expert,
applauded IQFS for quickly reaching out to customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Vanguard organizations are always aware of their most important
external stakeholders," Mitroff said. "You need to send a signal to
the marketplace saying, 'We're still in business.' "</TE>
<TE>   IQFS' source code, the DNA of its software products, had been
backed up on tapes that were stored off-site. Using the backup tapes
and the computers in Virginia, technicians were able to get things
running again, but it took several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During those first few weeks, nearly all employees were working
from home--that is, those who had work to do. Some of Katz's crew who
work directly with the source code could only wait.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to contribute, not sit home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unifying Employees</TE>
<TE>   Managers organized several phone-in conferences to give workers a
chance to reestablish connections with the company and one another,
and to blow off steam. There also was a well-attended barbecue in
early October at an executive's home.</TE>
<TE>   Employees also gathered more somberly at memorial services for the
four deceased co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa C. Doi, 32, whom one customer recalled admiringly as "a
take-charge woman," was a passionate amateur ballet dancer. An
understanding boss, she once helped a subordinate through a difficult
pregnancy by letting her work from home some days.</TE>
<TE>   David A.J. Rathkey, 47, the only married victim, left behind his
wife and three young children. British born, he was a tea drinker and
an avid outdoorsman. He passed his love of soccer on to his children,
whom he coached in youth leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Karen H. Schmidt, 42, who "never missed a deadline" in her work
with the company's risk-management software, was renowned as a baker
of cookies. She often organized bridal and baby showers and
constantly bragged about her nieces.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney W. Walcott, 37, a golf enthusiast and a New York Jets
fan, was a star defensive back on the Hofstra University football
squad. Devoutly religious, he worked through his church as a mentor
to teenage boys.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, those early weeks were easier for the sales and
customer-support staffs because they could continue calling on
clients, who showered them with sympathy and encouragement, according
to Stone, the sales manager.</TE>
<TE>   IQFS also began hearing from customers that it was getting
bad-mouthed by a competitor, Ho said.</TE>
<TE>   "They went out and told our clients we were history," he said. "I
won't ever forget that."</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the tactic may have backfired. IQFS employees used
the incident as a rallying point.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, in late September, the company scored a huge
emotional victory by signing a $7-million contract with Merrill
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   The giant brokerage chose IQFS as its vendor after an exhaustive,
five-month selection process and scheduled a contract signing for
Sept. 11, according to Paul Fox, the Merrill executive in charge of
the selection.</TE>
<TE>   "The only business decision I had was to make sure the source code
could be reconstructed," Fox said last week. "Was there an element of
trust? Yes, but they had earned it. There was no aspect of charity in
the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the signing was a strong expression of Merrill's faith that
the battered company could deliver on the contract, and it was a big
boost to morale, according to Stone.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled the kick-off meeting, at which IQFS staffers met
their counterparts at Merrill Lynch, as especially festive.</TE>
<TE>   As October approached, IQFS employees were impatient to get back
to work in a permanent space. It seemed to many that the relocation
was taking forever, Ho said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding a New Location</TE>
<TE>   Finding new space was not easy, especially because employees had
expressed very strong criteria for new headquarters, according to Ho.</TE>
<TE>   The new office could not be in a prominent landmark building, nor
anywhere near ground zero. It had to be a low-rise with exceptionally
good fire-safety characteristics. For budgetary reasons, Ho added
another condition: It could not be north of 30th Street, where rent
is exorbitant.</TE>
<TE>   Ho hired six commercial brokers and personally looked at 26
potential locations. He passed up a "beautiful" space being vacated
by a much larger technology firm because it was right on top of
Madison Square Garden--too high-profile for his employees.</TE>
<TE>   The company finally settled on a fifth-floor office in a
nondescript brownstone building on 23rd Street. Ho visited the
22,000-square-foot space five or six times with various groups of
employees to satisfy their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In late October, IQFS moved into its new headquarters, taking over
computer equipment that Ho said he purchased for "25 cents on the
dollar" from the previous tenant, a struggling dot-com company.</TE>
<TE>   During the first 10 months in its new space, IQFS experienced a
few layoffs and some strategic restructuring that involved selling
off some product lines.</TE>
<TE>   In a management change that was in the works before Sept. 11, Ho
was installed as chief executive in September.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a tough economy, the company's sales probably will be flat
with last year's $35 million, and it will maintain the profitability
that it achieved for the first time in 2001, Ho said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, of Merrill Lynch, said he admires the company's
determination.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people had to find ways to be better because they didn't
have all the old tools they used to rely on," he said. "I would
definitely say they are stronger for it."</TE>

<HD>Retirement Account Safeguards Founder</HD>
<DH>Legislation: As public outrage fades, Congress is easing up
on proposals to limit holdings of employers' stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN WEISMAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress has all but abandoned legislative proposals to ensure that
employee retirement funds are not concentrated in their employers'
stock, after hearing from businesses that vigorously oppose such
restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   The recently devastated retirement accounts of employees at Enron
Corp. and WorldCom Inc. initially fueled a wave of indignation among
lawmakers in Washington and solemn vows to protect their investments.
But the anger that pushed tough new accounting standards past
corporate opponents this summer has already faded, lawmakers and
lobbyists say, allowing businesses to regain their strength on
Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Now, legislation taking shape would allow employees with company
stock in their retirement accounts to sell it after three years of
employment, would encourage companies to provide more investment
advice and would prevent corporate executives from selling company
stock in secret or in periods when employees are forbidden to sell.</LD>
<TE>   But unlike federal laws covering traditional pension plans, the
new 401(k) legislation almost certainly will not mandate
diversification of investments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that concerned," said Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lost the fight over the
accounting bill but joined a campaign against tougher pension
measures.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-rights groups, unions and retiree advocates, which were
confident that the toll on workers from this year's huge bankruptcies
would force real change to the rules, expressed outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is appalling, and I think the American people would be
appalled if they knew," said Karen Friedman, director of policy
strategies at the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group that
supports such mandates. "It's time for Congress to have some
backbone."</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of Enron and WorldCom rattled stock markets and shook
investor confidence. But those who were hurt most might have been
employees who had invested virtually all of their retirement savings
in company stock, then lost their jobs and their nest eggs at once.</TE>
<TE>   Through the bull market of the 1990s, companies became
increasingly reliant on bolstering their employees' retirement
accounts with their own stock, by matching employee contributions
with stock and by allowing employees to buy into the companies on
their own. Of the $698 billion in assets that publicly traded
companies and their employees invested in 401(k) plans by 1998, $273
billion--nearly 40%--was in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   In the bear market of 2002, such investments have been disastrous
for many workers. Osman Guven, an employee of WorldCom and its
predecessor companies for 31 years, had a relatively diversified
401(k) account in the early 1990s. But, the San Jose systems
administrator said, he heard the pitch from executives about the
company's future. He read the memos from then-Chief Executive Bernard
J. Ebbers touting WorldCom's boundless potential, and he saw the
company's stock price rise.</TE>
<TE>   He slowly shifted his investments into WorldCom, until his entire
retirement account was bound up in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   On June 28, he was laid off with tens of thousands of other
WorldCom employees. Not only had he lost his job, he lost $380,000 in
retirement savings, as WorldCom stock plunged.</TE>
<TE>   "I get up in the middle of the night saying, 'How am I going to
rebuild?' " Guven said. "I'm 57 years old. How am I going to restart
my whole life?"</TE>
<TE>   In response to such stories, Congress and President Bush vowed
earlier this year to secure private retirement accounts. Bush
proposed three broad principles: give employees the right to sell
company-issued stock, provide more investor education and make sure
employees have the same rights as corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) went
further, moving to cap retirement-fund holdings of an employee's
company stock at 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate lobbyists, Republican leaders and some Democrats
strenuously objected. Then Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) came up
with a considerably weaker proposal: A company could either match
401(k) contributions with company stock, or it could allow employees
to invest in company stock on their own, but not both. But the idea
was opposed not only by Republicans but also by Sen. Max Baucus
(D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Business
lobbyists said it would raise costs enough to convince some employers
to reduce company contributions or withdraw their 401(k) plans
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups say granting company stock makes employees more
loyal. By using company stock instead of cash to match employee
contributions, firms avoid dipping into their reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is trying to preserve his proposal by giving employers a
large escape clause. Under the most recent compromise, companies
would be allowed to match with company stock and let employees invest
on their own if they also offer a traditional pension plan, offer
independent investment advice or require employees to approve the
purchase of company stock on top of a stock match.</TE>
<TE>   Baucus said the legislation taking shape in the Senate would
change investment behavior without mandates. The bill would require
that companies advise employees against over-concentration in any one
stock and warn them when they are over-concentrated. The bill also
would mandate quarterly benefit statements and would make it easier
for companies to offer employees independent investment advice.</TE>
<TE>   David Certner, a lobbyist for senior citizens advocacy group AARP,
has his doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, while you might have made some improvements
to the law, you will not have substantially changed the environment
that created the problem to begin with," he said.</TE>

<HD>Disney Raises Admission Prices for Its Florida Parks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The price for an adult single-day ticket to any of Disney's four
central Florida theme parks was raised $2 on Sunday to $50 before
taxes, making the parks the area's most expensive by a nickel.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was timed for the end of the summer vacation season,
said Disney spokesman Rick Sylvain.</LD>
<LD>   The company also is raising the price of multiday passes but said
it will offer a discount to visitors who purchase them in advance.</LD>
<TE>   The price of a four-day pass bought at the park will rise $7, to
$199, but will be available for $192 if purchased online, over the
phone, at Disney Stores outside the state or through a travel agent.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that through Nov. 17, Florida residents will be
able to buy a four-day pass good for admission to all Disney parks
for $109.</TE>
<TE>   Disney last raised prices in January 2001.</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>China's appetite for dollar deposits appears to have played a
significant role in helping the United States plug its trade gap over
the last three years, according to a report by the Bank for
International Settlements.</LD>
<LD>   The Swiss-based BIS, a forum for the world's central banks,
calculated in its quarterly report that rising dollar deposits,
together with declining dollar loans, generated a foreign currency
surplus of $75 billion in mainland Chinese banks in the 1999-2001
period.</LD>
<LD>   It said this sum, which beats the $67-billion rise in China's
official foreign exchange reserves over the same period, has flowed
in large part into U.S. debt markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Taken together, the increase in foreign currency liquidity in
China's banking system and higher foreign exchange reserves suggest
that Chinese bank managers and official reserves managers needed to
find uses for over $140 billion during this period," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese banking system's dollar surpluses have joined
increases in official reserves in flowing into BIS reporting banks
and U.S. debt markets."</TE>
<TE>   The level of overseas demand for U.S. assets is closely monitored
by currency analysts, given signs that foreigners' voracious appetite
for U.S. assets has begun to fade.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. needs to attract capital inflows of $1 billion every day
to offset its current account deficit and keep its currency stable.</TE>

<HD>Leisure Spending Remains Steady</HD>
<DH>Consumption: The total dollar amount has not dropped
despite the sluggish economy, but buying patterns are different, a
survey shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer spending across the entertainment industry is holding steady
amid an economy that remains sluggish, according to a new survey.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers in the U.S. spent an estimated $35.1 billion in the
first half of this year on music, movies, books, theme parks and
other leisure outlets, according to data from Nielsen Entertainment's
entertainment index.</LD>
<LD>   "What we really see is there seems to be always a percentage of
someone's available dollars that will be spent on entertainment,"
said Rob Sisco, general manager of Nielsen's Retail Entertainment
Information division. "We're not seeing any evidence of fewer dollars
being spent."</LD>
<TE>   The data are compiled from 3,000 completed monthly telephone and
Internet surveys given to U.S. consumers ages 12 and older.</TE>
<TE>   The surveys are weighted according to geographic balance and
demographic information.</TE>
<TE>   Although consumers lavished about $17 billion each quarter of this
year on books, CDs and other items, the data show that some forms of
entertainment appear to be taking dollars from others. For example,
the survey suggests that DVD and home video sales and rentals are
cutting into music sales, Sisco said.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that rentals and sales of DVDs and home videos
captured 23% of the entertainment market for the first six months of
the year--the biggest category.</TE>
<TE>   For the six months ended in June, books ranked as the
second-most-popular entertainment category, claiming 15.6% of
entertainment spending, or $5.5 billion. Music ranked third,
capturing 14.9%, and movies garnered 10.2%, according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Other Nielsen data show DVD and video sales rising while music
sales are slumping.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence we see is people are still going to stores to buy a
CD, but instead of buying a second CD, they're picking up a DVD,"
Sisco said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the steady performance of spending in the entertainment
sector during the first six months of 2002, the survey shows, there
are some indications that the cloudy economic climate is weighing on
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Political events and the current condition of the country's
economy are pressuring consumers to be more careful with their
expenses, driving them to avoid impulse purchasing," according to
Nielsen's analysis.</TE>

<HD>Leaders Are Missing for Long-Term Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where are the market's leaders?</LD>
<LD>   That's what many investment strategists are asking as they try to
determine whether stocks finally hit bottom in midsummer.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which rallied 20.7%
from its five-year low July 23 to Aug. 22, has lost 7.1% since then,
raising the threat of another leg downward for the 29-month-long bear
market.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks rallied Friday, but major indexes still lost ground for the
week. Within the S&amp;P 500, 78 stock industry groups fell for the week,
while 26 rose.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle of August everybody was screaming, 'We've finally
seen the bottom, now we're going to the moon!' " said John Bollinger,
head of Bollinger Capital Management in Manhattan Beach. "How are we
going to the moon if there are no dogs pulling the sled?"</TE>
<TE>   A new bull market needs strong leadership in the form of gains
across many industry sectors, analysts say. But in the last four
weeks, 62 S&amp;P 500 industry groups have fallen, while 41 have risen.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, investors have shown a renewed aversion to risk in
recent weeks, favoring the kind of "defensive" stocks not usually
associated with a robust bull move, said Kevin Marder, a Los
Angeles-based strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   Leading groups over the last four weeks have included such
typically defensive sectors as home improvement retailers, gold
miners and brewers. Also, snapbacks in such deeply depressed groups
as movie companies (mainly AOL Time Warner Inc.), airlines and
wireless services have made them top performers for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the technology and industrial issues that often have
led at the start of bull markets have been among the worst performers
over the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's symptomatic of the whole problem: The speculative sentiment
that you need to see early in a new bull market simply is not there,"
Marder said. Defensive stocks can be leaders, as they were in 1988
and 1989, but generally "not in the healthiest, most durable bull
markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, worries about the market's staying power are
prompting some investors to take paper gains quickly, strategists
say. That is making it difficult for leading sectors to stay leaders
and build momentum and interest.</TE>
<TE>   The home-building sector, for example, a pillar of strength
earlier in the year, has weakened lately. S&amp;P's home-building stock
index is off about 14% from its all-time peak in late June. More
weakness in the sector could be a sign that the market is
anticipating a return to recession, Marder said.</TE>
<TE>   After the broad market hit its trough July 23, health care and
financial services stocks showed strength initially, said Ron
Rowland, editor of All Star Fund Trader, an Austin, Texas-based
newsletter. Health care stocks have faltered recently, however, and
financial shares have turned mixed, with banks and savings and loans
strong while brokerages slump.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, few individual stocks are breaking out to substantial
new highs, Marder said. H&amp;R Block Inc., for example, edged past its
52-week closing high Aug. 19, then topped out at $53.15 the next day.
The stock had pulled back to $50.91 as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "If institutional investors had more conviction, you would expect
to see a stock like that run for another 15% to 20%," Marder said.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger called the market's lack of clear leadership "the best
argument for why we probably haven't hit the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the midsummer lows hold, many analysts say
that when the next bull market begins in earnest, investors should
not expect the former leaders--namely technology and telecom--to set
the pace again.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, semiconductor stocks were considered market leaders,
Rowland said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still 'leaders'--but to the downside now," he said,
noting that the so-called SOX index of 17 major semiconductor stocks
has set a string of new lows since July 23, including one Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which rallied 18% from its low
Aug. 5 through Aug. 22, has slumped 9% since then.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, it's rare for the biggest winners of one bull market
to be the leaders of the next. In many cases, fallen stocks never
return to their old highs--or take a painfully long time to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola Co. did not overtake its 1973 peak until more than 12
years later, Marder said. "And that was a company with earnings," he
added, in a jab at the tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger said that in addition to the fundamental problems tech
and telecom firms face because of the reluctance by corporate
managers to step up capital spending, many of the stocks are still
overvalued even at lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems Inc., for example, trades at a price-to-earnings
multiple of 88 based on analysts' consensus fiscal 2003 profit
estimate of 4 cents a share and Friday's closing stock price of
$3.54. The S&amp;P 500, by comparison, carries a P/E of about 15 based on
2003 earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   If history is a guide, sectors that lagged during the bull market
from 1998 to 2000 but have held up well during the bear market of the
last 2 1/2 years may be among the leaders of the next bull market,
said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Sectors that fit that mold include basic industry, including
chemical and paper producers; capital goods, including machinery
stocks; energy, including oil and gas explorer/producers; and
consumer cyclicals, including auto parts makers.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe said tech may not be able to sustain market leadership
again for the foreseeable future, but the stocks could see a burst of
strength late this year or in 2003, perhaps lasting six months or so,
as hopes for a return to the heady days are revived--albeit just for
a while, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened with the "Nifty Fifty" U.S. blue-chip stocks
in 1975 and with Japanese stocks in 1993, McCabe said.</TE>

<HD>Warner to Offer Movies Online</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Deal with CinemaNow will make selected
titles available for downloading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what appears to be a first for a major Hollywood studio, Warner
Bros. is making a few dozen of its movies available for downloading
through an online video-on-demand service.</LD>
<LD>   The studio is expected to announce a deal today with CinemaNow of
Marina del Rey to make selected new releases and older titles
available for downloading on a temporary basis. The downloads will
come with electronic locks designed to provide 24 hours of unlimited
playback while also deterring users from copying or redistributing
the files.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is the second by Warner Bros. to offer downloadable
movies, but it is the first to make films available.</LD>
<TE>   In August 2001, Warner Bros. joined four other major Hollywood
studios in a venture to provide downloadable movies, dubbed
Movielink, but the long-delayed service is not expected to launch
until late this year.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. already is providing movies online through
Intertainer, a video-on-demand service that works with certain
high-speed Internet connections. But Intertainer does not provide
downloads. Instead, it streams videos, requiring users to stay online
while they watch.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Calman, executive vice president of video on demand and
pay per view for Warner Home Video, said a key factor in the deal was
CinemaNow's anti-piracy technology, which is supplied by Microsoft
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "As we would with any entrant into the area, we investigated their
technology and found it to meet our digital rights management
requirements and reached reasonable economic terms," Calman said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Calman nor CinemaNow would disclose financial terms of the
deal, which runs through the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Marvis, CinemaNow's chief executive, said his company will
have access to any movie that Warner Bros. has the right to offer
through the public Internet, including one of its biggest hits,
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." CinemaNow plans to offer new
releases for $3.99 and older titles, such as "Dial M for Murder" and
"Mars Attacks," for $2.99.</TE>
<TE>   The company made a trial run this year with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Inc., but that deal was limited to two movies.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate having more studios in the near future that are
going to be willing to give us content," Marvis said. "I think
everyone's still trying to figure out the proper business models that
will work in this whole area."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to piracy, picture quality has been a major concern
for studios. The Warner Bros. downloads on CinemaNow will at least
match the image quality of videotape, Marvis said, but as a
consequence, the files will be quite large--400 megabytes to 500 MB.
For a home with the typical high-speed Internet connection, that
means up to two hours spent downloading the file.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate video-on-demand development, Movielink is expected
to announce today that it has chosen IBM Corp. as a key technology
supplier. IBM will manage the computers that store and deliver the
studios' movies through the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Movielink officials said they are counting on IBM, which runs some
of the world's largest Web sites, to help ensure the reliability and
security of its service.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Warner Bros. and MGM, Movielink is owned by Viacom
Inc., Sony Corp. and Vivendi Universal.</TE>

<LD>Potential buyers for U.S. confectionery giant Hershey Foods Corp. are
close to putting their bids on the table, despite ongoing legal
hitches, sources familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   Chocolate makers Cadbury Schweppes of Britain and Nestle of
Switzerland, meanwhile, are close to an agreement on a joint bid for
the company, famous for its Hershey's Kisses and chocolate bars,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts have said the deal, which has attracted attention from
Northfield, Ill.-based Kraft Foods Inc., could net $12 billion or

<TE>   Nestle and Cadbury are planning a deal that would envisage Nestle
buying Hershey and then passing on some brands to the British
confectionery and soft drinks firm, sources close to the talks said.
This would also facilitate regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Cadbury said it would seek to take control of
its own brands licensed to Hershey in the United States as well as
other brands and the means to distribute the products.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Cadbury and Nestle declined to comment on whether
they were in talks.</TE>
<TE>   A Pennsylvania judge last week put the sale of Hershey on hold,
throwing the planned auction of the fabled candy maker in doubt and
preventing any sale until he can determine whether it needs court
approval. However, sources close to Nestle and Cadbury have said the
companies are confident a sale will go through.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan to Comment on the Economy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. stock market will focus on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's comments on the economy before Congress this week and
will pause midweek to mark the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Stock prices are expected to show little change in the first half
of the week, and then react to Greenspan's interpretation of
confusing economic signals as well as new data on wholesale inflation
and retail sales, traders said.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Stock Exchange will delay the opening bell until 8
a.m. PDT to accommodate the thousands of financial professionals
attending tributes and services for the people killed by the air
attacks on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Twin Towers were located about four blocks from the Big Board,
which suffered no physical damage but was silenced for four trading
days.</TE>
<TE>   After the anniversary ceremony, the key event will be Thursday,
when Greenspan testifies before the House Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will be listening for his interpretation of recent,
conflicting economic data, some of which has put the fear of a
"double-dip recession" into the market.</TE>
<TE>   As for other guideposts, there are few significant earnings
announcements scheduled, although there will be several key economic
releases, including the August producer price index on Friday. The
PPI is a measure of inflation at the wholesale level.</TE>

<HD>Intel Hosts Engineers at Developer Forum</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. kicks off a conference for hardware and software
engineers today in Silicon Valley at a twice-yearly gathering hosted
by the world's largest chip maker to spur technology using its
microprocessors.</LD>
<LD>   Intel is expected to release more details on the first processor
for laptop computers it has designed from scratch, code-named Banias,
unveil faster Pentium 4 chips and demonstrate the next version of its
Itanium processor designed for heavy-duty computing, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Called the Intel Developer Forum, the conference in recent years
has gone global, and is held around the year in Taipei, Moscow, Tokyo
and Shenzhen, China.</LD>
<TE>   An Intel spokesman said the company expects about 4,000
attendees--flat with last spring's developer forum--and said that the
vast majority were engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The conference comes as the personal computer industry, which
represents Intel's major market, remains mired in the doldrums,
following a slack 2001 when worldwide shipments of PCs declined
year-over-year.</TE>
<TE>   Intel is expected to reveal more details about the Banias chip,
which is more than just a microprocessor, said Nathan Brookwood,
principal analyst at market research firm Insight 64, adding that
Intel probably will talk up wireless connectivity using the 802.11
standard, which allows for high-speed wireless connections to the
Internet and networks.</TE>

<HD>National Airlines Back in Bankruptcy Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for National Airlines have detailed a $112-million
debt-for-equity finance plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court that is
expected to help the Las Vegas airline emerge from bankruptcy in late
October.</LD>
<LD>   The financing is subject to documentation that will be filed with
the court this week, as well as refinement of agreements with
creditors, primarily aircraft lessors.</LD>
<LD>   The next hearing is scheduled for Thursday when Judge Linda Riegle
will be asked to issue an order for interim approval of the
debtor-in-possession finance package. That's the first step toward
confirmation of a modified plan of reorganization, which should come
on Oct. 30.</LD>
<TE>   In breaking down the $112-million finance package, National
Airlines attorney Craig Hansen said $57.3-million came from
additional conversion of debt and administrative claims to equity,
$24.3 million from reduction of employee wages, $18.4 million from
new cash equity and $11.4 million from the letter of credit.</TE>

<HD>Shoppers Giving Costly Athletic Shoes the Boot</HD>
<DH>Apparel: Fashion shift, economic worries spurring many
consumers to buy simpler, cheaper footwear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shoppers who once thought nothing of shelling out $100 or more for
fancy sneakers have pulled back sharply and are buying cheaper,
simpler styles.</LD>
<LD>   At the highest end of the market, sales of athletic shoes costing
$150 or more plunged almost 41% in the first six months of 2002,
according to recent market data. And some companies that make and
sell hot youth brands say their customers aren't willing to shell out
$85 for a pair of shoes for skateboarding anymore.</LD>
<LD>   "Lower price points are growing and the higher price points are
declining," said Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD FashionWorld, a
unit of Port Washington, N.Y.-based NPD Group Inc., a market research
firm.</LD>
<TE>   Driving the change are a struggling economy that has made shoppers
wary and a shift in fashion that is prompting the athletic shoe
industry to try reinventing itself, as one insider put it.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of shoes laden with lights, flaps, "air bags" and
even shock absorbers, many consumers now want sneakers that look
downright old-fashioned, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Has there been a period of overkill?" Cohen said. "We just left
it."</TE>
<TE>   At the Foot Locker Inc. store in Costa Mesa recently, 12-year-old
Ryan Ripley skipped past the more expensive brands in favor of
low-top Vans, black with a white stripe, for $38. "It's old school,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another young shopper said he'd prefer to have his parents buy him
two pairs of modest-priced shoes rather than one costly pair.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like those $100 shoes," said Kevin Kung, 12, of Fountain
Valley. "If you buy expensive shoes ... they say you should wear them
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The U-turn back to basics reflects a much broader retro consumer
trend that is sweeping the nation, evident in everything from
Chrysler Corp.'s PT Cruisers to the "Scooby-Doo" film and
paraphernalia, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say there won't always be buyers for snazzy shoes
bearing the names of star athletes. For example, Foot Locker in Costa
Mesa is selling out of some styles and colors of the $200 Jordan 17,
which comes with a shoe-sized "suitcase," employees say. And serious
athletes are likely to continue paying top dollar for performance
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "For the rest of us, I don't think it matters that much anymore,"
said Fawn Evenson, vice president of the American Apparel &amp; Footwear
Assn. in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Many people who were swept up in the high-tech shoe fever of the
1990s bought the eye-catching sneakers because they thought they
looked cool, not because they needed them. Now, many of the extra
touches just seem superfluous.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares if they're high-performance anyway?" Evenson said. "Why
should I pay that much money for a shoe to walk to the Safeway?"</TE>
<TE>   Even trend-setting skateboarders are looking for more basic,
less-expensive shoes, retailers and manufacturers say.</TE>
<TE>   When Hermosa Beach retailer Dave Hollander noticed that customers
at his Becker Surf &amp; Sport stores were bypassing his more expensive
shoes earlier this year, he canceled some orders and began loading up
on shoes that cost less.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to sell an $80 shoe was to drop the prices rather
dramatically," said Hollander, who operates five stores in the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, young shoe shoppers want less "razzle-dazzle" on shoes
now, said Trent Armstrong, manager of the Becker Surf in Corona del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "Simpler, lighter, more basic shoes are what's doing well for us,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sole Technology Inc.--maker of the Emerica, etnies and es
brands--has resurrected some older styles that are "more minimal" and
less expensive, a spokeswoman said. The Lake Forest company's
lower-priced styles now cost about $60, compared with $90 a year ago,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In general, skate shoemakers are simply stripping away the
unnecessary features, said Saba Haider, managing editor of TransWorld
Skateboarding Business magazine. "The really teched-out shoes from
the late 1990s would, obviously, cost a lot more money than simple
shoes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A wide range of offerings--from stripped down to teched-out--was
on display at the Action Sports Retailer trade show in San Diego last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis Collection, a fledgling skate shoemaker in Carson and one
of the exhibitors at the show, zeroed in on the back-to-basics trend,
sales director Paul Ellis said. But by the time it was ready to show
its line to retailers last week, a growing number of competitors were
on the same bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kinda bummed about that," Ellis said.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa-based Hurley International Inc. launched its first
men's shoe line at the show. Since the youth apparel maker was
purchased earlier this year by athletic shoe giant Nike Inc., some
retailers expected Hurley to present skate shoes with more technical
features. But Hurley opted for simple, classic styles, priced from
$36 to $65.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely talked to a lot of consumers and knew about the
price they wanted to pay," Chief Executive Bob Hurley said. "It's not
your $100 shoe that you'd go buy to run a marathon in."</TE>
<TE>   As far as tennis player Casey Sheehan is concerned, a good shoe
shouldn't cost $100 anyway. The Newport Beach resident says he was
frustrated throughout the 1990s that he couldn't find the simple
styles he likes at prices he could afford.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need air, I don't need funny lacing, I don't need stars
and stripes," the trade show designer said. "I just need a functional
court shoe."</TE>
<TE>   So Sheehan was all smiles recently as he pulled no-nonsense
sneakers--with $55 price tags--from the display wall at the South
Coast Plaza Foot Locker.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to buy a pair of shoes," Sheehan said, "and I wouldn't
be here if these were $100."</TE>

<HD>Tobacco Case Judge Had Industry Ties</HD>
<DH>Courts: Legal experts say Lewis Kaplan was not required to
disclose his background or to disqualify himself in cigarette
smuggling suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan was part of the 2-1 majority that gave
the tobacco industry one of its biggest legal victories in recent
years--a ruling upholding dismissal of Canada's cigarette smuggling
case against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  Holdings Inc. The ruling last
October by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals not only derailed
Canada's billion-dollar claim but also led to dismissal of similar
suits against cigarette makers by the European Union and Colombia.</LD>
<LD>   Internal documents disclosed in tobacco litigation show that
Kaplan had represented Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. as a private
attorney during the 1970s and '80s.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show that as part of Kaplan's work for Brown &amp;
Williamson, he participated in meetings of the Committee of Counsel,
the inner sanctum of top tobacco lawyers that mapped the companies'
joint legal and political strategies--including how to temper
government action on tobacco smuggling.</LD>
<TE>   Kaplan did not disclose his former ties with the industry to
lawyers for the government of Canada, though legal experts say he
didn't have to. Nonetheless, tobacco industry foes, who said the
ruling was of immeasurable benefit to the entire industry, not just
R.J. Reynolds, reacted with surprise and anger.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very upset about what appears to be a failure of a judge to
disqualify himself in a decision as important as this," said Gar
Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers' Rights Assn. of
Canada, the country's leading anti-smoking group. "I would think any
reasonably intelligent layperson looking at this--quite apart from
any lawyer--would say that this judge's involvement in this decision
... is not the way justice should be done."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Meyer, who attended Committee of Counsel meetings as an
attorney for tobacco company Liggett Group Inc., recalled Kaplan as
"a crackerjack lawyer." Meyer told The Times that although he was
"not an expert" on judicial ethics, he was "surprised that Lew
[Kaplan] would not have disclosed his representation" of Brown &amp;
Williamson.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan, a U.S. District judge for the Southern District of New
York, was sitting as a visiting judge with the 2nd Circuit when he
cast the swing vote in the Canada case, which involved billions of
contraband cigarettes that poured into Canada during the 1990s. The
court ruled that the suit was barred by the "revenue rule," a
common-law doctrine that forbids the use of U.S. courts to collect
taxes for a foreign government.</TE>
<TE>   The judge did not return several phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   However, legal experts contacted by The Times said the
circumstances of the case did not require Kaplan to disclose his
former ties or disqualify himself.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law states that a federal judge "shall disqualify himself in
any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be
questioned." But several legal experts said the restriction as
interpreted in case law is not so broad as that language implies.
They noted that years had passed since Kaplan's involvement with the
industry, and that his client had been Brown &amp; Williamson, not R.J.
Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some experts said, Kaplan would have had to remove
himself only if he or his former partners had defended RJR in the
Canadian smuggling case.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical nexus is client and subject matter that are
identical to the case at hand," said Steven Lubet, a law professor at
Northwestern University school of law in Chicago. "The farther away
you get from that, the less likely it is that the judge has any
disqualification or disclosure obligation."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the interest in this really stems from the fact that the
tobacco companies are persona non grata with a lot of people, and
pretty suspect," said Stephen McG. Bundy, a professor at the Boalt
Hall school of law at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Peltz, a lawyer with the Chicago firm Bartlit Beck Herman
Palenchar &amp; Scott, attorneys for Canada in the smuggling case,
acknowledged that news of Kaplan's history with the tobacco industry
had taken them by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not find out about it until after the decision came down,"
Peltz said, adding that he is not sure what his clients would have
done had they known beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   But Peltz said although he believes the 2nd Circuit reached "a
wrong legal conclusion ... we're confident that that court, including
Judge Kaplan, approached the case impartially and professionally."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Peltz said, "the case is now where it belongs, before
the U.S. Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear
Canada's appeal of the 2nd Circuit ruling. In May, the court asked
the Justice Department's solicitor general for advice on whether to
take the appeal. The solicitor general has yet to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco ties are a complicating factor there too. Solicitor Gen.
Theodore B. Olsen, named to the post by President Bush in February
2001, had to recuse himself because within days of his appointment he
had supported RJR's position in a friend-of-the-court brief filed
with the 2nd Circuit on behalf of the National Assn. of Manufacturers
and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said principal Deputy Solicitor Gen. Paul Clement, a
former partner with King and Spalding, also had to recuse himself
because of the law firm's longtime defense of Brown &amp; Williamson in
smoking and health cases. According to sources, career employees at
the Office of Solicitor General have taken over the framing of a
response to the Supreme Court. A Justice Department spokesman did not
return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan, 57, was appointed by President Clinton in 1994 to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. From 1970 until
his appointment to the bench, he was with the New York law firm of
Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison. The firm represented Brown &amp;
Williamson during much of the 1970s, '80 and '90s. In recent years,
it has also handled cases for R.J. Reynolds, though senior partner
Martin London said Kaplan had left the firm by the time its
involvement with Reynolds began.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting agendas and minutes disclosed in tobacco litigation show
that during the late 1970s Kaplan was a regular at meetings of the
Committee of Counsel.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the meetings in January 1978, Ernest Pepples, general
counsel of Brown &amp; Williamson, voiced concern about an article in
Forbes magazine suggesting that "the cigarette manufacturers have
something to do with cigarette smuggling," minutes of the meeting
said. At the time, anti-contraband bills were pending in Congress
that would have increased record-keeping requirements for cigarette
makers, and Pepples said he was concerned that "the bills in Congress
'might take off.' "</TE>
<TE>   Pepples suggested "that everyone should formulate a position so as
not to appear to be favoring smuggling."</TE>
<TE>   The minutes give no indication of whether Kaplan took part in the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1978, at the annual meeting of the Tobacco Institute,
the industry lobby group, Chairman Horace R. Kornegay boasted that
anti-smuggling legislation had been "greatly watered down," according
to a text of his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   The bill as passed put the "onus on organized crime," with "no
reporting burden ... placed on the industry," Kornegay said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether cigarette smuggling is solely the work of criminal gangs,
or involves complicity by major U.S. tobacco companies, is at the
heart of the suits filed by Canada, the European Union and others.</TE>

<HD>AOL Gives a Boost to OS X</HD>
<DH>Technology: Latest version offers Mac users services
previously offered only for Windows--plus nifty new Apple-only
features.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY GENTILE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, a confession. I am a Mac convert, albeit a reluctant one.</LD>
<LD>   After buying my iMac DVD Special Edition nearly three years
ago--and loving it, at first--I discovered the limits of the Mac.</LD>
<LD>   Many Web sites that offered movies, music or rich graphics didn't
support my machine. A lot of productivity software lacked the bells
and whistles of Windows counterparts.</LD>
<TE>   I was consumed by buyer's remorse until Apple introduced its new
operating system, version 10.1, last October. Software makers finally
released new versions to take advantage of OS X's gorgeous interface
and crash-resistant code.</TE>
<TE>   I fell in love with my Mac all over again. So it should be no
surprise that I am quite pleased with the new AOL software designed
for Mac OS X.</TE>
<TE>   The latest version updates the program's look and feel while
catching up Mac users with services previously offered only to
Windows users. It also includes several nifty Mac-only features.</TE>
<TE>   I ran mine on my iMac with a 400-megahertz G3 processor running
version 10.1--not the "Jaguar" update Apple just released. I
connected to the Net using AOL and the iMac's internal
56-kilobit-per-second modem.</TE>
<TE>   The program places all its functions on a sleek, metallic bar
across the top of the screen that has the transparent drop-down menus
common to OS X programs. This makes the toolbar, with its clunky,
cartoonish icons, redundant. Yet the toolbar jarringly remains.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, it can be contracted--or detached and tucked out of the
way, an option not yet available to Windows users.</TE>
<TE>   The software includes a search tool that links users to AOL
content and the Web using the Google search engine. It works well,
although I wish it would give you AOL content as a separate option
along with Web choices, like Yahoo's search engine.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, type in something like Britney Spears, and up pops AOL's
Music page devoted to the pop goddess. You have to open AOL's search
function to find Web alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the latest Windows version is superior because it places a
Google search box right on the Welcome page.</TE>
<TE>   A nice new feature is the AOL icon that is added to the Mac menu
bar. I have mine configured so it's hidden until I move my cursor to
the bottom of the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The AOL icon automatically bounces into sight whenever I leave the
program running in the background and receive an e-mail or instant
message, and it tells me how many e-mails and messages are waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Another Mac exclusive is the ability to attach files to e-mails by
dragging and dropping them into the e-mail's attachment window. The
program also allows you to embed photos and sound files within
e-mail. Graphic-rich e-mails, previously a problem to view using AOL
e-mail, now appear quickly, with fully functioning hyperlinks.</TE>
<TE>   I also was impressed with the Netscape Gecko Web browser.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, I used AOL to access the Internet, then bypassed the
service altogether, surfing the Web with Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 5.1. With the Netscape browser, I experienced nothing but
quick, reliable surfing on sites rich with graphics and Flash
animation.</TE>
<TE>   One side effect of staying on the AOL service was that I explored
AOL channels I'd previously ignored. I suspect others who use AOL
merely for the convenience of having a recognizable e-mail address or
for instant messaging also will find themselves diving deeper into
the service.</TE>
<TE>   You now can have your Mac "speak" every line of text in a chat
room or every line of an instant message. Though this was amusing at
first, I found it grating after a few minutes. It can be turned off.</TE>
<TE>   Like the latest version of its Windows software, AOL detects when
the user is using a high-speed connection and offers special content
featured in an additional panel on the Welcome screen.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, it is a pleasure to use, as is everything else on my Mac
these days.</TE>

<HD>Xcam2 Is a Good Low-Cost Option for the Casual User</HD>
<DH>Cameras: For the price, the wireless device offers
surprisingly decent image quality, motion and color.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't say you've never heard of the Xcam2 wireless camera.</LD>
<LD>   If you're online at all you've probably seen its pop-up ads. They
scroll languorously up and down, over a shapely model or across a
furnished living room.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out that, advertising inundation notwithstanding, this
Web-based product was not what I expected. Instead, it was
well-built, easy to use and fairly priced.</LD>
<TE>   Made by Seattle-based X10, the camera costs about $100. It is
marketed as an inexpensive alternative for home security--low cost
but not low quality. And it fills that bill perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   I hooked mine up to the TV and set up the camera in the living
room, ostensibly to see what my goldfish do during the day when I'm
not around.</TE>
<TE>   The results were what I expected. The fish didn't do anything.
They just swam around and nibbled on the krill brick in the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   With its 2.4-gigahertz antenna, the camera can beam color video to
its receiver, which you can plug into a television, VCR or computer.</TE>
<TE>   I got crystal image quality, fluid motion and good color, though I
did notice some jerkiness when I viewed the camera's pictures through
my laptop.</TE>
<TE>   My model featured the Ninja Pan N' Tilt, a clever device that
enabled camera movement. That afforded a wider view of the goings-on
outside my apartment when I placed the camera outside the window. And
with the included remote control, I didn't have to get up from the
sofa.</TE>
<TE>   It's a nice effect, though the novelty wears off quickly. (The Pan
N' Tilt camera kit goes for about $170 on the X10 Web site.)</TE>
<TE>   Connected to a computer using an RCA video jack (a Universal
Serial Bus adaptor is available) the Xcam2 can be a high-tech nanny
cam, dog cam or watch-the-children cam. You can log in from work and
view over the Internet. Mono audio is an option.</TE>
<TE>   A word of warning: The software drivers for this don't come with
the camera but must be downloaded. Others said they had problems
installing their software, but I didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The Xcam2 camera is small and sports an adjustable 2-inch square
antenna. The plastic lens is 2 millimeters, fixed focus with a depth
of field from 5 inches to infinity.</TE>
<TE>   The camera does have some failings--not major ones--including low
light. With the lights down low, it was sometimes hard to pick up
images. Another drawback: The transmission range isn't very good
beyond 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   For professional use, the camera won't do, but for the casual
hobbyist, the camera works fine.</TE>

<DH>Bill Gates extends Microsoft's media reach to Hollywood
with a digital platform for Internet-based entertainment</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Gates swept into Hollywood last week to trumpet his latest
technology--Windows Media 9--as the answer to movie studios' prayers.</LD>
<LD>   Studios have held off putting the bulk of their movies on the
Internet until they can be convinced that doing so won't result in
the kind of massive piracy that has plagued the music industry.</LD>
<LD>   Studios also have been skeptical of the quality of experience that
can be delivered over the Internet. Even over broadband, watching
Internet video has been like watching an aging videotape through a
mud-splattered window.</LD>
<TE>   Gates tried to address those twin concerns, saying Windows Media 9
can stream TV-quality video over the Internet, linked with digital
rights management -- or DRM -- software, which regulates and tracks
how consumers watch and store movies.</TE>
<TE>   For Gates, who runs Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash., Windows
Media 9 represents a three-year, $500-million project to build a
digital foundation for Hollywood to distribute its wares via the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You've spent a lot of time talking to movie studios
about what they need to digitally distribute their movies. How is
Windows Media 9 a response to what they've said?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There's a bunch in Windows Media 9 that relates to how
they build media, both video-and audio-type experiences. We talked to
them about [how] they want to expose consumers to their best work.
Whether they deliver it across the PC or not, they want to get
trailers or promotional things out there to all PC users. And so
there's things in Windows Media 9 that make that a lot cheaper,
easier for them. Then we talked about the PC as a delivery channel.
Obviously, there's the quality issue that [Windows Media 9] is a huge
breakthrough on, the digital rights issues that [Windows Media 9] is
a big advance on. This represents three years of having listened to
users and media company people. So it's a pretty big investment for
us.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: There [was] a noticeable absence of major movie studios on
stage with you at your launch event. Why do you think they [weren't]
there?</TE>
<TE>   A: Actually, we've had a lot of meetings with them, a lot of
discussions. As you see movie services like Movielink moving to
broader things, I'm sure there will be events where we [will be
present] as a platform provider to them. I'm sure we'll do events
together when we get to those uses. The time to bring the
businesspeople in--you might say the moguls--is when you have the
services built around these things.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the things that come out of the technology, there never
will be a big press conference about: the fact that it helps creative
people and the fact that it brings the kind of equipment you need
[down to just] the software on a PC without compromising what you see
in video quality and audio quality. That's the biggest milestone
we've got here. What is the best media creation and manipulation
device? It's now the PC. And that wasn't true before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Content providers say they are looking for technology to help
them deliver more business models. How flexible is your technology?</TE>
<TE>   A: Software on the PC is infinitely flexible. If someone wants to
say you can listen to this five times, or you can listen to this in
three locations, or you can listen to this for two years, or you can
listen to everything by this artist because you're paying an annual
fee, our [digital rights management] technology supports any [of
these] business models. That's part of the magic of software. It's
not like a dedicated device. We can accommodate every request we've
heard.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not some lack of technology that's holding us back. Part
of the reason we're having this event here is to underscore the
investment we've made in working with content companies. We've chosen
not to be a music company or a studio, but rather a partner with all
music companies and studios. And the incentive for us is to come up
with software that makes the PC more and more exciting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is it largely a learning curve issue for the studios that makes
them reluctant? As you say, it's not the technology. What is it?</TE>
<TE>   A: There are learning curves on both sides. There's certainly
learning curves by us of their needs, interests, who's who, what's
what. Because between the artist and the listener, there's lawyers,
businesspeople, marketing people, different companies. So we're
coming up the learning curve here too.</TE>
<TE>   The thing that makes people move fastest here is a big opportunity
or a big crisis. And we have both of those here. We have a huge
opportunity to let people get at the music and video that they want,
in more flexible ways, with more quality. And we have a challenge,
certainly in the music space, [in that] the most convenient way to
get music is one that you can't pay, even if you want to. Then [there
are] all the massive number of issues about, OK, what are the rules
in this country, what are the rules in other countries? So it's very
complex.</TE>
<TE>   It's radio on a PC. Wow. Home theater driven by a PC. Wow. Motion
video coming across any type high-speed connection better than you
see it anywhere else. It's not like, oh just because it's on a PC,
it's going to be crummy, which is sort of where things were.</TE>
<TE>   Now the very best experience for all of these things is on a PC.
And that just sort of supercharges ... the whole industry behind
these digital approaches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Talk about getting into the living room.</TE>
<TE>   A: Thirty-five percent of home PCs are in the living room or
family room. They're shared devices, and it's trivial to cable those
up to whatever the large display is. You see it in dorm rooms [where
it's] the everything device. And you see it in the living room where
the PC has multiple displays including, essentially, the TV set.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the percentage of entertainment experiences that are
coming off the PC--music, videos--is under 10%. And we think just in
the three years ahead that of the people who buy new entertainment
systems, in over half of those the PC will be at the center of those
systems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are there copyright issues around being able to share
copyrighted media across multiple devices?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you have two PCs, we don't want you to transfer [copyrighted
content] from one PC to the other PC. The infrastructure that
recognizes that those two PCs are both owned by you--we are working
on that.</TE>
<TE>   But we can't discriminate in a strong way between the second PC
that's your friend's PC who may not have rights, versus the second PC
that's your PC where you do have rights. Because we couldn't
distinguish between those two, unfortunately, we took the
conservative approach--the pro-copyright approach. We're working on
this stuff.</TE>

<LD>   The SEC is waiting for a decision from 75-year-old Volcker before
filling the other seats, said people familiar with the process. The
board was created by Congress in July to help restore investor
confidence shaken by accounting scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom
Inc. and other companies.</LD>
<LD>   SEC commissioners have discussed the job with Volcker, who has
concerns about the full-time hours and possible conflicts with his
other activities, such as chairing the foundation that oversees the
International Accounting Standards Board, which develops worldwide
audit rules, sources said. Other top board candidates include NASD
Vice Chairwoman Mary Schapiro and TIAA-CREF Chairman John Biggs, the
sources said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be full time, and will Paul Volcker go full time?"
said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's Center
for Corporate Governance. "It's a position that requires you to drop
everything you are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Through his secretary, Volcker declined to comment about his
possible appointment. SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and the other four
commissioners all favor Volcker as board chairman, said people
familiar with the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said the agency received about 350
recommendations and applications for board membership before a
deadline for submissions on Sept. 2. She declined to comment on
specific nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker, who was Federal Reserve chairman from 1979 to 1987, heads
a commission examining whether Swiss banks destroyed proof of
thousands of World War II-era accounts thought to belong to Holocaust
survivors and victims.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Volcker led an unsuccessful effort to separate
Arthur Andersen from its consulting business and make other changes
to stave off a criminal indictment of the accounting firm. Andersen
was later convicted of obstructing an SEC investigation of its audit
client Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said the "sad demise" of Andersen, which involved
allegations that the firm pulled punches in audits to get consulting
contracts, was part of a larger problem afflicting the accounting
industry. During congressional debate on the accounting scandals,
Volcker endorsed audit oversight legislation sponsored by Sen. Paul
S. Sarbanes (D-Md.).</TE>
<TE>   The bill, passed by Congress, included a plan to create a
five-member board with new powers to write and enforce accounting
rules. President Bush signed the legislation in July.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which calls for staggered five-year terms for the board
members, stipulates that two members must have had experience as
certified public accountants and the other three members must not
have worked as CPAs. The chairman may not have practiced as an
accountant for five years, the law says.</TE>
<TE>   The law also says members cannot hold other jobs or engage in any
other professional or business activity. In selecting the board, the
SEC is to consult with the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Other leading candidates for the five-member board include former
California Public Employees' Retirement System general counsel Kayla
Gillan; Columbia University law professor Bevis Longstreth, an SEC
commissioner under President Reagan; and Joel Seligman, dean of
Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said people
familiar with the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Bowsher, former head of the Public Oversight Board, is
another top contender, the sources said, as is Donald Kirk, former
chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and former vice
chairman of the Public Oversight Board.</TE>

<LD>Japan's prime minister has scheduled an unprecedented visit to North
Korea next week that could go far toward easing tensions in one of
the more dangerous parts of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Junichiro Koizumi's planned one-day summit with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il represents another small opening of North Korea to
the outside world after nearly 60 years of secretive Stalinist rule.</LD>
<LD>   The last decade has seen Pyongyang swing back and forth, at times
appearing approachable by Japan, South Korea and the United States
but at most times remaining deaf.</LD>
<TE>   Internal and external pressures are pushing the North to open up
now. Increasing numbers of North Koreans are trying to defect when
they are lucky enough to reach other countries--especially China,
Pyongyang's longtime ally. North Koreans at home are ill fed or
starving. The economy is a shambles. President Bush includes the
country in his "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi is expected to press Kim to explain what happened to at
least a dozen and perhaps as many as 100 Japanese kidnapped by North
Korea over the years, for reasons unknown. Japan also wants North
Korea not to test-fire another missile over its territory, as it did
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Cooperation with Japan can be lucrative, but decades of enmity
stand in the way. Japan ruled unified Korea brutally as a colony from
1910 to the end of World War II, when Korea was partitioned into the
non-Communist south and the Communist north. Japan was a rear staging
area for U.S. troops during the 1950-53 Korean War. Nearly 38,000
U.S. troops are still in South Korea, and about the same number in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has provided economic aid to South Korea and China after
reestablishing diplomatic relations, and North Korea is hoping for
more assistance and acceptance. In recent years the country has
allowed several European nations to establish embassies. In recent
months it has also started overhauling its economy, paying farmers
more for rice, removing subsidies for unprofitable businesses and
letting some prices increase to reflect actual costs.</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason to expect North Korea's relations with other
countries to progress quickly and evenly. Koizumi needs to return
home with some visible sign of progress to show Japanese who were
frightened and angered by the 1998 missile test, but he has to be a
hard bargainer as well.</TE>
<TE>   One accomplishment in this summit would be persuading Kim that
it's in his best interests to negotiate with Tokyo, Seoul and
Washington rather than sell missiles to any country willing to buy
them.</TE>

<HD>Congress, Courts: Step In</HD>
<DH>Overreaching by the executive branch is tipping the balance
away from protecting Americans' precious freedoms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael D. Kirkpatrick knows Americans have little patience for those
who would get between law officers and the terrorists they're after.
Gesturing at 100,000 square feet of data-packed computers at an FBI
center in the West Virginia countryside, his bureau ID bouncing on a
"Go Navy" neck cord, the assistant director in charge of the agency's
Criminal Justice Information Services Division offers his take on how
the people and their president want the agency to proceed: "It's like
the Nike commercial--'Just do it.' "</LD>
<LD>   If only it were that simple.</LD>
<LD>   Last Sept. 12, in urging our leaders to fight terrorists
mercilessly, we warned that liberties would probably erode. We called
for a reevaluation of the balance between rights and security each
year on the anniversary of the attacks. That seems particularly
important this first year.</LD>
<TE>   We hope people like Kirkpatrick will pause this week to
congratulate themselves. So far there has been no new mayhem. But we
also encourage President Bush, Congress, the courts and the people to
assess the avalanche of changes the war on terror has dislodged; to
scrutinize the new powers government is claiming; and to pay closer
attention to the details of the 340-page Patriot Act that Congress
quickly passed in October and the proposed Homeland Security
Department, which seems headed for Bush's desk after much
squabbling--but little scrutiny of its effect on fundamental civil
liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we spotlight where the government, in its herculean efforts
to detect terrorists and prevent attacks, has gone too far in
abridging the rights that help define this democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Rights Endangered</TE>
<TE>   The most urgent need for attention comes on the legal front, where
the cumulative effect of the Patriot Act has been to massively shift
power from federal judges to investigators, putting innocent people
at far greater risk of unwarranted government scrutiny, harassment or
persecution.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcers, rightly intent on catching crooks, always clamor
for fewer restrictions on how they do their jobs. Sept. 11 gave the
attorney general the rationale to obligingly sweep aside plenty.
Suddenly, the standard of "probable cause" is history. Under the
Patriot Act, prosecutors need only assert that information they hope
to find through electronic snooping--by, say, rifling through a
library's database of patron reading preferences--would be "relevant
to an ongoing investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Some changes are simply common-sense nods to public safety: for
example, making it easier, in well-defined circumstances, for law
enforcers to listen in on technologically sophisticated bad guys as
they move from cell phone to computer terminal in plotting their
crimes. But the Bush administration, in its zeal to thwart
terrorists, has overcome long-standing legal obstacles to snooping
into the homes and conversations of citizens by simply ignoring them
or, in some cases, cheating its way around them. If left
unchallenged, these incursions could forever erase fundamental
privacy and free speech rights.</TE>
<TE>   A Secret Court's Rebuke</TE>
<TE>   In May, for instance, judges on the secret federal court that
approves classified wiretaps and searches in terrorism and espionage
cases blasted Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft for the FBI's use of false
information in dozens of requests for top-secret warrants. Espionage
laws allow a lower threshold of suspicion in granting wiretaps. The
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act created the court in 1978 to
protect the public from maverick spying after the Nixon
administration abused its intelligence-gathering powers to probe
political enemies. The judges, who preside in a windowless room in
Washington behind a series of alarmed doors, charged that the Justice
Department shared information between criminal and intelligence
investigations, giving agencies access to data about "many hundreds
of citizens" that they were not legally entitled to have.</TE>
<TE>   The public again needs its Congress to intervene. It needs to
remind the attorney general that the powers to enter homes, tap
phones and search computers that he has so generously granted to law
officers were never his to give. Then it must compel the
administration to return to the people each privacy, 1st Amendment
protection and due process right he's taken, unless he can prove that
doing so would hurt national security.</TE>
<TE>   In opposing President Franklin Roosevelt's relocation of Japanese
civilians in the United States during World War II, Atty. Gen.
Francis Biddle noted, "The Constitution has not greatly bothered any
wartime president."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's only human for a commander in chief whose citizens
have been mercilessly slaughtered to focus so intently on protecting
them that he loses sight of his responsibilities to simultaneously
protect their rights and freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the courts, however, should be very bothered by the
Constitution--especially when the executive branch is ignoring it.
Democracy, with its built-in genius for self-preservation, insists
that these parallel branches of government defend Americans'
freedoms--even from a president.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Protecting the innocent means protecting the rights of
the accused--including accused terrorists.</TE>

<LD>I was saddened to read that each year about 120,000 hunters kill
about 1.8 million doves in California ("Hunters Mourn Lack of
Quarry," Sept. 2). Doves have a hard life as it is, dealing with
crows, hawks and starlings; they are peaceful birds, which makes them
easy targets. Doves are native birds. In my opinion, even though I am
against killing any living creatures, shooting starlings would be
better because they have caused the demise of many native birds and
they don't belong on this continent. This way, there would be a use
to hunting, which I believe is senseless killing.</LD>

<LD>With all the cuts in services that will be necessary in the upcoming
years to try to bring our state and local budgets out of the red, I
am disheartened to read about pensions for government workers
continuing to rise ("Pensions Straining Civic Coffers," Sept. 5). Why
should anyone receive 90% to 100% of his or her salary in retirement?
Most of us have to save our money and try to budget for the future.
Shouldn't government workers have to do the same, instead of relying
on taxpayers to take care of them? Yet Gov. Gray Davis was asked to
sign even more measures to use our hard-earned money to enable
government workers to retire young and enjoy many years of living off
the taxpayers. I hope Davis will help curb this waste.</LD>

<LD>I was very disappointed to see Michael Ramirez's cartoon Sept. 5
regarding the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. My wife and I had
a wonderful and holy experience attending Mass at the cathedral Sept.
3, the first day the cathedral was open to the public and to the
faithful for Mass. It was immediately apparent that the cathedral is
and will be a church for anyone to attend to pray and seek peace. The
people of Los Angeles are fortunate to have such a beautiful and open
cathedral.</LD>

<TE>   Re Ramirez's editorial cartoon: Cardinal Roger Mahony's leadership
from start to finish of the cathedral has been nothing short of
superior. The city of Los Angeles has a point of interest for the
ages, and Catholics have a church of which they can be justly proud.</TE>
<TE>   How do you build such a magnificent edifice if you don't have
money? Mahony deserves only praise and thanks for his selfless
effort.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Virom Coppola's "review" of the art and architecture of
the Los Angeles cathedral (letter, Sept. 4) offers that the new
building "fails to touch the spiritual depths of our being." However,
in excoriating the form and decor of the cathedral, he overlooks the
purposeful function of the building: creating a central space for the
worship and service programs of the city's Roman Catholics. Perhaps
those seminal Judeo-Christian traditions--worship and service--more
accurately fulfill Coppola's much-lamented idea of enthusiasm (from
the Greek, meaning "God within") than a building might ever hope to.</TE>

<LD>   Just think of what we could accomplish by slapping 80 pounds of
ammo on the backs of these individuals and shipping them off to some
desert in Iraq in 120-degree heat: (1) Fuel efficiency would more
than double on the streets of the U.S., thus pushing the price of
gasoline down to 50 cents per gallon; (2) our air would be twice as
clean, now that we were burning half the fuel we used to; (3)
millions of jobs would be created, now that these individuals were
traveling to the Middle East; and (4) we would be educating the next
generation of car buyers that the decisions we make today affect
every American tomorrow.</LD>

all-expenses-paid trip to Iraq! Or how about: Buy a GMC Yukon and

<LD>As someone who donated more than a few dollars to Republican
gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon, I also say it is time for him to
step aside. Many of us were elated to see him trounce the liberal
Richard Riordan but have been sorely disappointed by his performance
ever since then. He has squandered one of the best opportunities ever
to defeat a failed liberal Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   He is a disgrace to his party and to those of us who have
supported him. Replacing him with a solid candidate who is not afraid
to take on the status quo elites in Sacramento would really bring out
the vote against Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>

<TE>   "Gay Rights Flap Engulfs Simon," your Sept. 4 front-page coverage
of the allegations about Simon's attitude toward gay people, is
interesting. Typically, a very stunning indictment of Gov. Davis and
his freeloading on jets is placed in the California section (Sept.
4). Aren't they both of equal interest? Can't the voters digest the
reportage evenly and come to some conclusions? What is the effect on
the citizenry of the governor's accepting campaign money from people
with whom the state routinely does business? You do not mention the
deals with the computers, the unions, the financial people, et al,
and the summary double-dipping that this consists of. Your subtle
approach and sometimes blatant bias are a shame.</TE>

<TE>   It's amusing to watch Simon dance as he tries to figure out what
his position is in regard to gay rights. Equally amusing are
questions directed to Simon as to actions he might take as governor,
given the ineptitude of his campaign. Why not ask Adam Sandler about
what he would say during his acceptance speech should he win an
Academy Award for best actor? Or perhaps the L.A. Clippers' coach
could be queried about the lineup he would use should his team reach
the NBA finals. Interesting speculations all, but ultimately a waste
of time.</TE>

They remind me of people who didn't go to the store, didn't stuff the
bird, didn't peel the potatoes or make the gravy or watch the stove;
who didn't set the table or contribute a nickel for expenses (and
certainly have no intention of helping to clean up afterward), who
show up for Thanksgiving dinner and squeal, "Is this all we have to

<LD>On the bustling markets of Soweto, James Pinkerton wrote, "This is
small business in action. This is sustainable development. This is
the hope for a new South Africa" (Commentary, Sept. 5). I couldn't
agree more.</LD>
<LD>   However, in South Africa and throughout the developing world,
there remains for the poor a lack of the essential financial services
that foster small-business development.</LD>
<LD>   During my trip to the World Summit on Sustainable Development, I
spoke with a cab driver, explaining the purpose of my organization,
the Microcredit Summit Campaign: to help bring small loans to poor
families to start or expand their own businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Instantly, he understood the concept and its value, telling me
that South Africans desperately needed such services. "You must have
5,000 rand (about $500) to begin a bank account here," he explained.
"So imagine how difficult it is for someone like me to get a loan.
And I have a job, so think of what it's like for others with no
steady income."</TE>
<TE>   Access to financial services, particularly credit, is essential
for small and micro-businesses to develop and flourish, yet donor
agencies continue to ignore the reality Pinkerton observed in Soweto
and the power of microfinance in the developing world.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Powell Is Jeered at World Summit," Sept. 4: The heckling
Secretary of State Colin Powell received in Johannesburg was well
deserved. I have never been so ashamed and angered by my country's
policies as I have during this regime of Prince George. The wanton
disregard that this administration exhibits for other nations and the
planet we share with them is an outrage. It sends representatives to
meetings like the one in Johannesburg only to weaken environmental
protection proposals, scuttling any attempt to promote renewable
resources in order to further the interests of its fossil-fuel
cronies.</TE>
<TE>   I sincerely hope that enough international pressure can be brought
to bear to bring President Bush into line, for the sake of the U.S.
and the world. I urge my fellow citizens to speak out. We should not
be silenced by disingenuous attacks on our patriotism.</TE>

<HD>Von Dutch Artwork Keeps On Cruising</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As "Car Painter Earned His Stripes" (Sept. 2), your feature on the
legendary Southern California pinstriper, suggests, "everyone who
knew him or even spent five minutes with him has some crazy tale."
Absolutely true, and here's my "crazy tale." In the 1960s, Von Dutch
worked out of his garage in Reseda. One rainy evening he lifted a
piece of footprint-and-paint-laden cardboard from the floor of his
workshop and announced to no one in particular that "some idiot's
going to pay me $100 for this."</LD>
<LD>   He pinned the filthy cardboard to the wall and placed strips of
masking tape over the cardboard in seemingly random patterns. As he
finished painting each of a half dozen or so motorcycle tanks, he
would turn to the cardboard and put on a coat of the then-popular
pearlescent or flake finishes. After heat lamps dried the paint,
Dutch would peel off several strips of the tape to reveal a new
surface for the next color. Our disbelief turned to fascination as
the lowly piece of garage detritus became an abstract geometric
worthy of Piet Mondrian, at least in our eyes. The motorcycles Dutch
painted for me are long gone; I can only hope that, somewhere,
Dutch's "cardboard masterpiece" is being proudly displayed.</LD>

<HD>Davis Is Caught in Jaws of Two Latino Demands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, Gov. Gray Davis looked upon California's
fast-growing Latino electorate as a safe and solid base of support
for his reelection campaign. After all, Davis got 71% of the Latino
vote against his Republican opponent in 1998, according to Times exit
polls. Back then, Davis was only the latest Democrat to benefit from
the lingering anger that new Latino voters felt toward former Gov.
Pete Wilson, a Republican, for backing Proposition 187 in 1994. That
same Latino backlash helped give Democrats solid control of the state
Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   But that was then. Now the notoriously cautious Davis finds
himself besieged by unhappy Latino activists--including most of the
28 Latinos in the state Legislature--from two sides. And no matter
which way he turns, the governor runs the risk of alienating a big
chunk of the Latino electorate.</LD>
<TE>   The political standoff that has gotten Davis the most negative
attention is with the United Farm Workers, the small but symbolically
important labor union founded by the late Cesar Chavez. The UFW wants
Davis to sign a bill that would strengthen the state's Agricultural
Labor Relations Act by requiring binding arbitration whenever a union
and farmer cannot agree on a labor contract, something that has
happened quite often since the landmark law was enacted in 1975.
California's powerful agribusiness lobby wants the bill vetoed and
has donated a cool quarter-million dollars to Davis' reelection
campaign just since August.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW has responded with the politically potent tactics that
Chavez refined over many years--peaceful protest marches and prayer
vigils to publicly embarrass unresponsive opponents. So far they have
had the intended effect on Davis, prodding him to propose a
compromise--no veto in exchange for a five-year sunset provision in
the UFW bill. UFW officials agreed to it. But Davis has yet to sign
the reform into law, and the UFW has begun a prayer vigil outside the
Capitol that union leaders say will continue until he does.</TE>
<TE>   Many Latinos in the Legislature expect Davis to string the UFW
along as long as he can (he has until Sept. 30 to approve or veto
legislation) because the governor is weighing the potential
consequences of a second piece of legislation--a controversial bill
by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) that could allow up to
800,000 illegal immigrants to obtain California driver's licenses. To
make the license bill more palatable to the law-and-order voters who
supported Proposition 187, Davis demanded changes proposed by his
political allies in law enforcement, such as Los Angeles County
Sheriff Lee Baca. The bill would now require immigrant applicants to
undergo criminal background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Like the UFW, Cedillo and his supporters did not want to change
their bill but did so to get Davis' support. The driver's license
bill also sits in Davis' in-basket.</TE>
<TE>   As Latino legislators wait to see what happens to the UFW and
Cedillo bills, they privately discuss dark scenarios, particularly
one put forth by Davis' loudest Democratic critic in the Legislature,
State Senate President John Burton of San Francisco: Could Davis be
biding his time, deciding which group of Latino voters he can afford
to alienate? The rural Latinos who support the UFW or the urban
Latinos who support immigrants' rights measures like Cedillo's bill?</TE>
<TE>   The two groups are not mutually exclusive, of course. In fact,
Latino legislators warn that a veto of either bill could cost Davis
voter support in both California's rural colonias and urban barrios.
"The governor has got to sign both," warns state Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Norwalk), who voted for the Cedillo bill despite "hating" the
changes made to appease Davis. "This is a two-fer as far as I'm
concerned, and most of the Latino caucus feels the same way."</TE>
<TE>   A UFW spokesman said: "The governor's getting bad advice if he
thinks he can play us against urban Latinos. He may get some goodwill
by signing the driver's license bill. But it's been so watered down
that he won't get enough goodwill to offset a veto of our bill."</TE>
<TE>   How will the risk-averse Davis appease all these angry Latinos?
Watch this space. For now, I couldn't blame California's governor if
he wished Wilson and other Proposition 187 proponents had been right
and their misguided initiative had scared Latino immigrants back to
Mexico, or at least to some other state.</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe's Muzzle on Independent Media Must Be Removed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA HUSARSKA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Harare studios of the only Zimbabwean privately owned radio
station, Voice of the People, were destroyed Aug. 29 by an explosion.
The police say the perpetrators of the crime, in which there were no
casualties, are unknown but that they will be found and punished.</LD>
<LD>   Are we to assume that those who act against the independent media
in Zimbabwe will be finally brought to justice? Well, so says the
minister of home affairs, Comrade Kembo Mohadi, who, according to the
government mouthpiece, the Herald, announced that "no stone would be
left unturned" in the search for "these terrorists trying to induce
fear into this nation."</LD>
<LD>   The turning of the stones was probably delayed, though, because
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who has imposed laws limiting
freedom of expression, was in Johannesburg at the World Summit on
Sustainable Development, as was his minister of information, Jonathan
Moyo, known for his stated hatred of independent journalists.</LD>
<TE>   The attack against the Voice of the People is the fourth against
an independent news outfit in the last three years: In 2000, 2001 and
2002 the offices and printing house of the privately owned Daily News
newspaper were bombed. It's not known who carried out the newspaper
explosions.</TE>
<TE>   The VOP's premises were raided in July by members of the police
who, armed with a search warrant, confiscated files and 133 tapes.
They said they were looking for a transmitter.</TE>
<TE>   There was no transmitter because the VOP does not transmit; it
only prepares programs (two hours daily, in the two local languages,
Shona and Ndebele) and sends them out of the country. Then they are
broadcast from Radio Netherlands' transmitter in Madagascar.</TE>
<TE>   I learned about this from one of the VOP's journalists, whom I met
last year in Harare, the capital. She wanted to hear about the
experiences of independent media in other dictatorial countries in
order to improve the operation of the VOP. She was interested in the
clandestine Radio Solidarity, which broadcast in Poland when the
country was under martial law, but after listening to my explanations
she said with regret: "We could not do that; this would be illegal
here. We need to do things in a legal way. Otherwise we put our
security at risk."</TE>
<TE>   That "security" is now smoldering in the ruins of a small white
building in the Milton Park suburb of Harare.</TE>
<TE>   With its programming about human rights, about AIDS and about
social conflicts, the VOP was a thorn in the government's side, which
in published reports has called it "nothing short of a criminal and
terrorist group." In rural areas where the Daily News and the
English-language weeklies are not available or are not understood,
the VOP was the only independent source of information. The raid in
July was a warning. The Aug. 29 attack means there is no room for a
free radio in Mugabe's Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Without waiting for his new, self-described "war cabinet" to
celebrate getting its adversary off the air, the outside world should
prevent the VOP from going silent. There are a few days' worth of
broadcasts accumulated and some rebroadcasts are planned, but the
losses--virtually everything--must be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   When the other declared enemy of the free media, Slobodan
Milosevic, waged a war against his own journalists, the victims found
immediate support from abroad. Sarajevo's daily Oslobodjenje was
given newsprint even while its offices were being shelled. Belgrade's
radio B-92 was carried by other broadcasters when its offices were
taken over. The Banja Luka daily in Bosnia, Nezavisne Novine, was
offered grants after its editor lost both legs to a car bomb. And the
Pristina daily Koha Ditore was helped to temporarily resettle in
Macedonia after its offices and equipment were destroyed in Kosovo.
Now all those media are thriving in their respective countries, and
Milosevic is answering for his deeds in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   If independent media are not helped to stand up to the dictator,
Zimbabweans will be left with only government-sanctioned mouthpieces
to read, watch and listen to.</TE>
<TE>   Condemning Zimbabweans to such propaganda would have long-term
effects on the prospects of the country's return to democracy.</TE>

<LD>Among my compatriots in New York, the anniversary of Sept. 11 is
being faced with a dread unrelated to anxieties about homeland
security. No, we do not feel at all safe. Yet almost as troubling as
the fear that things will never be "normal" again is a sense that
things have gotten too normal too soon. Couples who brunch have
reclaimed the abandoned apartments around ground zero. Firefighters
get around unmolested by huggers and amateur paparazzi. New Yorkers
in general have recovered from the tenderness that marked our casual
interactions throughout last fall, and the families of the victims
are fighting over their payouts.</LD>
<LD>   If there is a reluctance to look back on the last year, it may be
not because of what we will see but because of what we won't see.
What is missing is spiritual resonance, evidence that something
constructive came out of the slaughter.</LD>
<LD>   Why did a trauma experienced so deeply and endured so
magnificently inspire no commensurate civic vigor? The emptiness we
feel a year later is the absence of redemption, of proof that we have
been transformed by the pain.</LD>
<TE>   A valuable key to how national identity is shaped by epic disaster
lies at the bottom of the ocean, in a wreck that also had been the
technological marvel of its day. The collapse of the World Trade
Center irresistibly evokes the sinking of the Titanic 90 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Like the twin towers, the Titanic was a gaudy monument to
progress--to state-of-the-art modernity and the crass materialism
that came with it. And as with the World Trade Center, the great
ship's downfall dramatized the inequities of a system in which
ballrooms for the few crowded out lifeboats for the many.</TE>
<TE>   Both cataclysms immediately inspired national "narratives" of
democratic redemption, in which authentic virtues of discipline,
selflessness and brotherhood were reasserted in a heroic defense of
civilization. For the Titanic, as Steven Biel writes in "Down With
the Old Canoe," his 1996 cultural history of the shipwreck, the moral
lesson centered on the conversion of the first cabins'
millionaires--epitomized by John Jacob Astor--from heartless
plutocrats into gallant martyrs who gave their own lives so that
women and children might be saved. The men in uniform who became the
heroes of Sept. 11 were the polar opposites of those gentlemen
dressed for dinner and death, but their role too was to restore an
ethos of action, courage and sacrifice that had been marginalized in
a techno-culture dedicated to the pursuit of toys.</TE>
<TE>   There was a crucial difference in the way the country processed
the earlier blow that may explain why the Sept. 11 aftermath has felt
so stale and unsatisfying. Even the most sentimental versions of the
Titanic disaster carried a harsh critique of capitalism's
dehumanizing excesses. The national soul-searching that followed
Sept. 11, however, brooked no such hard look at The System.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is obvious: The thing that brought down the twin towers
was not the icy indifference of nature but the hot zeal of human
beings bent on annihilating our civilization. To criticize that
civilization in this context would have seemed traitorous, even
murderous. But in our hearts we knew that part of what the jihadists
hated about us was what we ought to deplore in ourselves: not
"freedom," as the president insisted, but MTV--the trash culture that
is our most visible global export.</TE>
<TE>   In the surge of patriotic feeling after Sept. 11, the public
seemed hungry for something more sustaining than this junk food for
the soul. We wanted to be told what we could do for our country.</TE>
<TE>   It was a brilliant opportunity for civic renewal, a re-declaration
of what it means to be an American. But instead our leaders gave us
pep talks advancing the mindless materialism our enemies accuse us
of: Don't stop shopping; don't stop taking vacations. Even on this
anniversary they cannot find the words to engage us, except in the
sacred texts, such as the Gettysburg Address.</TE>
<TE>   The genius of our democracy is its tolerance for flux and tension,
a recognition that ideals and trash coexist. But if we as a society
do not confront the corruption within as forcefully as we fight the
terrorism from abroad, then history will force the job on us.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Sept. 11, we were met with an almost pornographic
pageant of corporate shame. The enduring mythic image of the past
year, to be sure, is the firefighters charging up the stairs of the
world's tallest inferno. But superimposed on it is another American
icon: a disgraced CEO, trapped in his Texas-size mansion, crying in
his white wine over his sad fate. If we are to do true honor to the
heroes and innocents who died for their country, we must also
acknowledge the civic idols who betrayed it.</TE>

<HD>Reparations: A Scam Cloaked in Racial Pain</HD>
<DH>There's no legal basis for claiming slavery damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the history of con games there have been some legendary flimflams,
from the ancient Trojan horse to the modern Ponzi scheme. But nothing
quite equals the current reparations movement.</LD>
<LD>   Various civic and political leaders have recently used the promise
of trillions of dollars in "slavery damages" to leverage political
and financial gains.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the relatively harmless street con of a $5 gold watch,
however, these leaders are fueling a racial divide with the allure of
windfall awards that will never be realized.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, lawsuits were filed in California, New York, Illinois,
Texas and Louisiana seeking reparations for slavery. With emotions
rising over the issue, there has been reluctance to say the obvious
about these lawsuits: As a legal matter, they are entirely without
merit.</TE>
<TE>   Given the deep injury that many African Americans legitimately
feel over slavery, coverage and commentary often have focused on the
historical rather than the legal aspects of these filings to avoid
insulting many citizens. This has led to a false impression of merit,
which has increased the racial tension.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits typify the dangers in using the law as a form of
expression rather than true adjudication. Fundamental legal elements
are treated as immaterial distractions. For example, there is the
small matter of the statute of limitations: For claims like unjust
enrichment, it is six years. That would have run out, for these
cases, roughly 131 years ago</TE>
<TE>   The designated corporate defendants often seem equally random. One
lawsuit named FleetBoston Financial Corp. as "unjustly enriched" by
slave labor. The basis for this claim is that FleetBoston was created
by an array of businesses, one of which, Providence Bank, was
originally founded by a slave trader.</TE>
<TE>   This is only slightly more compelling than using the popular "six
degrees of separation" from actor Kevin Bacon as the basis of a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Previous reparation lawsuits were given little credence by the
courts. In 1995, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco tossed out as largely frivolous a $100-million reparations
lawsuit against the U.S. government. But then these lawsuits are
designed to vent rather than validate claims of injury.</TE>
<TE>   The categorical rejection of these claims by courts would normally
prove something of a marketing barrier, but in these cases it is used
as evidence of a white-dominated legal system. This convenient
argument has been made by reparations advocates like New York City
Councilman Charles Barron. "Some days I get so frustrated I just want
to go up to the closest white person and say, 'You can't understand
this, it's a black thing,' and then slap him just for my mental
health," Barron said.</TE>
<TE>   This would appear to be a walking advertisement for analysis, not
reparations.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, reparations advocates held a rally under the
remarkably revealing motto: "They Owe Us." "They" appear to be all
white people. "Us" is supposedly every African American for whom
these leaders now claim to speak. What is "owed" has been stated as
high as $10 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the rally was filled with racial animus and
epithets. The highlight of the rally was the keynote speaker, the
virulently racist and anti-Semitic Louis Farrakhan, leader of the
Nation of Islam. Farrakhan rejected mere financial settlements as a
"jive token" and demanded that the government hand over millions of
acres of land.</TE>
<TE>   This vision of a Farrakhanland only typifies the level of delusion
that has been unleashed. Of course, this outcome is less appealing to
leaders like Jesse Jackson who want the trillions to be managed by
organizations like his own, the final realization of the pot of gold
at the end of his Rainbow Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   None of this questions the lingering effects of slavery. Moreover,
the law can be used to deal with direct injuries of discrimination.
This was recently the case in 1999 when black farmers won a
$2-billion payment from the federal government for discrimination by
the Department of Agriculture. The award of reparations for Japanese
Americans and Jewish slave laborers from World War II--made to the
direct victims of the abuse--does not support but rather refutes
these claims. While leaders like Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
have encouraged African Americans to put aside this reparations
fixation, an increasing number of politicians and organizations have
succumbed to the lure of racial politics.</TE>
<TE>   In failing to debunk this urban mythology, our political leaders
are playing a dangerous and harmful game. When this Ponzi scheme
collapses, we will be left with only racial animus as the only
dividend of the Great Reparations Scam.</TE>

<HD>Helen Giuliani, 92; Active in Son Rudolph's Political
Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Helen Giuliani, the mother of former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who was credited with teaching her only child a sense of history and
public service, died Sunday. She was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Helen Giuliani died at Mount Sinai Medical Center with her son and
other family members at her side. She had been in poor health for
about 18 months, said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the former
mayor.</LD>
<LD>   The astute woman took an active role in her son's political
career, campaigning for him in 1989, when he lost a bid for the
mayor's office, and in 1993, when he won his first term.</LD>
<TE>   On the morning her son was sworn in for his second term in 1998,
she made clear she foresaw another inaugural.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday, I will see him sworn in as president," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor, 58, credited his mother with imparting a sense
of history and the importance of establishing priorities, Mindel
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He regaled us with wonderful stories about his mother," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's father, Harold, died in 1981 of prostate cancer, the
same disease Giuliani was diagnosed with in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral was scheduled for Tuesday--the day before the former
mayor is to begin a reading of the names of World Trade Center
victims at a ground zero anniversary remembrance of the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he remained at her bedside Sunday, Giuliani was appearing
on television in taped interviews recalling the eventful period
immediately following the destruction of the monolithic city
landmarks nearly one year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani, lionized for his efforts at calming the city after the
attacks, left office at the end of last year, having been prevented
by term limits from seeking a third term.</TE>
<TE>   His mother's death comes during a tumultuous year for the former
mayor, who also settled a bitter divorce with Donna Hanover, his wife
of 20 years. Giuliani's companion, Judith Nathan, was with him at the
hospital when his mother died.</TE>
<TE>   Helen D'Avanzo Giuliani was born in 1909, the fourth of seven
children. Three of her brothers became police officers, and a fourth
became a fire captain, Mindel said.</TE>
<TE>   After Giuliani was born in 1944, she stayed home to raise him
during his early years and then went to work as a secretary for a
medical group.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani has said his mother often read six newspapers a day,
highlighting stories and teaching him to follow national affairs. He
remembers learning about the McCarthy hearings of the 1950s from her,
Mindel said.</TE>
<TE>   As he grew up, she helped organize his time and set priorities,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a phenomenal teacher to him," Mindel said.</TE>

<HD>John Lerro, 59; Harbor Pilot Haunted by Role in Deadly
Bridge Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John E. Lerro, the harbor pilot who crashed the phosphate freighter
Summit Venture into Tampa Bay's Sunshine Skyway Bridge two decades
ago, plunging 35 people to their deaths, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Lerro, who spent the rest of his life seeking redemption and
peace, died Aug. 31 in Tampa of multiple sclerosis after slipping
into a coma earlier that week.</LD>
<LD>   "He finally quit being haunted by what happened. He finally could
stop thinking about it all," said Laila Lerro, his wife of four
years.</LD>
<TE>   Lerro was 37 and near the top of his profession when the accident
occurred May 9, 1980.</TE>
<TE>   He was guiding the 608-foot freighter into the Port of Tampa when
a sudden squall with gale-force winds engulfed the empty, high-riding
ship less than a mile from the bridge. Visibility plummeted to near
zero.</TE>
<TE>   If he could anchor--and the emphasis was on if--he feared the wind
might push the Summit Venture into an oncoming ship. So he decided to
shoot for the 800-foot hole between the bridge piers, hoping to steer
safely under the high center of the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a large degree of sliding due to the wind. I'm sure the
vessel moved laterally," he testified. "I figured she'd make the
center span."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The ship slammed into a secondary support pier of the vast bridge.
A 1,297-foot chunk of the highway collapsed, and six cars, one pickup
truck and a bus fell 150 feet to the water. The pickup driver
survived after his truck bounced off the freighter's prow, but 35
other commuters drowned.</TE>
<TE>   A new $244-million bridge was opened in 1987. It's bigger, better
and safer, with a clearance of 175 feet, rather than 150; a ship's
channel 1,200 feet wide, rather than 800; and concrete islands and
bumpers protecting supports from wayward ships. The old Skyway, with
its gruesome ghosts, was torn down and its approaches were converted
to fishing piers.</TE>
<TE>   Lerro could not be reconstructed so easily.</TE>
<TE>   Before the accident, the deputy harbor pilot had worked his way up
to ship's master, taking container ships to Japan, passenger ships to
South America and chemical tankers to Europe. He was qualified to
guide ships through the Panama Canal and had steered nearly 800
vessels the size of two football fields over the tricky 50-mile
stretch from the Gulf of Mexico through Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   He was scheduled for promotion to full-fledged harbor pilot two
days after the accident, with a jump in pay from $45,000 a year to
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   A kid from the Bronx who once danced ballet at Carnegie Hall,
Lerro had gone to sea because it seemed romantic and exciting. He
spoke lyrically of his job as a pilot: "This little man is moving
that big thing. You're a very significant person. It was the reason
for getting up, the reason to be.... I was so proud of myself as a
pilot ... proud of my ability."</TE>
<TE>   But the bridge disaster changed all that. Lerro lost his health,
his career and his wife and became so depressed he contemplated
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks after the accident, he and his family holed up in a
hotel, avoiding threats and false accusations that he was an
alcoholic. His pilot's license was suspended. For months he was the
subject of state and federal hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida state officials absolved him of blame and reinstated his
license. The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3 to 2 that
Lerro had been partly responsible but said that other factors,
including the severe storm, had contributed to the accident.</TE>
<TE>   In a dissent, the board chairman, James B. King, said: "He acted
reasonably in the situation in which he found himself."</TE>
<TE>   "All the world thought John was guilty," Steve Yerrid, his
attorney, told the St. Petersburg Times in 2000. "John got some
partial, personal salvation from our defense that the storm caused
the catastrophe, and the storm was an act of God. Until John
understood that God had a hand in this, he was the only culprit."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man who has been to hell," Yerrid said. "It took a long
time to extricate him from that, and even today, 20 years later, I
think he only gets out on passes."</TE>
<TE>   Lerro returned to work for most of 1981, but then noticed he was
having trouble keeping his balance as he climbed ships' ladders. He
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease that hardens tissue
in the brain or spinal column, eroding muscle control and impairing
thought. On Dec. 24, 1981, Lerro turned in his pilot's license for
good.</TE>
<TE>   With the life he loved gone, he tried repeatedly to build a new
one. He sent out dozens of resumes for various jobs, and got back
dozens of refusals.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1985 he was hired to teach nautical science for a semester
at his old alma mater, the State University of New York's Maritime
College. He bunked in cramped, damp quarters aboard the teaching
vessel Empire State anchored under a bridge and told cadets bluntly:
"If you misjudge, you've got hell to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Lerro was even more candid in a St. Petersburg Times interview
that spring, one of his earliest after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miserable existence," he said. "I spent thousands of hours
thinking about that day. Thousands of hours. Trying to figure out:
Why me? You know what the answer is? Because. Why me? Because. Why
the poor souls who died? Because. In other words, no answers."</TE>
<TE>   "If I had life to do over again," he said, "I'd be a flute
player."</TE>
<TE>   Lerro returned to Tampa, only to have his 21-year marriage
disintegrate into divorce. He lived on disability and pension checks
and shared a small townhouse with his adult son, Charles, filling it
with comforting things: a cat, marine paintings, books and classical
recordings.</TE>
<TE>   And he enrolled in the University of South Florida, earning a
master's degree in counseling. He volunteered to talk with rape
victims and potential suicides at the Hillsborough County Crisis
Center and with convicts at the Tampa Probation and Restitution
Center.</TE>
<TE>   When Lerro counseled convicts he would say: "Everybody screws up.
I know. I invented screwup. When you get caught screwing up, keep
your dignity. If you've lost that, you've lost everything.
Self-esteem is the most important thing."</TE>
<TE>   But his comments to a reporter showed it was not as easy to do as
to say: "Piloting was beautiful. Piloting was wonderful. But the
bridge was the antithesis of piloting. It was a screwup, and there it
is for all the world to see. It was the storm and the wrong
decision.... The radar was out; the visuals were out. I ought to have
put the ship aground.... I was between the devil and the deep blue
sea. That's what I have to live with now."</TE>
<TE>   With his body as well as his mind in pain, he added, "Sanity is
the most important thing in my life. I'm not going to rethink the
Skyway now. How could I ever make up for one death? I can't. Having a
hand in 35 deaths? No way."</TE>
<TE>   Lerro tried to find an author to write a book that would cleanse
his reputation and his memories. He spent hundreds of hours with two
screenwriters who drafted a screenplay but never got the movie made.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a Florida teenager, Christian Knightly, screened a
50-minute docudrama on the disaster, called "The Fallen Sky," in a
small Clearwater theater.</TE>
<TE>   By the 20th anniversary of the disaster--two years ago--Lerro had
become too ill to work as a counselor and was confined primarily to
his bed or wheelchair. He commented briefly for the St. Petersburg
Times, demonstrating that he was still suffering from more than his
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, you don't want to hit a bridge," he said. "Not that
bridge. Not any bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had counseled criminals as one screwup to another, he
backed away from the term he had so often used to describe himself
and his collision with the bridge: "I don't find anything of myself
in that word."</TE>
<TE>   Lerro, who is survived by his wife, Laila; his son, Charles; and a
stepdaughter, Angel Klinsmith; added philosophically: "Life throws
you a lot of things that aren't bearable, and you have to find a way
to bear them."</TE>

<LD>A strong earthquake struck just off Papua New Guinea's northern
coast, causing a wave that killed three people and swept away up to
50 seaside homes, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit about 530 miles northwest of the
capital, Port Moresby, a spokesman for the Australian Geological
Survey Organization said. Some roads reportedly collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Tony Burgess of the coastal town of Wewak said, "About 40
or 50 houses were washed away. It wasn't this monstrous tidal wave
... it was more like a gentle swell."</LD>

<LD>Maoist rebels launched a major overnight attack on the remote

offices, the junior home minister said. There was no immediate word
on casualties -- communications were severed -- but a police official
said the toll could be high because about 200 police and soldiers
were posted in the town.</LD>
<LD>   The rebels, fighting to set up a one-party communist republic,
have stepped up attacks on government installations in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The latest came a day after an assault on a police post by more
than 1,000 rebels in which 49 police officers were killed.</LD>

Israel, according to a draft copy of a speech he is to deliver today.</LD>

Palestinians see peaceful negotiations as the way to resolve their
dispute.</LD>
<LD>   It calls for formal recognition of Israel as a state.</LD>
<TE>   The speech also argues that bomb attacks gave Israel justification
for harsh retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, violence continued. Palestinian officials said Israeli
tanks killed two people in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, as
Israeli forces encircled three refugee camps.</TE>

<HD>Archbishop Hints He Was Brainwashed</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Emmanuel Milingo, the Zambian archbishop who shocked Roman Catholics
by marrying in the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, says in
a new book that he may have been brainwashed.</LD>
<LD>   Milingo, 72, left the Vatican in spring 2001 to marry Maria Sung,
a 43-year-old Korean woman chosen for him by Moon, the controversial
South Korean-born evangelist. The mass wedding took place in New
York, where the archbishop kissed his bride for the cameras.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe I was the object of a type of brainwashing," he says in the
160-page "Fished Out of the Mud," which is to be published this week
by Edizioni Paoline.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't realize what I was getting myself into. I only
understood later that it was a way of them getting total control over
me," he says there.</TE>
<TE>   Milingo wrote the book with Italian journalist Michele Zanzucchi.
He refuses to reveal whether he consummated the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican, which never recognized the marriage, threatened
Milingo with excommunication. He left Sung, rejoined the Church and
went into seclusion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was naive to think that I could still keep my membership in the
Roman Catholic Church. On the other hand the reality was different.
With that act [the wedding] I became one of them," he says in the
book. "It was all so strange. It was like a strange dream."</TE>

<LD>As I read articles about various Sept. 11 observances, I see words
used like "respectful" and "tasteful," but the most important word is
missing: "genuine." We have lost the ability as a culture to honor
the moment, and well-meaning media and politicians cheapen those who
sacrificed and died in their frantic rush to get out one more book,
TV special or political photo op.</LD>
<LD>   The barrage of events leaves sensible citizens numb; both the dead
and the living deserve better. Is there some unexplored angle or
viewpoint that needs to be reviewed? Do those in the obligatory
cross-section of air passengers' widows and firefighters' orphaned
children pressed again into the spotlight with our leaders realize
they're being manipulated? Is it so absurd to think it would be
appropriate to have quiet group reflection and stress our brotherhood
as Americans?</LD>

<HD>Cheney Defends His Tenure at Halliburton</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney defended his management of Halliburton
Co., saying he assumed the oil giant's insurance would shield it
against asbestos lawsuits that have cost hundreds of millions of
dollars and helped devalue its stock.</LD>
<LD>   Most of Halliburton's asbestos claims were inherited from Dresser
Industries Inc., which the company acquired for $7.7 billion in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   His appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" was the first time Cheney
fielded questions about Halliburton since May 28, when the Securities
and Exchange Commission informed the company it was investigating its
accounting practices. Cheney was chairman and chief executive of
Halliburton from 1995 to 2000.</LD>
<TE>   He said that asbestos "afflicts a great many companies" and that
"most of the difficulties arose since I left two years ago."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of people who were victims of violent crime excluding
murder fell by 9% in 2001, sending the crime rate to its lowest level
since it was first tracked in 1973, the government reported.</LD>
<LD>   The decline was primarily because of a record low number of
reported assaults, the most common form of violent crime.</LD>
<LD>   The drop is detailed in the 2001 National Crime Victimization
Survey, which is based on interviews with victims and therefore does
not include murder.</LD>
<TE>   Preliminary figures from another FBI report taken from more than
17,000 city, county and state law enforcement agencies and released
in June reflected an increase in murder of 3.1%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state child welfare agency employs at least 183 people with
criminal pasts, including felonies such as child molestation, child
abuse, sex crimes and drug dealing, a newspaper found.</LD>
<LD>   Among the Department of Children &amp; Families employees with
criminal records, three were punished for child abuse, 22 for grand
theft, seven for aggravated battery, two for DUI manslaughter, three
for dealing drugs, 10 for aggravated assault with a weapon and nine
for welfare fraud, the Miami Herald reported.</LD>
<LD>   One employee, the head of the agency's data security team in
Tallahassee, is listed on the state's list of sexual predators for
molesting a 5-year-old boy. A department spokesman said the agency
does not consider the man a risk because he does not come into
contact with clients.</LD>
<TE>   DCF officials said the agency was aware in most cases of the
charges against employees, but administrators acknowledged that in
some cases the agency did not know about the criminal pasts.</TE>

<HD>Girl's Death Rekindles Youth Football Debate</HD>
<DH>Sports: Taylor Davison died after a head injury in
practice. But some say kids playing full contact on the gridiron is
the issue, not her gender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARTLETT, Ill.</DL>
<LD>On a perfect football Sunday, two teams of 90-pound grade-schoolers
gathered in the center of the field, held hands and, with fidgety
awkwardness, bowed their heads.</LD>
<LD>   "A moment of silence for No. 95, Taylor Davison," the announcer
said. "Rest in peace."</LD>
<LD>   Then the Bloomingdale Bears ran to their side of the field, the
Bartlett Raiders to theirs. This was the first game day for this
Raiders squad--full of Taylor's friends from last season--since the
impish 10-year-old blond died last Monday, apparently after suffering
a head injury during practice. Her new team played its first game of
the season as well Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   After somber ceremonies before both games, the young players
peered through their face masks, searching for their parents. They
didn't appear scared, but uncomfortable, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to know what the chances were of it happening to him,"
Michele Kudalis said of her son Luke. "Who knows the odds? What do
you say?"</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, the Raiders took the kickoff and moved ahead
only a few yards. A running play earned them a couple more. Everyone
on both sides seemed nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a moment that turned people's minds back purely to
football, Lucas Wantroba took a handoff, broke left, right and then
free. He sprinted 48 yards and crossed the goal line to the kind of
cheering unheard here in a week.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Taylor's own squad (all 19 teams in the league are
called the Raiders) finally scored against the Lombard Falcons, one
Bartlett coach mumbled to a spectator: "It finally feels like I can
breathe again."</TE>
<TE>   Because she was the only girl among 400 players in the league,
Taylor's death has prompted a number of questions and brought few
answers--leaving the league and parents alike feeling besieged.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't the media do human interest stories on this great,
30-year-old league with 400 football players and 400 cheerleaders?
Why focus on this?" league President Barry Brinn asked just before
game time Sunday. "Look at this beautiful day. Thousands and
thousands of kids all over the place are playing football today."</TE>
<TE>   "A real spitfire," as one parent called her Sunday, Taylor had
taken a hard hit during a full-contact practice Aug. 27. She
complained of a headache and sat out three plays, according to her
coach, Ken Minarcik, before returning to the field.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Susan Davison, has said that Taylor seemed fine and
said nothing of having a headache over the next three days. At a
light, no-contact practice Aug. 30, the girl again complained of a
headache. She began walking to the sideline, handed her helmet to
Minarcik, collapsed and vomited.</TE>
<TE>   She died three days later of a subdural hematoma--a blood clot
beneath the surface of the brain--that was caused by blunt trauma to
the head, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The office said the hematoma appeared to have emerged five to 10
days before the girl died, but noted that its precise cause is
unclear. More tests are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Since Taylor's death, some in this Chicago suburb of 37,000--and
others around the country--have found themselves wondering whether
children so small should be playing full-contact football.</TE>
<TE>   Several National Football League stars, including quarterbacks
Troy Aikman and Steve Young, have retired in recent years following
repeated head injuries. Medical studies on football players have
suggested that many concussions go undetected, and that players who
suffer multiple head injuries have an increased chance of long-term
declines in speech, memory and other brain functions.</TE>
<TE>   Some have also asked whether girls may be especially susceptible
to football-related injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Davison, who declined to comment for this story, defended
the league immediately after her daughter's death, saying Taylor not
only loved the game but also played it so well that competitors
quickly forgot about her gender.</TE>
<TE>   Raiders teams are categorized by weight first and age second.
Taylor played the last two years on teams with a 90-pound weight
limit whose players cannot turn 11 before Sept. 1. Children weighing
less than 80 pounds can play flag football, but not tackle, under the
league's rules.</TE>
<TE>   A precocious Girl Scout who loved horseback riding and the country
band Alabama, she played nearly every position on the team--from
running back to nose tackle. Treated just like every other player,
coaches say, she was nonetheless a rarity in a sport overwhelmingly
populated by boys and men.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, so few girls play football that there is not enough
evidence to know whether a 10-year-old girl wearing a football helmet
is more prone to a brain injury than a boy who endures a similar
blow, said Mary Jo Kane, head of the Tucker Center for Research on
Girls and Women in Sport. Thirty years after Title IX was enacted to
try to bring financial equity to women's collegiate sports, that is
not the question to ask, Kane argued.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that some sports, like football and boxing, are very
dangerous," Kane said. "But no one ever says men are not biologically
equipped to participate. No matter how many Muhammad Alis, no matter
how many Mark Buonicontis--who became a quadriplegic [while playing
college football in 1985]--we never suggest that. When a girl gets
hurt, that's the first thing we talk about: Maybe girls shouldn't be
playing.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I hope is that this accident doesn't scare other
girls who want to play football," Kane continued. "The risk isn't
about being a girl, it's about playing a risky sport."</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely what it was about Sunday at the perfectly
groomed Ruzicka Park, 35 miles west of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance stood a giant water bottle containing dollar bills
and some change, along with a hand-lettered sign: "Taylor Davison
Memorial Fund."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders players on both squads wore their traditional
black-and-silver uniforms, but with a new patch that reads simply
"95" sewn next to the one with the skull and crossbones.</TE>
<TE>   There was the moment of silence. A few parents crossed themselves.
Taylor's helmet sat on the bleachers. The specter of death seemed
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   So was the sense of excitement created by dozens of children,
their cleats laced up tight and eye-black smeared on just like the
pros, taking to the field on a cloudless late-summer day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always going to be in the back of our minds," Lisa Wantroba
said of Taylor's death. "Always, always, always."</TE>
<TE>   Then her son Lucas, the one who ran in for that first, thrilling
touchdown of the day, was lighting out again. Bloomingdale Bears were
falling at his feet, and the Raiders were on their way to a 13-0
victory. The other Raiders team would eke out a 2-0 win.</TE>
<TE>   "Go!" Lisa Wantroba shouted, her hands forming a bullhorn around
her mouth. "Go!"</TE>

<HD>Army Guard Wants to Scrap Some Tank Units</HD>
<DH>Military: Affected outfits would become 'mobile light
brigades.' Congress must approve proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Facing a new mission since Sept. 11, the Army National Guard plans to
transform some of its tank units into light infantry units that can
be rapidly sent to military hot spots in the United States or abroad,
Army officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The restructuring is designed to lighten the Guard force by
jettisoning some aging tanks and turning four brigades into
general-purpose "mobile light brigades" that could perform everything
from significant battlefield operations in wartime to homeland
security tasks, such as guarding nuclear plants.</LD>
<LD>   Army Secretary Thomas E. White approved the plan last month as
part of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's directive to alter the
guiding strategy of the armed forces. Rather than being ready to
fight two major wars simultaneously, the Pentagon is now preparing to
engage in a broad range of smaller conflicts and "asymmetrical"
threats--such as terrorists--on several battle fronts.</LD>
<TE>   "This initiative will help the Guard become a more deployable,
more mobile, and more flexible force, better-suited to support our
nation at home and abroad," White said Sunday at a National Guard
conference in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two months, senior Army officials have been briefed
on the plan, announced three days before the anniversary of the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The changes would require the approval of Congress, where some
members are likely to chafe at the prospect of losing heavy equipment
in their districts, and are tentatively scheduled to take effect in
fiscal year 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The revamped units could also be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina or
Kosovo to replace U.S. peacekeepers, or they could remain close to
home for domestic duties, a senior Guard official said on condition
of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We would envision this being used in a critical infrastructure
project role--the Golden Gate Bridge type of thing--or a nuclear
plant protection scenario, or perhaps a border security role," a
second senior Guard official said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Army Training and Doctrine Command is not expected to
finalize the plan until late fall, Army sources said it targets units
with aging M-1 and M-113 tanks that are costly to maintain and have
no prospect of being deployed in the near future, one of the senior
Guard officials said. Although Guard units have been sent to
Afghanistan and elsewhere in the war on terrorism, they have not
taken the breakdown-prone tanks with them.</TE>
<TE>   "The units we're looking at have the oldest equipment in the Army
inventory right now," one of the officials said. "We have units that
have equipment that's going to be falling apart before we get to it."</TE>
<TE>   The planned revamping of the Guard units would mark an interim
measure in the Army's effort to transform itself into a lighter, more
agile service that officials have dubbed "the objective force."</TE>
<TE>   "I would characterize this as a recognition that the Guard's role
has changed. We need to get past the Cold War force that we've had,"
a senior Guard official said. "We were talking about homeland
security requirements long before 9/11--9/11 just put an exclamation
point on it."</TE>
<TE>   The change will convert about one-third of the Guard's heavy
brigades, including 3,000 vehicles, to mobile light brigades. Tank
drivers would be reassigned to reconnaissance and other missions, the
officials said. All were light units in the 1970s and became heavy
units in the 1980s and 1990s. They were designed to fight Cold
War-era battles, such as a conflict with the Soviet Union or North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation is both philosophical and economical. The Army
spends about $1.5 billion a year on heavy brigades and $1 billion on
light brigades, although short-term costs would initially be higher
due to the cost of buying new equipment. Army officials said they
could not yet estimate those costs. Tracked vehicles, such as tanks,
would be replaced by Humvees, trucks and all-terrain vehicles already
in Army inventory.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Roger Schultz, director of the Army National Guard, said
he was still deciding which sites would be affected, but he added
that the changes could touch parts of as many as four Guard
divisions, each with up to 15,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Other senior Guard officials expected the impact to be limited to
two divisions in the end, with a total of four heavy brigades--each
with 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers--likely to be singled out for
transformation to light brigades. Three are from the New York-based
42nd Division. Two brigades from the 38th Division, in Michigan and
Ohio, are expected to be merged into a single brigade and transformed
into a light unit, Army sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In the 42nd Division, they could include the 3rd Brigade, based in
Buffalo, with subordinate units in New York, Buffalo and Staten
Island; the Montpelier, Vt.-based 86th Brigade, with subordinate
units in Melrose, Mass., and St. Albans, and Rutland, Vt.; and the
Ft. Dix, N.J.-based 50th Brigade, with units in Riverdale, Woodbury
and Port Murray, N.J. In the Indiana-based 38th Division, it could
include the 46th Infantry Brigade, based in Wyoming, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The units scheduled for transformation could change if more
modernized brigades opt to take part, Guard officials said. The
California-based 40th Infantry Division, for example, has M-1 tanks
and M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and is responsible for the most
populous state in the union.</TE>
<TE>   However, the adjutant general of the 40th, Maj. Gen. Paul Monroe,
said he was not inclined to volunteer his unit before he knows what
shape the larger transformation of the Army, due to be completed in
2030, will take. The 40th's duties have already changed three times
since the 1960s, he noted, and each revision has driven some soldiers
out. In addition, the California Guard is still undergoing a
reorganization that began four years ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "So you lose a lot of people and you have to go out and recruit a
lot of other people," Monroe said. "I would just as soon not put
California through another major reorganization until we know how the
Army's going to look."</TE>
<TE>   The Guard has about 450,000 part-time soldiers, but the exact
number in some divisions remains unclear. Some units have been
criticized for falsely reporting higher numbers to hold onto federal
money and to mask their difficulty in retaining soldiers. In January,
a recruiter in Indiana, Master Sgt. Robert Wyse, was convicted of
forgery for faking physical exams on some would-be soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Guard officials say they are conscious of staffing concerns and
plan to limit the effect of the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a concern as you convert from one skill to
another," Schultz said. "There'll be some retraining.... It's our
intent to minimize the turbulence."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Site Should Hold Memory of Nation's Loss</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>America is haphazard about its history. It took nearly a decade
before any concrete steps were taken to memorialize the carnage at
Pearl Harbor. It took 40 years to finish the Washington Monument.
Congress didn't declare Memorial Day a national holiday until 1888,
22 years after Civil War veterans began placing flowers on the graves
of the fallen every May 30. American life always hurtles forward,
often so fast that it tramples the past.</LD>
<LD>   That danger is resurfacing in the debate over what to do with the
site of the World Trade Center. Decisions that will shape how future
generations see and remember the attacks that destroyed the twin
towers last Sept. 11 are taking place haphazardly, with local
political and economic interests threatening to eclipse the nation's
stake in recording that terrible day.</LD>
<LD>   For now, the decisions on how--and what--to rebuild on the site
are primarily in the hands of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.,
formed by New York state and city officials to redevelop the area.
(The site's owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
also has a say.) The LMDC's initial proposals didn't inspire much
confidence: In July it released half a dozen blueprints that all
leaned too heavily toward putting office buildings over the shattered
ground.</LD>
<TE>   After a volley of criticism, the LMDC now says it will pick five
teams to develop new plans by Sept. 30. And it's planning a separate
architectural competition next year to design a memorial to the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, there's been much too casual an assumption that
this group, even with local elected officials, should make the final
decisions on how to use the site. That deference is misplaced. There
is a national interest in ensuring that the tragedy is memorialized
in the right way, and a national lever to enforce that interest: New
York has already received billions in federal dollars for the cleanup
and is seeking millions more for the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, New Yorkers in Congress want it both ways: Rep.
Jerrold Nadler and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, both Democrats, are
finishing a bill that would have the federal government match the
funds raised locally to construct a memorial. When the memorial is
completed, the National Park Service would assume responsibility for
running it.</TE>
<TE>   That's all reasonable enough. But the catch is this: The bill
insists that the public, through the federal government, shouldn't
have any say in designing or planning the memorial; it should just
foot half the bill for whatever the LMDC produces. Congress should
think twice about that deal.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Washington signed a no-strings check to build the
memorial at the site of the Oklahoma City bombing. In 1997, Congress
passed and President Clinton signed legislation committing Washington
to pay half the cost of the memorial designed by a local commission,
with no input from the federal (or local) government. But that was a
commission with no other responsibility except building the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The group overseeing the rebuilding of the World Trade Center
site--mostly local business leaders--is inherently more conflicted.
Its charge is to redevelop the area, which means that, even with the
best intentions, it must consider commercial as well as historical
interests. Compounding the problem, the Port Authority initially
demanded that the redesign include as much office space as in the
original towers: 11 million square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the uproar against the original proposals, the Port Authority
is signaling a retreat from that demand. The pressure to scale back
the commercial presence is likely to increase since former Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's argument in a Time magazine essay last week
that the entire 16-acre site should be set aside as a memorial, with
no commercial activity.</TE>
<TE>   As influential as Giuliani is, his won't be the final word.
Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research
Center, notes that many people in the surrounding neighborhoods want
at least some commercial and retail presence to keep those
communities alive. That's reasonable, to a point.</TE>
<TE>   But this site now belongs not just to the city or the landowners
or the neighbors or even the victims' families; it belongs to the
nation. It's no more appropriate to let New York officials make these
decisions alone than it would have been to let the Gettysburg Chamber
of Commerce decide what to do with the Civil War battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Gettysburg may be the most relevant model for protecting
the national interest at the site. In the 1890s, the federal
government went to the Supreme Court to stop a private company that
wanted to build trolley tracks over a part of the Gettysburg
battlefield it owned so it could operate a profit-making tour. In its
brief to the high court, the government wrote: "The ground whereon
great conflicts have taken place, especially those where great
interests or principles were at stake, becomes at once of so much
public interest that its preservation is essentially a matter of
public concern."</TE>
<TE>   As Civil War historian James McPherson noted in a recent essay,
the Supreme Court agreed--and today, the battlefield, like the nearby
cemetery where Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address, has
been preserved in the national park system.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should be prepared to act just as forcefully again. If
the LMDC produces a plan that gives a memorial its due, then fine.
But the federal government should intervene if it appears that
parochial commercial considerations are overshadowing the national
stake in building a lasting monument to the losses of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The physical monument will be only one part of how we remember
that day. Already, communities are establishing their own memorials,
with ceremonies this week commemorating the loss. This is the way
history breathes, in the organic life of families and neighborhoods.
But public decisions will guide these private reflections.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the signal sent at the World Trade Center site will
reverberate for years. Building new office towers there would show a
commitment to persevere, but also an eagerness to forget. More
powerful would be an empty sky where the towers used to stand,
anchored by a memorial of scale to the tragedy. That is how this
generation can show all generations to come it understands that what
was lost on Sept. 11 can never be replaced.</TE>

<DH>Afghanistan: Provincial soldiers and warlord's men battle
in southeast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany</DL>
<LD>Afghan President Hamid Karzai, en route to the United States for
ceremonies commemorating the Sept. 11 attacks, pledged Sunday to
persevere in fighting terrorism, even as violence flared in the
southeastern Afghan city of Khowst.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda fighters and Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers who gave
them shelter "are defeated as a movement but continue to act as
individuals," Karzai said during a German stopover. "Of course, they
will try some desperate acts."</LD>
<LD>   "We will continue to fight against terrorism," Karzai said before
he and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met at a U.S. air base
next to Frankfurt international airport.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai is to meet President Bush and address the U.N. General
Assembly during his five-day visit to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential spokesman Said Fazel Akbar said Karzai would visit
ground zero at the World Trade Center and "express his condolences to
the American people" over the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to the United States comes three days after Karzai
survived an assassination attempt in the southern city of Kandahar.
Karzai's U.S. bodyguards killed the gunman. An Afghan security guard
and an Afghan teenager who deflected the gunman's aim were also
killed in the exchange of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops took over security for Karzai after the July 6
assassination of Afghan Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai leaves behind a tense capital, Kabul, where security was
stepped up after a car bombing Thursday, just hours before the
attempt on his life.</TE>
<TE>   And conflicts flared Sunday in volatile Khowst, where a grenade
exploded in a music shop and fighting broke out between gunmen loyal
to a renegade warlord and government-allied soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were seriously injured in the explosion in Khowst,
where American soldiers are based, said Lt. Tina Kroske, a U.S.
military spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Music and video shops have often been targets of attacks in
Khowst, a stronghold of the former Taliban regime, which outlawed
such entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Late Sunday, militiamen loyal to warlord Bacha Khan attacked a
checkpoint in Khowst controlled by Gov. Hakim Taniwal, said Interior
Ministry spokesman Alishah Paktiawal.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is allied with Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   No other details of the fighting were immediately available.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>Beginning in stories published in 2006, the Afghan warlord Bacha Khan is
identified as Pacha Khan Zadran. (Second reference is "Pacha Khan.")</TE>

<HD>Leaders on Austria's Right Bow Out of Party</HD>
<DH>Politics: Three top members of the Freedom Party resign
amid a struggle for control with controversial former leader Joerg
Haider.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Austria's vice chancellor and two other Freedom Party leaders
resigned Sunday amid a rift in their far-right party, a move expected
to lead to early elections.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, Finance Minister Karl-Heinz
Grasser and the party's parliamentary speaker, Peter Westenthaler,
said they were resigning after a conflict with former party leader
Joerg Haider, a controversial figure known for past comments
defending the Hitler era.</LD>
<LD>   Riess-Passer, who is also the Freedom Party's leader, said the
conflict with Haider over control of the party made it impossible to
work effectively. Haider is governor of the southern province of
Carinthia.</LD>
<TE>   The Austria Press Agency, citing unnamed Freedom Party sources,
said the current center-right coalition led by Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel's People's Party would end its work Sept. 19 and that new
elections would take place in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Party will meet Oct. 20 to elect a new leadership,
Riess-Passer said. Until then, Defense Minister Herbert Scheibner
will act as party leader.</TE>
<TE>   Riess-Passer said she was forced to recognize "a motion of no
confidence" from within the party ranks. "These intraparty
disagreements have crippled the party and have seriously hurt the
trust of the voters," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said it was no longer possible for her and the other two to
perform their duties effectively without the support of the party.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Party has been plagued for months by a conflict over
who is in control: Riess-Passer, the elected leader, or Haider, a
charismatic figure who led the party to popularity.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, after a surprise electoral showing by the Haider-led
Freedom Party, the European Union slapped temporary sanctions on
Austria to protest the role in government of a party viewed as beyond
the pale of accepted Western norms.</TE>
<TE>   Under Riess-Passer, the Freedom Party has sought to ditch its
image as a home to racists and anti-Semites, although some of its
officials continue to draw fire for what critics say are xenophobic
comments.</TE>
<TE>   The recent party conflict has centered on a government proposal to
reform the tax system in 2003 to benefit low-income groups.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the vast damage caused by recent record floods, the
governing coalition has said the nation can no longer afford to pass
the reform next year.</TE>

<HD>Germans Giving Greens' Fischer a Closer Listen</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Foreign minister's message on the environment has
a renewed relevance in the wake of devastating floods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORDERSTEDT, Germany</DL>
<LD>His message is one that hardly wins over the average hedonist: Drive
less. Eat lean. Pay more for food, gas and government for the common
good.</LD>
<LD>   But as a man who has embraced virtue after decades of
self-indulgence, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer strikes a chord
with every German who would like to be a better person, if just a
little bit later.</LD>
<LD>   Hands down the most popular public figure in the country with a
78% approval rating, the 54-year-old Fischer has emerged in this
flood-ravaged election season not only as a paragon of social
consciousness but as the canary in the coal mine whose warnings on
the environment went unheeded.</LD>
<TE>   "This flood catastrophe is just a reminder that we aren't living
only for the here and now," the Greens party foreign minister told a
cheering campaign rally in this city on the edge of Hamburg. "We have
to live with regard for tomorrow and the fate of future generations."</TE>
<TE>   It is a message that has surprisingly strong resonance now, even
among the conservative farmers and fast-driving fanatics who people
the northern German reaches where Fischer has brought his election
bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   And coming from a former street fighter and onetime overweight
bohemian--he was sworn into his first government post in 1985 in open
collar and battered tennis shoes--the appeals seem to give his
listeners something to aspire to.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of a devastating flood that the Greens and many
scientists blame on global warming, Fischer and his party are
enjoying a renaissance of credibility that has transformed them from
an albatross around the neck of their partners in the government of
Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to the coalition's
last best hope for reelection Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the Greens' ideas are making a comeback. "Tempo 30,"
their aim of limiting drivers to 30 kilometers per hour, or about 20
mph, in cities and a proposal that Germans give up foreign vacations
three years out of four to cut jet-fuel emissions remain, in the view
of most people, decidedly harebrained.</TE>
<TE>   But even in this conservative heartland, Germans are paying
renewed attention to the connections between their behavior and the
crises that have befallen them, from cataclysmic weather to the
culinary scourge of "mad cow" disease.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the flood catastrophe, journalists were always asking me
why our party is relevant. Now they don't ask," Fischer observed in
an interview aboard the Joschka Express, an environmentally friendly
bus carrying his campaign message and clean-living mantra to the
masses. "We've recovered ourselves quite well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Party Rises in Polls</TE>
<TE>   Polls now give the Greens a good chance of winning 8% of the vote
in the election, whereas only a few weeks ago they were at risk of
political extinction. After 19 straight state and federal election
setbacks, the party was polling less than the 5% needed to take seats
in Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   With Germans frustrated by 10% unemployment and gasoline prices
topping $4 a gallon, even those who traditionally back the left were
turned off by the steady erosion of core Greens values as the party
was forced to compromise in its unfamiliar role as a partner in
power.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer's own existential crisis occurred in the early 1990s,
before the 1998 election that brought the left-of-center Social
Democrats and Greens into office. As he watched Serbian nationalists
slaughter civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina while Europeans stayed on
the sidelines, he concluded that pacifism at times could be worse
than war.</TE>
<TE>   His backing of German participation in Balkans peacekeeping and
offensive action in the 1999 NATO assault on Yugoslavia deepened the
ideological rift that has long run through his party.</TE>
<TE>   When Schroeder asked German lawmakers to endorse troop deployments
to Afghanistan in November, a fundamentalist minority of Greens
threatened to scuttle the action, prompting the chancellor to issue a
put-up-or-shut-up edict that could have forced the government's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to show that it was more than lip service we were paying
to the issue, and it was one of the hardest political battles I've
ever had to fight," Fischer said of the standoff, during which he
managed to persuade enough Greens to approve the deployment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Different Iraq Views</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's team has been taking transatlantic heat in recent
weeks for warning Washington against expanding the war on terrorism
to an assault on Iraq. Seen by the Bush administration as a campaign
tactic by a trailing incumbent, Germany's reluctance actually
bespeaks a genuine fear of overextension, Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply skeptical in regard to this Iraq discussion.... We
believe the priorities need to be set differently," said the foreign
minister, noting that the rationale for acting against Iraq has
strayed. Initially, he said, the goal was to force the resumption of
U.N. weapons inspections; now it is the elimination of a recognized,
if repugnant, foreign leader.</TE>
<TE>   Calling Schroeder's challenger for the chancellery "yesterday's
man," Fischer elicits laughs even from supporters of Bavarian Gov.
Edmund Stoiber with good-humored mockery of the fussy conservative.
But his witty jibes merely soften up his audience for the passionate
railings against greed that come later.</TE>
<TE>   Though some political observers contend that there is little
difference between the policies of the current leadership and those
of the conservative challengers, Fischer argues that there are
dangerous consequences in an opposition victory.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most troubling proposals by Stoiber's Christian Social
Union and its Christian Democratic Union and Free Democrat allies is
a plan to resurrect nuclear power production--a sector the Greens
managed to mothball in favor of investment in windmill parks, solar
technology and new biomass fuels made of combustible crops that can
be burned to produce energy without releasing harmful emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the terrible lessons we learned from Sept. 11 was that
there is no such thing as total security," Fischer told his audience
here, alluding to fears of terrorist strikes against nuclear
facilities that stand across the Elbe River.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the bus, after a dinner stop for salad and sparkling
water, there's neither coffee brewing nor beer cooling in the fridge.
On the Joschka Express, snacks are apples and bananas, and the mood
is more missionary than festive. Alternately animated and fatigued,
Fischer says that his job as foreign minister and vice chancellor
isn't fun anymore but that he still wants it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our work for this country isn't done, and I am strongly convinced
that we can do it better than the others," he said, exuding more of
the sacrificial quality that has come to define him since he took up
marathon running five years ago and lost 70 pounds.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Adapt to Annoying Searches, Ubiquitous Guards</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Constant fear and loss of privacy have driven
people to find innovative solutions. Mental health experts are
watching closely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Having your purse, your pockets and your body poked, prodded and
squeezed up to a dozen times a day has put Israelis at the cutting
edge of what populations must endure in the name of security.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is this spurring interest among mental health experts
worldwide as other countries move in the same direction in the
post-Sept. 11 world, it's prompting innovation among Israelis as they
learn to bear the unbearable.</LD>
<LD>   Tali Alon, a 35-year-old manager in the hotel industry, says she
and her friends now open their purses in an almost Pavlovian response
when entering a shop--not only in Israel, but overseas.</LD>
<TE>   House painter Mike Whelan, 49, no longer drives into underground
parking lots because he's tired of explaining what's in his trunk.
Some women have switched to transparent purses that show everything.
And Sheera Serbin, a 25-year-old ceramics student, has stopped using
a bag altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to carry everything in my purse," she said. "There'd be
seven types of tape, pliers, enough to survive in the desert for a
week. Now I only carry what fits in my pocket."</TE>
<TE>   While this nation has felt threatened one way or another for much
of its existence, the past several months have brought the country to
a new low as suicide bombings hit civilians where they live. And
Jerusalem has become Israel's "ground zero."</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere you turn here, there are security guards. Walk across
the street, enter a parking lot, drop into a grocery store, stop for
lunch--with each of life's daily activities comes another search.
Tamar Samet, 60, a piano teacher, says she's been through so many,
she dreams about them.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health experts say Israel's stress, its adaptations and its
mass trauma are turning it into an international laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   "There's growing interest in the U.S. and the world in how we're
coping and what measures we're taking here," said Hanoch Yerushalmi,
a psychologist and head of the counseling center at Hebrew
University. "Americans are looking more carefully at how Israelis
handle terror--not just how we're shrinking in fear, but how we're
really living with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'What a Life'</TE>
<TE>   Yerushalmi has helped scores of students, faculty members and
administrators with post-traumatic stress after a bomb in the
school's cafeteria a month ago killed nine people, including five
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis say they readily accept the constant intrusions on
their privacy as the price for living here. "At first, it's strange.
Then it irritates you. Eventually, you just stop thinking about it,"
said Dov Sirkis, a 50-year-old laborer on disability leave. "But what
a life: There are now more security guards downtown than civilians.
The police station has moved into the streets."</TE>
<TE>   With more Israelis arming themselves, the airport authority has
started warning people to leave their guns at home before heading
overseas. More common are run-of-the-mill humiliations--the tampons
or condoms that tumble out unexpectedly, your dirty laundry being
pawed through.</TE>
<TE>   "My hash pipe fell out one time," said Eiall Bandero, a
20-year-old student. "It was rather awkward."</TE>
<TE>   Security companies acknowledge that they see some strange, smelly,
even illegal things. But most say they turn a blind eye to almost
anything other than weapons or bombs.</TE>
<TE>   This is a necessary adjustment as the boundary shifts between
public and private life, experts say. "The guards pretend not to see
it, and people pretend it didn't happen," said Gabriel Ben-Dor,
sociologist and head of the National Security Studies Center at Haifa
University.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skeptical of Security</TE>
<TE>   In Israel's battered economy, jobs as security guards are among
the few on offer these days. While most are doing a heroic job for
little money, the economy has attracted others for whom security
isn't a lifelong calling.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at some of these guards and think: They're the last ones
who are going to save us," said Dina Bar Menachem, a 22-year-old
studying literature at Hebrew University. "Many are old. Some don't
speak Hebrew. If there was an actual terrorist, I don't know how well
they'd do."</TE>
<TE>   Ola Kuchles, 45, the owner of a small neighborhood restaurant in
Jerusalem that doesn't use a security guard, recalls a recent trip
she took to the beach. Her husband didn't have a bag, so she put his
gun in her purse, then forgot about it and went through a security
check. She breezed right by.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe and restaurant owners acknowledge that the quality of guards
varies, as with anything else. But they add that it's as much about
mental peace of mind as physical protection.</TE>
<TE>   Some restaurants now advertise their security, and customers often
check out the guards before the menu.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy when they search closely," said Batya Azo, 51, an
insurance company manager. "And when they don't, I'm nervous. I won't
go to a place that doesn't have security, and I'll call ahead to
check."</TE>
<TE>   Security companies claim to search everyone equally. But guards
admit privately that they search men or Israeli Arabs more carefully
than women or Israeli Jews. Having three children under 4 years old
also means you're generally waved through, said 30-year-old mother
Ilana Hanzin.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis say they only realize how crazy their lives have
become when they travel overseas. On a recent trip to the Czech
Republic, ceramics student Serbin shunned Prague's busy squares after
months of avoiding all crowds back home. "The fear becomes second
nature," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not that foreign trips don't have their own risks. "I'm fed up
with the security situation and had to leave, so I spent August in
Greece," said Chaim, a 57-year-old who declined to give his last
name. "Unfortunately, I ended up losing $2,000 in the casinos."</TE>
<TE>   Israelis acknowledge the internal wear and tear. "There's a
definite hunkering down," literature student Bar Menachem said. "It's
pervasive. There aren't enough psychologists to take our stress
away."</TE>
<TE>   Closely related is a feeling that the walls are closing in. "It
used to be the attacks only happened up north, then in Jerusalem,
then on my street. Now it's my school cafeteria," Bar Menachem added.
"It feels like there's no place to hide."</TE>
<TE>   People say this stress shows up in various forms. Drivers are
becoming crazier, and there's more domestic violence in the news,
more petty fights. Doctors say bottled-up pressure leads people to
overreact in other parts of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "You become mentally tired," said Whelan, the painter. "It really
wears you down."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone has a story to tell about how close they came to a
suicide bombing or armed attack. Certainly many have had close calls
in Jerusalem, say mental health experts. But the stories are also
exaggerated, a way of giving concrete form to people's inner fears.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time there's a bomb, everyone says they were just about to
go down this street or over to that ATM but then decided not to,"
hotel manager Alon said. "I'm sure many are true. But a lot are
folklore. I think it's a way of dealing with the death all around
you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quirky Behavior</TE>
<TE>   People also develop their own habits and quirks to avoid danger.
Often their choices aren't particularly scientific or effective,
experts say, but they give people the illusion of control over their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Thus people may shun the No. 18 bus, which they deem an unlucky
number or unsafe, while riding another route. Or a student at Hebrew
University may refuse to sleep in Jerusalem, opting instead to drive
the hour each way to Tel Aviv every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Statistically, there's a much worse chance of dying driving,"
psychologist Yerushalmi said. "But people calculate risks in their
own unique ways. They're trying to make sense out of a nonsensical
existence."</TE>
<TE>   Many say they spend a great deal of time looking around them. Last
month, police released a how-to manual for identifying suicide bomber
suspects: Watch for excessive nervousness, people who sweat
profusely, mumble to themselves or wear bulky clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go with my gut feeling," said David Vaknin, a 24-year-old
messenger who reckons he goes through 50 checkpoints a day for his
job. "Still, you never know. They could be dressed like a soldier or
a rabbi."</TE>
<TE>   Even as security fears invade almost all areas of their lives,
even their dreams, most people say it's worth it. "I still love this
country," insurance company manager Azo said. "I wouldn't live
anywhere else."</TE>

<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>New season, new venue. Doesn't matter. Whether it's by the shores of
Lake Michigan or in the heart of the farmland, the Chicago Bears keep
finding magical ways to produce victories.</LD>
<LD>   This was supposed to be a time of transition for the Bears, who
will play their home games downstate at the University of Illinois'
Memorial Stadium while Soldier Field undergoes a $600-million
renovation. Instead their opening game looked a whole lot like last
year, as the Bears used a late interception by free safety Mike Brown
and a touchdown pass from Jim Miller to David Terrell with 28 seconds
remaining to complete their comeback from a 10-point deficit in the
fourth quarter and beat the Minnesota Vikings, 27-23.</LD>
<LD>   "Deja vu?" Miller suggested.</LD>
<TE>   Sure.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Bears trailed Minnesota by seven points in the
fourth quarter and came back to win. They were down by 15 to San
Francisco in the fourth quarter and rallied to win in overtime, when
Brown returned an interception for a touchdown. The next week, the
Bears rallied from 14 back in the fourth and Brown did it again with
another interception return in overtime to beat the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears even trailed the lowly Detroit Lions by a touchdown in
the fourth before coming back to win. That's just how they do it. So
after Minnesota's Doug Brien kicked a 42-yard field goal to put the
Vikings ahead, 23-13, with 9:07 left to play Sunday, the Bears knew
the drill.</TE>
<TE>   First they turned past the first page of their conservative
playbook and threw to Marty Booker for a 54-yard gain. That took the
Bears to the Minnesota 24-yard line. It was the most memorable part
of Booker's eight-catch, 198-yard day. Booker dropped a couple of
passes, including one on Chicago's last drive, but there would be no
goats for the Bears on Sunday. They kept pulling heroes out of their
pockets. The offensive line and running back Anthony Thomas produced
nothing for most of the afternoon, but Thomas ran for gains of 11 and
seven yards before rumbling into the end zone from one yard out to
bring the Bears within</TE>
<TE>   three.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was Brown's turn. He missed most of training camp because
of a broken hand. He missed good chunks of this game because of heat
exhaustion and required two bags of intravenous fluids. Yet where was
he when it mattered, when Minnesota's Daunte Culpepper threw a long
pass to Randy Moss with less than three minutes to play? Right where
he always is: the right place.</TE>
<TE>   "I just happen to be in the spots that I'm supposed to be," Brown
said. "During the game, something's going to happen, especially in
the safety position."</TE>
<TE>   He ran over, jumped and picked off Culpepper's pass at the 33-yard
line, and returned it to midfield with 2:34 on the clock. The Bears
moved down the field and scored the winning touchdown when Miller
found Terrell in the end zone from nine yards out with 28 seconds
left to play.</TE>
<TE>   The same David Terrell who was out of favor with dropped passes
throughout last season. The same one who was in trouble for an
alleged altercation outside a nightclub this summer. The same one who
was the biggest critic of playing at Memorial Stadium because he
remembered playing there while he was at Michigan and the stench from
the nearby farm that sometimes wafted over the field. Apparently
everyone got a chance at redemption Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears were dominated in the rough-and-tough stuff for much of
the afternoon. Minnesota rushed for 64 yards in the first half while
the Bears gained only nine yards on the ground. Miller fumbled at his
33 in the last minute of the first half, leading to an easy Moss
touchdown catch. The defense that gave up only 13 points a game last
season allowed 23.</TE>
<TE>   "We overcame a lot of careless mistakes, and we just kept on
working," Miller said. "The game is 60 minutes and we definitely used
all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Said Larry Whigham, Brown's backup: "I don't know why we make it
dramatic. But you can't ask for anything better. And it's not luck.
We created it."</TE>
<TE>   They also carved out a memorable debut at their temporary home.
There actually are some deep ties between the Bears and the
University of Illinois. Franchise founder George Halas lettered in
three sports here, and he used his school colors when he clad the
Bears in orange and blue. Dick Butkus, one in a line of fierce Bear
middle linebackers that includes Bill George, Mike Singletary and now
Brian Urlacher, was an All-American at Illinois. All of that history
hasn't made the transition easier. The Bears take a 50-minute charter
flight to Champaign on the eve of game day while their Chicago-area
fans have to drive 2 1/2 hours to Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   Enough of them made the trip to pack the stadium with 63,226 fans.
If the players missed anything Sunday, it was the lakefront breeze.
The year-old Astroplay surface at Illinois has a base of ground-up
rubber tires. The rubber heated up Sunday to give the field
temperatures between 110 and 120 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Bears won in a game that provided NFL-caliber
excitement in a collegiate atmosphere. Did that change Terrell's
opinion of Memorial Stadium?</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't like it," he said. "I'm a Michigan man. But I guess
this is our new home."</TE>
<TE>   And it looks as if the Bears' old winning formula didn't get lost
in the move.</TE>

and this is all the incentive a true baseball fan needs: The two
hottest teams in the major leagues play tonight at Edison Field, the
first in a four-game series with first place at stake in the American
League West.</LD>
<LD>   In the home dugout, wearing red on their heads: the Angels,
winners of 10 consecutive games. In the visiting dugout, wearing
white elephants on their sleeves: the Oakland Athletics, winners of
22 of their last 23 games.</LD>
<TE>   With Troy Glaus hitting two home runs and driving in four runs
Sunday, the Angels dumped the Baltimore Orioles, 6-2, setting up this
scenario: If the Angels win three of four games, they'll move into a
first-place tie with the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "Playoff atmosphere," Angel closer Troy Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be four great baseball games," Angel pitcher Jarrod
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have not played a more important regular-season series
at home since 1989, when Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco--and, yes, the
notorious Dave Henderson--led Oakland in a three-game AL West
showdown that attracted crowds of more than 60,000 to Anaheim
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won 91 games that season but lost the division title to
the A's. The Angels could win more games this season and still lose
the division title to the A's, although the loss would not sting
nearly as much because a wild-card entry into the playoffs was not
available then.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lead the Seattle Mariners by four games for the wild
card, with 20 to play. The Boston Red Sox are virtually eliminated,
all but blowing their golden ticket of seven remaining games against
the pitiful Tampa Bay Devil Rays by tumbling 8 1/2 games behind the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   In this magical season, the milestones keep on coming for the
Angels. For the first time in franchise history, they swept the
Orioles in Baltimore. For the first time since 1979, they went
undefeated on a trip of six or more games. If the Angels win tonight,
they'll tie the club record for consecutive victories, set in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   And their September demons have been exorcised: The Angels already
have won seven games this month, one more than they won last
September.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels almost outsmarted themselves Sunday. They plan to bring
Washburn, their ace, back on three days' rest in Thursday's series
finale, assuming he reports no post-start soreness today. So, with a
5-1 lead after six innings, they felt comfortable removing Washburn,
who had made 103 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a little bit left," he said. "But we've got some games
against our division coming up. It was time for me to come out of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, the game suddenly got less comfortable. Al Levine,
who replaced Washburn, faced five batters, giving up two walks and a
hit before the Angels could yank him. Levine, possibly pitching
himself off a potential playoff roster, has given up 11 hits in his
last 4 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   With the tying run at the plate, Ben Weber replaced Levine and
restored order. Weber walked home a run, then shut out the Orioles
over the final 2 1/3 innings for his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   So here come the A's. Earlier in the week, Oakland pitcher Barry
Zito had expressed amazement that the A's could not lose for three
weeks and still not shake the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they're thinking about us," Washburn said. "I'm not
going to lie to you: We're thinking about them.... When they're
winning 20 in a row and we're chasing them, we're thinking about
them."</TE>
<TE>   The A's are coming off consecutive playoff appearances, but the
Angels have not advanced to postseason play since 1986. Glaus said
that "Nobody around here is not going to get uptight," and Darin
Erstad said he planned to worry about his fantasy football team
Sunday night, but Weber debunked any idea that the Angels have
spooked the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been overblown, with everybody saying they're concerned
about us and we're just relaxed, watching football in the clubhouse,"
Weber said. "They're a pretty laid-back club, and they're in first
place. We have to go after them."</TE>

<KH>DENVER 23, ST. LOUIS 16</KH>
<HD>Griese Has Staying Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Denver Broncos were a field goal away from replacing Brian Griese
with Steve Beuerlein in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   It's a good thing for the Broncos that St. Louis kicker Jeff
Wilkins missed.</LD>
<LD>   Griese threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns and led a 71-yard
drive for the deciding score as the Broncos beat the Rams, 23-16,
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Griese played a solid first half--10 for 16 for 110 yards--but was
booed after two interceptions and a fumble in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Beuerlein began warming up as Wilkins lined up for a tying field
goal midway through the fourth, but was called back when the kick
came up short.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, thoughts went through my mind in the third quarter when we
were a little flat," Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan said. "If they had
kicked that field goal, I felt we would have needed a spark."</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan left Griese in and he responded by completing four of
four passes for 56 yards on the deciding scoring drive.</TE>
<TE>   Griese capped it with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Ed McCaffrey
that put the Broncos up, 23-13, with just under six minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had a bad quarter, and I didn't play very well in
the third quarter," said Griese, who finished 18 for 27.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time, I think the mark of a good player and a
good team is that you show the character to come back from adversity,
because adversity is a part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Denver pressured Kurt Warner, held Marshall Faulk mostly in check
and played physically against St. Louis' receivers to end the Rams'
winning streak on the road at nine. The Patriots used a similar
tactic to beat the Rams in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched tapes of the Super Bowl and saw New England really
popping guys in the mouth," Bronco linebacker John Mobley said. "We
saw that they didn't like that and knew it was something that we
wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Faulk, the league most valuable player in 2000, had a career-high
14 catches for 91 yards, but had only 19 yards rushing in 10 carries.
He finished one yard short of becoming the ninth player in league
history to gain 15,000 yards from scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Warner was 32 for 41 for 315 yards, but didn't have a touchdown,
was sacked three times and threw an interception.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a great job up front," Warner said. "We just couldn't
pick up some of their schemes. They wouldn't let us get a push. We'd
get our momentum, but then get stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Said St. Louis Coach Mike Martz: "I thought they took the fight
out of us pretty good in the first half."</TE>

<KH>SAN DIEGO 34, CINCINNATI 6</KH>
<HD>Charger Victory Is a Real Brees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Drew Brees already has a legacy.</LD>
<LD>   In his first NFL start, Brees threw two touchdown passes, led a
95-yard drive and got in a few licks on Cincinnati Bengal defenders
Sunday while leading the San Diego Chargers to a 34-6 victory.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-year-old quarterback did it all with pronounced cool on a
90-degree afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "Seriously, my heartbeat was probably like 40," Brees said. "I
have a resting heart rate of 38, which is pretty incredible. I swear
it was right around there. I was just relaxed out there, having a
good time."</TE>
<TE>   The record-setting passer from Purdue appeared in only one game as
a rookie, but looked experienced well beyond his year. He was 15 of
19 for 160 yards and made gritty plays that impressed teammates--
throwing a downfield block on a reverse, running over a safety on a
scramble.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see that too often," said Curtis Conway, who caught one
of the touchdown passes. "That's one of the big things about him.
He's a football player, not one of those wimpy quarterbacks."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only star. LaDainian Tomlinson had 114 yards in 21
carries, and one of the NFL's toughest run defenses of the last few
seasons clamped down on Corey Dillon, who had 10 yards in nine
carries.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen an offensive explosion like that," linebacker
Junior Seau said. "Brees was poised. We're looking for great things
from him. It was a treat seeing our offense going up and down the
field."</TE>
<TE>   While Marty Schottenheimer's coaching debut with San Diego was an
overwhelming success, the Bengals' debut with Gus Frerotte as the
starting quarterback couldn't have gone any worse.</TE>
<TE>   In all respects, the NFL's worst team since 1991 played down to
its distinction. It was the most lopsided home-opening loss in
franchise history and the Bengals' worst opening loss overall since a
45-14 drubbing in Denver in 1991, the start of their dismaying run.</TE>

<HD>Chiefs Keep Heads in Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>In a matter of seconds, Dwayne Rudd lost his head, his helmet and the
game.</LD>
<LD>   Rudd drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for throwing his
helmet in celebration, setting up Morten Andersen's 30-yard field
goal with no time showing Sunday and giving the Kansas City Chiefs a
stunning 40-39 win over the Cleveland Browns.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sick," Brown Coach Butch Davis said. "To have something like
that happen at the end is inexcusable."</LD>
<TE>   And unbelievable for the Browns, who also had a bizarre finish in
their home finale last season when angry fans threw thousands of
plastic beer bottles on the field to protest a call overturned by
instant replay.</TE>
<TE>   Bottles are now banned in Browns Stadium. Rudd's lone projectile
cost Cleveland this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't have taken it off," Rudd said. "It's against the
rules. I thought we had won."</TE>
<TE>   Rudd, thinking he had sacked Kansas City's Trent Green, had his
back to the play and didn't see the quarterback flip the ball to
323-pound tackle John Tait, who rumbled 28 yards to the Brown 25.</TE>
<TE>   As Rudd retrieved his helmet--which he tossed 15 yards down
field--the officials moved the ball half the distance to the goal
line for Andersen, whose game-winning kick capped a 23-point fourth
quarter for Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Priest Holmes matched a team record with four touchdown
runs--three in the final 9:06--and rushed for 122 yards for the
Chiefs, who trailed, 30-17, with 11:19 left after Cleveland's Phil
Dawson kicked a 34-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Right then, we've got to shut the door," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Holcomb, who started at quarterback for the injured Tim
Couch, completed 27 of 39 passes for 326 yards and three touchdowns
for the Browns.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson had four field goals for Cleveland, which lost three games
on the final play in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's fourth field goal with 29 seconds left extended his
streak to 19 in a row dating to last season and put the Browns ahead,
39-37.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cleveland holder Chris Gardocki was called for taunting
on the kick, forcing Dawson to kick off from his own 15, and the
Chiefs returned it to the 35.</TE>
<TE>   On first down, Green ran for 12 yards and quickly lined up the
offense before spiking the ball with four seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs sent all their receivers into the right side of the end
zone to try a "Hail Mary" play. Green was flushed from the pocket and
was about to be sacked by Rudd when he alertly tossed the ball behind
him to Tait.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later came a reprieve, the penalty on Rudd.</TE>

<HD>Dungy's Debut a Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Jacksonville Jaguars saw what their future will be like in the
new AFC South--lots of Peyton Manning, and lots of frustration trying
to stop him.</LD>
<LD>   Manning threw three touchdown passes Sunday to lift the
Indianapolis Colts to a 28-25 victory over their new division rival.</LD>
<LD>   "Peyton is Peyton, and there's not much else to say," Jaguar
cornerback Fernando Bryant said.</LD>
<TE>   Colt running back Edgerrin James made his first appearance since
his devastating knee injury last October and rushed for 99 yards in
26 carries.</TE>
<TE>   New Colt Coach Tony Dungy got off to a successful start, even
though the defense he was hired to revamp wasn't the greatest. The
Colts surrendered 343 yards, including 104 receiving to Jimmy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   But the star of the show was Manning, who completed 19 of 31
passes for 211 yards with two touchdowns to Qadry Ismail and one to
Marvin Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, Manning avoided interceptions. He threw 23 last
year to offset his 26 touchdown passes over a 6-10 season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fabulous," Dungy said. "He and Marvin and Qadry, they have
great chemistry. They work at it. We took it right down the field,
really, three times. That was real impressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars also went 6-10 last season, although expectations for
Tom Coughlin's team are much lower than for the Colts in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Taylor, returning from a groin injury, ran for 83 yards and a
touchdown. Smith showed he didn't need training camp, after all. The
10th-year receiver, who got a big raise after a 38-day holdout,
caught eight passes.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt ... a little shaky, a little rusty," Smith said. "I didn't
make my cuts as well as I usually do, but that will come."</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars, forced to rebuild after an off-season salary cap
purge, showed they can still move the ball. Like so many times in the
last two seasons, they played hard but came up short, and their
streak of winning season openers ended at six.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Lose Ishii, Game</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Pitcher's skull is fractured by line drive by
Hunter during 6-2 loss to Astros.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime today, the Dodgers will try to focus on their rapidly
shrinking one-game lead over the San Francisco Giants in the National
League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   But Sunday, the memory of pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii writhing on the
grass and bleeding after a line drive had fractured his skull was too
vivid for players to think of anything but the trivial nature even
the biggest games can take on.</LD>
<LD>   "It's ironic," a shaken Alex Cora said, the memory of his Aug. 26
concussion and ambulance ride replaying in his mind. "Bad things have
to happen to people to put everything in perspective. Right now our
prayers and thoughts are with Ishii."</LD>
<TE>   Ishii was struck on the left side of his forehead by a drive off
the bat of Houston's Brian Hunter in the fourth inning of the
Dodgers' 6-2 loss to the Astros at Dodger Stadium. With home plate in
the shadows--start time had been pushed back to 4:10 p.m. to
accommodate the Los Angeles Triathlon--Ishii apparently didn't see
the ball screaming toward him and couldn't defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   The ball struck him so hard it ricocheted to the backstop while he
fell in a heap in front of the mound. Conscious and able to respond
to questions and move his limbs but bleeding from cuts on his scalp
and complaining of a bad headache, he was put on a stretcher and
taken by ambulance to Good Samaritan Hospital while the crowd of
42,934 watched fearfully.</TE>
<TE>   A CT scan found the small fracture on top of his forehead and
determined he has a concussion. Ishii, who turns 29 today, was to
remain in the hospital under the observation of neurologists for at
least 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "With that starting time, it was very difficult to see the ball,"
said Chad Kreuter, Ishii's catcher Sunday. "It was not safe
conditions, the way the shadows were. He didn't see the ball at all.
You can see on the replay. He did not get his glove up. He did not
lift his head up.... We as players have always complained about
starting times at 4, 5 or 6 o'clock. The shadows take away from your
depth perception of the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said he was told Ishii was stable and not
in danger but said the pitcher will be out indefinitely and will
certainly miss his next start. Tracy said he hadn't decided who would
take Ishii's next scheduled start, or how the rotation might be
reconfigured for the final 20 games of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the furthest thought from my mind," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger players, held in check on the field during seven strong
innings by Astro right-hander Roy Oswalt (19-6), were somber as they
dressed and packed for a trip to San Francisco and the start of a
three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration they might otherwise have felt after losing two of
three games to the Astros--which ended their nine-series winning
streak--was absent. Real life had intruded on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time the ball comes back like that, everybody worries about
the pitcher," said second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who had one of
three Dodger hits off Oswalt. "It was an awful sight. I just hope
everything works out for him. It's tough when you've got one of your
guys in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen.
We've got to use it as a motivator, to try and get us going."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii (14-10) struggled from the outset, giving up home runs in
the first inning to Craig Biggio and in the third to Hunter. He
walked Jason Lane and Oswalt before Hunter drilled a 3-and-2 pitch at
him; Lane scored before time was called.</TE>
<TE>   Consecutive doubles by Jose Vizcaino and Brad Ausmus in the fifth
off Kevin Beirne gave Houston a 4-0 lead. In the meantime, the
Dodgers were being subdued by Oswalt, who struck out nine and gave up
one hit through seven.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt was relieved by Octavio Dotel in the eighth after giving up
singles to Tyler Houston and Grudzielanek. Dotel walked pinch-hitter
Dave Hansen and gave up a double to Cora that scored Houston and
Grudzielanek, but with runners on second and third he got Adrian
Beltre to pop up to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's condition, however, was of paramount importance to the
Dodgers. "I started praying, doing the same things my teammates did
for me two weeks ago," Cora said. "When we come out [today], we'll be
ready. But right now, it doesn't even matter."</TE>

<KH>MIAMI 49, DETROIT 21</KH>
<HD>Newcomers Help Maintain a Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>For the Miami Dolphins, plenty of points meant plenty of heroes--most
of them newcomers.</LD>
<LD>   Ricky Williams rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns, offensive
coordinator Norv Turner earned raves for his play-calling and the
Dolphins won their opener for the 11th year in a row Sunday, beating
the Detroit Lions, 49-21.</LD>
<LD>   Backup tailback Robert Edwards, playing his first game in four
seasons, scored the Dolphins' final two touchdowns. Rookie tight end
Randy McMichael turned acrobat on one catch and scored on another,
and even 335-pound guard Jamie Nails won cheers by clearing the way
downfield for Williams on a 37-yard run.</LD>
<TE>   All were in their first game with the Dolphins, who rang up their
biggest point total since a 52-14 win over the New York Jets to open
the 1995 season, Don Shula's last as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Miami extended its home winning streak in August and September to
16 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised about a lot of things, starting with the score,"
Lion Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "I expected our entire team to play
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions' Joey Harrington, the third pick in the April draft,
made his debut with 10 minutes left. He directed a 77-yard touchdown
drive but completed only four-of-11 passes for 41 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Mike McMahon went seven for 17 for 133 yards and remains the
starter, Mornhinweg said.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Fiedler threw three touchdown passes for Miami, but fans saved
their biggest cheers for Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, acquired from the Saints in March to bolster Miami's
perennially poor ground game, did just that. He carried 20 times,
scored on runs of one and two yards and set up another touchdown with
his 37-yard run, the second-longest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, hired in February after spending last season as San
Diego's offensive coordinator, directed an offense that totaled 27
first downs and 389 yards, including 245 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "With Norv Turner's play-calling, it's a joke out there," tackle
Mark Dixon said. "I knew after the first four plays that the Lions
were in trouble. With all of our shifting and motion, they could not
adjust."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sorry, Oklahoma, but this is where I bail out.</LD>
<LD>   We could drag this charade of a No. 1 romance out a few more
weeks, reminisce about soda-sipping summer days in Norman only weeks
ago, but a clean break now is probably best for the kids.</LD>
<LD>   To paraphrase your cowboy-poet Will Rogers, who said he never met
a man he didn't like, well, I just met Miami.</LD>
<TE>   Bummer it had to end like this, but I'm ready to sign papers.</TE>
<TE>   I hitched my No. 1 hat on Oklahoma based on a couple of
assumptions: that Jason White would be the starting quarterback, and
that the Sooners' quick-as-lightning defense would be impenetrable.</TE>
<TE>   So here we sit, Sept. 9, two days after White ripped up his knee
against Alabama and two days after the Sooner defense allowed 20
points at home to Probation U.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma is 2-0, yes, still misses Nebraska and Kansas State on
the schedule, yes, still is a national title contender, yes, but no
way Oklahoma is better than Miami, at least not as presently
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   With White out for the season, the Sooners must now rely on Nate
Hybl, a nice kid lacking only the necessary vowels and skills.</TE>
<TE>   White was an X factor because of his running ability; it was he
who rescued Oklahoma in last year's win over Texas.</TE>
<TE>   With White out, Oklahoma hands the keys to a one-dimensional
thrower and a running game that went backward against Alabama
(minus-23 yards).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Gainesville, Fla., the Miami Pound Machine extended
its road winning streak to 12 games with a 41-16 thumping of Florida.
Miami rushed for 304 yards while senior quarterback Ken Dorsey, on an
off night, tossed four touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we were good," Miami center Brett Romberg huffed in the
locker room afterward. "We kind of shut the critics up at about
halftime."</TE>
<TE>   Critics? Miami entered the season ranked No. 1 in both the media
and coaches' polls, yet there were some of us who wondered whether
Miami could win at Florida and at Tennessee while restocking a roster
that lost 11 players to the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Well, gee, I guess so, but who knew Miami's sock drawer was so
deep?</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes lost running backs Clinton Portis and Najeh
Davenport to the pros, plus star-in-waiting Frank Gore to a knee
injury, and simply plugged in sophomore Willis McGahee, who stepped
out of mothballs and rushed for 204 yards against Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Sikes answered questions about the brand new secondary by
intercepting quarterback Rex Grossman twice, returning one 97 yards
for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has only three hurdles left in the bowl championship series
steeplechase: at home against Florida State on Oct. 12, at Tennessee
on Nov. 9 and home to Virginia Tech on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's biggest opponent is going to be boredom, not showing up
against an inferior opponent. The Hurricanes, remember, nearly lost
at Boston College last year.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma? Thanks for the memories, all two week's worth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irish Report</TE>
<TE>   We checked the owner's manual and confirmed 2-0 Notre Dame can
qualify for a BCS game this year without scoring a touchdown on
offense. The skinny on next week's showdown: How does Michigan's
offense stop Notre Dame's defense from scoring?</TE>
<TE>   Does Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr order tackling drills for
tailbacks? Will the Wolverines deploy a two-deep zone on offense in
anticipation of John Navarre's first interception?</TE>
<TE>   Amazing stuff.</TE>
<TE>   You may know by now that Notre Dame has scored four touchdowns in
two games, none produced by an Irish quarterback-center exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But did you know the Irish's last two touchdowns of the 2001
season, against Purdue, also came without anyone saying "hike"?</TE>
<TE>   Scoring summary of the Irish's last six touchdowns: interception
return, fumble return, fumble return, punt return, interception
return, kickoff return.</TE>
<TE>   Use of carbon dating has confirmed that the last Notre Dame
touchdown on offense was scored Dec. 1, 2001, with 11:21 left in the
second quarter against Purdue, on Ryan Grant's 14-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Where the Heisman race stands after Saturday's Grossman-Dorsey
interception derby.</TE>
<TE>   1) This Space Available.</TE>
<TE>   2) Dorsey. He's 28-1 as a starter, which makes him eligible for
Heisman's lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   3) Byron Leftwich, Marshall. Thursday night's game at Virginia
Tech may be the biggest in school history.</TE>
<TE>   4) Nick Setta, Notre Dame. Is there a more potent offensive weapon
in South Bend these days than the kicker?</TE>
<TE>   5) McGahee, Miami. Gaining 204 yards against Miami gets you in the
mix, although his numbers will dip once Gore returns.</TE>
<TE>   Conference of the Week: Pacific 10. The Pacific Coast league
avoided full-blown home-court disasters when Washington rallied from
10-0 down to beat San Jose State and Oregon came back to beat Fresno
State. Stanford gets a pass for losing a tough one at Boston College
because starting quarterback Chris Lewis missed the game because of
an NCAA violation.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida press box was abuzz with questions about who might be
the UCLA coach next year. If the Bruins' opening win over big, bad,
two-games-under-its-belt Colorado State was any indication, the
answer could be: Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Conference of the Weak: Big East. It's top-loaded with one
terrific team (Miami), one really good team (Virginia Tech), a few
scrubs and two embarrassments in Temple and Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Big East has addressed the Temple problem by kicking the
school out of the conference in 2004, but now there's the Rutgers
problem. "Sopranos" star James Gandolfini has been doing promotional
spots for his alma mater, but it may be time for Tony Soprano to put
a hit out on a program that followed last week's loss to I-AA
Villanova with a 34-11 loss to Buffalo.</TE>

<HD>Ochs' Career Is in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A third concussion within a year has put Colorado quarterback Craig
Ochs' playing career in jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   The 18th-ranked Buffaloes have listed Ochs as doubtful for
Saturday's home game against USC.</LD>
<LD>   The junior left Saturday night's 34-14 victory over San Diego
State at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   Ochs was hit hard near the sideline at the end of a 10-yard
scramble on the next-to-last play of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken by ambulance to Boulder Community Hospital as a
precaution, but a CAT scan and other tests were negative.</TE>
<TE>   Ochs' first concussion in college came last September against
Kansas. He suffered a second one against Texas A&amp;M and was held out
of the Texas game. Ochs also had a concussion in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic department spokesman Dave Plati said that the coaching
and medical staff will be especially cautious with Ochs during his
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   After Saturday's game, Colorado Coach Gary Barnett deflected
questions about Ochs' future.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand and know what you're going to ask, and I don't have
an answer for it," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what the extent of his injury is going to be. For
us, it means basically Robert Hodge now is going to have to step up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern quarterback Alexander Webb will be sidelined at least
eight weeks after being hospitalized following a hit during
Saturday's 48-24 home loss to Texas Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, a freshman playing his first game, was admitted to Evanston
Hospital with a lacerated liver.</TE>
<TE>   He got caught between two defenders as he threw an interception
early in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Outside the Lines-- 9/11: One Year Later"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, Tuesday, 5 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The amazing story of Doug Goodwin's heart transplant at Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, is beautifully
told in this special edition of ESPN's "Outside the Lines."</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin, 59, was a fullback on the Buffalo Bills' 1965 American
Football League championship team. Because of the generosity of
former Bill quarterback Jack Kemp, owner Ralph C. Wilson and other
Bills and NFL players, $40,000 was raised so that Goodwin could have
the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   His new heart and two surgeons were on a plane that departed
Boston's Logan International Airport at 7:50 a.m., nine minutes
before the first of the two soon-to-be-hijacked planes departed.</TE>
<TE>   The small plane carrying the heart landed at Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey not long before all flights were grounded. And the
ambulance carrying the heart crossed the George Washington Bridge
just six minutes before the Port Authority ordered all New York
bridges closed. The 5 1/2-hour surgery was performed on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp appropriately calls Goodwin's story "heartwarming." He also
calls it "one of the greatest stories of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Another segment on this show is about the rebuilding of sports in
Afghanistan, with the focus on an exhibition soccer match between
local players and an international peacekeeping force. Under the
Taliban, sports ceased to exist and the soccer stadium in Kabul was
used for public executions.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments include one on the New York City Fire Department's
football team and another on Mark Bingham, one of the heroes on
Flight 93 that crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The FDNY football team is also the subject of a one-hour NFL Films
special that will follow "Outside the Lines" Tuesday at 6 p.m. And
Bingham and the other heroes of Flight 93 are the subject of a
one-hour special, "Flight 93: A Call to Action," which will air at 7
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The three specials are part of what ESPN is doing to commemorate
the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK JETS 37, BUFFALO 31 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Morton Puts On the Afterburner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Chad Morton didn't want to look back to see if anyone was chasing
him. Now the New York Jets can look forward to next week after
squeaking out a dramatic victory to open their season.</LD>
<LD>   Morton ran back two kickoffs for touchdowns, including a 96-yarder
to start overtime to lift the Jets to a 37-31 victory over Buffalo on
Sunday and spoiling Drew Bledsoe's debut with the Bills.</LD>
<LD>   He became only the second player in NFL history to return an
overtime kickoff for a touchdown. On Nov. 27, 1980, Chicago's Dave
Williams took the opening overtime kickoff for a score in a win over
Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew it was going to be a foot race. I didn't know if I had
enough gas to make it to the end zone," Morton said. "I was thinking
to myself, 'Please, don't get caught.... But I made it into the end
zone. Game over."</TE>
<TE>   Morton caught Mike Hollis' kickoff along the right sideline and
cut toward the middle of the field. He broke a tackle at the 30, then
outran Shawn Bryson into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   He is the first player in NFL history to return a kickoff for a
score in regulation and overtime. He also became the first Jet and
fifth player in NFL history to return two kickoffs for scores. New
Orleans' Tyrone Hughes was the last player to run back two kickoffs
for scores, accomplishing the feat in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   After running back a 98-yarder--the third-longest in franchise
history--in the second quarter, Morton had enough in him for one more
big return. It came after Bledsoe forced overtime by connecting with
Eric Moulds on a 29-yard touchdown pass play with 26 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets won even though Curtis Martin left the game at halftime
because of a sprained left ankle, and Vinny Testaverde played
inconsistently.</TE>
<TE>   Testaverde completed 24 of 30 passes for 210 yards and two
touchdowns. Anthony Becht, with a one-yard reception, and Wayne
Chrebet, with an 18-yarder, also scored for the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, acquired in a deal with New England last April to spark
the Bill offense, was 26 for 39 for 271 yards, with a touchdown and
two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's Travis Henry rushed for a career-high 149 yards and
three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The close finish should not come as a surprise. The two teams'
previous three meetings were decided by six points or less.</TE>
<TE>   Special teams continue to haunt the Bills, going back to the Music
City Miracle in the 1999 AFC playoff loss to Tennessee. That's when
the Titans' Frank Wycheck threw a lateral pass across the field to
Kevin Dyson, and he scampered 75 yards for a 22-16 victory as time
ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, the Bills allowed 300 yards in returns. They also allowed
a blocked punt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the worst day I've ever experienced and ultimately it's
our responsibility as a special teams group," Bills' special teams
coach Danny Smith said. "I apologize to our football team. I
apologize to the fans."</TE>

<HD>More Bang! for ABC's Bucks</HD>
<DH>Network is counting on Madden's grass-roots popularity to
help pull 'Monday Night Football' out of ratings dive</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Madden is an anomaly. In a business where youth and hipness mean
everything, Madden is neither young nor hip.</LD>
<LD>   Madden is quirky. You've probably heard he's afraid to fly, so he
travels by bus. Also, he doesn't like to ride on an elevator if other
people are on it. At stadiums, it's usually only Madden and the
elevator operator. His claustrophobia is that severe.</LD>
<LD>   And off the air, he's actually kind of bland. Believe it or not,
he doesn't talk much. No booms! No bangs! Particularly on game days.</LD>
<TE>   On the day of an exhibition game in Denver, Madden's bus is parked
in front of the hotel housing the ABC crew. Madden walks through the
lobby. There are a few oohs and ahs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's John Madden," says a young woman to her husband. "I can't
believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Madden is on his way to a Monday night game between the Broncos
and San Francisco 49ers. It's the second game he'll work with new
partner Al Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   Madden climbs aboard the bus and the first thing he does is get a
sandwich out of the refrigerator. The bus has a kitchen, plus
sleeping quarters with a king-sized bed, a computer and satellite
television.</TE>
<TE>   Two 23-year-old men are on the bus. One is sporting a buzz cut,
the other is wearing a Randy Moss Minnesota Viking jersey. They are
young and hip. They are wide-eyed and excited to meet Madden.</TE>
<TE>   The one with the buzz cut went to great lengths for the privilege
of meeting Madden and riding with him to the game. He won a "ticket
to ride" contest sponsored by a restaurant chain that also sponsors
Madden's bus. The other, a co-worker at an elevator company, is his
guest.</TE>
<TE>   "So what did you have to do to win this thing?" Madden asks as the
bus pulls away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little embarrassing," the young man tells him. But he
seems to feel comfortable. He proceeds to tell Madden about going on
a Howard Stern-type Denver morning radio show and answering questions
about his parents' sex life. He says he had to listen while the
show's co-hosts called his mother to verify the answers.</TE>
<TE>   Madden's eyes light up. He enjoys the story, and all its graphic
details. He and the two young men have a good chuckle. It's obvious
that Madden, 66, has somehow made a connection.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is counting on Madden to make a connection with all types,
young and old, male and female. That is a key reason the network
lured him away from Fox with a four-year, $20-million contract and
paired him with Michaels on "Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   It's important to ABC, the No. 3 network and falling, that "Monday
Night Football" have a successful season. It's the network's No.
1-rated show and maybe more than anything else can help turn things
around.</TE>
<TE>   The three exhibition games averaged a 7.4 rating, a slight
improvement over last year's 7.3 average for ABC's preseason. But
among young males, there was a 21% increase (from 4.3 to 5.2).</TE>
<TE>   The regular-season rating last season was 11.2, down from 13.7 the
year before. In 1994, ABC averaged a 17.8 with Michaels, Frank
Gifford and Dan Dierdorf in the booth. There has been a steady
decline for seven consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   The most important factor in reversing the ratings trend is the
quality of games. But Madden may be a close second.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels and Madden make their regular-season debut tonight, when
the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots play host to the
Pittsburgh Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   After three exhibition telecasts, indications are that Michaels
and Madden will be an outstanding team. They jelled coming out of the
gate.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so comfortable, it was almost scary," Michaels said before
the game in Denver. "We were sharing the same thoughts, as if our
minds were melding. I think we're going to be able to take John
places he hasn't been before."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of Madden is his down-to-earth style, much in contrast
to Dennis Miller's loutish, cerebral style.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, gone after a two years, seemed to be always trying to show
how smart he was.</TE>
<TE>   Gone too is Dan Fouts, shifted over to college football, and
sideline reporter Eric Dickerson. Fouts didn't do anything wrong;
it's just that the ABC brass believed one John Madden in the booth is
worth two of anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a recent guest on NBC's "Tonight Show With Jay Leno," told
Leno: "When I heard John Madden [was available] I called Dan Fouts
and told him we were whacked.</TE>
<TE>   "Al is the preeminent play-by-play announcer and John is the
preeminent color announcer. Put them together and it's a dream team."</TE>
<TE>   So far it has all been sweet for this "dream team." The media
coverage has been extensive and favorable. Madden's picture was on
the cover of Sports Illustrated before he had worked his first game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked Super Bowls and my picture hasn't been on the cover
of Sports Illustrated," he said. "Now I'm on the cover for a
preseason game."</TE>
<TE>   But the honeymoon soon may be over.</TE>
<TE>   Madden is now on the hot seat, and some critics will find reasons
to pounce on him. His act is old, some will say. He talks too much,
others will complain.</TE>
<TE>   He's going to hear it, and he knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes criticism, and I know there's going to be more now,"
he said. "I care, but I can't worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   For now, things are good. "Monday Night Football" producer Fred
Gaudelli said Madden has become sort of a coach, giving advice in
production meetings and taking Melissa Stark, now in her third year
as a sideline reporter, under his wing.</TE>
<TE>   Although Madden says he enjoyed his 21-year run with Pat Summerall
at CBS and Fox, this is where he always hoped to end up.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, I always enjoyed 'Monday Night Football.' I really
got up for it; the players really got up for it," he said. "And when
you were a team you wanted to play on Monday night. I know that from
having been there.</TE>
<TE>   "And then when you go into broadcasting, I think that's the same
thing, that somewhere in your broadcasting career, if you are going
to be fulfilled, you want to be a part of 'Monday Night Football.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of Michaels, Madden said: "He's a consummate professional. And I'm
a consummate bumbler. I'll bumble around, and he'll consummate the
deal."</TE>
<TE>   Don't be fooled by Madden's act, Michaels says.</TE>
<TE>   "John is not only a tremendous observer of football, he also
understands television," he said. "He understands the art of
communication. He gets it. And he has been able to stay fresh, stay
on top of his game and not rest on his laurels."</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation that maybe there isn't enough room in
the booth for the sizable egos of Michaels and Madden.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't understand that kind of talk," Michaels said. "John
and I are both confident that we can pilot the plane, that we can
take off and land. But neither one of us are concerned about how much
air time we get."</TE>
<TE>   It has always been assumed that Summerall, whose specialties are
brevity and word economy, was the perfect partner for Madden, who is
talkative on the air.</TE>
<TE>   But Michaels, it appears, is going to be able to draw more out of
Madden.</TE>
<TE>   And you never know what Madden is going to come up with next.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's third exhibition game was in Green Bay, and when someone in
the stands held up a sign saying, "Sheboygan Loves Madden," he came
back with, "And I love Sheboygan. I'd love to be able to say, 'I'm
from Sheboygan.' I think that would be real neat."</TE>
<TE>   Madden likes ordinary people, and ordinary people seem to like
him. Those are the kind of people he mingles with while traveling
around the country on his bus, the Madden Cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this country as well as anyone," he said. "The old people,
the kids--I know what they think. The kids think of me as that guy in
the video game."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Madden's popularity with the younger set can be attributed
to his EA Sports NFL video game. The latest edition, "Madden NFL
2003," just came out.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids say to me, 'I'm playing Madden,' like I'm a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Madden's wide appeal, however, means nothing if ABC doesn't get
good games. Madden has something to say about that too.</TE>
<TE>   He has a plan that would provide ABC with key games the last four
weeks of the season, a plan he'd like to see implemented before the
2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't give games out, because you're not going to be able to take
them away," he said. "I know that from having been on the other side.
You can't say, 'OK, now you have that game, but we're going to take
it and put it over here.' There's no way [Fox and CBS] are going to
go for that.</TE>
<TE>   "So the way you do it is, you don't give them out. Now, before the
season, they give them out. CBS has its games, and Fox has its games.
What I propose is they give out three-quarters of the schedule and
then at the halfway point, after the eighth game, they give out the
last four.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, you're not taking anything away. I think that's the
whole secret."</TE>
<TE>   Madden's old friends at CBS and Fox aren't exactly thrilled with
this plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny, John wasn't for the flexible schedule last year, was he?"
said Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ed Goren, president of Fox Sports: "I guess Disney has
brainwashed him."</TE>
<TE>   The brass at CBS and Fox may not be too fond of Madden's plan, but
they remain fond of Madden. It's harder to get a feel for what the
rank and file think of Madden. There have been rumblings over the
years that Madden can sometimes throw his weight around, particularly
among the underlings. But most people at Madden's two former networks
will tell you they like him.</TE>
<TE>   What ABC is hoping for above all is that viewers like him.</TE>

<HD>GOLDEN JOY</HD>
<DH>Millie Corretjer has brought calm to Oscar De La Hoya</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIG BEAR</DL>
<LD>It was the kind of phone call that could make a woman think she was
hallucinating, on the end of a wrong number or the object of a cruel
prank.</LD>
<LD>   On the other end of the line was someone claiming to be Oscar De
La Hoya, young, single, available, good-looking, an athlete, a
singer, an international celebrity and a multimillionaire. And he was
pleading for a date.</LD>
<LD>   As far as Millie Corretjer was concerned, the joke was on him. She
wasn't interested.</LD>
<TE>   Corretjer wasn't much of a sports fan, certainly not a boxing fan.
As a Puerto Rican, all she knew about De La Hoya was that he had been
beaten by Felix Trinidad, a fellow Puerto Rican, and that was fine
with her. As a singer who has been seen and/or heard on television,
videos, CDs, albums and the Internet, she is accustomed to being
pursued by men.</TE>
<TE>   But this was not just any man, those around her told her as she
cradled the phone in her San Antonio hotel room on that day in
February 2000, this is Oscar De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the big deal?" she said. "I don't care. He's just a pretty
boy. I'm not an easy girl. I don't go for pretty boys. I go for
people with good heads and good hearts. Who does he think he is? I
don't have to be anything for this guy. He's not going to get
anything from me."</TE>
<TE>   It was an unusual position for De La Hoya to be in. He was not
accustomed to being the pursuer. Women had been throwing themselves
at him since he won an Olympic gold medal in Barcelona in 1992.
Squealing as if he were a rock star, they would toss their underwear
at him or hold up signs saying they wanted to have his baby. In El
Paso in 1996, while on a media tour to promote his first fight
against Julio Cesar Chavez, De La Hoya found his limo under an attack
by a mob of mostly female fans who jumped on the hood and clawed at
the windows as he arrived at a hotel for a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   So why all this effort to land a date with Corretjer, a woman he
had never seen in person?</TE>
<TE>   It began in a recording studio weeks earlier, where De La Hoya was
making his first CD. Things were not going well in the mind of his
producer, Rudy Perez. De La Hoya was supposed to be singing about
heartbreak, yet he wasn't showing enough emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had my heart broken," De La Hoya told Perez. So how
could he express that feeling?</TE>
<TE>   Perez's eyes lit up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to give you someone who will do it for you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez flipped on one of Corretjer's videos.</TE>
<TE>   That did it.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just that she looked beautiful," recalled De La Hoya
last week at his Big Bear training headquarters where he was wrapping
up his preparation for Saturday's 154-pound championship fight
against Fernando Vargas at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center.
"I've seen many beautiful women before. It was something beyond that.
I don't know what an angel looks like, but I felt like I was seeing
one. I couldn't even record after that. I just wanted to see that
video. I was watching it 20 to 30 times a day."</TE>
<TE>   When De La Hoya found out Corretjer was performing in San Antonio,
he took a detour on his way home from New York where he had beaten
Derrell Coley.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Corretjer agreed to see De La Hoya, but there were
strings attached. Nearly a whole orchestra, as a matter of fact.</TE>
<TE>   "We can take a walk as long as I can bring along some chaperones,"
she said. She wanted to include her dancers, musicians and chaperone,
eight people in all.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine," De La Hoya said.</TE>
<TE>   And so they strolled down the famed Riverwalk, De La Hoya, his
dream date and eight chaperones.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very weird," Corretjer said.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, undeterred, waited a few months and then invited
Corretjer to fly to L.A. to be his date for the Latin Grammy Awards.
She accepted, as long as she could bring along chaperone Marisela
Diaz. De La Hoya agreed. He was making progress. The chaperone list
was down to one.</TE>
<TE>   "He put me up in a nice hotel," she said, "but that didn't make
any points with me."</TE>
<TE>   Corretjer stuck around for four days, allowing De La Hoya to show
her Southern California, including a trip to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very respectful," Corretjer said. "He was very sweet.
Because he was a boxer, I would expect him to be a monster. I
couldn't imagine this guy being a boxer. He didn't try to kiss me or
even grab my hand."</TE>
<TE>   Of course with Diaz, the chaperone, still acting as Corretjer's
shadow, De La Hoya didn't have many options.</TE>
<TE>   When they parted at the airport, however, De La Hoya and Corretjer
exchanged their first kiss.</TE>
<TE>   "On the way home," Corretjer said, "I cried. Then I knew I missed
him. I didn't like that feeling because I had heard the stories about
Oscar [He has had two children--Jacob, age 4, and Atiana, 3--out of
wedlock and was twice accused of rape though no criminal charges were
filed].</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was all wrong for him. I am in show business, but I'm
not into the celebrity scene. My friends are my high school friends.
I have a very strong family feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that when I got married, I wanted it to be forever and I
wanted it to be to the father of my children."</TE>
<TE>   When Corretjer arrived home in Puerto Rico, she found something
else worth crying about. There, plastered on the pages of the
tabloids, was a picture of her kissing De La Hoya. It was a national
scandal. Here was the nation's sweetheart, a highly popular singer,
in an embrace with public enemy No. 1, De La Hoya, the man who had
dared to take on Trinidad, a national hero.</TE>
<TE>   Corretjer still remembers sitting in a restaurant in Puerto Rico
in 1999 on the night of the De La Hoya-Trinidad match with her
cousin, Jaime Durand, who had a radio stuck to his ear. The first
thing Durand thought he heard was that Trinidad had lost. Depression
spread through the restaurant. Then came the correct information.
Their beloved Tito had won. Total elation.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people called me a traitor for being with Oscar," Corretjer
said. "Then I understood what a big deal it was. It caused the first
controversy of my career."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't stop her from seeing De La Hoya. Again he sent for
her and again she came.</TE>
<TE>   And again Diaz came along. But this time, it wasn't to protect
Corretjer from De La Hoya. It was to protect Corretjer from herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't need this at that time in my life," she said. "I had to
be careful not to fall in love. I wanted Marisela to hold me and save
me from falling for Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   But soon Diaz was gone and so was Corretjer's resistance. On Oct.
5, 2001, De La Hoya and Corretjer were married.</TE>
<TE>   She had agreed to share his life, but she still didn't understand
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like boxing," she said. "I didn't know why two guys would
beat each other up. They should talk first."</TE>
<TE>   The first match Corretjer saw in person was De La Hoya's fight
against Arturo Gatti in March of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted it to be over," she said of a fight De La Hoya won
easily. "I thought, 'What is wrong with these people fighting like
this?' I was scared. When I saw Oscar could hit so hard, I started
crying. I wanted to go home.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was over, his hands were swollen and there were scratches
on his body. It's painful for me. It's hard to see it happening. And
it's hard to understand how Oscar can do this. This is a person who
is afraid to go on a roller coaster. It makes him sick. But he can do
this."</TE>
<TE>   While Corretjer finds it hard to connect her loving husband to the
vicious fighter she sees in the ring, it also is hard for her to see
a connection between De La Hoya's reputation and the De La Hoya she
has come to know.</TE>
<TE>   "This perfect guy," she said, "loyal, fun loving, a man and a kid.
I haven't met that other person and I'm grateful for that. But if he
had to do all the things he did to be the man he is today, thank God
for that."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya gives Corretjer the credit for changing him.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I met her," he said, "my life has been different. I
had gotten caught up in a lifestyle that isn't me anymore. I had a
lot of money and went out with my buddies a lot and it was wild, but
all that is over now. It never crosses my mind. I have what I want. I
have my jewel here in Millie."</TE>
<TE>   The fact Corretjer was sitting beside De La Hoya as he spoke last
week in Big Bear showed how important she has become to him.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, women have been about as welcome in a boxer's
training camp as a flu bug. Wives, girlfriends, one-night stands, it
didn't matter. They were all forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   But when De La Hoya found himself pining for his wife while
isolated in the San Bernardino Mountains, Joel De La Hoya, Oscar's
father and a stern disciplinarian, asked Corretjer to come to camp.
And Floyd Mayweather Sr., Oscar's whip-cracking trainer, approved.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hesitant," Corretjer said. "I assured them I would be a
good girl and not mess with his training."</TE>
<TE>   Corretjer also will be at Saturday's fight, although she still
won't feel comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of jealous when women throw themselves at him," she
said. "But in my business, men throw themselves at me too, so I can
understand.</TE>
<TE>   "And as far as the boxing, I can deal with that too because, even
though I don't understand his career, I know how happy it makes him."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya says he won't go on much longer. "I want to be a
husband to her," he said. "I want to think about her before I think
about anything else."</TE>
<TE>   But what if the lure of the ring keeps him fighting much longer,
perhaps for another decade?</TE>
<TE>   "Then I would put my foot down," Corretjer said. "It's dangerous.
I love him and I want to grow old with him. I would tell him, 'This
is ridiculous.' "</TE>
<TE>   And if that doesn't work, she can always threaten to bring back
the chaperone.</TE>

<TE>   Randy Williams, a 19-year-old USC freshman from Compton, ended a
48-hour gold-medal drought for the U.S. track and field team with a
victory in the long jump. He jumped 27 feet 1/2 inch, then credited a
teddy bear that a girlfriend had given him for good luck. Still, the
U.S. failed to win the men's shotput for the first time since 1936,
George Woods finishing second to Poland's Wladyslaw Komar. Dave
Wottle, who had won the 800, failed to qualify for the final in his
best event, the 1,500. Olga Connolly of Culver City, in her fifth
Olympics, did not qualify in the discus, attributing her showing to
her refusal to take steroids.</TE>

<TE>   --Incoming IOC President Lord Killanin, forecasting changes in

<TE>   POSTSCRIPT</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vladislavas Cesiunas confronted a remarkable fall from grace, one
possible only in a land void of essential freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years after he and partner Yuri Lobanov won a gold medal for
the Soviet Union in the Canadian pairs' 1,000-meter canoeing
competition in Munich, Cesiunas returned to West
Germany--Duisburg--to observe the kayak and canoe world championships
as director of Dynamo Sports School.</TE>
<TE>   Cesiunas met a West German woman on his monthlong visit and dated
her twice. Asked by an interpreter recently if he had fallen in love
with the woman, Cesiunas answered quickly, "Nyet!"</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged being intrigued by her mention of remaining
with her in West Germany, expressing his confusion on the subject to
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw no political aspect to it," Cesiunas said. "Even though I
was an officer for Dynamo [the Soviet Union's KGB-sponsored club], I
was not on the police side, I was on the sports side. I saw no
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   There were reports the Soviets, made aware of the situation,
kidnapped Cesiunas and ushered him back to his home in Lithuania.
"It's now 30 years later," Cesiunas, 62, said in a telephone
interview from his home in a small, rural Lithuanian village. "It's
OK to tell the truth. The truth is I left [West Germany] voluntarily
and I arrived voluntarily."</TE>
<TE>   Upon his return, however, Cesiunas faced immense intimidation. "I
was accused of betraying my country. I was accused of being a
deserter," he said. "I was told I was going to be sent away to a
prison camp for 15 years, to a coal mine in a distant city where I
would have to perform hard labor."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was stripped of his job in the customs department upon
his return, he somehow avoided the coal mine.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics were coming to Moscow in 1980, and I think [the
Soviets] were afraid of public opinion if anyone learned they had
forced one of their gold medalists into the prison," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was given a new job, as a civilian coach in a children's sports
school, at one-third the salary of his customs position.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he married a Lithuanian woman, Irena. They have two
daughters, ages 20 and 19. Cesiunas hasn't left Lithuania since his
1979 return.</TE>
<TE>   "When people ask, I say I appeared with the Soviet national team,
but I am from Lithuania," Cesiunas said.</TE>
<TE>   Cesiunas and the German woman reunited for a brief meeting shortly
after Lithuania gained its independence.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pleasant, like seeing someone you had formally dated
usually is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two years ago, he said he was informed the woman had
died at age 75.</TE>
<TE>   Head of shifts for the Lithuanian customs agency, Cesiunas said he
is one year from retiring. He said he receives about $30 monthly from
his Soviet sports pension and four times as much from the Lithuanian
Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he will venture out of Lithuania in retirement, he said:
"I don't expect to be invited anywhere. It seems I'm not needed by
anyone. I grew up here. I was a kid here. I love my country and I
love my land, which is a difficult place to live."</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 37, ATLANTA 34, OT</KH>
<HD>Henderson Beats the Heat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Both teams thought the game was over long before Ryan Longwell's
34-yard field goal with 5:15 left in overtime gave Green Bay a 37-34
victory over Atlanta on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Exhausted from the steamiest opening day in Lambeau Field history,
the Packers and Falcons began celebrating after fullback William
Henderson's fourth-and-inches plunge toward the goal line with 1:10
left in regulation.</LD>
<LD>   The Falcons were sure they'd stopped him. The Packers were just as
certain he'd scored.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, officials signaled a touchdown, and a review confirmed
the call, giving Green Bay a 34-31 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Vick quickly moved the Falcons downfield and Jay
Feely's 52-yard field goal with five seconds left sent the game into
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   On Henderson's plunge, this much was certain: He didn't make it on
his initial burst.</TE>
<TE>   But just as he was getting stacked up, tailback Ahman Green gave
the pile of bodies a shove. Henderson, with his feet churning
furiously and his knees nowhere near the grass, lunged the ball
across, placing it squarely on the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not going to be denied," Henderson said. "I don't get too
many opportunities down there."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who rushed for 155 yards in 27 carries, was scared
Henderson wasn't going to get into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw he was having some trouble getting in, I ran up and
gave him a push," Green said. "I was tired. But I just put my body in
there and pushed."</TE>
<TE>   When it took so long for the officials to raise their arms, Falcon
Coach Dan Reeves was certain he'd be leaving Lambeau with a 31-27
win.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the longest whistle I've seen in the goal line. To call a
TD that late.... " Reeves said, his voice trailing off.</TE>
<TE>   "They said he was still moving his feet. I thought it was called
late and our guys were actually celebrating the fact that we'd
stopped him. I thought we played extremely hard and when you come up
short, it hurts."</TE>
<TE>   Packer Coach Mike Sherman said it was a no-brainer to give the
ball to his 250-pound battering ram.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need a whole lot. William is a horse, a bull I should
say," Sherman said. "He made a great effort."</TE>
<TE>   The temperature at kickoff was 83 degrees and was above 90 when
the game was over.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 10, BALTIMORE 7</KH>
<HD>Losing Streak Is Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Players mobbed each other in a pile on the ground, new Coach John Fox
jumped into the arms of his assistants, and the Carolina Panthers
celebrated their first victory in 364 days.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers turned to their veterans for scoring and to their
youth to save the game Sunday, beating Baltimore, 10-7, to end a
losing streak at 15 games and give Fox a win in his head coaching
debut.</LD>
<LD>   It made for a jubilant celebration for a team and a town that had
seemingly accepted losing. The Panthers set an NFL record by dropping
their final 15 games last year.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to enjoy it, this team is going to enjoy it, I hope the
whole town enjoys it," said tight end Wesley Walls, who scored the
Panthers' only touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It just feels so incredible to finally win again and to finish a
game and just put an end to all this misery."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens, two years removed from winning the Super Bowl, felt
little shame in losing to Carolina, the worst team in the league last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Carolina's record last year was just that--last year," said Coach
Brian Billick. "I don't know how good Carolina is right now, but they
are one of 16 teams that are going to be 1-0 at the end of the day."</TE>
<TE>   John Kasay, the only original Panther on the roster, kicked a
27-yard field goal, and Walls, a member of Carolina's 1996 team that
went to the NFC championship game, caught a 20-yard scoring pass from
Rodney Peete.</TE>
<TE>   But the Panthers had to sweat this one out after Kasay missed a
50-yard field goal with 2:00 left--enough time and a short enough
field for the Ravens to pull it out.</TE>
<TE>   But Chris Redman, making his first career start for the Ravens,
had his third-down pass batted away by Julius Peppers, the second
overall pick in this year's NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   The ball landed right in the hands of Dan Morgan for an
interception. Morgan, Carolina's first-round pick a year ago, raced
22 yards downfield to preserve the Panthers' win.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 1 IN THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Browns Get Helmet-Hard Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of the Cleveland Browns learned a valuable lesson Sunday
(although don't expect it to be licensed by the NFL any time soon):</LD>
<LD>   Given a choice of projectiles and pitching motions, the delirious,
two-handed helmet toss is a far worse thing to do than the
one-handed, three-quarter-delivery, drunken-beer-bottle changeup.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck a few hundred plastic beer bottles on the field, as Brown
fans did at their last home game last December, and all you will get
is a few days of national derision in the media and maybe a stern
finger-wagging from the league office.</LD>
<TE>   Spike your helmet on the field before the final whistle actually
sounds, as Brown linebacker Dwayne Rudd did Sunday, and you will be
penalized half the distance to the goal and one victory in the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd set a world record for Fastest Dash From Hero to
Goat--really, when you examine it closely, no one is even in the same
league anymore--when he mistimed the start of his post-victory
celebration by a millisecond or two, ripped off his helmet and
excitedly flung it 15 yards through the air while the final play of
regulation was still underway, and was immediately flagged for
premature jubilation, or unsportsmanlike conduct, or probably a
combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd was amped, he was pumped, he was stoked, he was a very happy,
very large man who thought he'd just ended the game by throwing
Kansas City quarterback Trent Green to the ground to clinch a 39-37
Brown victory. Rudd said he saw Green on the grass and "triple
zeroes" on the clock before doing his helmet fling thing.</TE>
<TE>   The big problem was what Rudd didn't see: Green, at the last
moment, flipping the ball to Kansas City tackle John Tait, who
grabbed the last-ditch pitch and lumbered 28 yards to the Cleveland
25.</TE>
<TE>   Because Rudd's helmet hit the turf long before the play ended,
Rudd was in violation of the NFL rule book. With no time on the
clock, referee Ron Blum cited Rudd for unsportsmanlike conduct and
penalized Cleveland half the distance to the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Since no NFL game can end on a defensive penalty, Kansas City was
allowed to send in its field-goal unit and tee it up for Morten
Andersen, whose 30-yarder after time expired gave the Chiefs a 40-39
victory.</TE>
<TE>   In one of numerous postgame interrogation sessions with the media,
Brown Coach Butch Davis confessed, on the record, "I'm sick."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Coach Dick Vermeil, who hadn't been handed so nice a gift
since Kurt Warner moved up the depth chart in St. Louis, admitted "We
were fortunate to win" and surmised that Davis and his players must
be "shell-shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Rudd certainly fit the description.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was down," Rudd said, alluding to Green. "When I
tackled him, he rolled over on my facemask. I looked up and saw
triple zeroes on the clock and thought the game was over. But I
didn't get the chance to look behind me and see the game wasn't
over."</TE>
<TE>   Willie Roaf, the veteran Kansas City offensive lineman, called the
game "the craziest I have played in 10 years." On any scale, it would
certainly have to rank up there, although considering the wild
finishes on this first Sunday of the 2002 NFL season--three games
were decided in overtime--it tended to blend into the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Lambeau Field, traditional home to tundra, Ice Bowls and
frostbitten fans, was hotter than a greenhouse for Green Bay's opener
against Atlanta, with perspiration and IV bags flowing amid
temperatures reaching the 90s. For the Packers, it seemed like a good
day to get five quick touchdown passes out of Brett Favre and head as
soon as possible for the postgame ice baths, but the Green Bay
defense postponed the chill by letting the Falcons' Michael Vick-led
offense ring up 34 points, including Jay Feely's game-tying field
goal with five seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Of all times to go overtime. The Packers and Falcons staggered on
for nearly 10 more sweltering minutes before Ryan Longwell's field
goal finally won it for Green Bay, 37-34. Any longer, Favre said, and
"I'd be watching from the infirmary."</TE>
<TE>   This was a game in serious need of Chad Morton, who knows how to
end overtimes in a hurry. Morton's New York Jets were tied, 31-31,
with Buffalo when the Bills committed a grievous mistake: They lost
the coin toss.</TE>
<TE>   Then they committed another: They kicked off to Morton.</TE>
<TE>   One 96-yard dash later, game over. Morton had ended the shortest
overtime period in NFL history with a kickoff return that gave the
Jets a 37-31 victory. One other thing: It wasn't Morton's longest
return of the day. He also had a 98-yarder during regulation,
becoming the fifth player in league history to run two kickoffs back
for scores in the same game.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay, which barely got Martin Gramatica on the field in time
to kick the field goal that tied New Orleans, prolonged the agony for
more than 12 minutes. With 2:50 left in overtime, Buccaneer punter
Tom Tupa was trapped in his own end zone--holding the ball, wearing a
defensive lineman as an overcoat--and panicked. Tupa, a 15-year
veteran who has started 13 NFL games at quarterback, chose a bad time
to throw a pass and a worse time to try it with his left arm.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a pass, actually. It looked more like a wounded
pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   It wound up in the arms of New Orleans' James Allen, an innocent
end zone bystander one second, the touchdown-scoring hero of the
Saints' 26-20 triumph the next.</TE>
<TE>   What to do in such a situation? It's hard to know. Dallas
quarterback Quincy Carter, in the waning minutes of regulation in the
Houston Texans' first regular-season game ever, found himself in a
similar predicament and opted to hold onto the ball and take the
safety.</TE>
<TE>   The big-picture result wasn't any better. Dallas fell behind by
nine and Houston went on to become the first expansion team since the
'61 Vikings to win its NFL debut, 19-10.</TE>
<TE>   Ticking down the last historic seconds, every Houston player still
on the field made sure to keep his headgear on his head until the
final gun had sounded. Wise beyond their years, those Texans.</TE>

<HD>Now He Can Determine the Going Rate</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>From the moment he stood in the tunnel before the U.S. Open final and
lined up behind Andre Agassi with a big grin on his face, until the
moment he hit a final, winning volley, when he was limp, drained of
energy and emotion, able only to hold on to Agassi in grateful
appreciation, Pete Sampras owned this day.</LD>
<LD>   "This takes the cake," Sampras said.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras has never been one for padding his sentences with extra
emotion but this time the paucity of words came from utter physical
and emotional exhaustion.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras beat Andre Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, to win his fifth
U.S. Open and 14th Grand Slam title. He was given a moment or two to
enjoy, then had to think out loud about his future.</TE>
<TE>   "To beat a rival like Andre in a major tournament at the U.S.
Open, a storybook ending, it might be nice to stop," Sampras said.</TE>
<TE>   "I still want to compete, you know? I still love to play. Right
now it's really hard to talk about. My head's spinning. The next
couple of months I'll reflect on it and see where I'm at."</TE>
<TE>   This sounds like a man who might now be ready to retire, on his
own terms, in his own way. This was a man who needed an intravenous
boost of fluids after the match, who spoke in the wearied tone of a
man who had been pushed to his physical limits. Because of rain,
Sampras had played five matches in seven days, all of them filled
with huge emotional as well as physical investment, and now Sampras
had nothing left.</TE>
<TE>   This was a privileged day, for the competitors, for the fans, for
all in the stadium who were able to watch two of America's greatest
tennis champions play for the fifth time in a Grand Slam final.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi was seeded No. 6, Sampras No. 17. Whoever won was going to
be the oldest Open champion since 1970, when Ken Rosewall, 35, won.</TE>
<TE>   The day began with an emotional singing of "America" by Art
Garfunkel and his son, James, a haunting version of quivering high
notes sung while the tattered flag that survived the World Trade
Center attacks blew strongly in the wind above Arthur Ashe Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras and Agassi stood together again, two men who have grown up
together as opposites and rivals who appreciate having each other.</TE>
<TE>   These two men began their Grand Slam rivalry when they were
children, at the 1990 U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras was 19, scrawny and loose-limbed and oblivious to his own
great talent and the history he was starting to make. Agassi was 20,
as interested in being trendy and hip and having cool clothes and
long hair as he was to making a tennis legacy.</TE>
<TE>   They played in the final. Sampras won, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, a thorough
thumping. Afterward Agassi said that Sampras had served too well,
everything on the lines and 120 mph.</TE>
<TE>   It was that way Sunday. Sampras had 33 aces. Everything on the
lines, 120 mph, Agassi lunging and punching.</TE>
<TE>   This was so unexpected from Sampras. He was a woebegone figure two
months ago at Wimbledon, a second-round loser in another tournament
he had owned, an old-looking man with his head buried in a towel out
on Court 2, an insulting place in Sampras' mind for a champion to
have been exiled.</TE>
<TE>   And more than ever, Sampras heard the sad questions.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't he walk off the stage, leave it to the youngsters? Why
didn't he understand that his moment of triumph, the 2000 Wimbledon
when he broke the record, won his 13th major and hugged his father
Gus--who had never celebrated a victory at a Grand Slam event with
his son--could not be topped and should not have been tarnished with
all the losses that followed?</TE>
<TE>   It was time, wasn't it? Thanks for the effort and historical
greatness, Pete, and go away. Sampras heard this. He kept quiet about
it, but he heard it.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I promised myself, even though I was struggling and
hearing this and that, was I want to stop on my own terms," Sampras
said. "I deserve to stop on my own terms. I've done too much in the
game to hear the negative things and start believing it."</TE>
<TE>   And Sampras didn't say "I told you so," even though he could have.</TE>
<TE>   If he plays again next year, if he says he wants to win an eighth
Wimbledon or feels motivated to defend his Open title, then that's
what he should do.</TE>
<TE>   If the scene at the net in the dusk Sunday evening--hugging
Agassi, his foil, his rival, the man he calls "the best I ever
played, no disrespect to anybody else"--if this was Sampras' final
Grand Slam moment, then it was the best. By the best.</TE>

<KH>OAKLAND 31, SEATTLE 17</KH>
<HD>Raiders Start Out on the Right Foot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Tim Brown made sure his coach got the game ball.</LD>
<LD>   After the Oakland Raiders defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 31-17, on
Sunday, Brown congratulated new Coach Bill Callahan, who replaced Jon
Gruden when he left for Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, there has been a lot of talk about that, can we be the
same team?" said Brown, playing for his sixth coach since joining the
team in 1988.</LD>
<TE>   "This is only one victory, but it's important he get the game
ball. Everybody can settle down, they know he can coach. If we don't
win another game, it's not his fault."</TE>
<TE>   Rich Gannon completed 19 of 28 passes for 214 yards and two
touchdowns, and Charlie Garner amassed 191 total yards and scored two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders tallied 24 consecutive points to beat the Seahawks for
the fifth time in a row in the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought our team came out and played physical today," Callahan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be physical from the onset. I thought our units were
cohesive. Our run defense was outstanding, and we limited Seattle a
great deal."</TE>
<TE>   Because NFL realignment has separated the longtime AFC West
rivals, Seattle is not scheduled to return to Oakland for a
regular-season game until 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's meeting was much like last year's game here, except this
time Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck played better.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck, filling in for injured starter Trent Dilfer, completed
his first eight passes and led the Seahawks into the end zone in
their first offensive series, passing to Itula Mili for a one-yard
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   As the starter last season, Hasselbeck was sacked six times by the
Raiders before getting benched with the Seahawks trailing, 38-0, in
an eventual 38-14 loss.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle's 1-3 preseason, Hasselbeck threw five interceptions
and only one touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Maurice Morris set up Mili's touchdown when he returned a
kickoff 66 yards to start the Seahawk drive on the Oakland 36.</TE>
<TE>   Then Seattle fell apart, struggling to convert third downs and
allowing the Raiders touchdowns on their first three drives of the
second quarter. The Seahawks were penalized 13 times for 105 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't anything we hadn't seen in practice," Seahawk
cornerback Shawn Springs said. "They outblocked us, they outran us,
they out-toughed us. There weren't any secret plays."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's new defensive front led by John Parrella and Sam Adams
made sure to shut down Shaun Alexander, who rushed for 266 yards
against the Raiders in Seattle last season.</TE>
<TE>   He was limited to 36 yards in 13 carries this time. "The only
tough thing about this is we don't get another shot at them like we
used to," Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   Garner was the running back of the day. He carried 15 times for
127 yards and had five catches for 64.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, who did not throw a touchdown pass in the preseason,
connected with Brown for an eight-yard scoring pass on Oakland's
first possession.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 31, ARIZONA 23</KH>
<HD>Spurrier Is Cut Above</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier cut the middle finger of his right hand while trying
to rip off his headset over a holding penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier's first NFL play was a simple run up the middle--much to
the coach's surprise.</LD>
<LD>   His debut as coach of the Washington Redskins was more of an
adventure than anyone could have expected. After all, when was the
last time a coach slammed his playsheet to the ground because he had
to use his backup quarterback as a kicker?</LD>
<TE>   But Spurrier and the Redskins survived Danny Wuerffel's tepid
squib kickoff and subsequent headfirst tackle and held off the
Arizona Cardinals, 31-23, Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Matthews threw three touchdown passes, and Stephen Davis
overcame a third-quarter groin strain to get 150 total yards in an
attack that wasn't as much Fun 'n' Gun or trickery as it was good,
solid NFL offense.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews completed 28 of 40 passes for 327 yards, and Rod Gardner
had seven catches for 131 yards and a touchdown as the Redskins put
up 442 yards of total offense.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, concerned he would be the forgotten man in a pass-happy
offense, was the focal point with 26 carries for 104 yards and had
seven catches for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times did he carry? 25? 30?" Spurrier said. "Sometimes
you can't believe what you hear or read."</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, coaching the first game of his record five-year,
$25-million contract, was known for tossing his visor at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But this game will be remembered for the big bandage he wore
around his finger after the headset calamity.</TE>
<TE>   "They had that little sponge for padding," Spurrier said. "But I
guess my finger went right through it."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the injury to kicker Brett Conway, who experienced
what he called "a total failure" in his leg in the first half.
Conway, bothered by a hip injury during training camp, couldn't kick
after his final meager extra point, prompting Wuerffel into emergency
duty.</TE>
<TE>   Conway's injury let the Cardinals back into the game. Wuerffel's
kickoff was so short that he had to make the tackle himself at
Washington's 42-yard line.</TE>

<HD>An Emotional Day for Dolphins' Edwards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday, when Robert Edwards reached an NFL end zone for the first
time in four seasons, he knelt and said a prayer of thanks.</LD>
<LD>   Later, he scored again--just to emphasize that his comeback from a
calamitous knee injury is complete.</LD>
<LD>   Playing in his first game since January 1999, Edwards scored the
Miami Dolphins' final two touchdowns to punctuate a 49-21 victory
over the Detroit Lions.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt like I did when I scored my first touchdown as a rookie,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The injury followed Edwards' rookie season as a 1,000-yard rusher
for the New England Patriots in 1998. When he hurt his left knee
playing flag football on a beach before the Pro Bowl in Hawaii,
doctors feared amputation might be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Even when they saved the leg, the prognosis was gloomy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told my career was definitely over, and that I might not be
able to walk without a cane," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, thanks to a series of operations and arduous
rehabilitation, the former first-round draft pick has regained much
of his speed. He won a spot on the Dolphin roster as a backup to
Ricky Williams, and he saw plenty of action in Sunday's blowout.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, 27, carried four times for 20 yards and caught four
passes for 38--dazzling numbers only to those aware of his ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just a special story," offensive lineman Mark Dixon said.
"His heart and courage are something most of us can't comprehend."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' recovery came in fits and starts as he endured nightmares
that his leg had been amputated. He was walking and biking only a few
months after the injury, but it was last year before he was ready for
a training camp tryout--with the Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   Hampered by a groin injury, he practiced only twice and was cut.
He signed with Miami after last season and said he felt great after
Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge step," Edwards said. "I think I'm capable of going
out and doing that every week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries: Tennessee Pro Bowl defensive end Jevon
Kearse broke a bone in his left foot and will be out at least six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland running back Zack Crockett was taken off the field on a
cart after injuring his neck while covering a punt against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to move his arms and legs but was taken to a local
hospital for tests. Coach Bill Callahan said X-rays were negative.</TE>
<TE>   * New York Jet running back Curtis Martin did not play the second
half against the Buffalo Bills because of a mildly sprained left
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   * Philadelphia offensive lineman John Welbourn broke his left leg

<HD>Sampras Makes a Lasting Impact</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He battles past old rival Agassi in four sets for
fifth U.S. Open championship and 14th major title, then admits
retirement is possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>His journey from zero to 13 was nothing compared to the march from 13
to 14. Almost yearly, Pete Sampras marked off majors, sometimes
winning two in the same season.</LD>
<LD>   But the man who was as reliable as a machine started to stall
after his record-setting 13th Grand Slam championship at Wimbledon in
2000. And as his tournament title drought hit 33, his viability on
the circuit was questioned by many, including his peers, who circled
his aura like vultures.</LD>
<LD>   So much of Sampras' career has traded on a rare ability to
astound, so it shouldn't have come as a surprise that he had it in
him to do it one more time.</LD>
<TE>   He flicked his magic racket again Sunday, maybe for the last time,
recording a most improbable result, winning the U.S. Open at age 31
to capture his 14th Grand Slam singles title.</TE>
<TE>   That the result came against his greatest rival, Andre Agassi, put
the championship in a special stratosphere. The 17th-seeded Sampras
served the way he did in his prime for two sets, then held on with
gritty determination, defeating No. 6 Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, in
2 hours 54 minutes, hitting 33 aces.</TE>
<TE>   Flashes of light dotted Arthur Ashe Stadium as Sampras tossed the
ball in the air to serve on his first match point, at 5-4, 40-0.
Agassi saved it with a forehand passing shot, and the cameras were
poised again, lights flashing to capture the winning image.</TE>
<TE>   And Sampras supplied it, hitting a winning backhand volley, ending
his 26-month run without a title. He thrust his arms in the air and
shared a warm embrace with Agassi at the net, and later made the long
climb into the stands to hug his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson. It
was somewhat reminiscent of his journey up the stairs at Wimbledon
when he found his parents after the record-setting moment.</TE>
<TE>   So similar, and so different.</TE>
<TE>   "This one might take the cake," Sampras said. "I never thought
anything would surpass what happened at Wimbledon a couple of years
ago. But the way I've been going this year, to kind of come through
this and play the way I did today, it was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   But were the cameras capturing the image of Sampras for the last
time? His close friend Paul Annacone, who reunited with Sampras this
summer as his coach, spoke positively about the future.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sampras came into the interview room. After he was done
talking, the question was: Will he stay or will he go?</TE>
<TE>   That has been out there, but Sampras put it out there himself
Sunday. "Well, I'm gonna have to weigh it up in the next months to
see where I'm at," said Sampras, who appeared in his third
consecutive Open final. "I still want to play. I love to play. But to
beat a rival like Andre in a major tournament at the U.S. Open, a
storybook ending, it might be nice to stop. ... You know, see where
I'm at in a couple of months, where my heart's at and my mind. Right
now, it's really hard to talk about. My head's spinning. But I'm sure
the next couple of weeks I'll reflect on it and kind of see where I'm
at in a few months time."</TE>
<TE>   The flip side of staying is the idea of going out on top. In a
sense, Sampras' victory at the Open--his fifth, which tied Jimmy
Connors--is similar to Jack Nicklaus' Masters victory in 1986, after
almost six years without a win in a major. Nicklaus, too, used
negative comments to fuel his desire, putting articles on his
refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras had Greg Rusedski for that. "He's got his own issues,"
Sampras said of the British player, who had criticized him at the
Open. "His issues have issues."</TE>
<TE>   The vulnerability of Sampras made him a sentimental favorite,
which is saying something with the 32-year-old Agassi on the same
court. Agassi, playing in his first Grand Slam final since winning
the Australian Open in 2001, is 1-4 against Sampras in Grand Slam
finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think a lot of people get support toward the end of their
career," Agassi said. "The difference is they thought I'd been at the
end of mine for eight years now."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi started slowly and looked slightly sluggish, perhaps a
product of a difficult semifinal victory Saturday against Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia. But he showed his mettle and kept plugging away.
Eventually Sampras' serve returned to earth, losing some speed, and
Agassi found his return range.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having a hard time getting on to it and getting off the
mark and making any sort of impact at all," Agassi said. "I think he
sensed that, and I was allowing him to play pretty loose in his
return games."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi quite conceivably could have pushed the match into a fifth
set. He had two break points against Sampras in the fourth game of
the fourth set, a 22-point game that had seven deuces. Sampras held
on, and later in the set, the momentum flipped one more time in about
a five-minute span.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras broke Agassi in the ninth game on his fourth break-point
chance, hitting a huge forehand service return, drawing a forehand
into the net from Agassi. Sampras served it out, calling the moment
"eerie."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens in his future, he will always have New York,
which is where it all started with his first Grand Slam title in
1990, against Agassi, and where it may have ended with a win against
Agassi, completing the circle.</TE>
<TE>   "A little destiny, sure. It might have went my way in this event
to play Andre in the final, two Americans that have meant a lot to
the game in the U.S.," Sampras said. "Yeah, it was a fitting way to
end it."</TE>

<HD>Texans Are Lone Stars in Opener</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Expansion team humbles hated Cowboys, 19-10,
in NFL debut before 69,604 in Houston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>There are embarrassing gaffes. There are humiliating indignities.
Then there's losing to the expansion Houston Texans on national TV,
the way the Dallas Cowboys did Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   With ashen-faced Cowboy owner Jerry Jones nervously pacing the
sidelines, the Texans scored twice in the fourth quarter to defeat
the Cowboys, 19-10, to join the 1961 Minnesota Vikings as the only
expansion teams to win their debut.</LD>
<LD>   The sellout crowd of 69,604 rocked Reliant Stadium--a $440-million
glass palace--and roared with approval when David Carr broke a 10-10
tie with a 65-yard touchdown pass to Corey Bradford early in the
fourth quarter. Ten minutes later, with 2:37 showing on the clock,
the Texans sealed the victory with a safety--Seth Payne sacked Dallas
quarterback Quincy Carter in the end zone--and jubilant fans danced
in the stands. One held a sign that read, "You can go 1-15, as long
as you beat the Cowboys," and that pretty much summed up the emotion
of this football-starved city.</LD>
<TE>   "They didn't give us a chance," said Texan running back Jonathan
Wells, whose team was an eight-point underdog. "The coaches showed us
some clips about what they were talking about. They didn't respect us
at all. Some guys said that losing to the Texans would be like
Oklahoma losing to Baylor. We took that personally and we came out
and got that done."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans won with good defense, sporadic bursts of offense, and
by taking advantage of costly Dallas penalties. It was a penalty, in
fact, that paved the way to the first touchdown in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   On the first play from scrimmage, Carr dropped back and fired a
long pass for Bradford. But Bradford was roughed up along the
sideline by Bryant Westbrook, and the ensuing pass-interference call
gave the Texans a first down at the Dallas 21. Three plays later,
Carr connected with Billy Miller over the middle, and the former USC
player eluded a tackle and stretched the ball across the goal line
for a 19-yard touchdown play.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans built a 10-3 halftime lead despite rolling up a mere 82
yards before the intermission, then appeared to be coming apart in
the third quarter when Dallas running back Michael Wiley dashed
untouched through the defense for a 46-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cowboys were unable to sustain the rally, and Carter
looked out of sync all night. He was sacked three times, intercepted
once, and connected on only 13 of 30 passes.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Emmitt Smith, who started the season 540 yards shy of
Walter Payton's all-time rushing record, gained 67 yards in 17
carries to lead all rushers.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the attention was focused on Carr, the No. 1 pick last
spring, who looked fairly polished even though he was under constant
pressure. He was sacked six times and threw for only 145 yards, but
he would have had another touchdown had receiver Jermaine Lewis held
on to a beautiful long pass at the end of the first half. He let it
slip through his hands as he was all alone and just a few steps from
the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to stay pretty relaxed," Carr said. "I tried to stay on
an even keel, but when you score on your first drive, it's hard not
to get a little excited out there. I was a little excited and I had
to calm myself down and sit down a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys were impressed, particularly with his durability.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real good player," Dallas defensive tackle La'Roi Glover
said. "We hit him, we popped him and got after him. We scratched and
clawed to get after him, and he still made the plays that counted."</TE>
<TE>   In all, it was an ideal night for the Texans. NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue was at the game and toured the stadium with Texan
Owner Bob McNair a few hours before kickoff. It was McNair who wrote
the $700-million check to outbid Los Angeles for the league's 32nd
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue raved about the stadium, which is more than half glass
and features pro football's only retractable roof. And the
commissioner said he can envision L.A. having a similar facility in
the coming years, although there's no indication that will happen
anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   "History tells us that Los Angeles does things on a world-class
standard," Tagliabue said. "So at some point there will be a
world-class stadium there."</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing world-class about the way Jones was feeling
after the game. He stayed and talked to reporters for several minutes
after the game, repeatedly heaping praise on the Texans and McNair.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't expect to lose tonight," he said, finally. "We get to
sleep on this for four years and I'm sure this will be with us for a
long time."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his team, which spent the summer as subjects for the
Hard Knocks documentary, pulled off a convincing audition for its
next HBO special: Six Feet Under.</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 27, PHILADELPHIA 24</KH>
<HD>Titans Regain Their McFlair for the Dramatic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The Tennessee Titans think they have their winning attitude back.
They can thank Steve McNair and Eddie George.</LD>
<LD>   McNair threw for two touchdowns, including one in the fourth
quarter, and George scored two touchdowns, the second on a two-yard
run with 3:09 remaining, as the Titans rallied and beat the
Philadelphia Eagles, 27-24, Sunday for their first season opening
victory since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the way we felt years ago," Titan receiver Kevin Dyson
said. "We kept fighting and found a way to win."</LD>
<TE>   The Titans, who lost five games at home in going 7-9 last season,
led only once in the game, 7-0 after their opening drive, and turned
the ball over four times.</TE>
<TE>   They also lost three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Jevon Kearse on
the second play from scrimmage because of a broken left foot. He will
have surgery today and will be sidelined six to eight weeks. They
also had several players battling cramps in 90-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   Even a ruling on an onside kick by the Eagles went against them.</TE>
<TE>   "No one blinked an eye," Titan Coach Jeff Fisher said. "They just
kept playing, and I'm especially proud of them."</TE>
<TE>   The defense sacked Donovan McNabb six times, intercepted him twice
and shut down the Eagles in the second half. Philadelphia had 261
yards of total offense but only 78 in the second half. McNabb was 18
for 36 for 212 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The defending NFC East champions had two chances in the final
3:03, but the Eagles went three-and-out on their first possession. On
the last Eagle possession, rookie Carlos Hall sacked McNabb for the
third time, knocking the ball loose, and Titan end Kevin Carter
recovered with 1:12 to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes on my shoulders," said Philadelphia Coach Andy Reid,
whose team led, 24-10, at halftime. "This is my fault, and I take the
full responsibility for it. I need to do a better job of being more
aggressive in the second half and putting the players in a better
position, and that is what I will do."</TE>
<TE>   Reid had McNabb handing off in the second half, and that is when
the Eagles bogged down. McNabb said part of the problem came from the
Titans disguising their defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that with the number of guys they were bringing that we
had to get rid of the ball quick," McNabb said.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum shifted for good with Philadelphia leading, 24-13, at
the end of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Dyson intercepted a pass from McNabb. The Titans then got a
key defensive pass interference call against former Tennessee safety
Blaine Bishop for 40 yards, and McNair threw a two-yard touchdown
pass to Justin McCareins five plays later with 12:49 to go.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans tried for a two-point conversion, but McNair was
stripped of the ball short of the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee forced Philadelphia to punt, and McNair drove the Titans
84 yards in 14 plays by going six for nine for 81 yards. The
highlight was a 39-yard catch-and-run by Derrick Mason on third and
19 to the Eagle 30. McNair finished 24 for 34 for 269 yards.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Victory Looks Weak in Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winning can be a salve that makes deep cuts feel like mere scratches.</LD>
<LD>   The real pain should be hitting UCLA right about now.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins' 30-19 victory over then-19th-ranked Colorado State
Saturday looks terrific on paper and the fourth-quarter highlights,
but much of UCLA's performance was hard to watch.</LD>
<TE>   Despite being the last of the 117 major-college teams to start the
football season, the Bruins weren't ready.</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't it enough of an omen when Akil Harris fumbled the opening
kickoff not once, but twice?</TE>
<TE>   He recovered the first and Tab Perry recovered the second, leading
to one of the good-news statistics of the evening: At least the
Bruins were four for four recovering their fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   The final score says UCLA won big.</TE>
<TE>   The final analysis says the Bruins made a few big plays when they
had to and better buckle down in practice and get the kinks out fast.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick called it like he saw it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the better team for three quarters," he said. "We could
have just as easily won this game as not. Had we made the two-point
conversion, who knows what might have happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin defense made the big plays, and from the looks of it,
that's going to be UCLA's identity.</TE>
<TE>   There was the determined swarm that met quarterback Bradlee Van
Pelt as he tried one more option run on the two-point conversion
attempt that would have tied the score with 1:32 left.</TE>
<TE>   Van Pelt desperately tried to make a pitch, but UCLA's Ben Emanuel
alertly grabbed the loose ball and raced to the other end zone for
two points--the first defensive two-point conversion in UCLA history.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the swarm was linebacker Brandon Chillar, who led
UCLA with 10 tackles and thwarted a scoring threat with a
third-quarter interception at the Bruin seven-yard line as Colorado
State tried to pad a six-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   And in the fourth quarter, cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. put a hit
on running back Cecil Sapp that forced a fumble. UCLA recovered, and
then Manuel White ran 16 yards for the touchdown that gave UCLA a
21-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Take away those three plays--or even one or two of them--and UCLA
probably doesn't win.</TE>
<TE>   On offense, the Bruins didn't find any rhythm until the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   Their only first-half points came courtesy of the fleet feet of
freshman Junior Taylor, whose spectacular 49-yard touchdown run off a
reverse only made you want to see more of him.</TE>
<TE>   What UCLA fans mostly saw was that quarterback Cory Paus wasn't
very accurate--and when he was, Bruin receivers frequently dropped
passes.</TE>
<TE>   The running game amassed 215 yards, but 49 of them came on
Taylor's run and Harris, despite 94 yards with a long run of 35, has
planted the seeds that he might be a fumbler.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman quarterback Drew Olson did better than anyone could hope
and demonstrated plenty of poise. But that should only serve to make
UCLA feel more comfortable about him as the backup to Paus, not make
anyone hanker for a quarterback change because he completed two of
three passes and directed a scoring drive.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's special teams--with the notable exception of the job the
Bruins did fielding Colorado State's onside kick attempt after the
two-point conversion play--were disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Griffith, the Bruins' reliable kicker, missed field-goal
attempts from 41 and 32 yards (the first was partially blocked).</TE>
<TE>   Compare that to last season, when Griffith missed only three field
goals, going 10 for 13--and one of the misses was from 50 yards on
the final play of a 21-20 loss to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   There's more. The punt coverage team gave up a 55-yard return to
the UCLA 15 by Dexter Wynn that set up Colorado State's first
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   And the punt return team gave the Rams the ball back to revive a
drive after UCLA was called for roughing the punter.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty to work on, in other words.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half, the kicking game faltered," Toledo said. "We
missed two field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, in the first half, the passing game wasn't very good.</TE>
<TE>   "But the defense played well and kept us in it."</TE>
<TE>   Put plainly, the defense carried the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Now their job is to see that the load isn't as heavy Saturday at
Oklahoma State.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. intelligence analysts were alarmed when spy satellite photos
last month suddenly showed dozens of trucks near a former Iraqi
biological weapons facility on the outskirts of Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Was Saddam Hussein again producing botulinum toxin, which causes
botulism, at the Taji military base? Was he moving Republican Guard
equipment in fear of a U.S. airstrike? Hauling animal feed?</LD>
<LD>   "It's open to interpretation," said a CIA official.</LD>
<TE>   Similar photos last spring showed trucks carting steel tanks to
Falluja, a former chemical weapons facility. Had the so-called
"devil's kitchen" resumed production of deadly sarin, cyclosarin and
mustard gas? Or was it, as Iraq claims, producing pesticide to fight
an infestation of white fly?</TE>
<TE>   Commercial satellite pictures last week showed new buildings at
several sites once used for Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Was it
evidence that Baghdad had resumed illegal nuclear activity?</TE>
<TE>   Not until someone looks inside, a U.N. official said.</TE>
<TE>   These and other troubling questions will form the backdrop when
President Bush addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. He is
expected to declare that Iraq has illegally built or is pursuing
weapons of mass destruction, and to warn that the United States will
act alone unless the world community moves quickly and decisively to
disarm Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   After months of threatening war against Iraq, Bush administration
officials now say they will consider a final U.N. effort to force
Baghdad to immediately accept highly intrusive weapons inspections.
If Hussein refused, or failed to cooperate, he would face military
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has barred the U.N. inspectors since December 1998. If they
now return, their task will be daunting.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials have identified about 700 potential sites for
initial inspection, including up to 100 places where clandestine
weapons work might have begun over the last four years. Just checking
the known sites could take a year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The priority now is "to tackle the 'Dark Years,' " said Ewen
Buchanan of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission in New York, which is responsible for ferreting out
evidence of chemical weapons, biological agents and ballistic
missiles in Iraq. "What has happened since the 1998 withdrawal of
inspectors?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer is far from clear. After being gone for four years,
inspectors not only would need new cameras, computers and cars--they
also would need a mop. U.N. officials say a flock of pigeons has
taken roost in the former inspection chief's Baghdad office, laying
eggs on the sofa and soiling the desk and floor.</TE>
<TE>   Established after the U.S.-led coalition forced Iraq from Kuwait
in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.N. Special Commission was created
to verify Iraq's commitment to get rid of chemical weapons,
biological agents and most missiles and warheads. The work was
expected to last about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, teams from the U.N. and International Atomic
Energy Agency had uncovered far larger quantities and far more
dangerous weaponry than anyone expected, including a previously
unknown nuclear weapons program that appeared within months of
building a crude atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's fierce resistance ended the inspections. By the time the
last U.N. teams withdrew in 1998, just before a punitive bombing
campaign by U.S. and British forces, they had dismantled or destroyed
hundreds of ballistic missiles, huge stores of chemical and
biological warfare agents, and sophisticated nuclear laboratories,
factories and equipment, according to U.N. reports and inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   But dozens of disarmament issues were left unresolved. Evidence
suggested, for example, that Iraq still possessed stockpiles of
liquid anthrax and up to 17 tons of growth media for other biological
agents. Also apparently missing were reserves of VX, a highly lethal
nerve agent, and up to 4,000 tons of precursor chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   More important, most experts believe that Hussein could have
resumed production of biological and chemical weapons on a modest
scale any time after the inspectors left.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that he has a lot of chemical and biological
weapons," said Lawrence Freedman, a military expert at King's College
in London.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's nuclear program was largely dismantled by 1998, and
although Baghdad reportedly has tried to buy black-market plutonium
or highly enriched uranium, no evidence indicates that it has
obtained the fissile material needed to build a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. inspectors never found parts of a centrifuge cascade, a
series of subcritical gas centrifuges that could be used to enrich
some forms of uranium. If the system is working, some experts fear
that Iraq by now may have produced enough fuel for a workable nuclear
device.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1998, there was a broad consensus that they could build an
enrichment plant in two to seven years," said David Albright, a
former nuclear inspector who now heads the Institute for Science and
International Security, a Washington think tank. "But when did they
start? Where are they in the process? We don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Similar questions dog Iraq's missile program. After the Gulf War,
Baghdad was barred by the U.N. from building missiles with a range of
more than 150 kilometers, or about 90 miles. Some experts are
convinced that Iraq hid 12 to 18 longer-range missiles as well as
numerous warheads. Such missiles, if they exist, could conceivably
reach U.S. forces or allies in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Smuggling is another problem. Inspectors discovered covert
transactions between Iraq and more than 500 companies from 40
countries between 1993 and 1998 in violation of U.N. sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, U.S. officials say, Iraq has used a complex global web
of front companies and proxy agents to smuggle in machines and
materials, including aluminum alloys, special tubes and high-strength
steel that could be used for missile or nuclear weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are credible reports that illegal procurement is ongoing,"
said Timothy McCarthy, a former inspector who specialized in missile
searches. "I don't see any reason to think it would have stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts say the U.N. mission that ended in 1998 might have
achieved greater success if it had targeted Hussein's weapons experts
in addition to his weapons. The commission had personnel rosters with
thousands of names of Iraqi scientists and technicians but never
tried to arrange asylum, fellowships or other opportunities that
would have taken them out of Iraq and thus out of its weapons
programs.</TE>
<TE>   If allowed back in, the U.N. will use a U2 spy plane for aerial
mapping and a French Mirage jet for airborne sensors, as it did in
the 1990s. Nuclear experts would test the water for radioactive
pollutants and use vehicle-mounted gamma ray detectors to test the
air. Other sophisticated equipment would look for telltale chemical
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Teams would fan out across the country with helicopter-borne
ground-penetrating radar to look for underground sites. Similar
efforts in the 1990s, backed by geologists and other specialists,
found nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Few who have dealt with Baghdad over the last decade believe that
Hussein would fully cooperate with new inspections. U.N. reports say
Iraqi authorities regularly lied about their weapons, secretly moved
equipment, hid or forged documents and used armed troops and angry
mobs to block inspections of key facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Similar confrontations are inevitable if inspections resume,
warned Robert Einhorn, who retired last year as assistant U.S.
secretary of State for nonproliferation.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be passive at first," Einhorn said. "They'll say they
can't locate the scientists we want, or say, 'Sorry, we can't provide
an escort,' or 'The road's washed out,' or 'It's a religious
holiday.' Eventually, it will become more active obstruction."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gallucci, who once was trapped for four days in a Baghdad
parking lot because he refused to surrender an Iraqi nuclear weapons
document he had found, agreed. "The Iraqis will do whatever they can
to impede inspections of sensitive facilities," said Gallucci, now
dean of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service.</TE>
<TE>   Counterintelligence will be crucial. Several former inspectors say
Iraq used spies and electronic surveillance at inspectors' offices or
hotels in New York, Baghdad and Bahrain in the 1990s to obtain notice
of impending inspections and other intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Another former inspector said Hussein's security forces learned to
hide equipment from satellites and the U2 spy planes, which were
operated by U.S. pilots from a base in Saudi Arabia. They also began
to encrypt communications and use fiber-optic cable instead of radios
to hinder electronic intercepts by U.S. and other intelligence
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew when our satellites moved across the sky," he said.
"They had their own jamming stuff. They were very good at it."</TE>
<TE>   While waiting to return to Iraq, U.N. and IAEA experts have relied
on news reports, intelligence gathered by various government
agencies, and high-resolution color photographs taken by commercial
satellite. U.N. officials announced last week that they had evidence
of new construction at former Iraqi nuclear sites after studying
overhead photos.</TE>
<TE>   "From time to time, we see changes on the ground--a new building
here or there or a renovation," said Mark Gwozdecky, spokesman for
the IAEA. "But we have no conclusions to draw. The only way we can
tell what's under the roof is to have inspectors on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   A steady stream of defectors and informants also has provided
tips. Defectors have said, for example, that a secret weapons
facility now sits in a women's dormitory at Baghdad University.
Another allegedly is under a downtown Baghdad hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Some former inspectors are skeptical. In the past, they say, Iraq
tried to plant bogus information to embarrass the U.N. One group of
inspectors was repeatedly told that nuclear material was in a Baghdad
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an attempt to lure us into digging up the central
cemetery," recalled David Kay, an early member of the nuclear
inspections team. "Can you imagine how that would have played out on
CNN?"</TE>
<TE>   Several defectors also have warned recently that Iraq has built
mobile weapons laboratories, disguising them inside refrigerated
trucks and other vehicles. Former inspector Scott Ritter said he
chased similar reports from 1993 to 1998 without success.</TE>
<TE>   "I launched raid after raid," he said. "We intercepted their radio
traffic. We ran roadblocks. We never found anything. It was just
speculation."</TE>
<TE>   Other defectors appear more legitimate. The Pentagon's Defense
Intelligence Agency last year sent a team to Bangkok, Thailand, to
pick up and debrief Adnan Saeed Haideri, an Iraqi engineer who said
he had helped build clandestine chemical and biological weapons
sites. Haideri also said Baghdad had resumed its nuclear weapons
program in underground facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Nabeel Musawi, a member of the London-based Iraqi National
Congress, an opposition group in exile, said Haideri and other
defectors have made clear that the Iraqi dictator has sought to
disguise and disperse his secret weapons factories, hiding them near
homes, office blocks and other civilian sites.</TE>
<TE>   "He mirrors every program three times around the country," Musawi
said. "So if one is bombed or discovered, you just move the programs.
Only bits of the program are done at any given moment at a site.
Nowadays, you have tiny little sites spread all over the country.
Instead of huge complexes in the desert, you now have them in
residential areas."</TE>
<TE>   Former inspectors say that some of the uncertainties about Iraq's
weapons programs may never be cleared up. Some of the evidence may be
misleading, and some of the suspicions unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I laugh when I hear people say we know this or that about what
Iraq is doing," said McCarthy, who was an inspector for four years.
"Those of us who have spent a lot of time in Iraq are much more
humble."</TE>

<HD>Threat by Iraq Grows, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Security: A chorus of Bush officials pushes the case for
strong action, charging that Baghdad is actively working on a nuclear
bomb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a media blitz to rally support for toughened action against Iraq,
the Bush administration charged Sunday that Baghdad's intensifying
efforts to develop a nuclear weapon increase the urgency of ousting
the regime of President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq is "actively and aggressively" working on a nuclear bomb,
with the growing potential for the United States to become a victim
of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, said Vice President Dick
Cheney, one of five top officials who appeared on Sunday television
talk shows to press the U.S. case for strong action on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the looming dangers, the United States does not need
additional U.N. resolutions, international participation or other
justification to act against Baghdad, administration officials
emphasized.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud," National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on CNN's "Late Edition." "How
long are we going to wait to deal with what is clearly a gathering
threat against the United States, against our allies and against his
own region?"</TE>
<TE>   The administration can invoke President Bush's new policy of
preemptive action to eliminate the threat, the officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have reason to believe someone is preparing an attack
against the U.S., has developed that capability, harbors those
aspirations, then I think the U.S. is justified in dealing with it,
if necessary, by military force," Cheney said on NBC's "Meet the
Press."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the regime's buildup of weapons of mass destruction, the
vice president said, a war against Iraq would not be "that tough a
fight." He conceded, however, that it would be costly and could
involve a prolonged U.S. presence in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The increased danger from Hussein's nuclear ambitions has become
clear over the last 12 to 14 months from new intelligence and the
interception of equipment needed to develop a nuclear bomb, including
specialized aluminum tubes to enrich uranium, Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know about a particular shipment. We've intercepted that. We
don't know what else--what other avenues he may be taking out there,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   "But we do know, with absolute certainty, that he is using his
procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to
enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon.... And increasingly, we
believe that the United States may well become the target of those
activities."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Hussein is widely believed to have used illicit
funds derived from smuggling oil to procure goods to advance his
weapons programs, in violation of several U.N. resolutions and the
cease-fire terms of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is still uncertain when Iraq might have a bomb,
but Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said on ABC's "This Week" that he does not believe that
Baghdad has a nuclear capability yet.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney warned that the dangers have reached a point at which a
delay of as little as six months would mean higher costs down the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of military action, if that's what it comes to, would be
significantly less [now] than having to deal with it after we've been
struck once again by a deadly system," the vice president added.</TE>
<TE>   As the administration prepares to mark the first anniversary of
the Sept. 11 attacks, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld invoked
the horrific magnitude and casualties of the terrorist actions
against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in describing Iraq's
weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a Sept. 11 with weapons of mass destruction. It's not
3,000--it's tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children,"
he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials also warned Sunday that Baghdad has
stepped up the development of nonnuclear weapons, particularly its
ability to produce and deliver biological agents such as anthrax and
smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said Hussein could attempt to use these diseases against
other nations, "possibly including the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq also has been "working hard" to develop delivery systems,
among them aerial devices and drones, to disperse biological weapons,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   In light of the dangers, Cheney said, stronger action is warranted
because U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq--the toughest ever
imposed on a nation--have broken down after 11 years and because
growing trade with Baghdad by other nations is allowing Hussein to
both defy the outside world and strengthen his position at home.</TE>
<TE>   A day after Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
plot a joint U.S.-British strategy to win international backing for
what the administration calls "regime change," officials said Sunday
that they believe other allies will eventually agree with the U.S.
call for Hussein's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Other nations either oppose or question the U.S. drive to end
Hussein's 23-year rule because "many of them do not have access to
the [intelligence] information we have," Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is expected to lay out at least some aspects of the
administration's rationale for ousting Hussein during a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia weighed in Sunday with a warning that any effort to use
the war on terrorism to intervene in the internal affairs of a
sovereign state would cause "irreversible damage" to the global
coalition amassed by the United States to confront Islamic
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Powell left open the possibility that the U.S. could go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The president will retain all of his authority and options to act
in a way that may be appropriate for us to act unilaterally to defend
ourselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's domestic campaign to win support came on the
same day that former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter told Iraq's
National Assembly that the United States is on the verge of making a
"historic mistake" by launching a war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter, a former Marine who resigned from the inspections team in
1998, also told the parliament that Iraq is no longer a threat to its
neighbors or the outside world because it has eliminated up to 95% of
its deadliest arms.</TE>
<TE>   "The rhetoric of fear that is disseminated by my government and
others has not to date been backed up by hard facts that substantiate
any allegations that Iraq is today in possession of weapons of mass
destruction or has links to terror groups responsible for attacking
the United States. Void of such facts, all we have is speculation,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials dismissed his allegations. The United States has
facts, not speculation, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Scott is right, then why are they keeping the inspectors out?"
the secretary asked.</TE>
<TE>   Other weapons inspectors disputed Ritter's claim that Iraq has
almost complied with the U.N. demands, pointing out that the United
Nations never had a list outlining 100% of Baghdad's arsenal--and
therefore could not know what percentage has been found and
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   But Ritter did call on Hussein's government to allow the
inspectors to return and have unfettered access to all Iraqi
installations.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has legitimate grievances regarding the past work of the
weapons inspectors and for that reason has sought to keep inspectors
from returning to Iraq. But I also know that there will be no
peaceful solution of this current crisis unless Iraq allows their
return," he said. Ritter in the past has written about the presence
of U.S. and British intelligence operatives among the weapons
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter spoke to the 250-member National Assembly, which is tightly
controlled by the ruling Baath Party, on the same day the parliament
formally ratified a motion nominating Hussein to lead Iraq for seven
more years. Iraqis will go to the polls to vote on the uncontested
nomination Oct. 15.</TE>

<HD>Russia Sits on the Edge of an Epidemic</HD>
<DH>Health: The former Soviet state's social ills go hand in
hand with its soaring HIV rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RYAZAN, Russia</DL>
<LD>Out of work and separated from his wife, Yuri takes the only job he
can find--chauffeuring prostitutes in this provincial city. The women
are all using heroin. He becomes close to one, has an affair with
her, and one evening while drunk accepts her challenge to shoot up
"just once."</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of days, Yuri is addicted. Months later, he learns he
is HIV-positive. He contemplates suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the shock of realizing he might die of AIDS gets him off
drugs. He goes through two weeks of gut-wrenching withdrawal and
stays off the stuff.</LD>
<TE>   And his wife, in an act of love and pity he considers miraculous,
agrees to take him back even knowing of his infection. It would be a
happy ending, if not for the ticking time bomb in his system--and
Russia's.</TE>
<TE>   Dismissed by the former Communist authorities barely a decade ago
as a phenomenon of Western decadence that would never spread widely
here, AIDS is making its mark on the new Russia. Disturbingly, it
arrived virtually overnight, with the number of people with the human
immunodeficiency virus exploding in just the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   The coming together of a poor economy, a burgeoning plague of
intravenous drug use, an overreaction to the country's new freedoms
and Slavic fatalism has landed Russia on the cusp of an epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   The face of HIV infection today in Russia is a young man,
unemployed, who is using or has used intravenous drugs--and who has
caught the disease from injecting himself with a dirty needle. So
far, comparatively few people seem to have been infected by
homosexual or heterosexual contact. Assuming, however, that the young
man is sexually active, officials fear that this will inevitably
change.</TE>
<TE>   At least 201,000 Russians are HIV-positive, and the country's top
AIDS fighter warns that the number of people infected but not
registered with authorities could be four to six times higher.</TE>
<TE>   Across the former Soviet Union, there are more than 1 million
cases of HIV infection, participants at the International AIDS
Conference in Barcelona, Spain, were told this summer. From a very
small number of HIV/AIDS cases in 1995, the former Soviet states have
zoomed ahead of the United States, which is roughly equal in
population but has endured the epidemic for far longer.</TE>
<TE>   The former Soviet states now face the fastest-growing AIDS
epidemic in the world, the United Nations says, and international
AIDS officials consider it vital that more resources go to oppose the
disease here.</TE>
<TE>   The epidemic in Russia is so young that cases of AIDS are rare.
And it is still unclear whether there is a chance to staunch Russia's
HIV crisis before it mushrooms into a human and demographic
catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   There is one glimmer of hope: The number of newly registered cases
of HIV infection has actually been dropping in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Vadim Pokrovsky, director of Russia's federal AIDS center,
argues that the recent drop-off makes the situation no less alarming.
"Last year, about 88,000 new cases were registered. In the first six
months of this year, we registered about 26,000 new cases--which may
seem to some analysts as a slowdown," he said. "But the number of new
cases in which the virus was transmitted heterosexually rose to 7%
compared with 4.3% last year, which demonstrates the epidemic is
spreading over the majority sector of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "And thus it begins to develop according to the African scenario,
where the majority of the HIV patients contracted it heterosexually."</TE>
<TE>   In Pokrovsky's view, if just half of the HIV-infected population
spreads the virus to one sexual partner per year--which he considers
conservative based on the African experience--Russia could have as
many as 5 million HIV cases by 2010 and will have suffered 500,000
AIDS deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be very grave for the country's demographics, because
80% of the infected people are between 15 and 30. They will die, and
they will not produce children. And this is very frightening indeed
for Russia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Already troubled by their country's declining influence since the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, many Russians tend to look with
dread on demographic projections that show their population declining
from its current level of 144 million to around 110 million by 2050.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS could accelerate that decline, and discussion of the epidemic
often is seen here almost as a matter of long-term national survival.</TE>
<TE>   The HIV/AIDS crisis in Russia has been a slow train wreck. Experts
saw it coming but found themselves powerless to stop it. Tatyana N.
Nikitina, the director of the Kaliningrad regional AIDS center, said
the scenarios for the spread of AIDS in Russia turned out to be all
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Officials who were concerned about the disease as early as the
1980s and early 1990s expected it to be primarily a sexually
transmitted illness that would build gradually over a long period.
They were caught by surprise when it instead soared in 1999 and 2000
among intravenous drug users.</TE>
<TE>   Nikitina gave her clinic as an example. Until 1996, it had handled
only 21 HIV cases and needed only two small rooms in a former
kindergarten to function. Suddenly, it was meeting 180 clients a day,
with people lining up outside the doors waiting for blood tests and
HIV counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "It became clear that the amount of work ahead of us was immense,"
she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   As in other parts of Russia, the rate of new infections in
Kaliningrad--a region of about 950,000 people--is falling off. "Each
month we have 30 to 40 fresh cases," Nikitina said. "We call it a
stabilization, but of course, in reality, we understand it is a
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We also see a growth in the disease in people over 30, even over
50. Normal people, not addicts. So it means that it is now spreading
by sex."</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, HIV is striking hardest in communities of intravenous
drug abusers--young people taking the Afghan-grown heroin that in
recent years has flooded the country via Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Pokrovsky expects a slower rise in the disease as it begins
to be spread through heterosexual sex.</TE>
<TE>   Few visitors to Russia fail to notice the presence and ubiquity of
prostitution--women stand day and night along the road from Moscow's
main Sheremetyevo Airport and on other busy thoroughfares.</TE>
<TE>   For young women desperate to escape village life and remote
provincial towns, working for sex clubs and escort agencies, or
dispensing "erotic" massages in their apartments by appointment, may
seem the only path to economic advancement.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows there is a strong link between prostitution and
drug abuse, and the prostitutes themselves pose a major risk factor
for HIV. In the Moscow region, a survey three years ago indicated
that 14% of prostitutes were already infected.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the danger of contracting HIV, prostitutes say many male
clients are willing to pay more to have unprotected sex--creating an
economic incentive for the women to be more careless.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why anyone would put themselves at such risk, Yuri had this
reply: "There is a certain element of haphazardness in the Russian
mentality," he said, citing his own misfortune. "We are always
looking for a stroke of luck, but it seldom comes."</TE>
<TE>   Pokrovsky said prostitutes will play a key role in spreading the
virus to the heterosexual population. "A huge number of women are
among infected drug users--20% to 30%--and most of these make money
for drugs through prostitution," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Nikitina said she wouldn't expect drug abusers to be responsible
in their sexual practices, but there are exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Yuri received the news of his illness a year and a half
ago, he made a resolution: "I will do everything to make sure I do
not ever infect anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   "For me," he said, "it is an ironclad rule: I will never again
have sex without a condom. I make about $100 a month, and buying
good-quality condoms leaves a breach in my family budget. I could buy
cheaper ones, but I would never do that."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he said, he can sense his wife's tension whenever they
have sexual relations. "I can't blame her," he says. Pokrovsky sees
some positive signs that people are beginning to take the threat of
AIDS seriously by using more condoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We can see that the rates of syphilis and gonorrhea have dropped
a bit. We note that the use of condoms is up somewhat," he said. "But
the biggest problem is when we have evolved to a period of
toleration--meaning that the population is no longer afraid enough of
AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   For example, "in June, a poll in Vlast magazine measured what
issues concerned the public. Out of several thousand respondents,
there were 30 concerns listed, and AIDS was not one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Pokrovsky said he sees a similar level of indifference on the part
of the nation's authorities. The expected federal budget to combat
AIDS was small enough--180 million rubles, or about $6 million--he
said, and then that was reduced to $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Ryazan, the city about 136 miles south of Moscow where Yuri
lives, the epidemic started slowly. There was not a single case
detected in the city until 1991, and through 1998 there were one to
five cases each year.</TE>
<TE>   But then the drug epidemic hit, and in one year, 1999, the number
of reported HIV cases mushroomed to about 300. The next year there
were 508 cases, and in 2001 the number of new cases started to
decline, to 307 cases. So far in 2002, it appears that the annual
increase will be about 200 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Anton S. Dimashov, head of the Ryazan Regional AIDS Center, thinks
part of the decline is attributable to the more active prevention
efforts by public health authorities. But mainly he sees a change in
mentality in the town's young people.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, the young would have contacts with the disease only
by hearsay and not by direct exposure. Today, they have started to
bury their own friends. And this is having a major influence on their
thinking," Dimashov said.</TE>
<TE>   Yuri, who asked that his last name be omitted because he fears he
will be fired from his job at a local factory, caught the virus in
2000--the news confirmed by a blood test at the regional AIDS center
four months after his relationship with the prostitute began.</TE>
<TE>   "I had always thought of HIV and AIDS very remotely, not as
something that would ever affect me," he says. "I had never taken any
special interest in finding out more about it--just a glance at the
literature out of curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he says, "I lead a group--Youth Against Narcotics--and in my
spare time, I am an AIDS and HIV counselor."</TE>
<TE>   His 40-year-old wife, Tatyana, who works as a tram conductor,

<TE>   "At first, I thought he was just saying it to make me angry. He
said: 'It is up to you to decide if you want me to leave. If you do,
I will leave.' I finally said I would give it some thought and
decide.</TE>
<TE>   "And later, I thought if he has reacted this way [getting off

wants us to stay together, we will. If not, not. I did not shout. I
did not smash up the kitchen. I just felt extremely sorry for him."</TE>

be, or not to be?' And we decided to be."</TE>

<HD>Airports in Scramble to Add Security</HD>
<DH>Safety: Additional checkpoint lanes and
explosives-detection machines are being installed to meet new U.S.
rules by year's end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the nation prepares to mark the first anniversary of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, California airports are scrambling to complete
dramatic structural changes to meet federal security mandates by the
end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Most noticeable for passengers is likely to be a move by airports
to add lanes and additional equipment at security checkpoints.
Truck-sized explosives-detection machines also will start showing up
in some airport lobbies and on the curbs, squeezing check-in lines
for skycaps and at ticket counters.</LD>
<LD>   Aging facilities such as Los Angeles International Airport will
undergo extensive remodeling, as will several smaller, regional
facilities, where officials are finding room for bulky new security
equipment underground or in parking garages.</LD>
<TE>   At LAX, subcontractors for Lockheed--the company contracted by the
federal Transportation Security Administration to help redesign
airports--plan to start increasing by 25% the security checkpoint
lanes in the airport's nine terminals. The work may require the
relocation of some concessions.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring major revisions are Terminals 1, 3, 4, 6 and the Tom
Bradley International Terminal. Officials emphasize these plans must
be cleared by the Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Redesigned checkpoints are crucial not only to curb long lines,
officials said, but to minimize security breaches, such as a July 27
incident in which a man ducked under a rope near a checkpoint in
Terminal 5, forcing evacuation of the airport's entire south side.</TE>
<TE>   Contractors will widen checkpoints and install aisles with
plexiglass walls on either side. Some passengers will be asked to
step into these "wanding corrals," where they will be examined with
hand-held metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help decrease congestion at the X-rays because people
can stand out of the way of other passengers to be 'wanded' behind a
glass partition, where they can watch their carry-on bag as it goes
through," said Kim Day, deputy executive director of project and
facilities development for the city agency that operates LAX.</TE>
<TE>   New checkpoint areas also will feature improved signs alerting
passengers to what is allowed on board, longer X-ray machine belts,
tables set aside for hand searches of bags and special X-ray machines
for passengers' shoes.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco International Airport is widening security
checkpoint lanes in its two domestic terminals, said airport
spokesman Mike McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   An additional screening lane will be built this fall at Ontario
International Airport. Expanded checkpoints and lanes have been added
at Long Beach and John Wayne airports.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood-Burbank Airport, city building and safety inspectors
halted efforts last month to begin construction on a
40,000-square-foot expansion of the main terminal to meet a federal
Dec. 31 deadline that requires airports to screen all checked luggage
for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank City Council will hear an appeal Sept. 17 of a
decision by the city's planning board to approve these design
changes. The situation prompted airport directors to write the
federal government to say they will be unable to meet the deadline,
said Charles Lombardo, an airport authority commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the Dec. 31 deadline, subcontractors for Boeing--the
company contracted by the Transportation Security Administration to
reconfigure airports to accommodate explosives-detection
machines--will begin installing cables and other electrical equipment
at LAX terminals in October.</TE>
<TE>   The equipment will be used to operate several dozen
explosives-detection machines, which generate three-dimensional
images of objects inside closed bags, in airport lobbies and on some
curbs. The new machines will require officials to reconfigure lines
at ticket counters.</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco International and John Wayne airports, officials
plan to install the truck-sized machines in systems used to move
baggage. This configuration is more efficient than placing the
machines in ticket lobbies, but costs more and is difficult to do at
older facilities such as LAX.</TE>
<TE>   At John Wayne, officials will spend $18 million to build two
baggage systems that include about a dozen explosives-detection
machines, said airport spokeswoman Ann McCarley. The hefty machines
will require workers to build the systems in parking garages outside
Terminals A and B, where they will eliminate some parking, she said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX officials hope eventually to install explosives-detection
machines in existing baggage systems, but that will take time, Day
said. Starting this winter, most passengers' checked luggage will be
scanned with smaller trace-detection machines, she said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX needs about 260 of these machines, which require workers to
use a hand-held swab to detect explosive residue on the inside and
outside of luggage, and must figure out where to install them in
already overcrowded ticket lobbies, Day said.</TE>
<TE>   There are still some unknowns about how new federal security
rules, and the personnel hired to implement them, will affect the
state's airports.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the bigger problems we're having is finding square footage
to house additional people," said Sharon Diggs-Jackson, Long Beach
Airport's public affairs officer. "Our TSA agents need offices and,
as they add people, they need a place to store their uniforms and
effects."</TE>
<TE>   Federal screeners will begin moving into LAX security checkpoints
in October, said David Stone, the Transportation Security
Administration's security director there.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, who began work at LAX two months ago, is making other
significant security changes, including deploying bomb-sniffing dogs
more often on curbs and in airport parking garages, where they will
check passengers' luggage. "This will be part of our theme in the
coming months," Stone said. "We don't want to be predictable or to
allow people to say, 'That's how we've always done things in the
past.' "</TE>
<TE>   LAX may begin a two-week pilot program this month in conjunction
with American Airlines and the Transportation Security Administration
in Terminal 4, where it will eliminate gate screening by combining
these checks at the main security checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   As part of this program--which is still under review--passengers
whose boarding passes are flagged by the airline would go to a
special lane at security checkpoints for a more thorough inspection
instead of undergoing a second screening as they are about to board
the airplane, Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   He said his office will make a recommendation to the
Transportation Security Administration about whether it should expand
the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this increases security by doing what used to be done at
the gate more thoroughly at the main checkpoint," Stone said. "It
also reduces the hassle factor for our passengers, who often have
duplicated checks at the gate."</TE>

<HD>Simon Finds Road to the Center Rocky</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate for governor angers conservatives,
moderates by trying to please both.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bill Simon Jr. backed away last week from his campaign's
previously stated support for several gay rights measures, the GOP
gubernatorial candidate not only angered gay activists, but exposed
the difficulty he faces in simultaneously holding onto his
conservative base and winning over moderate voters.</LD>
<LD>   For the last few months, Simon has struggled to articulate his
positions on issues such as global warming, domestic partnerships and
driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Wary of upsetting conservatives who helped him win the primary
last spring, Simon has refrained from staking out a clear stance on
many of those topics--frustrating the very Republicans he is afraid
of losing. Meanwhile, the novice candidate has made only tentative
efforts to reach out to swing voters, disappointing moderates who say
that Simon is failing to extend the reach of his candidacy.</LD>
<TE>   "He has somehow managed to alienate everybody," said Jack Pitney,
a government professor at Claremont McKenna College and former
national Republican Party operative. "The only appeal he has is that
he's not Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Political experts said Simon's turnaround on gay rights after
pressure from religious conservatives illustrates a striking
difference between how Republican and Democratic politicians must
contend with positions that anger their most ideological voters.
Lately, Democrats have papered over disputes on the death penalty and
welfare reform in the interest of electing their candidates--although
in the governor's office, Davis is under heavy pressure from liberals
to sign a bill protecting farm workers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals are "willing to swallow all those things for the greater
good," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran Republican strategist.
"Conservatives--and I'm one of them--seem on certain issues to lack
the necessary political flexibility to realize the best way to have
influence is to hold office."</TE>
<TE>   The box in which Simon finds himself eight weeks from election day
is familiar to many conservative Republicans seeking statewide office
in California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, U.S. Senate candidate Matt Fong was forced to defend his
credentials as a moderate after newspapers reported that he had given
$50,000 to the Traditional Values Coalition, an anti-gay and
anti-abortion rights group that also criticized Simon's early support
for gay rights measures last month. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, the
incumbent in that race, successfully painted Fong as an extremist and
defeated him by 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   'Moderate State'</TE>
<TE>   Simon "does need to move to the center because California is
fundamentally a moderate state," said Kevin Spillane, a GOP
consultant and political director of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan's failed gubernatorial bid.</TE>
<TE>   After the Republican primary, Simon tried to do just that. With
backing from the Bush administration, he declared his opposition to
offshore oil drilling. And, in a speech before a nonpartisan women's
organization, Simon, a practicing Catholic, said that although he
opposes abortion, he would, as governor, uphold California's
constitutional protection for abortions.</TE>
<TE>   As he entered the fall campaign season, however, Simon's message
and campaign stops appeared tailored for conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   On Labor Day, he visited picnickers at the Richard Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda, calling the late president "a fine public servant."
The next day, he toured the Calvary Christian Center School in
Sacramento, where he complained that state regulations impede home
schooling.</TE>
<TE>   Those moves, combined with Simon's statements last week opposing
Gay Pride Day and hospital visitation rights for gay partners, worry
moderates who want the Republican nominee to avoid controversial
social issues.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening here is that we're obscuring what ought to be
the main focus of the campaign, which is the Davis record," said Jim
Hartman, the state GOP regional chairman in the Bay Area. "There's a
tremendous opportunity, and a lot of us feel frustrated that we're
possibly losing that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's back-and-forth on gay issues has not only aroused concern
among moderates, it has failed to soothe some conservatives who said
they are unsure about where he stands. Even Lyn Nofziger, a veteran
conservative strategist who was touted by the campaign as a senior
advisor, posted a searing critique of the candidate last week on a
conservative family-values Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Questions have been created in people's minds, people who want
marriage and family protected," said Randy Thomasson, executive
director of the Campaign for California Families, a nonpartisan
statewide group that posted Nofziger's commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's preoccupation with pleasing conservative supporters comes
at a time when he needs to position himself as a viable choice for
Democrats and unaligned voters dissatisfied with the governor,
several Republican consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   "You should not be worrying about your base in September," said
one GOP strategist, Don Sipple, who worked on Riordan's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Some political experts believe that Simon's continued attempts to
woo the party's rank and file suggest that he believes a robust
Republican turnout could overcome a weak Democratic showing Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's campaign consultant, said a low turnout would
increase the power of conservative voters, who tend to vote more
faithfully than others.</TE>
<TE>   But Russo insisted that the campaign is not relying only on the
party's conservative base to deliver a Simon victory. For one thing,
Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents hugely outnumber
Republicans in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only win in California by appealing to a broad
cross-section of voters, and that's what we're doing," said Russo,
who ran Fong's losing Senate race. "We're doing that by talking about
core issues that matter to people: education, the economy and quality
of life."</TE>
<TE>   Global Warming</TE>
<TE>   As he has done that, however, Simon often has appeared fearful of
angering party conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Simon's rhetoric fluctuated as he tried to explain his
stance on legislation regulating automobile emissions of greenhouse
gases.</TE>
<TE>   "Reducing global warming, if indeed there is such a thing as
global warming, is always a good idea," Simon told a San Francisco
radio station.</TE>
<TE>   In other interviews, however, the GOP candidate criticized the
measure as "social engineering."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has been equally elusive about his position on a
bill pending before Davis that would grant driver's licenses to
undocumented immigrants who are applying for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate told the Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion
in July that he would sign the measure, as long as proper security
measures were in place.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent radio interviews, however, Simon repeatedly said he
would have to look at the final language before making up his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very upset and we want an answer on this, not, 'We'll
look into this,' " a caller named Randy scolded Simon during a KFI-AM
(640) interview in late August. "We're waiting to hear your firm
stance, and then we'll go 120% behind you."</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday, Simon struck a different tone.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I tell you, I just don't think I'd sign the bill," he
said in an interview on KRLA-AM (870).</TE>
<TE>   Gay Rights Flap</TE>
<TE>   Russo said Simon's position had not changed: He supports granting
licenses to people who are taking steps to become citizens as part of
a larger effort to legalize the status of immigrants "on the right
path." But the current bill, Russo said, is too narrowly written, and
needs to be complemented by federal immigration reform.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's attempts to explain his position on gay rights led to
confusion even before he disavowed his campaign's statement to a gay
Republican group that, among other things, Simon would sign a
proclamation for a Gay Pride Day.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Simon said he would consider supporting domestic
partnerships--the device used by gay partners to establish legal
rights to benefits and the like-- but only if they were not based on
sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens if my brother and I--we don't happen to have an
intimate relationship, from a certain perspective--why couldn't we be
domestic partners, if we both lost our wives?" Simon asked during an
interview on a San Francisco radio station.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, incest comes to mind," replied KGO-AM (810) host Ronn
Owens. "You lost me on that."</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO--Cold, dry statistics sprang to life and displayed the new
political reality during a recent Assembly floor fight. These
familiar statistics:</LD>
<LD>   * The Latinos' share of the California population grew from 19% to
32% between 1980 and 2000 and is projected to reach 39% by 2020.</LD>
<LD>   * There were only seven Latino legislators after the 1980
election. Today there are 26--seven in the Senate, 19 in the
Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly one-fourth of the Assembly now is Latino. Back 30 years
ago, only one-fortieth was.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is handy fodder for academicians lecturing
abstractly about rising Latino political power.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, however, real Latino politicians were exercising real
power.</TE>
<TE>   The fight involved farm workers and growers. Some rotten-apple
growers have been stonewalling United Farm Worker negotiators for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Now all growers--many very angry--are being affected by the
proposed legislative cure.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW and its Capitol point man--Senate leader John Burton
(D-San Francisco)--kept coming back at session's end with new
collective bargaining proposals, hoping to pass one Gov. Gray Davis
would sign. A bill permitting binding arbitration when negotiations
deadlocked led to a second proposal for mandatory mediation. The
state Agriculture Labor Relations Board would have the final say,
subject to court appeal.</TE>
<TE>   That mediation bill (SB 1156) is what the Assembly was intensely
debating Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   I was struck by the number of Latino lawmakers who rose and spoke
passionately of their farm worker roots. Some spoke at length in
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   It's something you wouldn't have heard 15 years ago, let alone 35
when the powerful Senate leader--Democrat Hugh Burns of
Fresno--carried water for growers. Indeed, the Central Valley then
was represented in Sacramento by white men beholden to growers.</TE>
<TE>   A shift began in the '70s. Fresno Democrat George Zenovich, a
labor ally, replaced Burns in the Senate and co-sponsored the bill
giving farm workers collective bargaining rights and creating the
ALRB.</TE>
<TE>   But few then could have envisioned today's diverse political
representation from California's farm belt.</TE>
<TE>   Example: Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno), 41, a former TV
reporter-anchor. She wasn't going to speak during the debate, Reyes
says, but "all these memories came back." Memories of picking grapes
at age 10 with her parents and six siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "What I remember the most," she told lawmakers, "were those early
morning hours that we got up at 3 a.m. dressed like it was the Arctic
North. We went out into the field, I looked down that long row and
was told, 'Get picking.'</TE>
<TE>   "As you went down the row, you took off the jacket because it got
a little warmer, you took off the sweater ... you put on a bandanna
because you want to block your head from the sun ...</TE>
<TE>   "All you did was pick and look down the row, wondering if there
was ever going to be an end to the row. And when you get to the end
of the row, they go, 'There's another row.' ...</TE>
<TE>   "This is an easy vote. When I decide how to vote on this, I
remember when I was 10 years old."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Simon Salinas (D-Salinas), 46, told of coming to
California from Mexico with his migrant worker parents, who raised 12
children. "It's very offensive to me when people use the word
'illegal alien,' " he said. "Come with me to Salinas, and I will show
you those hard-working 'illegal aliens.' "</TE>
<TE>   The only Republican to vote for the bill was Assemblyman Robert
Pacheco, 68, of Walnut, who recalled a childhood picking cotton and
onions with his dad. "The bottom line," he said, "is this: As a farm
worker remembering my past, my roots, where I come from, I cannot
abandon that."</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the Assembly 49-27 and the Senate 25-12. The next
night, the Legislature sent Davis yet another bill (AB 2596) placing
a five-year "sunset" on the mediation measure and capping the number
of mediations at 75. Davis had proposed a three-year "sunset" with 35
mediations.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' advisors are sharply divided over whether he should sign
the legislation. Some say it's too rushed and he should delay a year
to strive for a worker-grower consensus; moreover, he shouldn't allow
the bellicose Burton to shove him around. Others argue the proposal
is close enough to his liking and growers never will be satisfied;
besides, he belongs with the union.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't sign the bill, he puts many of us who have been his
staunchest supporters in a very precarious position," says Democratic
state chairman Art Torres, an ex-lawmaker who helped push the
original ALRB bill. "If he's going to get people excited about the
election, he has to give them a reason to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes would tell Davis this isn't about some abstract notion of
centrism. This is about real field hands trudging down row after row
as the grower stomps on their collective bargaining rights.</TE>

<HD>Shelter for Mentally Ill Operates With Few Rules, Little
Oversight</HD>
<DH>Housing: Inspectors find 'deplorable conditions' at Echo
Park facility known as Dad's House. Owner says he provides a
last-chance refuge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They may be cluttered and less than pristine, but Darryl Cannady
considers his two boardinghouses in Echo Park a last-chance refuge
for mentally ill patients who would otherwise be on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County mental health officials have described the
conditions in court documents as "horrible and illegal," citing
filthy mattresses and bathrooms, overcrowding and medications stored
"randomly" in the open. They liken Cannady's two houses to one in the
San Gabriel Valley that aroused concern because five of its residents
died this year.</LD>
<LD>   But no one has died at Cannady's houses--both known as Dad's
House--and they remain open, providing sorely needed shelter to
vulnerable occupants.</LD>
<TE>   The problem, county and state officials say, is that such
facilities exist in a regulatory netherworld, subject to few rules
and little oversight. That can lead to abuses that are difficult to
detect unless there is a complaint, and by then, it may be too late.</TE>
<TE>   Facilities that provide care and supervision to residents are
required to be licensed by the state, but many unlicensed
boardinghouses provide these services illegally--including disbursing
Social Security checks and coordinating medical care. No one knows
the precise number or locations of such unlicensed facilities in Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Social Services cited Dad's in May
for providing illegal care and later fined the operator $4,000. But
the houses remain in operation while Cannady's attorney contests the
fine.</TE>
<TE>   Cannady argues that he operates the equivalent of an apartment
building, which does not require licensure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tricky deal," said John Gordon, a spokesman for the state
Department of Social Services. "When we find someone that's
unlicensed, we don't have a lot of jurisdiction.... We don't have the
authority to shut them down."</TE>
<TE>   In essence, Gordon said, authorities depend on operators to be
honest about the type of services they provide and to seek a license
if one is required. His agency also depends on mental health
officials to monitor where psychiatric hospitals refer their patients
upon discharge.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really focused on the facilities that we do license and
making sure that they fall within the regulations," he said.
"However, when we have these [unlicensed] situations, we try to get
them resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Deaths at One Facility</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have struggled with how to handle unlicensed
board-and-care facilities for years, but the debate gained urgency
after five residents of one San Gabriel house died this year.</TE>
<TE>   The most severe penalty to arise from the deaths, however,
targeted not the San Gabriel house, but two of the psychiatric
hospitals that referred patients there. The county Department of
Mental Health stripped the hospitals of the authority to detain
mentally ill patients against their will.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the county also cited the hospitals' referrals to
Dad's as justification for its action.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Community Hospital of Van Nuys, where Cannady works as a
chef, and City of Angels Medical Center-Ingleside have sued to have
the sanctions overturned. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David
Yaffe upheld the sanctions Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, county and state authorities try to keep an eye on
Dad's.</TE>
<TE>   During an April visit to one of the houses, on Clinton Street,
inspectors found an open container of malt liquor on the kitchen
table. Dad's has billed itself as a sober-living house, but Cannady
now says it is for "independent living."</TE>
<TE>   On a return trip in June, inspectors described "deplorable
conditions": clothing and medications strewn all over the floors;
furniture broken and torn; tarps covering the windows, and numerous
holes in the wall, according to a court affidavit filed by Barbara
Leifer, a patients rights advocate with the county Department of
Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be a better system," Leifer said in an interview.
"There needs to be a system where people do get in trouble--there are
punishments, there are repercussions."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators can--and have--removed seriously ill patients from
unlicensed facilities and placed them in houses licensed to give them
the care and supervision that they need.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes patients return to the unlicensed boardinghouses,
and regulators are nearly powerless to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   It's all the harder to intervene because conditions can change
dramatically from day to day, as can the health of residents,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 30, for instance, Cannady invited a reporter to visit his
two houses. The furniture and carpets were soiled, and a broken-down
car and appliances sat in the front yard.</TE>
<TE>   But no medications were strewn on the floor, and no liquor was on
the table. Mental health officials, who showed up during the
reporter's visit, confirmed that conditions appeared better than
inspectors described in April and June.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a great place to live, but that's where the clients want
to live, and they have a right to live there," Leifer said. "As of
today, at least what they showed us, it's probably a legally run
facility."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's because they're on notice now," added Leifer's boss,
Carole Mathews. "They know people are going out there" to inspect.</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday, Leifer and Mathews returned to Dad's for an
unannounced visit and found the place dirtier. Clothes were on the
floor, and dirty pots were on the stove, they said. But they said
they did not find any residents needing care or supervision.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, on a return visit, county and state officials were not
allowed on the premises, Mathews said. Instead, residents were
allowed to come outside the front gate to talk to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we have the authority to say, 'We're the Department
of Social Services, let us in,' " Gordon said. "It's just another
obstacle that we have to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Cannady calls the visits "constant harassment." He said his
residents are seeking legal aid to pursue redress.</TE>
<TE>   Helping Former Addicts</TE>
<TE>   Cannady said he became interested in helping mentally ill patients
a few years ago when a colleague told him about the squalid
conditions at "sober-living" facilities that housed recovering
addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked around and talked to different people and decided we'll
take the people that nobody else wants to take and give them
dignity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cannady maintains that his houses provide an independent living
environment, whose rules are created by residents, not him. He said
state laws don't permit him to enter residents' bedrooms to see
whether they are clean.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he makes little to no money from the houses, despite
charging $475 per month for rent and one meal a day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no money being made," he said. "I am so broke.... I owe
everybody just making sure these guys have a place to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, he plans to close the house on Clinton Street and move
residents to another facility nearby if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Ten residents from both Dad's houses told a reporter they had been
in and out of psychiatric hospitals, and some had been homeless
before coming to live at Dad's. They say Cannady is helping them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was tired of living on the street, so I came here, and I like
living here," said Fred McQuiston, 55, who says he is a paranoid
schizophrenic who also suffers from bipolar disorder. "I've got no
bits about living here. Everything's hunky with me."</TE>
<TE>   McQuiston said that a doctor comes once in a while to check in on
residents, and Cannady helps him with his budget. But he said he
remembers to take his medications on his own, and doesn't need help
to get by.</TE>
<TE>   The California Assn. of Addiction Recovery Resources, which
represents sober-living homes, said some unlicensed places pose a
credibility problem for the industry as a whole. The group offers a
voluntary registration process, in which facilities agree to be
inspected by the association.</TE>
<TE>   "The true sober-living home is a landlord-tenant agreement where a
person is renting a room or renting space with the assumption that
there will be no alcohol or drugs," said Susan Blacksher, the group's
executive director. "Our picture of a sober-living is the nicest home
on the street, and it's clean and respectable."</TE>
<TE>   Legislative Efforts</TE>
<TE>   State Assembly member Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) introduced a bill
this year to require adult recovery (also known as sober-living)
facilities to obtain licenses from the state. She said courts and
hospitals are currently referring patients to facilities that they
know little about.</TE>
<TE>   Her bill died in the Legislature, primarily because the state
lacked money to implement the system she proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard that there were unscrupulous operators out there and no
oversight," Chu said. "We want the courts and hospitals to refer them
to homes that they know are in good operation and are legitimate."</TE>

<HD>Top Ornithology Program Coming Out of Its Shell</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hornbills are stiff as battle-axes, the ostriches sit folded like
bath towels, and the shimmering green quetzals lie resplendent in
drawers reeking of mothballs.</LD>
<LD>   Tray after tray, row after row, the birds and their eggs stretch
across the 22,000 square feet of this featureless warehouse on the
dusty outskirts of Camarillo, home of the Western Foundation of
Vertebrate Zoology, one of the largest and perhaps least-known
ornithology collections in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Penguins, condors, kiwis, birds of paradise and even extinct
species such as the heath hen and Carolina parakeet peer up from
drawers or look down from the ceiling.</LD>
<TE>   Eggs--more than a million of them--are everywhere. Only the
British Museum of Natural History has as many.</TE>
<TE>   "From the egg point of view, it's the best there is," said Joseph
Forshaw, an ornithologist and renowned parrot expert who flew in from
Australia last week just to examine the foundation's collection of
trogons--a lesser-known relative of the quetzal--for an upcoming
book.</TE>
<TE>   "In most of my work, the specimens come from this collection,"
Forshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a million eggs, 53,000 skins and 8,000 books, the
foundation houses 18,000 nests--the largest such collection in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Started in 1956 by a handful of adventurous, occasionally
swashbuckling egg collectors, the foundation has always kept a low
profile, opening itself primarily to scientists.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it has participated in more than 3,000 research projects.</TE>
<TE>   Its collections helped prove that DDT caused thinning of brown
pelican, peregrine falcon and bald eagle eggshells. That led to $140
million in legal settlements against companies that for years dumped
pesticides off the coast of Los Angeles, and foundation scientists
also testified in a landmark court battle that led to the banning of
DDT in the U.S. in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most anyone who has done museum-based study on birds has
used the collections or wished they had," said Kimball Garrett,
foundation board member and ornithology collections manager for the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. "The egg collection is
really the only game in town."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hatching Higher Profile</TE>
<TE>   While most of its work has been out of the public eye, the
foundation's new director, Linnea Hall, hopes to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, a former professor of ornithology and a wildlife biologist,
wants to increase fund-raising, create partnerships with academic
institutions, boost outreach to schools and offer occasional tours to
the public.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is still primarily for hard-core researchers," she
said. "But we are raising our profile, slowly."</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit foundation survives largely on donations. It has
just five full-time employees to catalog eggs, prepare skins and
mount expeditions around the globe. Money is tight.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, collections manager Rene Corado opened a refrigerator,
to reveal dozens of frozen hawks, crows and pheasants.</TE>
<TE>   "We are running out of room," said Corado, who skins the birds,
packs them with cotton and labels them.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is actually a collection of collections.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Kiff, the first director of the foundation, set off on an
11,000-mile car journey in 1970 to persuade major collectors to
donate their eggs. Of the 20 he visited, all but one agreed. The
foundation now has 400 egg collections.</TE>
<TE>   "They had no other destination because public sentiment had turned
against egg-collecting," said Kiff, now science director with the
Peregrine Fund in Boise, Idaho. "A lot of people in the U.S. who went
on to be prominent ornithologists started as egg collectors. The
founder of the Audubon Society was an egg collector."</TE>
<TE>   The man behind the Western Foundation, Ed Harrison, was a
collector extraordinaire. The Los Angeles millionaire made his money
in real estate and oil, but his true passion was amassing
things--relics, minerals, animal skins, nests, a shrunken head and
especially eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "He collected everything he could get his hands on," said Glenn
Hiatt, 89, a longtime friend and foundation board member. "But from
the time he was young he loved everything about birds."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, now 88 and in declining health, was unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Egg-collecting was a fashionable hobby from the mid-19th century
to the 1940s. People bought and traded eggs like baseball cards.
Magazines catered to collectors, and oology, or the study of eggs,
was popular.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were unbelievable. They had a sixth sense on where to
find bird nests," said John Borneman, a former condor warden in Los
Padres National Forest charged with keeping out egg collectors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changing Attitudes</TE>
<TE>   He said one Fillmore collector would lower his 5-year-old daughter
over a cliff with a basket to snatch eagle eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Others would literally swing from trees using belts to grab eggs
and hold them in their mouths until they got back to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Collectors were usually amateurs, not scientists, and when laws
were passed banning the practice for conservation reasons, they found
themselves with thousands of eggs and a public hostile to their
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   With his own vast collection and several others, Harrison started
the foundation as a conservation resource and a way to keep
collecting legally. The specimens were housed behind his Brentwood
home and in the basement of his 20-story Westwood office building.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison considered moving them to the UCLA campus, Descanso
Gardens, the L.A. County Museum of Art or the Santa Barbara Museum of
Natural History. None of these worked out, and in 1992 the eggs,
skins and nests landed in a cavernous warehouse in a light-industrial
park in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Corado helped move the eggs by truck, making two trips a day
from Los Angeles to Camarillo for seven months.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved a million eggs and never broke a single one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The eggs come in every conceivable color and size. There are
lime-green cassowary eggs, ebony emu eggs, tan elephant bird eggs and
tiny white hummingbird eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Corado makes small holes in the top and bottom of the eggs and
blows out the yolks. Each item is categorized and the circumstances
of its arrival recorded.</TE>
<TE>   A tag on a red-naped trogon from Borneo says "shot in lower canopy
25 feet from ground." Tags list the bird's habitat and sometimes its
stomach contents. An owl once arrived with a wren in its stomach.
Corado skinned and mounted both.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Natural Attraction</TE>
<TE>   Aside from scientists, illustrators for nature guides visit to
sketch the birds. A Japanese author of children's books came from
Tokyo to draw a rare nest. Students and professors from Europe come
to touch and measure birds unavailable to them at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it when people come in here and you see their eyes widen
as they look around," Corado said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, hired last month as director, is still getting used to the
menagerie.</TE>
<TE>   "I first saw this collection in 1990 and I was blown away by it,"
she said. "It was so well-organized and accessible. All this data
helped keep the peregrine falcon, brown pelican and bald eagles
alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the foundation, they probably wouldn't be here."</TE>

<HD>Jurors Ask to Hear Killer in His Own Words</HD>
<DH>Murder: Taped police interview of Westerfield, convicted in
the death of Danielle van Dam, will be played in full in the penalty
phase of his trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Jurors in the penalty phase of the David Westerfield trial will begin
their third day of deliberations today by hearing the voice of
someone who did not testify: Westerfield himself.</LD>
<LD>   Before adjourning Friday for the weekend, jurors sent a note to
Superior Court Judge William Mudd asking to hear the entire 40-minute
taped interview between Westerfield and a police interrogation
specialist on Feb. 5, three days after 7-year-old Danielle van Dam
disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   While the guilt phase of the trial dealt largely with matters of
science--with testimony about DNA, autopsies, fingerprints and fiber
analysis--the penalty phase may hinge on what jurors think about
Westerfield's character.</LD>
<TE>   One of the imponderables is what impact Westerfield's polite and
unthreatening demeanor during the trial will have on jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Slump-shouldered and given to mild trembling, Westerfield sat
impassively during most of the trial, remaining attentive but showing
little emotion.</TE>
<TE>   He wept when his sister, son and daughter told jurors of their
love for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how much good it will do him, but the best thing
Westerfield has going for him is that he looks so pitiful, that he
doesn't 'look' like a killer," said former prosecutor Colin Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Nimmo, a longtime defense attorney, said jurors cannot help
but be influenced by having watched Westerfield at the defense table
for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Only two groups of people are ever asked to make a conscious
decision to kill people: soldiers in war and jurors in a
death-penalty case," Nimmo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference," he said, "is that jurors get to know the person
they're asked to kill."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have sought to contradict Westerfield's
sympathy-invoking image by introducing evidence that he lied about
Danielle's disappearance and that he may have made an illicit
physical advance 12 years earlier on a young niece.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which convicted Westerfield of kidnapping and killing
Danielle, must now recommend whether he should be executed or sent to
prison without the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the police interview, jurors also want to review the
tape of a brief interview Westerfield gave to TV reporters after he
returned home from a two-day meandering trip to the beach and desert
while other neighbors were frantically searching for Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield laughed nervously and asked if his thinning hair would
look good on television, but never expressed any concern over the
disappearance of a neighbor child--a fact that Deputy Dist. Atty.
Jeff Dusek stressed as he asked jurors to recommend that the
50-year-old design engineer be given "what he deserves, not what he
wants."</TE>
<TE>   Dusek said the TV interview shows Westerfield's innate cruelty and
arrogance, and contradicts the testimony of numerous defense
witnesses who said Westerfield was a generous and helpful friend and
co-worker.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek portrayed Westerfield as a cunning killer who harbored
sexual desires for young children and who tried to destroy evidence
by cleaning his recreational vehicle and home, and then lied
repeatedly to police.</TE>
<TE>   During the police interview, Westerfield said he did not remember
Danielle van Dam, whose family lived two doors away from his home in
the upscale Sabre Springs subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   "If you brought her in right now, I would not be able to tell her
from 10 other kids," Westerfield told police interrogation specialist
Paul Redden.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors on Thursday asked to examine testimony during the penalty
phase from a former niece who said that Westerfield had come into her
bedroom when she was seven years old, stuck his finger in her mouth,
and massaged her teeth. She testified that he stopped only after she
bit his finger.</TE>

<LD>Sunday was no day of rest for the detectives of the LAPD's North
Hollywood Division, who have been handed a heavy caseload in the last
12 days: five homicides.</LD>
<LD>   At the station, investigators waited for officers to haul in the
only arrest among the cases, a gang member suspected of shooting
another alleged gangster at a party early Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   On the streets, one pair of detectives cruised a park near the
apartment of a 35-year-old man, looking for information about who
stuffed his dead body into a closet. Two more detectives chased down
leads on a mysterious double homicide on Labor Day in which two men
turned up dead in a burning SUV.</LD>
<TE>   The homicide unit's supervising detective, Mike Coffey, sat at his
desk while a pregnant widow described to a sketch artist the man she
thinks shot her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Coffey said his three investigators, plus two from North
Hollywood's gang unit, were "running into each other. This is very
unusual."</TE>
<TE>   From the first of this year through the end of August, the Los
Angeles Police Department recorded 446 homicides, a 23.5% increase
over the same period last year. Fourteen of those killings took place
in the North Hollywood Division, plus four since the tally.</TE>
<TE>   Talking Sunday about the most recent of the slayings in his
division, Coffey, a veteran detective, stumbled over his facts. "I'm
kind of tired," he said by way of apology.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a small group of friends was apparently celebrating
the 31st birthday Saturday night of Raul Gonzales at an apartment in
the 11400 block of Albers Street.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 a.m. Sunday, several men showed up uninvited. Gonzales
argued with them on the porch and pushed one against a wall. That
man, believed to be 19-year-old Jose Arevalos, pulled a handgun from
his waistband and fired at least two shots into Gonzales' chest,
Coffey said. Less than an hour later, Gonzales was pronounced dead at
a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Arevalos was arrested Sunday at his home in East Los Angeles. He
belongs to a gang, Coffey said; Gonzales allegedly belonged to a
different gang.</TE>
<TE>   The streak of North Hollywood homicides began Aug. 29 when
neighbors at a North Hollywood apartment building noticed a foul odor
and summoned police. Officers found the decomposing body of Kenneth
Kitching, bound and stuffed into his bathroom closet.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe Kitching, 35, was familiar with his killer
and may have met the person in a nearby park.</TE>
<TE>   The second and third homicides happened early Labor Day morning on
a quiet street in Studio City. When firefighters rolled up to a
burning Mercedes-Benz SUV, they found inside the bodies of
Christopher Monson, 31, of Culver City, and Michael Tardio, 35, of
Los Angeles. The friends--both motorcycle buffs--had been shot
multiple times in their torsos. Investigators believe whoever killed
the men set the fire to cover up the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Tardio was a bouncer at the popular Garden of Eden nightclub in
Hollywood and comes from a well-to-do family in New York. Coffey
wonders why Tardio rented the black sport utility vehicle days before
the slayings, since he had his own car. "If we could find the answer
to that, we might find the motive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, after three homicide-free days in the North
Hollywood Division, someone shot Artak Jragatsbanian in the head.
Jragatsbanian, 26, had been living in a halfway house as part of his
sentence for medical fraud, Coffey said. He was supposed to be at
work, as the program allowed, but instead was visiting his wife at
their home on Colfax Avenue. She is three months pregnant, Coffey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Around 9 a.m., a man came by to talk to Jragatsbanian, whose wife
went out to get them food. When she returned 10 minutes later, she
told police, her husband was dead. Coffey thinks the motive may have
been extortion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detectives ask anyone with information about these homicides to
call LAPD's North Hollywood Division at (818) 623-4045. On weekends
and during off-hours, call the Detective Information Desk, (877)
LAWFULL.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11's Rubble at Nixon Library</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Thousands are drawn to an exhibit of World Trade
Center beams, FDNY firetruck and items from the other two plane
crashes.</DH>

<LD>More than 2,000 people visited the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace
in Yorba Linda on Sunday to view twisted beams from New York's World
Trade Center, a seared firetruck and other exhibits commemorating the
events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "People have come all day and night to see this," said Sandy
Quinn, the library's assistant director.</LD>
<LD>   The library conducted a memorial concert Sunday to honor those who
died in the terrorist attacks, and on Saturday 16 tons of steel from
the twin office towers and a New York City firetruck used on Sept. 11
were brought to the former president's birthplace.</LD>
<TE>   Visitors viewed the exhibits in somber silence, and wrote down
their thoughts in commemorative books provided by the library.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had anything like this, obviously. Seeing this gives
you a chill. It makes you mad," said Jon Zeiger of San Juan
Capistrano. "I didn't think a chunk of metal would make me feel that
way. But it does."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Marcosa, who works as a spokeswoman for the Costa Mesa
Fire Department, came with her husband, Joe. "We wanted some
closure.... We wanted to get some photos, something to remember 9/11
by," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really amazing. It's also really sad."</TE>
<TE>   The truck, beams, a piece of the facade from the Pentagon and a
flag from the Shanksville, Pa., crash site were brought to the
library by the San Bernardino-based Freedom Flame Sept. 11 Memorial
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, which has traveled through several cities, will be at
the Nixon library until Sept. 29. The metal will be used to make a
permanent memorial in Rancho Cucamonga, said Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the University of Southern California USC Trojan
Marching Band offered a patriotic concert.</TE>
<TE>   The library will conduct other events this week:</TE>
<TE>   Harry Waizer, who was badly injured at the World Trade Center, and
Commander Bradley D. Voigt, a U.S. Navy SEAL who directed forces in
Afghanistan, will speak Tuesday at 2 p.m. The public may light
candles to float in the library's reflecting pool from 3 p.m. Tuesday
until noon Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the library will conduct ceremonies at 5:45 a.m.,
when American Flight 11 struck the north tower of the World Trade
Center; at 6:03, a.m., when United Flight 175 struck the south tower;
at 6:40 a.m., when American Flight 177 struck the Pentagon; and at 7
a.m., when UnitedFlight 93 crashed near Shanksville, Pa.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Rites Strike Tones Both Patriotic, Somber</HD>
<DH>Memorial: A service at the Crystal Cathedral features music

fears of 'Islamophobes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before thousands at the Crystal Cathedral, the Sunday services
commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
included a black-tie orchestra, one of the world's largest pipe
organs, a specially commissioned video and, as the grand finale, the
unfurling of a 90-foot American flag that rose to the rafters as the
congregation sang "America the Beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   Six miles across Garden Grove, at the Islamic Society of Orange
County mosque, about 250 people from various faiths gathered in a
spartan meeting hall with no air-conditioning, the overhead fans on
high because of the heat.</LD>
<LD>   The Day of Unity and Prayer meeting, organized by the county's
Islamic leaders, didn't rely on high-tech assistance but on voices
including Arefa Simjee's.</LD>
<TE>   The Muslim woman who lives in Westminster told the story of how
her husband's cousin died on Sept. 11 while working on the 92nd floor
of one of the World Trade Center towers.</TE>
<TE>   Simjee told the audience that her family prays for "peace,
justice, love and understanding."</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts. It hurts a lot," she said in an interview afterward
about the backlash felt by U.S. Muslims after Sept. 11. In addition
to mourning the loss of a relative, "we were also very scared."</TE>
<TE>   The two Garden Grove ceremonies were among the first of hundreds
that will be held in places of worship and in public places across
Southern California in the next few days to mark the Sept. 11
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The largest inter-religious gathering in Orange County will be A
Prayer Service for Peace at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at St. Columban
Church in Garden Grove. Jewish, Islamic and Buddhist leaders will
join bishops and other local heads of major Christian denominations
for an interfaith service.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's event at the mosque also attracted many local faith
leaders, in addition to politicians, police officers, firefighters,
scholars and journalists, who were honored for defending the Muslim
community in the days and weeks after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim leaders said they mourned their fellow Americans killed or
injured in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they also had to deal with "Islamophobes" who
equated Muslims with terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We thank God for the fair-minded, caring and compassionate
people," said Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Southern
California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, religious director of the Islamic Society of
Orange County, said the attacks were "a major crime against our
religion. We consider [the terrorists] enemies of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   At the Crystal Cathedral, the services had the tone of a somber
Independence Day. American flags lined the grounds. Some churchgoers
discarded their Sunday best for outfits normally reserved for the
Fourth of July: red, white and blue shirts, dresses, pins and purses.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the organist played "Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "God
Bless America" while people were seated.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Robert A. Schuller warned the congregation, "I hope you
brought Kleenex, because you'll need it." In his sermon, against the
backdrop of American flags, he said God has the power to "heal our
nation, protect our nation and prosper our nation."</TE>
<TE>   He said the thousands of prayers said since Sept. 11 will help
America.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we're going to see a new power in our nation like we've
never seen before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronela Vidican, a 33-year-old immigrant who moved to Santa Ana
from Romania three years ago, frequently wiped away tears as she sang
along.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking how much I love America," she said. "I still can't
believe [the terrorist attacks] could happen here."</TE>
<TE>   For Fran Wilson, who has beenworshiping at Schuller's church for
40 years, the upbeat, patriotic tone of the service was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be all gloom and doom," said the
81-year-old Anaheim resident. "But our country is great, and we're
going to lick this."</TE>

<HD>91 Toll Lane Sale May Cut Commute Fees</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Officials to act as fast as possible on
charges and will begin improvements to Riverside Freeway. Davis must
yet approve deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once it buys the 91 Express Lanes, the Orange County Transportation
Authority wants to phase out the controversial toll road as quickly
as possible and launch a massive package of long-awaited improvements
to relieve severe rush-hour congestion on the Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Although it could be years before the lanes are opened to
nonpaying customers, OCTA might lower tolls in the meantime and will
immediately lift troublesome restrictions that have blocked widening
one of the most bottlenecked highways in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to reduce tolls, shorten the term of those tolls, and
improve mobility," said Arthur T. Leahy, OCTA's chief executive
officer. "This will be a toll road elimination program."</LD>
<TE>   Before the authority can act, Gov. Gray Davis must approve
legislation that grants OCTA the power to get into the turnpike
business. Assembly Bill 1010, which passed overwhelmingly in both
houses last month, is expected to reach the governor's desk in
mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the measure is vetoed, OCTA and the private company that
owns the 91 Express Lanes can close a deal they agreed to in April,
addressing one of the region's most nagging transportation
controversies.</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes run for 10 miles down the median of the
Riverside Freeway from northern Anaheim to the Riverside County line.
They opened in December 1995 with two lanes in each direction. During
rush hours, they cost $4.75 each way, one of the steepest tolls in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   To help the tollway succeed, Caltrans gave its owner, the
California Private Transportation Co., the extraordinary power to
veto improvements to portions of the Riverside Freeway through 2030.
The non-compete agreement covers 30 miles of the freeway, including
the toll lanes and 10 miles on each side.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the restrictions have aggravated congestion on the
Riverside Freeway, the only one between the fast-growing Inland
Empire and Orange County's job market. On workdays, motorists make at
least 250,000 trips on the Riverside Freeway, most during the morning
and evening crush. The number of daily trips is projected to swell to
400,000 by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the private toll lanes also increased tensions
between politicians and government officials on either side of the
Orange County line who disagreed on ways to fix the Riverside
Freeway's congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County officials originally supported the Express Lanes as
a way to relieve congestion. Riverside officials opposed the tollway
and eventually sued Caltrans to nullify the non-compete agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "While many people use the private toll road operation, they don't
realize the restrictions it places on future improvements," said John
F. Tavaglione, a Riverside County supervisor who chairs the
transportation commission. "Hopefully in time, we will be able to
relieve the bottlenecks and help both counties."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of AB 1010, Riverside County must drop its lawsuit
against Caltrans. In the long term, the county has earmarked almost
$500 million for lane additions and interchange improvements to the
Riverside Freeway and nearby sections of Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Those plans are part of a broad proposal to make $1.6 billion in
improvements to the Riverside Freeway corridor in Orange and
Riverside counties over three decades. They range from simple lane
restriping and choke-point projects to major widenings and
interchanges from the 15 to the Orange-Los Angeles County line.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made unprecedented progress in having the opportunity to
improve mobility in Riverside and Orange counties," said Orange
County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who chairs the OCTA board. "This will
pave the way for major work on the 91."</TE>
<TE>   To help clear the way for those improvements, OCTA agreed to buy
the Express Lanes for $207.5 million. The authority will assume the
turnpike's debt of $135 million and pay the company $72.5 million in
cash. If all goes well, officials say escrow will close Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   If AB 1010 clears the governor's office, OCTA plans a traffic and
revenue study for the tollway and will assemble two advisory
committees--one from OCTA and a second of officials from Caltrans and
the counties of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said OCTA already is negotiating with Cofiroute, a French
toll road company, to handle day-to-day operations once the authority
acquires the lanes. Cofiroute is now a partner in California Private
Transportation. OCTA also plans to hire a tollway manager until it is
phased out.</TE>
<TE>   More critically, Leahy said, he wants California Private
Transportation to consider dropping some provisions of the
non-compete agreement immediately so Caltrans can begin planning
improvements to the Riverside Freeway well before the deal closes in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said much of the groundwork for a change in ownership,
setting tolls and road improvements might be completed as early as
November.</TE>
<TE>   The authority plans to continue tollway operations until the
road's debts have been paid. OCTA is considering ways to retire the
debt early, including a refinancing. Toll revenue, Leahy said,
appears to be healthy and running about $2 million ahead of
projections for this year, but OCTA officials do not know when they
will be able to cease toll operations.</TE>
<TE>   There has been some discussion among a few supervisors from Orange
and Riverside counties that Riverside County might become a financial
partner in the tollway and provide funds to help retire the debt
early. But Tavaglione described the talks as preliminary.</TE>
<TE>   If OCTA takes ownership of the 91 Express Lanes, elected officials
expect the purchase to end years of political rancor and a long
impasse in regional transportation planning between Orange County and
the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   AB 1010 establishes an advisory committee for the Riverside
Freeway corridor that includes five members from Orange County, five
from Riverside County, two Caltrans directors, and one San Bernardino
County representative.</TE>
<TE>   Up for consideration is a new transportation link between
Riverside and Orange counties. Riverside has looked at four possible
highway routes through the Cleveland National Forest. The other ideas
include a tunnel under the forest and a proposal by the Irvine Co. to
build a freeway that parallels the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA polls indicate that most Orange County residents want all
options for the Riverside Freeway addressed before a route through
the national forest is considered. Some Orange County cities also
have opposed a new corridor.</TE>

<HD>Also-Ran in Diddlys: Does It Get Any Worse?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice in a row is good enough to make a tradition, and Mother Jones
magazine, published in San Francisco, has awarded, for the second
time, its Diddly Awards, for a "rubber-stamp Congress, whose members
have found plenty of time to do squat."</LD>
<LD>   Runner-up in the Celebrity-Mongering award, Escondido Republican
Rep. Duke Cunningham, who summoned (but evidently did not subpoena)
the Sesame Street character Elmo to testify on the importance of
music education. It was left to Elmo, who testified in suit and tie,
to declare, in third-person hauteur, "Elmo is not making a mockery of
this place."</LD>
<LD>   Two California congressmen rated runner-up status for the Common
Touch award: San Mateo Democrat Tom Lantos, who drove over a
13-year-old boy's foot just outside the Capitol in 2001 and left the
scene; and Vista Republican Darrell Issa, the car-alarm magnate whose
own voice of warning is heard on his car alarms. Issa, says Mother
Jones, was stopped by the Border Patrol for speeding at 90 mph
through a 65-mph zone in San Clemente, and told the officer, "It's
not your job to stop me for speeding."</LD>
<TE>   And the winner of the Sex in Congress award--Bakersfield
Republican Bill Thomas, who heads the House's health care
strategizing and who was reported to have had an affair with a
health-care lobbyist. Thomas, the magazine says, "breathes new life
into the phrase 'in bed with industry.' "</TE>
<TE>   A Gay Old Time for Simon Sub Riordan</TE>
<TE>   With Bill Simon Jr. severely disinvited to last week's Republican
Unity Coalition event in L.A. for Mary Cheney, the lesbian daughter
of Vice President Dick Cheney, just who was that Republican
millionaire gubernatorial candidate who showed up at the Hancock Park
reception?</TE>
<TE>   It was Richard Riordan, who came in second to Simon in the
primary, losing GOP support during that campaign in part because he
championed issues important to gays. Last week's Field Poll, which
showed Simon trailing Gov. Gray Davis, hypothetically matched the
more moderate Riordan against Davis and found that the former L.A.
mayor would beat Davis if the matchup were held today.</TE>
<TE>   Can California Afford Seven More Governors?</TE>
<TE>   Joel Fox is, to use the political shorthand, a political and
governmental consultant, the ex-president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn., and something of a nut on political history.</TE>
<TE>   Before he ran off to join the circus--which is to say he's now an
analyst and advisor to the San Fernando Valley secession effort--he
was looking up the law of succession in California. He found that, in
case of a war disaster, government code 12060-63--instituted under
Gov. Pat Brown in 1959, when the Bomb hung over Americans' lives like
fog over the Bay Bridge--requires California to have shadow governors
waiting in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   The elected governor is supposed to name as many as seven, in
different parts of the state, in the event all designated state
officials in the line of succession--from the governor through,
presumably, the insurance commissioner--get killed off.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Fox suggests that Gray Davis doesn't know about this law, or
he would have "used these appointments as the ultimate big bonanza
fund-raiser" to name a fat cat as governor-in-waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Nominees, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Left High and Dry on Libertarian Front</TE>
<TE>   More than a year ago, Steve Kubby, the medical marijuana advocate
Libertarian who ran for governor of California in 1998, took it on
the lam to British Columbia to avoid spending four months in a
California jail on drug possession charges.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's been granted the right to grow and smoke large amounts of
dope in Canada for medical purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Kubby, who says he smokes weed to control symptoms of
adrenal-gland cancer, can now grow up to 59 plants at a time, store
up to 2,655 grams of the stuff, nearly 6 pounds, and travel with 360
grams of it. He says he'll be "cleaning out our garage to start
growing."</TE>
<TE>   But first there's that little matter of Canadian criminal charges
related to 160 plants found in his home in April, and a U.S. request
that he be deported from Canada back south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Gary Copeland, California's current Libertarian
gubernatorial candidate, hasn't been getting much in the way of "free
media," which is how politicians characterize press coverage, so he's
told Fourth Estaters: Name a charity, go ahead, any charity, and
he'll donate $100 in the reporter's name.</TE>
<TE>   No strings, but no takers, either. "They think it's a trap," says
Copeland. "For me, it's fun. I'm going to donate the money anyway.
I'm not going to get press from these people, so I might as well do
something worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Copeland's counting on his ballot statement to do what the press
hasn't: On it he lists his heroes, economist Milton Friedman,
philosopher Herbert Spencer and "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry.
Watch for a huge Trekkie turnout.</TE>
<TE>   A Captive Audience Even Out of Prison</TE>
<TE>   You'd have thought he was one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Wait--now he is, almost.</TE>
<TE>   Don Novey, recently retired as president of the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn.--the prison guards union--has just
been named by Senate leader John Burton to a $114,000-a-year job on
the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly, not to be outdone, even as it strove to pass a
budget, took a chunk of time to laud Novey to the heavens a couple of
Saturdays ago. The doors opened, the call went out, "Mr. Speaker,"
and the resolution honoring Novey, sponsored by Cerritos Democrat
Sally Havice, was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The place went churchly quiet. Novey, with his signature fedora,
walked in. Most Assembly members gathered about him, going on for
more than 20 minutes about his wonderfulness. Novey made a few
remarks about some legislators, talked about how his family came to
California in the 19th century, and fought in every one of the
nation's wars, and accepted his framed resolution.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, the CCPOA gave Gray Davis' campaign another
$253,000, bringing to $1.3 million the total of its contributions to
Davis since he's been in office (on top of the $2 million it gave to
help get him there).</TE>
<TE>   Don't Make Us Send Our People to Collect</TE>
<TE>   If they'd had to wait this long in Vegas for someone to pay up on
a bet, there'd be some broken legs.</TE>
<TE>   But L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn is not only waiting for the hot dogs bet
by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on the outcome of the
Sparks/Liberty WNBA championship--the Sparks won--but there's a
grocery cart full of other sports bets he's won that remain
uncollected.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of Charlotte, N.C., still owes honey from a bet when the
Sparks beat the Sting last year. The mayor of Sacramento still hasn't
ponied up the promised bottled water after the Lakers beat the Kings.
And the mayor of East Rutherford, N.J., is still holding out on the
Jersey tomatoes bet against Hahn's Valley strawberries from the
Lakers' defeat of the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone ever pay up on these wacky food bets? Or is it just
PR?</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Haim Saban is a big guy with a big house, but it wasn't big
enough for the ever-growing Bill Clinton-Tom Harkin fund-raiser last
week for the Democrats' Senate Victory Committee, so the event was
moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel. The next morning, Clinton had the
top billing at a fund-raising breakfast for Gray Davis at the estate
of grocery magnate Ron Burkle, where seats started at $2,500 per,
which is a lot of scrambled eggs.</TE>
<TE>   * In case you were worried about that special-label wine the new
Los Angeles cathedral sells in its gift shop, the church can even
ladle out vodka if it wishes to, because it holds--in partnership
with Patina Group, which operates a number of chic L.A.-area
restaurants--a full-range liquor license for the six-acre cathedral
and conference center. Drink up.</TE>
<TE>   * Oh sure, $1,000 got you in to the George Bush-Bill Simon Jr.
event in Dana Point recently, but on Sept. 20, a mere $10 will get
you in to a "light vegetarian repast and wine bar" fund-raiser at the
GEM Theater in Garden Grove for Peter Camejo, the Green Party
candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   * Must be an election year: Gov. Gray Davis showed up in El Monte
to praise labor groups and Caltrans for being two months ahead of
schedule on a new carpool lane on the San Bernardino Freeway--a lane
not scheduled to open until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Garden Grove Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez is front and center
in a 30-second Spanish-language ad for Gray Davis; "When it comes to
health care," she says, "Gray Davis has been our best friend."</TE>
<TE>   * It's not easy being ... right. The California chapter of the
Young Americans for Freedom, the GOP's youthful shock troops, is
looking for temporary help to coordinate YAF chapters on new
campuses. Requirements, says California chairman Chad Morgan, include
the ability to "work well with others"--presumably others of like
political mind.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want the press to get this."</TE>
<TE>   -- Bill Simon Jr.'s youngest son, Griffith, age 9, as he
frantically tried to mop his shirt front clean of the bright red
smears from his dripping cherry snow cone during a Labor Day
appearance at the Nixon Library with his family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking bids: Challenger Bill Simon Jr.'s campaign, playing off his
"pay-to-play" and "coin-operated-governor" gibes at Gov. Gray Davis'
fund-raising, has launched "EGray," a sendup of the Internet auction
site EBay, portraying Davis as seeking donations in exchange for
"favorable government action."</TE>

<HD>Clearing the Road for Pet Projects</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ballot initiative would divert 30% of auto sales
taxes to causes that include a golf cart path.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Casino operators, land developers, museum boosters and a major
private university, among others, have poured millions into a
November ballot initiative that would funnel tax dollars into their
favorite projects in the name of easing freeway congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 51 would take car sales taxes that normally help pay
for prisons, parks, health care and other government services and use
them to finance dozens of projects, including a rail line with stops
at an Indian casino, golf cart paths for a gated retirement
community, fuel-efficient boats for Lake Tahoe and a railroad museum
addition.</LD>
<LD>   The proposition, titled the Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe
School Buses Act, guarantees 30% of state motor vehicle sales taxes
would be set aside for road and transit projects and a smattering of
land conservation grants.</LD>
<TE>   In 2003-04, state analysts predict that would translate into $870
million. Of that amount, $228 million would be allocated as seed
money to dozens of earmarked projects, including $183 million for
Southern California. The remainder of the money would be divided
among state agencies, which in turn would divide the money among
California counties for transportation or conservation projects.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsor of the proposition is the Planning and Conservation
League, a Sacramento-based lobbying organization whose leaders say
they want to protect the environment. The measure, which would go
into effect Jan. 1, has split California's environmental community
and angered some legislators, who complain that it would force cuts
to other programs to pay for projects that have not gone through the
usual process for evaluating and selecting transportation proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing earmarks projects that cater to contributors'
interests. It will sacrifice kids and the poor so that people have a
nice ride from L.A. to a casino, for God's sake," said Sen. John
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), a 36-year veteran of the Legislature
and one of its leading experts on government finance.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsor of Proposition 51 acknowledged that many projects were
selected with an eye toward getting contributions that would pay for
the campaign to pass the initiative. So far, the Planning and
Conservation League has raised $2.47 million and hopes to take in
another $8 million by Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that we picked projects where we thought
people might contribute as a result," said Jerry Meral, the league's
executive director. "That was not to say that out of those more than
a hundred projects that was the only criteria. But after all, these
things are expensive and we wanted to get contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Projects that found their way into the initiative include:</TE>
<TE>   * A $120-million rail line starting in Los Angeles, stopping in
Palm Springs and ending in Indio near the Spa Resort Casino operated
by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, which gave $250,000 to
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   * A $2-million golf cart path along El Toro Road to Leisure World,
a gated retirement village in Orange County, and $12 million for
boats, fueling stations and docks for Lake Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   * A $75-million project to provide rail service to USC. The
university's $300,000 is the largest single contribution to date. USC
President Steven B. Sample decided to donate the money after the
Planning and Conservation League amended the proposition to guarantee
that the transit line would go underground as it entered Exposition
Park, a university spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   * A $7-million interchange expansion at California 126 and
Interstate 5 that would feed Newhall Land and Farming's proposed
21,000-home construction project along the Santa Clarita River. "It's
very important to our company," said Newhall spokeswoman Marlee
Lauffer. Newhall gave $150,000 to the initiative campaign.</TE>
<TE>   * A $7-million guarantee for a proposed Railroad Technology
Museum, with $1 million each year to staff and maintain it. The
nonprofit California State Railroad Museum Foundation contributed
$10,000 to Proposition 51.</TE>
<TE>   Those set-asides for special projects would decrease over time,
and the money would shift to either the California Transportation
Commission for road projects or any of several regional boards that
would be established by the measure to purchase and manage
undeveloped land.</TE>
<TE>   Meral, who was deputy of a department under former Gov. Jerry
Brown that managed water resources, views the initiative as a way to
send a message to the Legislature and the governor about urban
sprawl, traffic congestion and pollution. "The initiative process, in
my view at least, is reserved for the times when you've failed in the
Legislature," he said. "The legislative process as it has worked
until now has brought us an under-investment in infrastructure....
The fundamental reason we went to the initiative process was to
rebuild the state's infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to lawmakers, the legislative analyst's office
predicts elected officials will have to cut from poverty programs,
education and even transportation programs to offset the tax revenue
lost under the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he has any concerns about other programs that may be cut
as a result of the initiative, Meral suggested that rather than slash
programs, the Legislature should consider tax increases to make up
the difference. "I don't think we spend enough money on anything," he
said. "My general feeling is that the state budget is not adequate to
meet most of the needs of the state ... and the fundamental reason is
we don't have enough revenue." He insisted that the measure has
safeguards against hard times because provisions freeze spending if
annual state revenues fail to grow enough to cover the proposal's
costs.</TE>
<TE>   But Jean Ross, analyst for the nonpartisan California Budget
Project, said those provisions are meaningless. "The fact is that the
state never takes in less money from one year to the next," she said.
"If the initiative were in place right now, the money transfer would
happen," she said, even as the state was struggling to make up for a
$24-billion shortfall in revenues.</TE>
<TE>   In selecting projects for the initiative, Meral said he used no
set procedure, but tried to include those that would draw as much
support as possible. Some became part of the initiative because they
would garner endorsements from environmental groups, others because
they would be popular with voters in a particular area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With transportation projects, a key goal was to select those that
would help relieve congestion, particularly in the central city, so
there would be less incentive for people to move into the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the initiative has drawn support from many nonprofits and
environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, which touts
the measure as a reasonable compromise between construction and
conservation. Other groups, such as the League of Conservation
Voters, have refused to support the measure. "We think that we can
work with developers," said Sierra Club spokesman Jim Metrapulos.
"The initiative is a win-win."</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club's endorsement carries weight with some grass-roots
environmentalists, such as Dan Silver of the Los Angeles-based
Endangered Habitats League. "Some people would argue that
conservation groups have no business backing freeway building, but if
developers want to support these more progressive solutions, that's
called 'common ground,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition has come from advocates for the poor and from
government officials. They charge that Proposition 51 is really a
vehicle for special interests to get projects built that would be
given low priority if they had to withstand review by the California
Transportation Commission, which approves spending on transportation
proposals based on regional need and overall benefit to the state.</TE>
<TE>   "The best we can tell, none of those projects is in the STIP
(State Transportation Improvement Plan). Zero," said state
transportation Commissioner R. Kirk Lindsay. "That means that the
regional and state agencies charged with prioritizing projects
haven't even put it on the map yet."</TE>
<TE>   One regional agency, the San Bernardino Area Governments, voted to
oppose Proposition 51 after receiving a report that its staff and the
staffs of other regional agencies "were propositioned by PCL to
include ... projects in the initiative if that agency would commit to
requesting that their contractors contribute to supporting the
measure in November."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the San Bernardino regional agency also objected
because it earmarked $30 million for the construction of four rail
grade crossings near San Bernardino International Airport--a project
they would have given low priority.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said there is no congestion at any of the four
locations and that the $30 million would only cover a portion of the
cost. "We would have to come up with money from higher priority
projects to get the crossings done," said Norm King, executive
director of San Bernardino Area Governments.</TE>
<TE>   But the project would benefit Hillwood Development LLC, a Dallas
freight distributor headed by Ross Perot Jr. that has contributed
$120,000 to the initiative and plans to build a distribution center
near the airport. A Hillwood executive called the grading project "a
critical piece of infrastructure."</TE>

<HD>With the Cats Away, Beachfront Rodents Have a Field Day</HD>
<DH>Ventura: A rise in the rat and squirrel populations raises
health concerns. The city considers a ban on feeding the animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County officials may have rid the downtown beachfront of
feral cats a few years back, but the rodent population has boomed
since the predators were removed.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura Promenade has become so overpopulated with rats and
ground squirrels in the last year that city officials fear the spread
of disease. The rats tested negative for plague earlier this summer,
but there is still concern that they could pose a health hazard to
the hundreds of people who visit the popular section of beach near
California Street.</LD>
<LD>   Litter along the promenade contributes to the problem, but
officials say a bigger factor in the infestation is people who
consider the rodents "pets" that need to be fed--people like
62-year-old Helene Tagoni of Ventura, who continues to provide food
despite official requests that she cease.</LD>
<TE>   City officials say the only option might be to legally prohibit
people from feeding wild animals within city limits. Councilman Neal
Andrews has proposed such an ordinance, and the City Council is
scheduled to discuss the matter at its meeting tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Such a ban would be devastating to Tagoni, a self-styled beach
crusader who leads about 15 volunteers in washing handrails, cleaning
restrooms and caring for the animals along the promenade.</TE>
<TE>   She has become a fixture along the beach, spending up to two hours
each afternoon feeding sea gulls, pigeons, ground squirrels, and,
inadvertently, rats. Tagoni estimates she spends at least $100 weekly
on dog chow and carrots.</TE>
<TE>   Tagoni said her goal is to make the promenade a safe, revitalized
area to be enjoyed by residents and tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted was to make it a better place for the animals and a
better place for the public," she said. "We're not looking to cause
trouble. If we thought we were hurting something, we wouldn't have
gotten involved."</TE>
<TE>   Tagoni knows some city officials and residents resent what she's
doing, but she fears the ground squirrels and sea birds would waste
away if someone didn't help feed them.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started, the squirrels were just horrible-looking," she
said. "Even if I didn't feed them, they'd be here every day; then
they'll just have sick, diseased animals."</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura Parks Manager Mike Montoya says feeding the squirrels
creates an unnatural environment that artificially increases the
rodent population. An occasional tourist feeding the birds isn't
likely to have a detrimental effect, but those who regularly feed
wild animals are doing more harm than good, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such people wrongly believe that "they're doing a good thing," he
said. "They're really well-meaning people, but they're only
contributing to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Tagoni believes the city is using the rats as an excuse to thin
the squirrel population. "They've always had rats on the beach," she
said. "You can kill all the squirrels you want, but you're not going
to get rid of the rats."</TE>
<TE>   City parks officials have discussed ways to reduce the vermin, but
many common removal methods are not feasible because of the financial
or environmental costs. Trapping rodents is expensive and difficult,
and using poison could also kill secondary predators, such as certain
types of birds, Montoya said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Jenks, director of Ventura County Department of Animal
Regulation, said rats and ground squirrels along the beach are
destructive and carry fleas, and their droppings may pose a health
hazard. She said the best way to control the population would be to
let the food supply taper off.</TE>
<TE>   In early August, the city sponsored a session bringing together
people for and against feeding the animals. Both sides acknowledge
the meeting didn't accomplish much, except to make the debate more
heated. Now, city officials say it will take an ordinance to deter
people from feeding the wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Tagoni has suggested her own solution: using a bulldozer to move a
pile of large boulders from the Ventura Pier farther up the beach to
create a wildlife sanctuary. The rodents would likely migrate there,
leaving a wider section of beach next to the pier for swimmers and
beach-goers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Until there's a law preventing her, Tagoni intends to continue her
daily routine of feeding the myriad pigeons, sea gulls and ground
squirrels that flock to her. She said she'll consider moving away if
the city bans the feeding of wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "I had planned on buying a building and spending my life here,"
she says. "I don't know what else to do. There must be a solution."</TE>

<HD>Visions of Green Drawn in Sand</HD>
<DH>Events: Seal Beach sandcastle festival becomes the right
environment to advocate the benefits of recycling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kent Trollen wasn't offended that the most often-asked question from
spectators marveling at the sand sculpture his team spent nearly two
weeks building was, "What is that?"</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it delighted him.</LD>
<LD>   It gave Trollen the opportunity to remind those attending the Seal
Beach Sand Castle Festival on Sunday that unless they shape up their
act, the planet will face the grim future presented in his sculpture.</LD>
<TE>   The 100-foot-long sculpture depicted a recycling machine in the
year 2517--the only hope for cleaning up an Earth that has been
completely trashed by garbage, according to Trollen's written
narrative for the piece.</TE>
<TE>   The sculpture showed the giant starship-like machine sucking in
tires, cans and other trash at the mouth of the San Gabriel River and
transforming them into flowers. Trollen explains that this is
happening at a time when humans, overwhelmed by trash, have long
since fled the planet but returned after burying the rest of the
galaxy in trash too.</TE>
<TE>   "This is meant to be a slap in the face to people," said Trollen,
principal of Sandcastles Unlimited of Seal Beach, a company that
builds sand sculptures across the country for private functions,
corporate events and just for the fun of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Space Age sculpture--built by a team of 54 people with the
help of earth-movers and a high-loader--set the tone for the
festival, which was organized by the local Chamber of Commerce to
promote beach cleanup</TE>
<TE>   The past few years have been tough on Seal Beach, with raw sewage
contaminating the water and household trash washing onto the beaches
through storm drains. So this year's festival included the
traditional sandcastle contest with an environmental twist.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the contenders took their cues from Trollen--whose Space
Age sculpture was a demonstration project--and built castles around
an environmental theme.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an octopus picking up trash," said Fred Moore, 46, of
Seal Beach as he stood in front of the sculpture built by him and his
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of sculptures down was a scene with a bizarre, mutated
creature crawling through what looked like the apocalypse. A caption
carved in the sand explained: "Lost your city to trash."</TE>
<TE>   Peppered among the sculptures were booths where children played
games with a clean-up theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it all by myself," said Willemina Freiberger-Inskeep, 4,
with fishing rod in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I cleared out all the garbage." She was playing a game run by the
Orange County Sanitation District that involved fishing garbage out
of a pond full of fake fish and plants.</TE>
<TE>   The younger boy next to her didn't do as well. He became a little
confused and just threw his plastic dinosaur into the pond.</TE>
<TE>   Near the festival entrance, a group of young girls rubbed their
fingers along rows of slimy kelp and recoiled a bit when Scott Smith,
a high school teacher and Orange County Coast Keeper volunteer,
informed them that the plant is a key ingredient in ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   That was enough to get the girls moving to the next table, a
display of how urban runoff makes its way from the San Gabriel
Mountains all of the way down to Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But the kelp kept some of their parents intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   Smith explained that his students grow it on small tiles in water
tanks in his classroom. Professional divers then take the tiles and
place them in the water at Crystal Cove State Park in areas where
kelp is critical to the ecosystem. Pol- lution has killed off much of
the kelp that once grew there.</TE>
<TE>   "The students go to the beach and see it growing again," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'Hey, that's my kelp.' "</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard Forms Unit to Protect Area Seaports</HD>
<DH>Security: The San Pedro group is the third created in the
U.S. to help safeguard harbors against terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retired from the U.S. Coast Guard for a decade, Mike Dobbins had
worked as a police officer and even started a charter boat company in
Old Harbor, Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "I was on the phone [with the Coast Guard] in Washington, D.C.
that day," Dobbins recalled. "I made it known that all they had to do
was ask, and I'd come back."</LD>
<TE>   They asked, and Dobbins, 48, returned to join the Coast Guard's
Maritime Safety and Security Team, which was commissioned in a
ceremony Sunday at its home base in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The 104-member unit will undertake a variety of tasks to ensure
port security. Among them will be boarding suspicious vessels and
escorting cruise ships, which are considered potential terrorist
targets.</TE>
<TE>   The security team also will patrol the harbor during ceremonial
events, such as those for visiting tall ships or when Navy ships
dock.</TE>
<TE>   The San Pedro group is the third security team the Coast Guard has
commissioned this year, following one in Norfolk, Va., and another in
Seattle. Plans call for a fourth based in Houston and a total of 12
within the next three years, said Chief Warrant Officer R. Lance
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The San Pedro team has eight 25-foot boats that can travel 50 mph.
Each has an M-60 rifle mounted on it.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is based in Southern California, the unit can be moved
quickly throughout areas along the West Coast. The boats are small
enough that they can be loaded on C-130 cargo planes.</TE>
<TE>   Not to mistake the mission, the Coast Guard identifies the units
with the number 911. Because it is the third team, San Pedro is known
as 91103.</TE>
<TE>   Training for the new team began in June, said Lt. Cmdr. Keith M.
Smith, the unit's commanding officer. The group recently completed a
month of training with the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   At the commissioning ceremony, Secretary of Transportation Norman
Y. Mineta called the team a "nimble, elite force."</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Transportation, but
it will be moved to the Homeland Security Agency, if Congress passes
legislation to create the cabinet-level organization and the
president signs it into law.</TE>
<TE>   As Mineta and others spoke, the Los Angeles Channel behind them
was busy with giant cargo ships, tugboats and sailboats.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles/Long Beach harbor is the busiest in the nation.
More than 4 million cargo containers and 500,000 cruise ship
passengers pass through it annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It must be protected at all costs," Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the secretary spoke to the National Guard
Assn. of the United States conference in Long Beach, praising new
security measures imposed after the terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Shasta Dam Protectors Look Back With Pride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>REDDING</DL>
<LD>One of the first thoughts that popped into Doug Latimer's head Sept.
11 was whether he could find someone to take a couple thousand hot
dogs off his hands.</LD>
<LD>   That morning was supposed to be Shasta County's annual county
employees' picnic. Latimer, as chief administrator, was set to be
host. But the picnic was quickly canceled, and the hot dogs were sent
to a local charity.</LD>
<LD>   Then the reality of the attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon settled over him and Latimer began worrying about a much
more serious problem: Shasta Dam. A terror attack could never happen
here, he thought. Or could it?</LD>
<TE>   Holding back a reservoir of 4.5 million acre-feet of water just up
the road from this old lumber town of 80,000, Shasta Dam is one of
the three largest in the nation. Experts say its 15 million tons of
concrete would be next to impossible to breach. But if someone did
manage to take it out, the flood would cover an area the size of
Connecticut. Half the people around here could be killed and the
state water system seriously damaged.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, the possibility seemed real enough that Latimer took
on a strategic role in the nation's new war on terrorism. So did the
76-member Shasta County Sheriff's Department and every police
agency--big and small--in the county.</TE>
<TE>   On orders of the Interior Department, Shasta Dam was immediately
closed to the public and 24-hour guards were posted, most of them
pulled in from local police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In dozens of other rural and urban communities all over
California, local officials scrambled to keep things calm, looking to
help in any and every way.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, most communities tapped into state and regional
emergency systems that already existed, simply modifying them for the
new terrorist threat. But on that first day, all those people were
mostly on their own. And as the first anniversary of that day
approaches, most of them look back with pride.</TE>
<TE>   "Shasta County is a good example of a rural area that has
strategic value and had to be guarded," said George Vinson, a career
FBI agent with a background in counterterrorism who was brought in
after Sept. 11 by Gov. Gray Davis to help run state anti-terror
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists, in general, are strategic thinkers," Vinson said.
"You shut them down in one area, they will pop up in another. While
our major population centers are obvious targets, there are plenty of
places like Shasta County where both law enforcement and the public
need to stay alert."</TE>
<TE>   The population of Shasta County is about 170,000. It's mostly pine
trees and lakes and farms. Doug Latimer describes it as "sort of like
a Midwestern town in the Bible Belt," with Redding as the county
seat.</TE>
<TE>   Economic Cornerstone</TE>
<TE>   Shasta Lake and Shasta Dam are key to California's Central Valley
Project. More than 600 feet high and almost 900 feet thick at its
base, the dam is a cornerstone of California's farm economy and the
most important component in the state water system, supplying 20
million people.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody could breach that dam, there would be massive
flooding all the way down to Sacramento, 160 miles from here,"
Latimer said. "So we were worrying about that and also the
possibility somebody could poison the lake."</TE>
<TE>   In the entire nation, only Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state
and Hoover Dam compare. Grand Coulee is wider and Hoover is taller.
The water Shasta Dam captures from the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud
rivers helps produce two-thirds of the nation's food supply.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing Lt. Dave Dean of the Shasta County Sheriff's
Department ever figured was that he might have to protect it from
foreign attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a concern that they would blow Shasta because it is
so enormous. But the public did," Dean said.</TE>
<TE>   So off he went, along with half the law enforcement agents in
Shasta County, to take turns guarding the dam.</TE>
<TE>   Top Tourist Attraction</TE>
<TE>   Shasta Dam also is the biggest tourist attraction in Shasta
County, next to the lake itself. It draws about 40,000 visitors a
year for guided tours. There were some angry visitors at first,
especially one who got arrested on a drug charge after being stopped
for a terrorist check.</TE>
<TE>   But gradually things settled down. Pinkerton guards now patrol the
bridge instead of sheriff's deputies and local police. While groups
are no longer allowed to roam the dam at will or tour its bowels,
small groups who give 72 hours' notice are allowed for brief visits.</TE>
<TE>   While security rules for visitors are beginning to ease, Dean
said, officials are preparing a permanent ban on operation of boats
within 1,000 yards of the dam. And law enforcement remains more
alert.</TE>
<TE>   The same scares that frightened big city dwellers scared residents
of Redding too. There were a few anthrax hoaxes to worry about. And
some domestic terrorist groups believed to be in the area are still
drawing special state law enforcement attention.</TE>
<TE>   Dean looks back at those early days as a good teaming of rural and
urban forces. As elsewhere, the precautions at Shasta Dam involved
federal, state, county and city agencies working closely together.
"It's taught us all a lot, I think," he said. "Our top priority here
is still natural disasters. We had a fire in 1999 that destroyed 274
houses. And while we've been keeping our eye on the lake for
terrorists, the real danger is from drunks. We have had five deaths
on the lake so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at 9/11 is that it was a shock that it occurred,
but it shouldn't have been a surprise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to continued security concerns about the dam, Shasta
County's other primary post-Sept. 11 goals in the coming year include
improving public health capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Disaster Plans Refined</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, Shasta County is the regional hub of a
nine-county area with mutual aid emergency medical plans for major
disasters. Since Sept. 11, officials said, those plans have been
refined significantly.</TE>
<TE>   One of the region's major needs, local health officials said, is
an improved laboratory to provide more sophisticated medical testing.
Shasta County Public Health Director Marta McKenzie and Dr. Andrew
Deckert, the county's health officer, are seeking $2.5 million in
state money to improve the county's lab. Other goals, McKenzie said,
include improving communications with private physicians, law
enforcement agencies and the public.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Doug Latimer is back to thinking about hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Shasta County's 1,900 county employees never did get their picnic
last year. But Latimer has one scheduled this year, for Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   There will be daylong observances of Sept. 11 in Redding and other
Shasta County towns, just as there will be across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   And he expects a peaceful day.</TE>

<HD>Toxin in Drinking Water to Be Regulated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Perchlorate, a hazardous legacy of California's defense industry,
must be regulated in drinking water by 2004 under a new law announced
Sunday by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   No state or federal standard now exists for perchlorate, a
byproduct of rocket fuel that can cause thyroid problems in humans.
The presence of perchlorate has forced the shutdown of wells in the
San Gabriel Valley and Rancho Cordova, east of Sacramento, where
defense contractors once tested rockets.</LD>
<LD>   Perchlorate is also found in the Colorado River, a major water
supply for Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   The governor also announced on Sunday the signing of several other
environmental bills, including one that would allow timber companies
to someday get credit for preserving old-growth trees as an antidote
to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Work to establish a California standard for perchlorate is well
underway. In March, state environmental officials published a draft
public health goal of six parts per billion in drinking water. The
Department of Health Services in 2000 reported finding perchlorate in
44 public drinking water systems, 23 of them at levels greater than
18 parts per billion.</TE>
<TE>   The bill Davis signed into law, SB 1822 by Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford), requires the state to have set a final standard by Jan.
1, 2004. After that date, no water district could legally sell water
with perchlorate levels that violate the standard.</TE>
<TE>   Sher said that, with the new law, "California has tried to take
its own destiny in its own hands" because a federal standard could be
years away.</TE>
<TE>   Davis announced the signing of a second Sher bill, SB 812, which
expands a climate change registry established by legislation last
year. The voluntary registry allows companies to detail the efforts
they've taken since 1990 to reduce emission of carbon dioxide and
other gases that have been linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, if regulators clamp controls on greenhouse gas
emissions, companies in the registry could get recognition for the
cutbacks they've already achieved.</TE>
<TE>   The Sher bill expands the registry to allow timber companies to
document the preservation or expansion of old-growth forest. Big,
mature trees help offset greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon
dioxide.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just bringing into play another element of the equation
... how the greenhouse gases are absorbed, which is through plant
life," said Winston Hickox, secretary of the California Environmental
Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Clothes washers built for California homes would have to be just
as miserly with water as commercial washing machines by 2007 under AB
1561 by Assemblyman David Kelley (R-Idyllwild), also signed by the
governor. The bill requires the state Energy Commission to seek an
exemption from the U.S. Department of Energy regulations for clothes
washers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed SB 1808 by Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz),
which requires the state Office of Planning and Research to issue a
report every year, instead of every four years, on the state's
environmental goals and policies.</TE>

<HD>L.A., Bakersfield Growth Is Poised for Grapevine Collision</HD>
<DH>Development: Plans for huge projects along I-5 threaten to
blur a longtime regional divide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Near the top of the daunting Grapevine, the mountain route between
Southern California and the Central Valley, lies a wind-swept valley
where developers are proposing to build a 70,000-resident city, the
largest housing project in Los Angeles County history.</LD>
<LD>   At the base of the same steep grade, a mammoth white Ikea
furniture warehouse juts out of a parched Kern County plain. It is
the first of dozens of warehouses planned at the foot of the
Tehachapi Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next decade or two, the 23,000-home Centennial housing
project, the 1,450-acre warehouse complex and a third large
development on the giant Tejon Ranch are expected to alter regional
distinctions formed over 150 years--blurring the lines that have
distinguished the sprawl of the south from the farms of the north,
the city from the country, the burbs from the sticks.</LD>
<TE>   Like steppingstones, the three projects along Interstate 5 would
link Southern California and the Central Valley, filling parts of the
75-mile expanse between Santa Clarita and Bakersfield that is now
nearly all open space.</TE>
<TE>   The rugged Tehachapis had long proved to be one obstacle that even
Southern California's relentless sprawl could not surmount. The
mountains were so formidable that the area's first U.S. surveyor used
camels to traverse them. Even when the Old Ridge Route was opened in
1915, it took the better part of a day to get from Los Angeles to
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   But those old boundaries are becoming obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   On the grazing lands of Tejon Ranch--an area larger than the city
of Los Angeles--developers now plot the warehouse district as a major
shipping springboard for goods from the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles. The "new town" of Centennial would include jobs for 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Protests seem inevitable--water is short, wildlife may be
threatened and development would leapfrog far beyond current city
boundaries. But given the growth records of Kern and Los Angeles
counties, the ambitious vision for Tejon could prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like Southern California and Northern California are
taking over Central California as a distinct place," said Kathryn
Colebrook, a mortgage company manager in Bakersfield. "Obviously,
Southern California is coming over the hill."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, residents of the Central Valley say they can already see
the fading of regional distinctions in the old Depression-era
boomtown of Bakersfield--and the best and worst of that change.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of Southern Californians have already moved to
that community, once better known for Buck Owens, oil and
agriculture. There, in blistering summer heat and chilling winter
fog, amid a stagnant economy, a typical house still sells for
$119,000, a third of the price buyers are paying in coastal Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the Bakersfield realty board said that one in
five of his customers is from south of the Tehachapis. The city's
growth rate was three times that of the state over the last decade.
And home sales are only accelerating, up 61% in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically people who 30 years ago might have bought a house
in Woodland Hills, and 20 years ago in Thousand Oaks and 10 years ago
in Santa Clarita," said author and demographic researcher Joel
Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they've been priced out of those markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the stylish new subdivisions of sprawling west Bakersfield,
which has grown from virtually nothing in 20 years, sit trendy shops,
big box stores and golf course communities so familiar to Southern
Californians.</TE>
<TE>   But while new industry brings jobs, along with it comes traffic.
While affordable homes are the dream of young couples, they can
obscure the heritage that once made Bakersfield a singular place.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest Bakersfield is almost a McTown, no different from the
McTowns of Orange County or the McTown of Valencia, " said Sriram
Khe, former director of the Environmental Resource Management Program
at Cal State Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the red-tiled homes and Starbucks-studded shopping centers
of the Southland migrated over the Grapevine, the Tejon Ranch still
seemed an impenetrable barrier between the two regions. A
cattle-raising operation since 1843, the 270,000-acre ranch comprises
four old Spanish land grants. It's 40 miles from north to south, 21
miles across--425 square miles in all.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1870s, New York Herald newspaper correspondent Charles
Nordhoff described the ranch as the "most magnificent estate, in a
single hand, in America."</TE>
<TE>   Tejon was sold in 1912 to an investment group that included the
owners of the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   "The ranch has never earned much money, but it's a great piece of
property," said former Times Publisher Otis Chandler, whose family
was a principal owner, through Times Mirror Co., until it sold its
interest in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Every developer, when they looked at it, thought they were going
to make hundreds of millions of dollars," Chandler said. "It's been
talked about for 30 years. But nothing has really come of it."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently.</TE>
<TE>   With a sharp swing in corporate philosophy in 1996 and the sale of
its livestock operations in the last two years, Tejon Ranch Co.
became primarily a real estate development firm. "It's like a
sleeping giant waking up," said economist Mark Evans, dean of the
Extended University at Cal State Bakersfield. "Once they do a couple
of things at the base of the Grapevine or even toward the top, then
things will really accelerate."</TE>
<TE>   Tejon Ranch includes 16 miles of freeway frontage along the I-5 on
each side of the Tejon Pass, where the artist Christo once installed
1,760 huge yellow umbrellas.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is bisected by the California Aqueduct, the straw
through which the Southland draws water from the snowpacks of the
north. And the ranch has abundant rights to that liquid gold.</TE>
<TE>   So as the state experiences, simultaneously, a population surge, a
water squeeze and a housing shortage, Tejon executives are seizing
the moment. "We would like to develop our land, but we like to think
we're good stewards," said Tejon Ranch President Robert A. Stine.</TE>
<TE>   Tejon's first three large projects are the warehouse complex near
the junction of the I-5 and Highway 99, about 25 miles south of
Bakersfield; the Centennial "new town" of 11,700 acres--half of it
open space--30 miles north of Santa Clarita; and a golf course resort
of second homes and ranch estates at Tejon Mountain Village, near
Tejon Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The first two warehouses are already built in Kern County.
Developers submitted the Centennial project to Los Angeles County
planners 10 days ago. They expect to firm up concepts for the luxury
resort in Kern County this year or next.</TE>
<TE>   The warehouse project is emblematic of Kern County's ambition to
become a kind of switching yard for big rigs that roam the West. That
crossroads depot is no more than 4 1/4 hours from every major
California city and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Tejon executives are selling the Centennial project to Los Angeles
County officials as a complete community with a balance between homes
and jobs--a mini-Santa Clarita to help meet Los Angeles County's
housing deficiency of 28,000 dwellings a year.</TE>
<TE>   "In Southern California, there's not much available land left,"
said Centennial project manager Greg Medeiros. "So the growth will
probably be accommodated in the Antelope Valley or along Interstate
5. It's the only underused freeway in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Centennial would exceed in size the 21,700-dwelling Newhall Ranch
project near Santa Clarita, the largest residential development ever
approved in Los Angeles County, according to county planners.</TE>
<TE>   The Tejon projects face many questions.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues of sprawl will definitely come up," said Jim Hartl,
planning director for Los Angeles County. "And when you start talking
about a jobs-housing balance, you can't force people to live and work
in the same location."</TE>
<TE>   In Kern County, Planning Director Ted James said there wasn't much
complaint about the first phase of warehouses at the bottom of the
Grapevine. But he expects more concerns about the expansion, which
overlays habitat of the San Joaquin kit fox, a rare kangaroo rat and
blunt-nosed leopard lizards.</TE>
<TE>   "Every environmentalist in the state should be concerned about
whatever is proposed for Tejon Ranch," said Dan Cooper, director of
bird conservation for Audubon California. "It's an ecological gold
mine."</TE>
<TE>   To blunt criticism, Tejon Ranch has sent representatives into
surrounding communities to speak to groups and survey residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to avoid the typical thing where a developer lays
out a plan and then you start arguing with environmental groups and
officials," Stine of the Tejon Ranch Co. said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the fate of Tejon Ranch, the law of housing supply and
demand is already changing the south end of the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing more L.A. influence here," said James, the Kern
County planner. "That's become an issue: Do we want to be another Los
Angeles bedroom community? There's a strong feeling for the
small-town character that Bakersfield still has to a large degree."</TE>
<TE>   Internal Revenue Service data show that about 55,500 Los Angeles
County residents moved to Kern County from 1990 to 2001, nearly
22,000 more than moved in the other direction. And planners say
thousands of commuters endure the long trip south over the Grapevine
each day.</TE>
<TE>   Khe, the former Cal State professor, is a Southern California
transplant who commuted to Los Angeles for eight months after moving
to Bakersfield. His wife has done the same while earning her
doctorate at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   So Khe sees both sides of the Central Valley's budding
transformation: Growth is a boon for him as a homeowner and
potentially good for the economy overall, he said. But it also brings
pollution to a basin that already has some of the dirtiest air in the
nation. A rich history is being brushed aside, too--one of oil
exploration, agriculture and the 1930s influx of Oklahoma migrants.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten rid of our railroad history; people turn up their
noses at our remaining oil wells," Khe said.</TE>
<TE>   But Southern Californians who fill the new subdivisions say change
generally is making their adopted hometown better all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Saltz, 30, an assistant director on the television drama
"JAG," drives 35,000 miles a year so she can live in one of
Bakersfield's newest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things Bakersfield has that L.A. can't compare
to--hometown feel and friendliness," said Saltz, who jumps into her
Volvo sedan each morning for a 1 1/2-hour drive to Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   But what Saltz, her lawyer husband and their two young children
really like is the large two-story house on an acre they bought for
$250,000. "It would be triple the price in L.A.," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She's hoping that a shopping center nearby replicates the
Marketplace outdoor mall built in southwest Bakersfield--a red brick
complex with fountains, a movie theater, Starbucks, Baja Fresh and
Jamba Juice that may be the busiest place in town on weekend nights.</TE>
<TE>   In time, Bakersfield will become less itself and more an extension
of the Southern California megalopolis, said Pepperdine's Kotkin, a
frequent visitor to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Bakersfield 30 years ago being much more of a distinct
place--sort of old Okie and Arkie, and funky country music," Kotkin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The spread of clueless suburbia is not anything that can be
celebrated in story or song," he said. "But it may just be
inevitable. And it may be a way that individual families get to live
a decent life."</TE>

<HD>A Learning Experience for the Teachers Too</HD>
<DH>Education: After one week, experimental program at
Camarillo charter school is getting rave reviews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It doesn't take long to figure out that something different is going
on at this Camarillo elementary school.</LD>
<LD>   There are the playgrounds, which remain mostly empty all day.</LD>
<LD>   There's the teacher who speaks to her young students solely in
Spanish--even the ones who don't yet know the language.</LD>
<TE>   And there are the college professors milling about the campus and
peering into classrooms--as if they were visiting a research
laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   That's the idea behind University Preparation School, which opened
Tuesday to 350 students at the former El Rancho Structured School
campus on Temple Avenue. About 200 students came from the surrounding
neighborhood and the remaining 150 from schools countywide, from Port
Hueneme to Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The charter school, closely affiliated with Cal State Channel
Islands University, will serve as a training ground for new teachers
while providing an innovative educational environment for hundreds of
Ventura County youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   It's an experiment that's been years in the making. Last week, for
the first time, teachers and professors got to see it in action.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been so awesome," said Judy Crenshaw, one of 16
veteran teachers handpicked for the school from districts across the
county. "It's all a big adventure, and it's so exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Thorpe, head of academic programs at the nearby
university, said professors are encouraged by what they have seen.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who visited came back so amazed and thrilled," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw is one of two teachers in the school's dual-language
program, which helps children become fluent in both English and
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Both classes include 10 native Spanish speakers and 10
English-only speakers. The format was chosen by a committee of
teachers and university staff, said Linda Ngarupe, the school's
principal.</TE>
<TE>   The students have both English-only and Spanish-only classes. This
gives the classmates the opportunity to help each other, while
boosting their own self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   One week in, it appears to be working, said Carolyn Bernal, who
teaches in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I have four or five children who are very bright, and you can see
that the biggest challenge for them right away is the Spanish,"
Bernal said. "I could see them look to the Spanish-speaking children
for help. I think it's going to be a very valuable experience for all
of them."</TE>
<TE>   This year's dual-language program includes 40 students, but over
time more classes will be phased in, Ngarupe said.</TE>
<TE>   All other children at the school get 30 to 60 minutes of Spanish
lessons each day.</TE>
<TE>   Many students said Spanish instruction was a highlight of their
first week.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to say, 'Adios, amigos!' " beamed 9-year-old Tanner
Jacobson.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Katie Kitay, 9, said, "This way I can talk to my mom so
my little brother doesn't know what I'm saying."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike traditional schools, University Preparation students are
grouped in multi-age classes: early years (kindergarten and first
grade), primary years (second and third grades) and intermediate
years (fourth and fifth grades).</TE>
<TE>   The day's schedule is also different, with uninterrupted class
time each morning, a 45-minute lunch break and another block of
classes in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   While some students grumbled about the lack of formal recesses,
Ngarupe said every teacher has incorporated several "brain breaks"
for snacking, stretching and socializing.</TE>
<TE>   "This way they take breaks when the children need it and when it
ties best into the curriculum," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Students also will have the opportunity to spend time in different
specialist classes each week, including physical education, music and
movement, art and drama.</TE>
<TE>   Such varied scheduling is easier to implement at charter schools,
which are publicly funded but free from most state curriculum
restrictions, Ngarupe said.</TE>
<TE>   The school's unique approach has drawn broad interest from parents
across Ventura County, with 140 children on a waiting list for future
enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cote, who has two sons attending the school, said he feels
as though he hit the educational jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   His family lives a block from the school, within the school's
local attendance area.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at it as a real blessing," Cote said. "It's an awesome
opportunity."</TE>

<HD>Pilot Is Critically Injured in Single-Engine Plane Crash</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Camarillo man known as a stickler for aircraft
safety loses power after takeoff at Oxnard Airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 41-year-old Camarillo man was critically injured Sunday when his
homemade single-engine plane lost power and crashed shortly after
taking off from Oxnard Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Lockamy, a weapons testing director at Naval Base Ventura
County, was reported in critical condition at Ventura County Medical
Center after his plane crashed just west of the airport's runway
about 11 a.m., officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "He was taking off and was in the air toward the end of the runway
when he turned away and crashed into the field," said Christopher R.
Hastert, the Oxnard Airport manager. "It appeared to be engine
failure, but until we can take a report from the pilot I won't know
for sure."</LD>
<TE>   Hastert said investigators from the Federal Aviation
Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were
expected to conduct the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Lockamy spent nearly two years building the single-seat kit plane,
called a Sonex, before flying it for the first time in May, according
to Lockamy's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, Lockamy radioed the airport's control tower
shortly after takeoff to report engine trouble and request an
emergency landing, said Oxnard Police Cmdr. Tom Chronister.</TE>
<TE>   Lockamy's lightweight plane bounced after a hard landing and
skidded to a stop, witnesses said. He was ejected from the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   A flying colleague of Lockamy's described him as a stickler on
aircraft safety who often instructed other members of the Point Mugu
Navy Flying Club on how to prevent accidents. The club is based at
Camarillo Airport and is composed of current or retired military
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really knowledgeable and safety-minded," said Gary LaPook, a
member of the flying club and an attorney specializing in airplane
crash investigations. "I see cases all the time where something goes
wrong and it surprises me that it happens to experienced pilots. Jack
was always safety-conscious, but these things can jump up and bite
you."</TE>

<HD>Political Financing's New State</HD>
<DH>Elections: Alabama's loose campaign funding laws show how
parties might bypass strict federal 'soft-money' curbs after Nov. 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Johnny Crawford is a state lobbyist whose self-effacing charm belies
the millions of dollars in campaign contributions he has at his
disposal.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just little old Johnny down here," the stocky political
operative says from behind a puff of cigarette smoke in his
well-appointed office in the state capital.</LD>
<LD>   Using a single post office box for no fewer than 10 political
action committees, he has amassed a war chest of nearly $2 million in
just 18 months from some of the country's biggest corporations and
richest businesspeople.</LD>
<TE>   And he has doled it out by the hundreds of thousands to everyone
from the mayor to Alabama's governor to the Democratic National
Committee in Washington--which on one recent day received $300,000
from an array of Crawford's committees.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford may well be one future face of how America pays for its
politics post-Nov. 5, a major money broker who personifies loopholes
in the landmark campaign-finance reform law that kicks in at the
federal level after midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   The law severely curtails how money can be raised and spent by
national parties. But most of those rules don't affect how
contributions are amassed and distributed by state PACs: Those are
governed by 50 different sets of regulations, and Alabama's are among
the loosest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford's are among more than 400 PACs registered in the state.
And since the current election cycle began in January 2001, they have
collected more than $31 million in corporate, union and individual
contributions--known as "soft money"--often moving the money through
a series of PACs, which erases public traces of their original
donors.</TE>
<TE>   It's a political treasure trove that analysts say almost certainly
will grow exponentially after Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, signed into law this
year, bans the use of soft money at the federal level.</TE>
<TE>   Soft-money contributions are unregulated, unlimited donations that
companies, unions and others pour into the national political party
committees for advertisements, voter registration and other
activities intended to influence elections. Because the money is not
spent directly on a specific candidate, it has not been subject to
federal contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   The national parties have collected and distributed hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of it in the last decade but can't touch it
as of Nov. 6, the day after the midterm congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   The special interests that have been sending that cash to
Washington will be looking for new ways to use it to back candidates
and to finance the issue ads and direct mail campaigns now funded by
federal soft money, according to political analysts and reform
activists.</TE>
<TE>   Many predict that money will gather at the state level in loosely
regulated PACs and from there find its way into the coffers of state
party committees and their candidates, where it can have much the
same effect.</TE>
<TE>   "These PAC managers become instant money brokers," said Ed Bender
of the Montana-based National Institute on Money in State Politics.
"People and corporations will go to them from all over the country
with bundles of checks to spread around at political fund-raisers and
to party committees, not only in their own state but in other
states."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of state PACs already are raising hundreds of millions
worth of campaign contributions. Reform advocates say soft money is
legal in all but one state: Connecticut. Many state legislatures have
tried to limit the amount of such contributions, but restrictions
often are riddled with loopholes that keep the special interest money
flowing far beyond intended maximums, Bender said.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance law in California, for example, prohibits the
more than 2,000 state PACs from receiving or distributing individual
contributions of more than $5,000. But a loophole lets far greater
sums flow through PACs that support or attack ballot initiatives,
rather than specific candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, according to Bender and other reformers: The
hard-fought federal campaign finance reform law may well end up being
a giant step backward. It will, they fear, merely shift many of the
soft dollars from the national level, where they have been subject to
strict accounting and rigorous monitoring, to states such as Alabama,
where the money trails are obscure at best.</TE>
<TE>   With just 2.4 million registered voters, Alabama has 486
registered PACs, which can be created overnight and take in and
distribute unlimited amounts of soft money. The proliferation of PACs
stems in large part from the way the state set up limits on
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations can give a maximum of $500 per election, per PAC, per
year. With as many as 17 state and local elections in a given year,
the true ceiling is as much as $8,500 per PAC per year. The PAC then
may spend the money on any candidates, races or issues--or donate it
to another PAC.</TE>
<TE>   Unlimited numbers of PAC-to-PAC contributions are permitted, which
PAC managers such as Crawford concede are used to disguise the
money's source, though the politician at the receiving end is almost
certain to learn the source through informal channels.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to pass legislation that would prohibit these
horizontal PAC-to-PAC contributions," said Chuck Grainger, general
counsel to Alabama's secretary of state. "That would bring some
sanity to it, as these horizontal contributions are oriented strictly
toward money laundering. But so far, the bill has died in Senate
every time."</TE>
<TE>   The result, according to James L. Sumner Jr., director of
Alabama's State Ethics Commission: "Today, we just have a huge
conglomerate of PACs. We have an enormous system of PAC-to-PAC
transfers. It has grown exponentially in the last five to seven
years. And most of us expect it'll probably explode after Nov. 5."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama also boasts a ready-made industry of campaign finance
middlemen such as Crawford. More than 500 licensed contract lobbyists
can set up PACs and raise unlimited amounts of corporate money for
candidates, then lobby those same politicians after they take office.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbyists generally don't charge fees for managing the PACs.
They get something more valuable for their money-raising efforts:
access to lawmakers, which attracts top-dollar clients to their
lobbying enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said he hadn't thought through the effect of the federal
reform law on his operation.</TE>
<TE>   But he agreed generally that money machines such as state PACs--in
Alabama or elsewhere--will become far bigger players at the national
level after Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   An inventory of Crawford's top PAC contributors helps explain why.
They are corporations that rank among the biggest givers of soft
money at the national level as well. Contributions include tens of
thousands of dollars from the Arkansas-based national nursing home
giant Beverly Enterprises, Alabama's multinational coal-mining
powerhouse Drummond Co. and Birmingham-based HealthSouth, which bills
itself as the country's largest single provider of nonemergency
medical care, with 1,900 facilities in 50 states.</TE>
<TE>   Those companies each have given tens of thousands of dollars at
the federal level for the coming elections--soft money that will be
banned under the reform law.</TE>
<TE>   Most say they have yet to decide how they will redistribute their
soft money after Nov. 5. In a typical response, a Beverly spokeswoman
said, "It's not a science, and the amounts aren't set in stone."</TE>
<TE>   But other companies privately said that their state-level
contributions almost certainly will increase.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most striking differences between giving to a national
party versus a state PAC is how difficult it is to trace the money.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama, PACs take in tens of thousands of dollars from major
corporations, state contractors and individuals that are seeking
anonymity to all but the ultimate recipient of the contribution,
according to state officials. And those PACs, in turn, can contribute
to other PACs, which often move the money to still other unrelated
PACs, which then contribute the money to targeted candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The donors are legally barred from telling PAC managers where to
spend the money. And the managers are not supposed to tell
politicians where the money came from. This serves to hide big donors
from the public, while still having the desired political effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you that, on the receiving end, the person knows
exactly where it came from," said Sumner of the ethics commission.
"Otherwise, what's the point?"</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said he complies with the law. Each contribution to one
of his PACs, he said, is met with a letter from his firm that states:
"We appreciate your contribution to our PAC, but you know that under
state law it is totally under the discretion of the PAC committee how
it will be spent."</TE>
<TE>   He said his PACs do not directly tell politicians who gave the
money the PAC is contributing, although he added, "I might say, 'OK,
this is Franklin PAC. We've got some good pro-business contributors
who believe in your candidacy and they include Company A or Company
B.' "</TE>
<TE>   Many of Crawford's PACs are an alphabet soup: ENVIRO, ECODEV and
one with his own initials, JDC. But there's also the Franklin PAC,
named after Benjamin Franklin, whom Crawford calls America's first
paid lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford has been in business since 1996, after leaving his job as
assistant secretary to the state Senate. He got a break in the run-up
to the 1998 state elections, when, he said, the Democratic National
Committee hired him to identify four key state Senate races that
would help the party keep its legislative majority in Alabama.
Crawford picked wisely. The Democrats won all four, and Crawford's
reputation was made.</TE>
<TE>   He got a chance to return the favor this year, in a move that may
boost his profile after Nov. 5 as a key state-based fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said he has been solicited regularly by fund-raising
colleagues and by the DNC for contributions to the national
committee, but the pitches intensified as the soft-money deadline
approached. So he pulled together $300,000 from his 10 PACs for the
DNC "as a favor to a friend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If national party officials are hoping for success stories like
Crawford's in all 50 states, campaign reform advocates are fearing
more tales like that of John Teague and Jimmy Butts.</TE>
<TE>   Butts was the director of the Alabama Department of Transportation
in the 1990s. His childhood friend, Teague, was a lobbyist who
created a series of PACs that distributed contributions for the
governor who had appointed Butts. Teague sought contributions from
highway contractors and other clients, all of whom were seeking
future contracts or favors from Butts, according to documents on file
in federal court here.</TE>
<TE>   A 42-count indictment the grand jury handed down in December 2000
asserted that Teague and another lobbyist also shook down their
clients to contribute tens of thousands of dollars to finance the
car-racing career of Butts' son.</TE>
<TE>   Butts, Teague and another lobbyist pleaded guilty to reduced
charges of bribery and tax fraud in October and are serving federal
prison terms; documents filed by the FBI in the case indicate that
investigators believed Teague was using at least five of his PACs to
move the illicit money.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such cases, there is little popular pressure for reform,
said Auburn University political science professor Bradley Moody.</TE>
<TE>   "The assumption by most Alabamians is, 'Par for the course, the
poor [guys] got caught,' " he said of the Butts case. "It is part of
a larger assumption that the whole blooming process is corrupt, and
there's nothing you can do."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of Alabama's system are grounded in "reform" efforts
that began with the state's Fair Campaign Practices Act, which was
drafted amid heavy lobbying by the state's Democrat-leaning labor
unions. The act set a ceiling only on corporate contributions, which
favor Republicans, at $500 per election.</TE>
<TE>   But the act was broadened through a series of rulings by the state
attorney general's office, which was headed at the time by a
politician who would later use the PAC system to raise millions of
campaign dollars to become Alabama's current governor, Democrat
Donald Siegelman.</TE>
<TE>   Those rulings are what effectively erased the corporate limit,
because the attorney general interpreted "election" to mean any
election in the state--from governor to dog catcher--in any given
year. So far, there have been as many as 17 a year, officials said,
generating the $8,500 figure. But that could go higher in the future.
And the "per PAC" ruling meant corporations could give the maximum to
any number of PACs, each of which could then give to a politician.</TE>
<TE>   This spawned the massive proliferation of PACs almost overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson to be learned from Alabama," Moody said, "is: As soon
as new campaign finance legislation is in place, the people who work
within that industry have already found ways around it."</TE>

<DH>Wilbert Rideau killed a woman on Feb. 16, 1961. Now, as his
fourth trial begins, a Louisiana town must once again relive the
long, painful saga.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAKE CHARLES, La.</DL>
<LD>Lockup is all about time. Anybody who's been inside can tell you
that. In the canned air and fluorescent glare of the Calcasieu Parish
jail, time is embedded in concrete, in a visitors' window thick
enough to smother sound.</LD>
<LD>   The women come through the lush twilight for this hour; the men in
orange jumpsuits march forth from the belly of the jail. With days
and months stretched between them, they pick up telephones, and a
soft slur of many private conversations settles over the room. Then
the guards loom behind, tap shoulders and prod the inmates back to
their dormitories. Their 45 minutes have run out.</LD>
<LD>   Wilbert Rideau stays put. Nobody makes him move. He is well-known
in these parts, a decorated prison journalist and a killer.</LD>
<TE>   "Do I have regrets?" He has been pondering the question. "Yeah, I
have regrets. But my life isn't over with. I'm not ready to add it up
yet."</TE>
<TE>   But isn't there one choice? One moment? One night he looks back on
now--?</TE>
<TE>   "Life isn't that cold and calculated," he says, the telephone
dangling from his fingers as if he has forgotten it's there. "There
are forces that drive it. You don't so much choose. It's not that
clear. There's emotion. There are things--"</TE>
<TE>   He interrupts himself.</TE>
<TE>   "See, I know where you're going with this," he says. "I'm
second-guessing you. That's the curse of being in the same business."</TE>
<TE>   He chuckles. He says good night. He waits until his visitor hangs
up the phone, and then he wanders back into the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the darkness is rich and thick with stars. Rideau can't
see the sky, can't smell the wilting jasmine. He can't hear the tick
and hoot of the swamp settling into sleep. He will sleep waiting and
wake up waiting still.</TE>
<TE>   His judgment day is coming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They say his name Read-oh, and around here they say it slowly, say
it in knowing voices. It refers to the man named Wilbert Rideau, but
it also means a night that split the past from the present, that
continues to shred a rift between blacks and whites in this decaying
oil patch town. It was a night that started out mean, that drained
into morning, but never quite ended.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbert Rideau is a black man who killed a white woman in 1961,
just as the stubborn Old South was beginning its slow slide into
obscurity. Now Louisiana is preparing to try him for a fourth time,
even though he has not denied his crime and despite the three death
sentences he has outlived. He is due in court today for arguments on
pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   Peering through the gauze of yellowing newspaper clips,
transcripts of testimony from dead witnesses and lost evidence, a
modern judge and jury will have to decide whether Rideau has redeemed
himself.</TE>
<TE>   The trial will measure time's work on a man--but it will also put
Louisiana up for judgment. Until now, each of Rideau's trials has
been so riddled with racism and bias that all of the state's verdicts
against Wilbert Rideau were overturned. Each trial drags out
Louisiana's ugly past and lays it alongside a man's transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   The laws have changed. Louisiana has changed. Rideau has changed.
But that Thursday night clings to the skin of Lake Charles like an
ill-advised tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'Let it go, put it aside, bury it,' but when you think
you've laid it down, it jumps back up," says Jan Cater. She was 12
when her aunt bled to death on a muddy roadside. She has lived in
Lake Charles all her life. "You push it to the back, you don't think
about it every day. And then guess what happens: The phone rings and
they say, 'He's trying to get out of prison again.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like that night happens over and over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rain, and More Rain</TE>
<TE>   When they think back, they mention the rain. The sky stretched
dull as metal that day, and the storm came to blur the seam between
day and night. It dropped its beads on windshields, left puddles in
the rice paddies. It roared and slackened, only to come back harder.</TE>
<TE>   It was Feb. 16, a night preserved in print at the public library
and the old courthouse, chronicled by long-gone stenographers and
newspaper reporters. A teller named Dora McCain said she knew
something was wrong when her boss yelled out from the back of Gulf
National Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "You girls close the curtains and come here," Jay Hickman called.</TE>
<TE>   McCain snatched up the telephone and dialed the bank's main
office. "I'm going to lay the phone down, but listen in," she
whispered. "Something's funny here." Then, frazzled, she hung up.</TE>
<TE>   In the back, Rideau had a pistol trained on the 55-year-old
Hickman. "Do what I say and you won't get hurt," he said. The women
stood by while their boss stacked bundles of cash into Rideau's
suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   The phone rattled. "Don't answer it," Rideau said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll think something is wrong," Hickman said.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau considered this. "Go ahead," he said, cocking his gun
against Hickman's head. "But talk right."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you need the police?" the bank's vice president asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be a good idea," Hickman said. Then he hung up.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau was suspicious. There was no time to rob the vault--he'd
take what he had. He turned to teller Julia Ferguson. "Do you have
your car?"</TE>
<TE>   In the parking lot, Rideau herded his three hostages into Julia's
Vauxhall. He slipped into the back, fingers wrapped around the
pistol. He'd let them go on the outskirts of town, he said. It would
be a cold walk back, but he needed time to escape.</TE>
<TE>   At 46, Julia was a stout woman in sensible pumps. She was driving
too fast. "Slow down," Rideau snapped. She did. Maybe he won't kill
us, Hickman thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you realize your lives are hanging on a shoestring,"
Rideau said.</TE>
<TE>   "One day you'll have to stand before God," Julia said.</TE>
<TE>   They rolled slowly through the wet winter night, headed out of
town along dreary streets where black families lived in old
bungalows. Down Opelousas Street, over the tracks, past the big dance
hall and onward into darkness. The pavement dropped off; the tires
grated on gravel and sand. They crossed English Bayou.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop the car," Rideau said. "Shut up. I'm trying to think."</TE>
<TE>   He looked lost, fingering his gun in a hijacked car on a moonless
night. The highway stretched before him. Darkened fields. Ditches.
Mud. $14,079.</TE>
<TE>   "Get out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He opened fire.</TE>
<TE>   A bullet caught Hickman in the arm. The bank manager reeled, then
staggered into the flooded bayou. Julia collapsed, and Dora dropped
onto the dirt in a fake faint. Rideau ran a few steps after Hickman,
then paused.</TE>
<TE>   Limp in the mud, Julia stirred. Rideau shot her in the shoulder
and the base of the neck.</TE>
<TE>   "Get up," he told her. "Get up."</TE>
<TE>   She was still alive. "Please, Wilbert, think of my poor old
daddy," she said. Those were her last words.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," he replied. "It'll be quick and cool." He plunged
his hunting dagger 6 inches into her left breast, piercing her heart.
He slashed her throat.</TE>
<TE>   He shot Dora in the neck, crashed toward the bayou and hollered
Hickman's name. Silence.</TE>
<TE>   Back to Dora. He kicked her so hard he snapped her rib. She fought
to keep still.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd better be dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He drew the wet night into his lungs and bawled out Hickman's name
one last time. "I believed they were all dead," he would say in his
confession. "I intended that they be dead." He slipped into the
driver's seat. He turned his headlights east out of Lake Charles and
hit the gas.</TE>
<TE>   His flight was fleeting: Police lights flashed behind him 20 miles
out of town. "I thought I had it made," he told the deputies as he
climbed from behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   They clapped handcuffs on his wrists. They drove him back to Lake
Charles. In the woods and over the town, the rain kept coming down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of Guilt to Go Around</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Boyd has been around about as long as anybody. At 73, the
longtime deputy sheriff still cruises the streets with a gun at his
hip and a worn black Bible at his right hand. He manned the
roadblocks the night of the Rideau robbery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good little town back then. Ever'body did their job," he
says in his thick, slow swamp tongue. "The prosecutors, the law
enforcement. Everybody did what they were supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   He chews on the silence, remembering.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't have to worry about lynching," he finally says.
"Because they lynched 'em for you."</TE>
<TE>   The night he was arrested, Rideau was sneaked through the back
door of the courthouse to avoid a white mob out front, according to
court testimony and the memory of local blacks. Asked about the
story, Boyd is uncharacteristically muddled. "I ah--I dunno. I think
I remember somethin'," he mutters. "I wasn't there though."</TE>
<TE>   One black man sat on the grand jury that indicted Rideau. He
wasn't tapped by accident--he had a job raking leaves and cutting
grass for the jury commissioner. Otherwise, the jury was white from
end to end. The commission had tampered with the race cards to make
sure of it.</TE>
<TE>   The attempt at convicting Rideau with color rather than law sprang
from the customs of the day. But like so many other aspects of this
epic case, time eventually rendered it self-defeating. Years later,
Rideau would use evidence of the long-forgotten maneuvers as a potent
legal weapon. The race manipulations are a profound vexation to the
current district attorney, who grumbles that he could have coaxed a
death sentence from even the most politicized black jury.</TE>
<TE>   It was Louisiana against Wilbert Rideau, and in 1961 neither man
nor state could claim innocence. This was a dank, shadowy land
governed by Jimmie Davis, a sharecropper's son and folk songster.
Davis swaggered through Hollywood movies, penned "You Are My
Sunshine"--and lost a ferocious battle to stave off the civil rights
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Scowling whites stood in the aisles of New Orleans trolleys that
year to avoid sitting alongside blacks. When integration hit the
schools, white supremacists ran riot in the streets, red-faced and
ranting. Truant white kids stalked, pounced upon and beat up blacks
in the alleys.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau stood trial the year the Freedom Riders streamed south from
Washington in hopes of reaching New Orleans. They were beaten in
Birmingham and Montgomery and ended up jailed in Jackson. It would be
awhile before the Freedom buses rolled into Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   When Rideau came to court, the state announced there would be no
record of the trial--not unless he could scrape together enough money
for a transcript. He couldn't. In jury selection, Rideau's lawyers
spent their strikes eliminating people such as a would-be juror who
proclaimed, "A darky killed my dad in 1931."</TE>
<TE>   A cousin of the slain teller Julia Ferguson made it onto the jury.
So did a friend of her brother, two deputy sheriffs and a fellow who
did printing jobs for the prosecutor. Three of the panelists had seen
Rideau's filmed confession on the evening news. A close buddy of the
wounded bank manager told the judge he wasn't too sure he could be
objective--and wound up on the jury anyway. All were men, and every
one white.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-day trial in a thronged courtroom, Rideau was
sentenced to die. His protests reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which
overturned the conviction and lambasted Lake Charles for its
"kangaroo court."</TE>
<TE>   He received a new trial in Baton Rouge, but it wasn't much better.
A member of the white supremacist Citizens' Council huddled with the
prosecution. Prospective jurors who admitted squeamishness over the
death penalty were sent home. It took the panel 15 minutes to hand
Rideau his second death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   He appealed again, and a state court agreed that jurors had been
improperly dismissed. So Rideau stood a third trial. It took another
all-white, all-male jury eight minutes to dole out yet another death
sentence. This time, his appeals were in vain. His lawyers said there
was nothing to be done.</TE>
<TE>   They were wrong, but Rideau didn't know it. Months turned into
years, which stretched into decades. Four times, pardon boards
recommended his release. Each time, a governor ignored the
suggestion, and Rideau stayed behind bars. "If I reacted solely on my
personal beliefs, I would sign the pardon," Gov. Edwin W. Edwards
said at a 1986 news conference. "I believe he has been
rehabilitated."</TE>
<TE>   But there was more than belief at stake. Edwards eventually
acknowledged a promise: He had vowed to a traumatized, terrified Dora
McCain that as long as she lived, and as long as he had any say,
Rideau would be locked away.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way 1961 rolled into 2002. Yesterday is the millstone
of every criminal. Awkward history is the great dilemma of the modern
South. Maybe that's why the Rideau case rankles so painfully in Lake
Charles: Because every time Rideau stands to be judged, he takes
Louisiana along with him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Highway Changes All</TE>
<TE>   On a steamy afternoon, the aging Deputy Boyd chases the ghosts of
a bank robbery down the old road to English Bayou. "He took 'em right
down here," he says. The patrol car bumps past a Holiday Inn, gas
stations and black tar parking lots, vast and empty in the heat of
day. "None of this was here then," he mutters. The old dance hall is
shut down. Houses have plugged the vacant lots. There are neon signs
and billboards. Only the sky is the same, full of nothing but light.</TE>
<TE>   He is almost there.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see it you're not gonna know how it was," he says,
wrapping his thick fingers around the wheel. "It don't look the way
it did."</TE>
<TE>   Decades back, Boyd and his brother drove into Texas, came home
with a few tallow trees and planted them in the dirt of Lake Charles.
Today he tells that story like a confession, glancing into the groves
of shadow and green. It is not a thing he likes to admit. The tallows
have spread like dandelions, have choked the swamps. Once they got
hold, nobody could chop them down fast enough. The roots were too
strong. "They just took right over," he says. "Took this country by
storm."</TE>
<TE>   Out in the shadow of Interstate 10, Deputy Boyd swings his car in
a loop and comes to rest alongside the bayou. "Right here he shot
those people."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one years later, there are only birds and the scream of
speeding cars. Boyd shakes his jowls. In 1961, Interstate 10 was a
slow tide of wet pavement, rolling along to smother fields and uproot
neighborhoods. The ribbon of tar would stretch from Florida to
California and would bind New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles
into a petrochemical crescent.</TE>
<TE>   It would unleash white flight, destroy black neighborhoods and
nourish the vast refineries with a stream of cargo trucks and
out-of-state workers. But in 1961, it was just a suggestion. "They
were just building it then," Boyd says. "Funny how a little old super
interstate can come through town and change everything up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Bridge Between Eras</TE>
<TE>   These days, Rideau's arrest would be deemed unconstitutional--in
1961, police weren't required to read suspects their Miranda rights.
He was prosecuted under an outmoded legal code. Back then, it was
murder or manslaughter. Now, Louisiana classifies murders by first,
second and third degree. Heading into trial, prosecutor Rick Bryant
didn't know whether he was supposed to follow the antiquated court
rules, or the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a dinosaur from a different age," Rideau likes to say.
"Here I am today being judged, and really I belong to another time."</TE>
<TE>   The last of the survivors, Dora McCain, is a frail 69-year-old who
underwent open-heart surgery last year. Twelve of the witnesses are
dead, including Jay Hickman, the bank manager. So is tough old Frank
Salter, the longtime prosecutor who became McCain's lawyer and
dedicated his career to keeping Rideau behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   The crime scene photographs are lost, along with trial records.
Nobody knows what happened to the car, clothing, fingerprints or
blood evidence. The knife that slit Ferguson's throat is nowhere to
be found.</TE>
<TE>   The state caught a lucky break when an office worker stumbled
across a dusty box of defunct discs in a courthouse closet. It turned
out they were stenographer's notes from Rideau's third trial. The box
was shipped off to FBI laboratories in Virginia, and some of the
30-year-old testimony of dead witnesses was raised up from the
crumbling records.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I wasn't even fooling with a 41-year-old murder case," the
district attorney sighs today. "It's a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Restless Youth</TE>
<TE>   Rideau was born Friday the 13th of February 1942, the oldest of
five children in a Catholic family. His father, a sometime janitor
and construction worker, eventually split from Rideau's mother. "An
excellent pupil but restless and inclined to be rude," reads the
script below a field of Bs on Rideau's eighth-grade report card. "Can
be probably attributed to home life."</TE>
<TE>   The next fall, he failed algebra, science, music and English. Then
he stopped going to class. Rideau was 16 when he was locked up for
the first time. The police had wanted to question his younger brother
about a robbery, and Rideau refused to help track him down. He landed
in reform school for five months. "It messed my head up for a while,"
he says now. "Kids can't cope with time."</TE>
<TE>   When he got out, Rideau stocked shelves and swept floors at
Halpern's fabric shop. Just about every day, he'd stroll two doors
down to Gulf National to make change for his boss. On sticky
afternoons, the tellers gave him a little money and sent him out for
Cokes.</TE>
<TE>   But Rideau grew uppity, Dora McCain told a jury. He started
calling the white bankers by their first names. They responded with
the brutal etiquette of the South. They bought a refrigerator,
stocked it with soda pop and stopped asking Rideau for favors.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau kept hanging around anyway, kept watching the currency
being counted and stacked, tied and locked away. "I saw all that
money and I thought I could get it," he said in an affidavit. A court
psychiatrist concluded Rideau was obsessed with money. The afternoon
he decided to rob a bank, he was a 19-year-old dropout with a
.22-caliber pistol, a $2 hunting knife and nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   In the edgy darkness of the stolen car, Rideau told his hostages
he wanted a plastic surgeon to fix up his face so he couldn't be
recognized, Dora McCain testified. He'd come home to Lake Charles,
but nobody would know him.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he became Condemned No. 18. Intent on leaving something
behind when he marched off to the electric chair, he penned a
longhand study in criminal psychology. He read. He waited to die.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the death penalty was abolished, and Rideau took his
place among hundreds of lifers in Angola. Those were rough days in
the pen--they called it the Farm, and Louisiana mothers shuddered to
think of it. A squalid, segregated gangland, it was dubbed the
bloodiest prison in America.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau tried for a job at the Angolite, the prison magazine, but
the all-white staff turned him away. So he gathered a handful of
black inmates and founded the Lifer, a gritty underground newspaper.
After a handful of issues, the prison stamped it out.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Angola was ordered to desegregate, and the warden asked
Rideau to take charge of the Angolite. He marched into its offices
flanked by a band of blacks, "in case there was trouble," he says
now.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I'm going to be the editor,' " he remembers informing the
staff. "They gave it to me."</TE>
<TE>   It was the beginning of a 26-year reign.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed like this colossal waste to sit there and do
nothing. If you've got a shred of decency, you want to redeem
yourself and redeem your station in life," Rideau says now. "Prison
is the only institution in the world dedicated to making people
suffer, and if you can bring a little light to it--that's the way I
saw myself."</TE>
<TE>   He put in 14 hours a day and fell asleep thinking about his
stories. He sat with condemned men in the hours before execution, and
he asked them whether they'd ever been in love. He wrote about the
prisoner who fed birds from his wheelchair, about Vietnam veterans
behind bars and about a blind man who fumbled through the corridors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not so much great writers as we have a unique vantage
point," Rideau says. "We don't want it, but it's there. You either
use it or you throw it away."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote "Conversations with the Dead," an investigation that
showed inmates had been lost in the vast prison system. Men went free
because of that story. In the late 1970s, Rideau collaborated with
another inmate on "Prison: The Sexual Jungle," a meditation on rape
behind bars. "I got everybody," Rideau says. "I got the people who
were involved, even the guys who did it. I got them to talk about
it."</TE>
<TE>   That story won a George Polk award and made Rideau a finalist in
the National Magazine Awards. "The prison bosses went up to New York
[for the awards ceremony], and they were really freaked out," Rideau
says. "It was a vindication that they were doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   His journalism is rooted in compassion, but in six months of
telephone and jailhouse interviews, Rideau refuses to express remorse
for the people who died or suffered at his hands. One day, this
observation is put to him: There are convicts who proclaim their
innocence, but still say they're sorry, in an abstract sense, that
somebody was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I--" Rideau trails off, then tries again. "Look, I--" He
pauses. "I am what--" He takes a breath, then: "What you said."</TE>
<TE>   "The victim has pretty much dictated what's happened to me," he
says another day. "Yeah, there was a victim on that side, but there's
one on this side too."</TE>
<TE>   The mechanical voice of an automated telephone operator
interrupts: "This call will be terminated in one minute."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God," Rideau says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'We Have to Pray'</TE>
<TE>   Since Rideau's first conviction, nearly 700 murderers have been
granted clemency by Louisiana governors. None of them did as much
time as Rideau. He's been locked up longer than any criminal in
Calcasieu Parish history.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors hate that statistic. They believe it's misleading.
Some of those convicts were put to death, they point out.</TE>
<TE>   But Rideau's judicial history is so messy that even Bryant, the
prosecutor fighting to keep him in prison, will admit that the
longtime inmate hasn't gotten equal treatment. "His argument has
merit as far as the other people getting out," he says. "But they
shouldn't have gotten out, either. I don't give a damn about
rehabilitation. It's irrelevant in these types of crimes."</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, a federal appeals court, citing the race-tainted
indictment, ordered the state to give Rideau a new trial or set him
free. Louisiana could have decided that enough was finally enough. It
was up to Bryant--but to him, it wasn't even a question. The district
attorney flushes when he hears complaints of prejudice, vendetta or
inequality. He believes confessed killers forfeit their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau should count himself lucky, the district attorney says. The
death penalty has been reinstated in Louisiana and elsewhere, but
Bryant will not ask for Rideau's execution. He does not think it
"proper"--or that he could win the death penalty for a 60-year-old
man.</TE>
<TE>   This killer should stay in prison until he dies, Bryant says. "If
we don't retry him, it's like this crime never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Until that night in 1961, Jan Cater had never seen her daddy look
that way. "We have to pray," he said, hanging up the phone with his
big butcher's hands. His sister, Julia Ferguson, had been taken
hostage in a bank robbery. "They can't find them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The voices fell quiet in the kitchen. Rain slapped the roof. It
wouldn't be long before Julia Ferguson's father would die. "It was
just too much," Cater says now. Ferguson's two brothers were gone
within three years--their hearts gave out young. Cater's father was
47 when he died.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, honey," Cater murmurs now. "Oh, honey."</TE>
<TE>   Dora McCain has carried chunks of bullet in her neck for decades.
People say she never has recovered, not all the way. The prosecutors
claim she is haunted by Rideau's words: "You'd better be dead." They
say she is heavy with guilt because she couldn't save Julia Ferguson.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of testimony, neither she nor her family has talked
publicly about the robbery. McCain broke her lifelong silence just
once, a few years ago. Rideau was up for an Oscar in documentary
filmmaking for a movie he shot about life at Angola, and an enraged
Dora McCain gave an interview to a British reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe he has manipulated all those people in Hollywood," she
told the Mail on Sunday. "They should remember it's very hard to know
what's going on in Wilbert's head. I thought I knew him when he
worked at the fabric shop.... I was fooled." The story ran under the
headline "How the Oscars Are Making a Hero Out of This Vicious
Woman-Killer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rideau Attracts Support</TE>
<TE>   After the bank robbery, black parents didn't let their children
play outside for days--that's what Lawrence Morrow remembers. Fear
gnawed at neighborhoods as far away as Vinton, where Morrow grew up.
He recalls that whites cruised the streets to holler curses. He
remembers that his grammar school was besieged by bomb threats, and
that a year or so later somebody followed through--half the building
was blown to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow grew up to be a no-nonsense publisher with opinions harder
than oak: He believes blacks ought to get their news from other
blacks--that's why he puts out Gumbeaux Magazine. He believes white
power is intact, even if the whites have grown more subdued since the
bad old days. And he believes, with a crystal outrage, that Wilbert
Rideau should go free.</TE>
<TE>   "The white community has a pact with the government," Morrow says.
"They're all working together" against Rideau.</TE>
<TE>   George Kendall, a New York NAACP lawyer who represents Rideau,
thinks the new trial is unconstitutional. He thinks it's spiteful. He
thinks it's the district attorney's bid to boost his popularity.
Mostly, he thinks it's a case of Louisiana pummeling a man who
already has done his time.</TE>
<TE>   It's "cavalier," Kendall says, to "try a 40-year-old case.... The
state has had three bites out of the apple already. It's like, how
many chances does the state get?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Make This Mean Something'</TE>
<TE>   When Rideau finally made it home last summer, he came as an
improbable prodigal, shackled hand and foot in a prison van. He ended
up right back where he began, in the Calcasieu Parish jail. He turned
60 this year. His mustache is graying; the skin of his face has lost
its starch.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the jail, a chain fence rings the grim box of dormitories,
curling inward like a fist about to close. Rideau passes his days
among gangly gangsters, street corner hustlers and unlucky drunks.
These men are younger. They call him Mister, and he puzzles over
their slang.</TE>
<TE>   In conversations with Rideau, there are popular topics: Civil
rights. The advancement of blacks in all arenas. The manifold
weaknesses of the criminal justice system. The "whole unholy force"
of Lake Charles.</TE>
<TE>   But there also are forbidden themes.</TE>
<TE>   His childhood? "I rarely think about the past."</TE>
<TE>   The crime? "They don't want me to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   His family? "You leave them alone. They got nothing to do with
it."</TE>
<TE>   As a journalist, Rideau has a firm opinion of how he ought to come
across in print. "I'm sort of a martyr," he says one day. "I'm a
wonderful person," he says another day, "a great guy." One afternoon,
he begins, "Not to sound too egotistical--" then stops himself. "Aw,
never mind, it'll come out wrong no matter how I say it."</TE>
<TE>   When he calls collect from the jailhouse, he opens each interview
with an interrogation. "I just want to know where you're going with
this," he says. "What's your agenda?"</TE>
<TE>   During a Sunday night jailhouse visit, Rideau leans in close to
the glass.</TE>
<TE>   "Make this mean something," he says. "Make it mean something for
me, or make it mean something for the other side. Don't just walk
away and say, 'Hey, another story.' "</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't blink.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to just be another story."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These days, his talk runs to new themes. He talks about God and
about his mother. He talks about death.</TE>
<TE>   He took a hit this summer, when a black judge was removed from the
case. It turned out Wilford Carter had lobbied for Rideau's release
more than a decade back, when he was in the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Rideau's file was handed over to Patricia Minaldi, a conservative,
white judge and former prosecutor who used to work for Bryant. "She's
part of that whole little clique," Rideau says ominously.</TE>
<TE>   "They wished evil upon me, but they don't recognize who they're
dealing with," he says. "These people got to understand that I got
God on my side."</TE>
<TE>   He's talking fast now, pouring the words out in a rush. Soon, the
operator will break in. Rideau is running out of time.</TE>
<TE>   "And you know," he says, "I know it's going to be all right."</TE>
<TE>   He has a judgment day coming. And Wilbert Rideau has nothing to
lose.</TE>

<HD>Zito Stops Twins for His 20th Win</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Zito became the American League's first 20-game winner, giving
up three hits in seven innings as the Oakland Athletics beat the
Minnesota Twins, 6-0, Sunday night in Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Tejada and Adam Piatt homered for the A's, who won for the
22nd time in 23 games and maintained a two-game lead over the Angels
in the AL West.</LD>
<LD>   They open a four-game series against the Angels tonight at Edison
Field, with Tim Hudson pitching against Kevin Appier.</LD>
<TE>   Zito (20-5) struck out seven and walked two, securing the first
20-win season of his career and boosting his chances for the Cy Young
Award. Jim Mecir and Ricardo Rincon finished the three-hitter.
Oakland leads the majors with 17 shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   With the A's leading, 3-0, Minnesota had its best chance to score
in the fourth with two on and one out. But Zito struck out Torii
Hunter and Bobby Kielty to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Zito improved to 44-17 in his three-year career, the best winning
percentage (.721) in modern major league history with a minimum of 50
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 16, Kansas City 9--John Olerud hit a three-run homer in
the 11th inning and Ben Davis belted a grand slam at Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners, who have won three in a row for the first time since
July 29-Aug. 3, remained four games behind the Angels in the AL
wild-card race. They scored eight times in the 11th inning after
blowing a three-run lead in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Desi Relaford, who had four hits, singled with one out in the
11th. Edgar Martinez walked before Olerud's shot to right-center
against Blake Stein (0-4).</TE>
<TE>   After Davis homered, Mike Cameron homered to make it 16-8. The
Royals have lost 12 of their last 13 home games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Texas 3--The Rangers set a major league-record by
homering in their 26th consecutive game when Rafael Palmeiro hit a
solo shot in the sixth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro's 39th homer this season and 486th of his career came on
a 1-and-1 pitch from Wilson Alvarez. Alex Rodriguez hit his major
league-leading 51st homer, against Esteban Yan in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The 1941 New York Yankees, 1994 Detroit Tigers and 1998 Atlanta
Braves homered in 25 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers hit homers in 21 consecutive games this season from
June 24-July 18. They are the only team to have two streaks of 20
games or more in a season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Detroit 4--The Yankees reduced their magic number for
clinching the AL East to 12 thanks to Rondell White's three-run homer
in the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   White entered the game with only one hit in 26 at-bats .</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stanton (7-1) got the win and Steve Karsay got two out for
his 10th save.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with Boston's 9-4 loss to Toronto, the Yankees moved
closer to winning their fifth consecutive division title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 9, Boston 4--Esteban Loaiza (8-8) pitched seven solid
innings at Boston to win for the fourth time in six starts. He gave
up three runs and nine hits.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Delgado scored four runs and Chris Woodward had three hits,
including two doubles, and three runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Cleveland 6--Frank Thomas hit a game-tying three-run
homer in the ninth and Joe Crede had a game-winning single at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Danys Baez (10-11) couldn't protect a three-run lead and
blew his first save this season.</TE>

<HD>Glaus Coming Through Again</HD>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The mighty slugger arose from his slumber Sunday, just in time for
the final three weeks of the season. Third baseman Troy Glaus, whose
raw power makes him the one Angel who can carry a team for a week or
two, hit two home runs in a 6-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.</LD>
<LD>   Glaus, who hit 41 homers last year and led the American League
with 47 two years ago, has 24 this year. He had not homered twice in
a game since the first week of the season, but he drove his two shots
a combined 822 feet. Power hitters are notoriously streaky, and the
Angels hope that Glaus started a hot streak Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a clutch performer," closer Troy Percival said. "We really
needed him today. If he can get hot the next couple weeks, that could
carry us through."</LD>
<TE>   Glaus went hitless in his first 18 at-bats on the trip before
homering in his last two Sunday. Still, he drove in six runs in the
six games--four on the homers, one on a sacrifice fly, one on a
bases-loaded walk. Look beyond his .246 average, and he ranks second
on the team in runs scored (87) and runs batted in (95), with a .294
average with runners in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels extended their winning streak to 10 games Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody on our team but Troy has been awful hot,"
pitcher Jarrod Washburn said. "Now maybe he can pick us up. We can't
expect guys to stay on fire forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody our clubhouse was worrying about him being
in a slump the rest of the year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pote stood on the mound Friday as his manager headed out for a
visit. Pote had a no-hitter going for triple-A Salt Lake, with one
out in the eighth inning and the Stingers needing one victory to
advance to the Pacific Coast League championship series. He had just
walked a batter, putting the tying run on base. He had struck out 11
and thrown 106 pitches, more than enough for a guy who spent most of
the season in the Angel bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just getting a little tired," Pote said. "In the regular
season, I would have stayed in there, but these were the playoffs. I
wanted to be honest."</TE>
<TE>   So, when Manager Mike Brumley suggested he depart with the
no-hitter intact, Pote readily agreed. Relievers Bart Miadich and
Francisco Rodriguez completed the 1-0 victory--a one-hitter, as
Rodriguez gave up a single in the ninth inning--and the Stingers open
the PCL finals Tuesday against Edmonton, a Minnesota Twin affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Even the no-hit night might not get Pote a return ticket to
Anaheim this season. Despite a 3.23 earned-run average, the Angels
demoted him July 26. They already have 13 pitchers on their roster,
plus the rehabilitating Aaron Sele, and aren't sure whether to recall
any more when the PCL playoffs end.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles sell their version of the rally monkey for $18--the
regular stuffed monkey, with long monkey arms and long monkey legs
and a long monkey torso, but with an oriole's head and bill. The
oriole is a proud bird, and the cross-breeding of a stuffed monkey
and a stuffed bird looks ridiculous. For shame.</TE>

<HD>White Sox Decide That Clayton Is Expendable</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago White Sox put shortstop Royce Clayton on waivers Sunday
for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release.</LD>
<LD>   Clayton was acquired in a trade from Texas on Dec. 14, 2000. He
batted .251 with seven homers and 35 runs batted in this season.</LD>
<LD>   He has appeared in only six of 25 games since Aug. 10. With only
three weeks left in the season, Clayton is hoping he can help another
club.</LD>
<TE>   "It was for the best. I wasn't playing here," Clayton said. "There
are a couple of weeks left. Maybe I could help somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Pirates have released right-handed reliever Sean
Lowe, who got one out in an 11-1 loss to the Florida Marlins on
Sunday, giving up two hits and a run, and allowing two inherited
runners to score.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe was 4-2 with a 5.35 earned-run average in 43 games this
season, including one start.</TE>
<TE>   He was released even though roster space is not an issue in
September and the Pirates are still obligated to pay all of his
$950,000 contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at the number of guys we have and the number of games we
have left, I just didn't see many opportunities for him to pitch the
rest of the way," General Manager Dave Littlefield said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Harwell jogged to the mound at Yankee Stadium, threw out the
first ball and shook Roger Clemens' hand.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after getting a nice gift from New York Yankee Manager Joe
Torre, Harwell hurried off the field. The 84-year-old Hall of Fame
announcer went to the broadcast booth.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell, the "Voice of the Tigers" for 42 of the last 43 years, is
retiring after this season and he was honored before his final game
at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of great games and a lot of great players here,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Tracy Trying to Remain on Even Keel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers. The Giants. A playoff race.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't get much better than that.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what we went to Vero Beach in February for," Manager Jim
Tracy said, "for the opportunity to be involved where we are at this
juncture of the season. By the time we get there, there'll be 20
games left. This is what it's all about."</LD>
<TE>   But Tracy cautioned against looking at the teams' three-game
series, which begins tonight in San Francisco, as the only important
series left.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep talking about the Giants as if that's all we're looking
at right now," he said Sunday. "There's a lot that can happen. The
Diamondbacks can't just sit back and say, 'We'll just coast to the
finish line,' because if they do, we've seen stranger things happen,
where the team that decides to try to coast to the finish line ends
up getting passed by two clubs that are right on top of them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy is asked every day about Kevin Brown's status, and every day
he appears a bit more exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   But even before Kazuhisa Ishii was hit in the head by a line drive
and suffered a skull fracture Sunday, Ishii's struggles and Andy
Ashby's inconsistency made it logical to ask if Brown will return to
the starting rotation during the final weeks of the season or in the
playoffs. Tracy remained noncommittal about Brown, saying he's doing
"OK" in varied relief roles.</TE>
<TE>   "If I know he's not right, and the fact it's still three weeks
away, means I don't spend a lot of time worrying about it," Tracy
said. "We've got to get [to the playoffs] first. We're still striving
to get there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers are the wild-card team, they will host Games 3 and
4 of the division series at Dodger Stadium Oct. 5 and Oct. 6. If they
win the NL West, they will host Games 1 and 2 and, if necessary, Game
5, on Oct. 1, Oct. 3 and Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets will go on sale Saturday. Gates will open at Dodger
Stadium at 7 a.m., and fans will get a numbered wristband in Lot 10
at 7:30 a.m. A lottery will determine the order of the ticket line.
Tickets can also be purchased by calling (323) 224-1448, or through
www.dodgers.com. Individual ticket prices will start at $10--but the
Dodgers didn't say where those prices end.</TE>

<HD>Dollase Is King of the Road</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer keeps low profile at Del Mar, but
Good Journey's win in Canada adds to success at other tracks.</DH>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Wally Dollase's horses have been virtually nonexistent at Del Mar--a
rare starter, Bare Necessities, ran third on Sunday's undercard--but
on the road the Hollywood Park-based trainer has been racking up some
important wins.</LD>
<LD>   Dollase worked Good Journey a fast five furlongs on dirt at
Hollywood Park on Aug. 26, gave the 6-year-old another five on
Woodbine's grass last Tuesday, and Sunday they combined with jockey
Pat Day to win the $1-million Atto Mile, Canada's richest race.</LD>
<LD>   The Woodbine grass race was Good Journey's fourth consecutive win,
a streak that started with the Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park in
November. Good Journey's next two wins came at Churchill Downs, the
most recent in the Firecracker Handicap on July 4.</LD>
<TE>   "This horse runs good fresh," said Dollase, explaining the
three-month layoff. "There was no mile race to run him in between
[the Firecracker] and this one, so I figured, what the heck, let's
just train him up to this."</TE>
<TE>   The second choice behind the 5-2 Noverre, one of Europe's best
milers, Good Journey finished the course in 1:33 1/5 to win by one
length and pay $8.40. Noverre finished sixth in the 13-horse field as
the filly Chopinina, at 55-1, ran second and Nuclear Debate, a
shipper from Del Mar, was third at 16-1 in his first start beyond 6
1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Good Journey is owned by a partnership that includes Mike Jarvis,
Gary Margolis and Flaxman Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I could pass the filly [Chopinina] at any time," said
Day, who thought he had won the same race in 1999 with Hawksley Hill,
but was disqualified by the stewards in favor of Quiet Resolve, who
was no factor in Sunday's running.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Vienna, who trains Nuclear Debate, started the 19-10
second choice, Janet, in Sunday's $150,000 Palomar Handicap at Del
Mar, and after difficulty loading, the 5-year-old mare contended
early before finishing sixth. Voodoo Dancer, the New York shipper and
6-5 favorite, won the Palomar by two lengths over the 23-1 I'm The
Business, with Skywriting finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   Voodoo Dancer, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, made her first start at
Del Mar since running fourth in the Del Mar Oaks last year. Sunday's
win, her ninth in 15 starts, came in 1:41 2/5 for 1 1/16 miles on
grass.</TE>
<TE>   "This filly put me in a nice spot at a critical moment on the
first bend," Desormeaux said of Voodoo Dancer, who overtook
Skywriting in mid-stretch.</TE>
<TE>   In another Del Mar stake, the $82,050 Torrey Pines for 3-year-old
fillies, Habibti, last year's Del Mar Debutante winner, made her
first start in four months and finished fifth at 3-5 as Got Koko, a
Texas-bred ridden by Alex Solis for trainer Bruce Headley, won by 1
1/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atoning for a loss in Sacramento two weeks ago, Black Ruby beat
her frequent nemesis, Taz, by about two lengths at Del Mar in a
$10,000, non-betting race between the mule breed's top two
performers. Officially, the win was the 48th in 55 starts for the
10-year-old Black Ruby, who unofficially--counting races that don't
appear on her record--has earned more than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Time for the 400 yards was 23 1/5 seconds. There will be a
rematch, with betting, Saturday at Fairplex Park in Pomona, where the
Los Angeles County Fair meet opens Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zippy Chippy, the winless 11-year-old gelding, lost his 95th race,
finishing fourth, 15 lengths behind the winner, Mr. Peanut, in a
$3,100 maiden race at the Northampton Fair in Massachusetts. Zippy
Chippy, who went off at 9-1 in a seven-horse field, earned $185....
When Good Journey runs in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Arlington Park on
Aug. 26, he'll have to beat Rock Of Gibraltar, who's won 10 of 11
starts after a half-length win over Banks Hill, last year's Breeders'
Cup Filly &amp; Mare winner, in the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp in Paris.
Rock Of Gibraltar is expected to run one more time, in England,
before the Breeders' Cup.</TE>

<HD>Kicking Up a Storm</HD>
<DH>Football: Converted soccer goalie Aguayo becomes a star at
San Jacinto with his booming field goals and kickoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sergio Aguayo knew as little about kicking a football as he did about
the sport itself. Yet he took a few strides and booted the ball so
far through the uprights that the 37-yard field goal would have been
good from about 60 yards.</LD>
<LD>   The pleased sophomore then scurried toward the sideline after his
first high school kick, yelling, "Hey, coach, can I kick it from that
spot every time?"</LD>
<LD>   The coach could only smile and shake his head at his kicker's
naivete--and his own good fortune.</LD>
<TE>   "He was so oblivious to football," San Jacinto High Coach Bill
Powell recalled nearly two years later. "But right then and there you
knew he had the makeup to be a great kicker."</TE>
<TE>   How great? Former UCLA All-American Chris Sailer ranks Aguayo in
the top three of the more than 100 high school kickers he has
evaluated over the last year or so.</TE>
<TE>   The converted soccer goalie was selected an all-state small
schools kicker last year after a junior season in which he made a
50-yard field goal that cleared the top of the goalposts in a playoff
victory over Bishop Union.</TE>
<TE>   That kick has become the signature one for the throng of college
recruiters pursuing Aguayo heading into his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   Powell thinks his star kicker, already perhaps the biggest draw in
the tiny desert community, could command $2 a head just to let people
watch him warm up before Tiger games.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans see him come out on the field and start screaming his
name," Powell said. "He's doing his kickoffs and he'll boom a couple
of 65-yarders warming up. It gets our crowd ready for our games."</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much talk about the 6-foot-1, 175-pound Aguayo, whom
Sailer likes to call "Gumby," before his sophomore year. He was a
dedicated soccer player who had never kicked a football, even while
messing around.</TE>
<TE>   Then his soccer coach told Powell about the boy's mind-boggling
leg strength. Powell watched him kick a football once and was sold;
Aguayo was put on the varsity team as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Houston, San Jacinto's kicking coach, immediately begin
teaching Aguayo the mechanics of kicking a football as opposed to a
soccer ball, though he continued to play soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Houston taught me right and wrong," Aguayo said. "From
there I moved up and just made the transition."</TE>
<TE>   Aguayo steadily improved to the point where, last season, he
converted 11 of 16 field-goal attempts, including a 51-yarder, with
the majority of his misses coming from beyond 50 yards. More
impressive was the fact that 94% of his kickoffs went for touchbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team starts at the 20 and has to go 80 yards against us,"
Powell said. "That's where he becomes a big weapon for us."</TE>
<TE>   Aguayo honed his skills even further after last season by
attending two of Sailer's kicking camps at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
High and another camp at the University of Colorado. He also awoke
early on many occasions to practice on his own at the San Jacinto
field, a short walk from his house.</TE>
<TE>   Powell anticipates that Aguayo, who kicks left-footed, will be
even more of a weapon this season for an offense that returns only
one starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to put him out there in a lot of situations a lot of
kickers won't be in," Powell said. "Anything from 60 [yards] and in,
we're going to put him out there this year."</TE>
<TE>   But does Aguayo's success come at a price? Powell, who has guided
San Jacinto to the playoffs in each of his four seasons, worries
sometimes that the expectations may pose too great of a burden for a
17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans see Sergio warming up and kicking them from 60 yards,
and they think every time he goes out there and tries a 55-,
60-yarder, he should make it," Powell said. "NFL guys don't do that.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands that I don't expect that from him."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Aguayo said he relishes the chance to make his mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it because my friends can get more exposure also," he
said. "I just like to see everybody happy."</TE>

<KH>FALL PREVIEW: GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY</KH>
<HD>Depth Charge</HD>
<DH>New coach inherits talent, expectations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His coaching resume is relatively skimpy, but Andy Sims feels right
at home in his first year at the helm of the nationally ranked girls'
cross-country team at Dana Point Dana Hills High.</LD>
<LD>   Sims, 36, set a Dana Hills record of 1 minute 51.42 seconds in the
800 meters while finishing third in the 1984 state track and field
championships. But he had not coached cross-country until last year,
when he was an assistant under longtime Dana Hills boys' coach Tim
Butler.</LD>
<LD>   "When I graduated from college, I had no intention of ever being a
teacher or a coach," said Sims, who ran 1:50.00 in the 800 for UCLA.
"But teaching and coaching have become two things that I'm into."</LD>
<TE>   Sims entered the advertising field after graduating from UCLA with
an economics degree, but soon was teaching social studies at Van Nuys
Montclair Prep. He taught at the small private school for 10 years,
but jumped at the opportunity last year to return to his alma mater
as a teacher and coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely came back here with the idea that I would coach,"
said Sims, who was offered the job after Beth Niednagel stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   Sims, who has three assistant coaches, inherited an immensely
talented team. The Dolphins are ranked fourth in Harrier magazine's
national preseason poll and return their top seven runners from last
year's squad that won the Southern Section Division I title and
finished second in the state championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call it a curse, but I would definitely call it a
double-edged sword," Sims said about taking over the team.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure is there because people out there are expecting big
things of you. But you have to always keep your perspective and
realize that these are high school-age girls you're dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Shaun Yourd was Dana Hills' top runner in the state
championships last year with an 18th-place finish. But Sims lists
junior Monika Rothenburger and senior Tarrah Crowley as his top
runners right now.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenburger, Dana Hills' No. 2 finisher in the state meet last
year, ran a team-leading 5:05.85 in the 1,600 during track season.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley was the Dolphins' No. 4 runner in the state championships,
despite battling injuries for much of the season. Seniors Emilie
Branham and Stephanie Eckl and sophomore Marijke Van Pelt placed
49th, 57th and 55th, respectively, in the state championships. But
they aren't guaranteed one of the seven spots on the varsity team
this year because Dana Hills has so much depth.</TE>
<TE>   "There's two or three others you could put out there right now and
they could contend for a top-seven position," Sims said. "It's just a
very balanced team."</TE>
<TE>   That balance has made Dana Hills a heavy favorite to win its first
Division I title when the state championships are held Nov. 30 at
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   But Sims isn't assuming anything, not after seeing Rolling Hills
Estates Peninsula upset Dana Hills, 150-158, in the Division I final
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the coaches nor the girls are in the mind-set that we can
take things for granted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning a state championship is seen as a goal and something that
is attainable, but it's not an expectation."</TE>

<LD>It seems hard to believe that high-profile trainer Wayne Lukas is
without a winner at Del Mar 41 days into the meet.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Lukas has barely been active this year at Del Mar.
Through Sunday, he had only four starters.</LD>
<LD>   On the second-to-last day of the meet, the Hall of Fame trainer
could pick up not one, but two victories.</LD>
<TE>   Downtime, a 2-year-old son of Favorite Trick, is a contender in
the fourth as he is entered in a maiden claimer for the first time
and Jury Box is the 7-2 second choice on Jeff Tufts' morning line in
the $100,000 I'm Smokin Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Downtime is the 5-2 favorite in the fourth, a $62,500 claimer at
six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   In the I'm Smokin, a six-furlong race for 2-year-olds bred in
California, Jury Box will be seeking his second win in six races.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Volkonsky, who beat maidens by 17 1/2 lengths
Aug. 24 at Saratoga, will make his turf debut in today's eighth at
Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Xtra Heat. The amazing 4-year-old filly won again
Saturday at Delaware Park and is 23 for 30 in her career.</TE>
<TE>   She may not run again until the Breeders' Cup Sprint on Oct. 26 at
Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Trainer Frances Henderson, who is based in Northern
California, is 0 for 36 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Vamos Nina and Bush
Triumph in the first, using Apalachian Thunder and Listen Indy in the
second and Ben Saw San, Unrelenting Grit and High Noon Meeting in the

<HD>Yugoslavia Rallies to Win World Title</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yugoslavia came back from an eight-point deficit in the final two
minutes and survived two key missed free throws by Vlade Divac to
beat Argentina, 84-77, in overtime Sunday in front of 17,079 in
Conseco Fieldhouse at Indianapolis to win the gold medal in the men's
basketball World Championships.</LD>
<LD>   The game ended with Argentina's players angrily pointing their
fingers and yelling at a Greek referee who failed to call a foul on
the final playof regulation.</LD>
<LD>   Dejan Bodiroga scored 27 points, including nine in a row late in
the fourth quarter when Yugoslavia rallied to tie the score, and Peja
Stojakovic had 26.</LD>
<TE>   Divac missed two free throws with 5.9 seconds left, leaving the
score tied, 75-75. Argentina rebounded and got the ball to Hugo
Sconochini, who drove to the basket and went down hard as he missed
the shot just before the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's coaches, players and trainers ran onto the court to
complain that a foul should have been called. Replays showed Marko
Jaric of Yugoslavia making contact with Sconochini.</TE>
<TE>   The referee, Nikos Pitsilkas, ejected a member of the Argentine
delegation a few seconds into overtime. Several players screamed and
gestured at the referee during the final few seconds of overtime,
then clapped their hands in mock applause as he left the court.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic made a three-point basket in the first possession of
overtime to put Yugoslavia ahead for good. Divac blocked shots on
Argentina's next two possessions and Bodiroga made two free throws
for an 80-75 lead with 2:16 left. Argentina scored two points the
rest of the way.</TE>

<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   Wheel to wheel with Al Unser Jr. for the last 22 laps, barely
ahead of a pursuing nine-car pack, Sam Hornish Jr. nosed ahead in the
last turn to win the Delphi Indy 300 at Joliet, Ill., in the closest
Indy car finish in history.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish won by 24 ten-thousandths of a second--about three inches.</TE>
<TE>   "The fastest way around is to push another car around, but it's
really hard to pass when you have to push a car aside," Hornish said.
"Having a guy that's experienced like Al and all the races I've been
in with him and all the respect I have for him, it's just like a
high-speed pace lap."</TE>
<TE>   Unser finished second. Buddy Lazier was third and Helio
Castroneves finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave Hornish the lead in the points race. He leads
Castroneves by 12 points with the series' final race Sunday at Texas
Motor Speedway.</TE>

<TE>   A stunning collapse by Neal Lancaster produced an equally
surprising winner in the Canadian Open at Markham, Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   John Rollins, already resigned to finishing second, got into a
three-way playoff when Lancaster made double bogey on the 72nd hole,
then ended it early by making a 20-foot birdie putt on the first
extra hole for his first PGA Tour victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be a tie for second, a great week,"
Rollins said after closing with a seven-under-par 65 and beating
Lancaster and Justin Leonard in the sudden-death playoff.</TE>
<TE>   With a two-stroke lead and his drive in the middle of the 18th
fairway, Lancaster pulled his approach into deep rough left of the
bunker, about 35 yards from the flag. His chip went into a valley,
nearly 40 feet from the cup.</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster needed two putts to win for the first time in eight
years and 265 tournaments. Instead, he suffered his first three-putt
of the week, missing the bogey putt from four feet.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam won her seventh LPGA Tour title this year and
ninth event overall, closing with a five-under 65 for a four-stroke
victory in the Williams Championship at Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   "This is shaping up to be my best season probably," said
Sorenstam, who won eight titles last year and has 39 victories in
nine seasons. She birdied four of the last six holes to easily hold
off Lorie Kane with an 11-under 199 total.</TE>
<TE>   She earned $150,000 to push her season total to $2,061,991 in 16
events. She set the tour record last year with $2,105,868, becoming
the first player in tour history to top $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder made a two-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole
to beat Tom Jenkins and win the Kroger Senior Classic at Maineville,
Ohio, giving him consecutive victories for the second time this year.
He won the SBC Senior Open and FleetBoston Classic in July and the
Allianz Championship last week.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins had 10 birdies during a course record 10-under 62 and was
the leader in the clubhouse at 16 under. Gilder had one bogey and
three birdies, including a birdie three at the par-four 17th. His
birdie attempt on No. 18 curled around the cup and left him tied with
Jenkins with a three-round total of 200.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder and Jenkins parred the first playoff hole, the par-five
18th. At the par-four 10th, Gilder hit his second shot within two
feet and Jenkins hit his approach to 10 feet. Jenkins' birdie try
slid a foot past the hole. Gilder rolled in his birdie putt.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves missed a chance to clinch their 11th straight
division title, losing to Bartolo Colon and the Montreal Expos, 7-0,
Sunday at Turner Field.</LD>
<LD>   Colon (8-3) pitched a four-hitter for seven innings to beat the
Braves for the third time since being acquired by the Expos in a June
27 trade with Cleveland. Tom Glavine (16-10) lasted six innings,
giving up eight hits and four runs as his losing streak stretched to
a season-high four games.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the loss, the Braves are set to earn a postseason berth
earlier than any other team in Atlanta history. In 1995, they
clinched the NL East on Sept. 13 with 15 games left in the season.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Chicago 1--Rookie Jason Simontacchi (10-5) beat Kerry
Wood (10-9) and the Cardinals completed a three-game sweep at St.
Louis. The NL Central leaders have won five in a row and 10 of 13 to
move a season-best 20 games above .500.</TE>
<TE>   Wood failed to beat the Cardinals for the fourth time this season,
yielding two runs and eight hits in seven innings. Simontacchi
pitched eight innings and gave up a run and four hits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 11, Philadelphia 3--Vance Wilson homered and drove in a
career-high four runs at Philadelphia as the Mets matched a season
high with their sixth straight victory. They started their streak
after setting an NL record with 15 consecutive losses at home and 17
of 20 overall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 11, Pittsburgh 1--Derrek Lee provided all the offense the
Marlins needed at Pittsburgh, hitting two doubles, a homer and
driving in four runs. Carl Pavano won for the first time since May 18
and Florida ended a five-game losing streak. The Marlins, who had
scored only three runs in 37 innings, broke a 1-1 tie with five runs
in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 9, Colorado 4--Ryan Klesko hit two home runs and drove

series at Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Milwaukee 4--Jimmy Haynes beat his former team for
the third time this season, yielding two runs and eight hits in 5 1/3

<HD>Giants Beat Diamondbacks Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds hit his 42nd homer, a 418-foot shot into McCovey Cove, to
lead the San Francisco Giants to a 3-1 victory Sunday over the
slumping Arizona Diamondbacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants, trying to catch the Dodgers for the National League
wild card, won the last three games of their four-game series with
the division-leading Diamondbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona has lost nine of its last 12 games. The Giants, who play
host to the Dodgers in a three-game series starting here tonight,
have won 11 of 14.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds' homer leading off the fourth tied the score at 1-1. It was
the 21st home run hit into McCovey Cove by a Giant since Pacific Bell
Park opened in 2000--and Bonds has 19 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds is second in the National League in homers to Sammy Sosa's
44.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Bonds' homer, Benito Santiago doubled and caught
Arizona napping.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago stole third while pitcher Brian Anderson stood on the
mound between pitches, then continued home when the startled
left-hander threw wildly past third baseman Matt Williams for an
error.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago said he was focusing on Williams, not Anderson, and
noticed the third baseman staring at the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I just timed it perfect. He was way off the bag. In my first
three steps he was still looking down, so I kept going," Santiago
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't focus on the pitcher on that play, you focus on the
third baseman. They look around sometimes, they look into the
stands."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said Santiago's dash was a good play only because he
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   "If Brian steps off and throws a strike to third, we've got him,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   But Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said his team was not
concentrating.</TE>
<TE>   "When everybody gets caught by surprise like that, something's
wrong there. A lot of people were sleeping," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants scored their third run in the eighth on David Bell's
sacrifice fly, but not without a scare.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' left foot slipped as he lined a single to left leading off
the inning, and his left leg buckled. He trotted to first and stayed
in the game, scoring on the fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Ortiz (11-10) won his third straight start, allowing one run
on seven hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 36th save in 44 opportunities.
His 199th save with the Giants tied him with Rod Beck for the most in
franchise history. Nen has 307 career saves.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson (6-11), who has lost four of his last five starts, gave
up two runs and four hits in three innings.</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 26, TAMPA BAY 20 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Punter Has Hand in Saints' Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Tom Tupa quickly ran out of options.</LD>
<LD>   The Tampa Bay punter, unable to get off a kick from his own end
zone, tried a desperation pass that sailed into the wrong hands and
gave the New Orleans Saints a 26-20 overtime victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Tupa, trying to avoid being tackled for a safety, tossed a weak
left-handed pass with the Saints' Fred McAfee draped on his back. All
rookie linebacker James Allen had to do was raise his hands and make
the game-winning interception.</LD>
<TE>   "I just thought, 'Oh, my God,' " Allen said. "All I could do was
just shuffle and catch the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's touchdown with 2:50 remaining in the overtime provided a
bizarre ending to a frustrating day for Tampa Bay, which scored 10
points in the last three minutes of regulation to extend the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't punt it, so I was trying to make a play out of
nothing," Tupa said. "Unfortunately, the guy got his hand on me and
started wrapping me up. He wrapped up my right arm. That's why I had
to throw it lefty."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Brooks threw for 260 yards, including touchdown passes of 32
yards to Boo Williams and 41 yards to Donte' Stallworth. Deuce
McAllister rushed for 109 yards in 31 carries in his first start
since the Saints traded Ricky Williams to the Miami Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers trimmed a 10-point deficit to 20-17 on Brad
Johnson's 11-yard scoring pass to Joe Jurevicius with 2:41 remaining
in the fourth quarter. They drove from their own 26 to the New
Orleans 23 to send it to overtime on Martin Gramatica's 40-yard field
goal on the last play of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson completed 28 of 52 passes for 278 yards, including a
four-yard touchdown to Keenan McCardell in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The loss spoiled Jon Gruden's debut as Tampa Bay coach. The
Buccaneers used four first-and second-round draft picks plus $8
million to pry him from the Oakland Raiders. "I'm disappointed, but
I'm not going to be one to let this fester for very long," Gruden
said. "We're going to come back from this."</TE>

<LD>Good thing it was a so-called "friendly," or the rout might have been
much bigger.</LD>
<LD>   The United States used hat tricks by forwards Mia Hamm and Abby
Wambach to defeat Scotland, 8-2, in a women's game in front of 6,295
Sunday at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 10th three-goal game for Hamm and the first for
Wambach, and it was the first time two U.S. players had hat tricks in
the same game since June 2, 2000. Hamm and Wambach are teammates on
the Washington Freedom of the Women's United Soccer Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Cindy Parlow and Shannon MacMillan also scored for the U.S., which
was tied with Scotland, 2-2, at halftime. Julie Fleeting and Debbie
McWhinnie scored for Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans dominated in the second half after Coach April
Heinrichs made four substitutions at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Lorrie Fair made her 100th appearance for the U.S.,
becoming the second youngest--behind Parlow--and 14th player to reach
that milestone with the team.</TE>

<TE>   Club America Rolls</TE>
<TE>   There's no longer a first-place tie in Group 1 of the Mexican
league.</TE>
<TE>   Chilean national team standout Ivan Zamorano scored twice and Club
America defeated Atlante, 4-1, to reach 15 points with a 5-0-0 record
and move ahead of Toluca (4-1-1, 13 points) in the group.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca was upset by Monterrey, 3-1, Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano opened the scoring against Atlante in the 12th minute,
controlling a shot from teammate Raul Salinas that had bounced off
the post. Antonio Castro made it 2-0 with a goal 24 minutes later.
Mexico national team member Cuauhtemoc Blanco scored in the 44th
minute for a 3-0 lead at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano got his second goal in the 64th minute. Paulo Serafin
scored for Atlante.</TE>
<TE>   The Chivas of Guadalajara won for the first time this season,
beating Universitario de Nuevo Leon, 4-0, behind goals by Rafael
Medina, Emilio Mora, David Mendoza and Omar Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   Queretaro and the UNAM Pumas battled to a 1-1 tie, and Celaya used
goals by Diego Cagna and Brazilian standout Claudinho to beat
Pachuca, 2-0.</TE>

<TE>   Dallas Loses Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Burn forward Ronald Cerritos is scheduled for season-ending
surgery Tuesday, a significant blow to the playoff-bound Major League
Soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring in the 14th minute, Cerritos fractured the tibia and

<TE>   Vogts Feels the Heat</TE>
<TE>   Soccer scribes around the world can be downright brutal, and the
ones in Scotland are having a field day with national team Coach
Berti Vogts, the former Germany coach.</TE>
<TE>   The latest barrage came after Scotland, coached by Vogts, was
forced to rally with two second-half goals to tie lowly Faroe
Islands, 2-2, in Saturday's opening round of qualifiers for the 2004
European Championships.</TE>
<TE>   At Glasgow, the Sunday Mail urged Vogts to resign after failing to
beat a team ranked No. 123 in the FIFA world rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "Your time's run out Berti" was the headline on the paper's back
page.</TE>
<TE>   The front-page headline in the Scottish News of the World read,
"Faroes 2 Zeros 2," and the back-page headline said, "Clueless."</TE>
<TE>   Vogts is 0-5-1 since taking over as Scotland's coach in February.
The five consecutive defeats were the longest skid in Scotland's 130
years of international competition.</TE>
<TE>   Vogts, however, has at least one supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a bit of the Scottish character in him," David
Taylor, chief executive of the Scottish Football Assn., told the News
of the World. "When things go wrong he doubles his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Berti is definitely the right appointment along with Rainer
Bonhof [under-21 coach] to reshape Scottish football."</TE>

<HD>Farmar Is Becoming Quite the Letterman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jordan Farmar never knew that mail was delivered on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it's a day off," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Weeks ago, he started receiving letters by overnight delivery on
Sunday from college basketball coaches determined to make an
impression on the 15-year-old point guard from Woodland Hills Taft
High.</LD>
<TE>   It's an indication how much Farmar's life has changed in a matter
of months.</TE>
<TE>   When the summer began, he wasn't getting letters and coaches such
as Lute Olson of Arizona, Rick Majerus of Utah and Mike Montgomery of
Stanford had never heard of him. Now, he averages close to 100
letters a week and has been identified as one of the top junior
guards on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no athlete in Southern California improved more during the
crucial summer training period than the 6-foot-2 Farmar, who has a
37-inch vertical jump and makes three-point shots look as easy as
layups.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, he didn't make all-league. He played for only one
month at Lake Balboa Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   Despite averaging 21 points, he was removed from the team in early
January by Coach Al Bennett, who objected to Farmar's decision to
transfer to Taft at the semester break.</TE>
<TE>   Farmar, who has a 3.4 grade-point average, said his mother wanted
him to change schools for academic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   While others were playing, Farmar practiced on his own. He made a
prominent travel team this summer and gained immediate recognition
for his guard skills.</TE>
<TE>   Former Taft coach Jim Woodard, who will serve as an assistant this
season, saw Farmar for the first time during a practice. "I walked in
the gym and asked, 'My God, who's that guy?' " he said. "He's a
tremendous player."</TE>
<TE>   Farmar started to understand the progress he was making during a
game in Las Vegas. He looked up in the bleachers and saw Stanford's
Montgomery scouting him.</TE>
<TE>   "That made me realize it's happening," he said. "It was shocking.
It was flattering that people would be there just to see me, and it
was an opportunity to show what I could do."</TE>
<TE>   Farmar is convinced he has a future in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my calling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Here are other athletes who made impressive summer improvement:</TE>
<TE>   * Sean Marshall, Rialto Eisenhower: A 6-6 senior, he practiced
almost every day at a park or gym, shooting jump shot after jump
shot. His improvement was dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "I moved my game from being a small forward to a shooting guard,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schools such as Boston College, Utah, Colorado, Oregon State and
Washington have started recruiting Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   * Ekene Ibekwe, Carson: Already highly regarded when the summer
began, the 6-9 Ibekwe enhanced his reputation with strong
performances against top competition. He displayed a level of
consistency not present during the regular season and became an elite
college prospect. Maryland, Arizona, Kansas and USC are pursuing him.</TE>
<TE>   * Megan Merritt, Woodland Hills Louisville: All the top women's
soccer programs know about Merritt after she helped the West Valley
Samba win the under-16 national championship. Only a junior, she
earned respect for her ability to head the ball and play tough
defense.</TE>
<TE>   * Nathan Longshore, Canyon Country</TE>
<TE>   Canyon: Despite having played only one season of football, this
6-4 junior quarterback stood out in summer passing tournaments
because of his arm strength and leadership skills. At a time when the
quarterback position in the Southland is lacking in quality college
prospects, Longshore put himself in position to be recruited.</TE>
<TE>   * Kyle Gunther, Camarillo: In this era of chat rooms and instant
messaging, Gunther is a big beneficiary. Word spread quickly about
the positive impression the 6-4, 275-pound offensive lineman made at
summer camps. Most important is his increased strength and size.</TE>
<TE>   * Steve Klosterman, Huntington Beach Marina: He was most valuable
player at the USA Junior Olympics Volleyball championships after
leading his club team to the 18-under national championship. He is
rated by many as the nation's No. 1 senior college prospect.</TE>
<TE>   * Scott Cohen, Sylmar: Cohen is outgrowing clothes so quickly that
his father, Bob, doesn't need to shop anymore. "I'm wearing his stuff
now," Bob said. Last season, Scott was a 5-10, 135-pound sophomore
second baseman. He has grown to 6-2, 160 pounds. He has continued
steady development as a hitter and fielder.</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Cable, Palmdale: The left-hander with an exceptional
curveball earned a spot in the Area Code Games, proved he can silence
hitters outside the Golden League, and accepted a scholarship to Cal
State Northridge.</TE>

<HD>Beschen Beats World's Best</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shane Beschen surfed so poorly last year that he failed to qualify
for this year's World Championship Tour. He called that a "big
wake-up call" and has been trying vigorously to ride his way back
into the major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, in front of more than 1,000 spectators under a mostly
sunny sky on three-to four-foot waves at Lower Trestles near San
Clemente, Beschen opened everyone's eyes when he showed, during a
dramatic showdown with the world's top-ranked surfer, that perhaps he
belongs there.</LD>
<LD>   Beschen, 30, who was awarded one of two wild-card entries into the
$285,000 Boost Mobile Pro, knew it would require all the skill he
could muster to defeat Andy Irons, winner of two of five WCT events
already this year. And Irons was well aware that Beschen, who lives
only a couple of miles from the famed point break, had the ability to
beat anyone on a given day.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, both surfers pulled out all their tricks and,
throughout their 35-minute heat, took turns performing maneuvers that
had even their fellow competitors applauding.</TE>
<TE>   Irons, 24, of Princeville, Hawaii, pulled off the most impressive
maneuver, an aerial off-the-lip followed by a floating re-entry into
the fast-breaking section. The judges scored the ride an 8 out of a
possible 10. Beschen followed with a similar move on wave that scored
8.4.</TE>
<TE>   Irons then used a combination of speed, power and hard-snapping
turns on a long right-breaking wave to score a 9.25, one of the day's
top scores. With the judges accepting each surfers' top two waves,
Beschen needed an 8.86 to pull in front. And in the final minutes he
used another aerial floater to register an 8.9 that propelled him
into today's fourth round and a matchup with Taylor Knox of Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nothing to lose and everything to gain," Beschen said. "If
my performance was good enough to beat Andy it's good enough to beat
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Knox, 31, advanced earlier in the day with a victory over Jake
Paterson of Australia.</TE>
<TE>   In failing to keep with the "locals rule" theme, Pat O'Connell,
30, of Laguna Beach, failed to advance after being defeated by Trent
Munro of Australia. That leaves Beschen and Knox as the only Southern
Californians still in contention.</TE>
<TE>   Also advancing was six-time world champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa
Beach, Fla. Pitted against Kieren Perrow of Australia, Slater posted
a 9.0 early in the heat, on a long right all the way to the beach,
but had trouble getting a decent second wave and watched as Kieren
took a lead that lasted until the heat's waning moments.</TE>
<TE>   After falling with about three minutes to go, Slater, while
scrambling back out to the lineup, saw another set of waves rolling
in and paddled fiercely to make it far enough to be able to turn
around and catch one.</TE>
<TE>   Kieren caught the first wave of the set and Slater managed to
catch the second almost as it was breaking. He stood up, kept his
balance and ripped the wave apart to the tune of an 8.5, which sent
him to a fourth-round match against another Australian, Darren
O'Rafferty.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive heat in which Slater, who is ranked
No. 21, had to scrape by with late-heat theatrics.</TE>
<TE>   Larger swells are forecast for today's fourth round, which begins
at 8 a.m. If conditions remain clean, the quarterfinals will follow.
The semifinals and finals are slated for Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>L.A. TRIATHLON</KH>
<HD>Walton Makes Up for Disappointment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wait was worth it for Craig Walton when it came to the third Los
Angeles Triathlon on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The 26-year-old Australian was set to compete in last year's
event, but suffered a broken bone in his lower right leg four days
before the race when he was hit by a car while on a training ride on
his bike.</LD>
<LD>   The injury prevented the 6-foot-2 1/2, 180-pound Walton from being
in top racing shape for about six months. But he dominated the
professional men's race in warm and sunny conditions Sunday to post
his fifth consecutive victory this season.</LD>
<TE>   Walton, who earned $14,000, clocked 1 hour 48 minutes 12 seconds
in the Olympic-distance race that began at Venice Beach with a
1.5-kilometer swim. That was followed by a 40-kilometer bike ride
that ended at the intersection of Main and First streets in Los
Angeles, and a 10-kilometer run that finished at El Pueblo de Los
Angeles near Olvera Street.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Australian Craig Alexander finished second in 1:50:00 and
Simon Lessing of Britain was third in 1:50:30.</TE>
<TE>   Barb Lindquist of Victor, Idaho, won the women's race for the
second time in three years with a 1:59:44 clocking. Nicole DeBoom was
second in 2:03:24 and Karen Smyers was third in 2:04:58.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty much trying to peak for this race," Walton said. "I
won [the Mrs. T's race] in Chicago two weeks ago, but I really didn't
feel that good. So I rested a lot in the two weeks leading up to this
race and it helped today."</TE>
<TE>   Rested is a relative word when it comes to elite triathletes.
Walton estimates the rode 250 miles, ran 70 miles and swam 15 miles
in training in the two weeks before Sunday. But there was no
questioning his dominance in his L.A. Triathlon debut.</TE>
<TE>   He had a 54-second lead over second-place Matt Clark after the
swim and a 3:45 advantage over Alexander after the bike ride.</TE>
<TE>   "The way Craig has been competing, we all knew he would be tough
to beat," said Lessing, who won five world titles during the 1990s.
"He's definitely at a peak level right now. He's sort of in a league
of his own compared to the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Lindquist's victory was similar to Walton's in that she took an
early lead in the swim and was never seriously challenged after that.</TE>
<TE>   She led second-place Julie Swail by 1:18 after the swim and
extended her advantage to 2:59 over DeBoom after the cycling portion
of the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I really concentrated on staying focused on the bike and not
daydreaming at all," the 33-year-old Lindquist said. "That's
something I've been working on this year and I feel like I did a good
job today."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11's Rubble at Nixon Library</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Thousands are drawn to an exhibit of World Trade
Center beams, FDNY firetruck and items from the other two plane
crashes.</DH>

<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 2,000 people visited the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace
in Yorba Linda on Sunday to view twisted beams from New York's World
Trade Center, a seared firetruck and other exhibits commemorating the
events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "People have come all day and night to see this," said Sandy
Quinn, the library's assistant director.</LD>
<LD>   The library conducted a memorial concert Sunday to honor those who
died in the terrorist attacks, and on Saturday 16 tons of steel from
the twin office towers and a New York City firetruck used on Sept. 11
were brought to the former president's birthplace.</LD>
<TE>   Visitors viewed the exhibits in somber silence, and wrote down
their thoughts in commemorative books provided by the library.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had anything like this, obviously. Seeing this gives
you a chill. It makes you mad," said Jon Zeiger of San Juan
Capistrano. "I didn't think a chunk of metal would make me feel that
way. But it does."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Marcosa, who works as a spokeswoman for the Costa Mesa
Fire Department, came with her husband, Joe. "We wanted some
closure.... We wanted to get some photos, something to remember 9/11
by," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really amazing. It's also really sad."</TE>
<TE>   The truck, beams, a piece of the facade from the Pentagon and a
flag from the Shanksville, Pa., crash site were brought to the
library by the San Bernardino-based Freedom Flame Sept. 11 Memorial
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, which has traveled through several cities, will be at
the Nixon library until Sept. 29. The metal will be used to make a
permanent memorial in Rancho Cucamonga, said Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the University of Southern California USC Trojan
Marching Band offered a patriotic concert.</TE>
<TE>   The library will conduct other events this week:</TE>
<TE>   Harry Waizer, who was badly injured at the World Trade Center, and
Commander Bradley D. Voigt, a U.S. Navy SEAL who directed forces in
Afghanistan, will speak Tuesday at 2 p.m. The public may light
candles to float in the library's reflecting pool from 3 p.m. Tuesday
until noon Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the library will conduct ceremonies at 5:45 a.m.,
when American Flight 11 struck the north tower of the World Trade
Center; at 6:03, a.m., when United Flight 175 struck the south tower;
at 6:40 a.m., when American Flight 177 struck the Pentagon; and at 7
a.m., when UnitedFlight 93 crashed near Shanksville, Pa.</TE>
