<AU>DOUGLAS BRINKLEY</AU>
<BD>Douglas Brinkley is professor of history at the
University of New Orleans and a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly before he died in 1986, the great 20th century Argentine man
of letters, Jorge Luis Borges, made a pilgrimage to Hannibal, Mo., to
pay homage to his great 19th century American cohort, Mark Twain.
Upon arriving in town, the blind octogenarian was escorted to the
Mississippi River levee. Despite his meticulous three-piece suit and
to the surprise of all present, Borges walked into the muddy waters
until the river rushed up around his chest. "Now," he declared, "I
understand the essence of America."</LD>
<LD>   Borges' baptism in the United States' Father of Waters made a
fitting tribute to his literary hero: No American writer put more
effort into promoting the Mississippi than former riverboat captain
Twain. His work began in defense, after Charles Dickens visited
Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio and Mississippi rivers converge, and
expressed his revulsion by calling America's great waterway "a slimy
monster hideous to behold" in his 1843 "American Notes for General
Circulation." Still more rankling, Herman Melville, who never so much
as saw the river, parroted Dickens' faulty impression in "The
Confidence Man: His Masquerade," in which Melville claimed that
"Fever and Ague" were the patron saints of the Mississippi.</LD>
<TE>   Infuriated by this misinformation, Twain set out to defend his
beloved "Big Muddy" in "Tom Sawyer," "Life on the Mississippi" and
"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." So powerful was Twain's argument
that the Dickens-Melville denigration of the river as a swirling
sewer faded from fashion, replaced by Twain's world of riverboat
pilots, prank-playing boys and magnolia-scented tall tales. For all
his efforts, however, among the great 20th century American
modernists who were born or raised along the banks of the Mississippi
River--Richard Wright, T.S. Eliot and F. Scott Fitzgerald--none was
quite taken in by Twain's enthusiasm. To them, the Mississippi was
most notable as a metaphor for the nation's racial divide and social
stratification. Unlike Twain's, their bleak memories of life along
the river don't amount to the stuff of annual festivals. But make no
mistake: The soulful Mississippi River courses through their work,
often in currents too deep to be obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Wright was born in Roxie, Miss., "too far back in the woods to
hear the train whistle and you could only hear the hoot owls holler."
When he left the Mississippi delta in 1927, the region's fertile soil
was depleted from planting too much cotton, the insatiable boll
weevil had marched up from Mexico and decimated the crops and heavy
flooding of the Mississippi River had left many plantations
devastated. The floods made such an impact on Wright that he wrote
three stories about them: "Down by the Riverside," "Silt" and "The
Man Who Saw the Flood." It haunted Wright that African Americans, and
particularly the most impoverished sharecroppers, were routinely
killed by Mississippi River floods as their better-positioned white
neighbors looked on and did nothing to help them, a disturbing
behavior that he expanded on in his essay "How Jim Crow Feels."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing improved when Wright's family moved to 20 E. Woodlawn Ave.
in Natchez, just blocks from the Mississippi River. The horrific
opening of his autobiographical narrative "Black Boy" in fact takes
place in this house--a scene of the 4-year-old author torching the
parlor curtains and getting whipped so hard by his mother with an elm
tree branch that he loses consciousness and remains plagued by
hallucinations of the event into adulthood. "For a long time I was
chastened," Wright confessed, "whenever I remembered that my mother
had come close to killing me." To escape his household's turmoils,
Wright would walk to the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi and watch
the steamboats. "There was," Wright described it, "a vague sense of
the infinite as I looked down upon the yellow, dreaming waters of the
Mississippi River far from the verdant bluffs of Natchez." Yet when
his family moved again, traveling up the river from Natchez to
Memphis by steamboat, the viciously bigoted pilots the Wrights
encountered displayed none of the tolerance of Twain's good-humored
versions.</TE>
<TE>   A diametrically different social upbringing along the great river
informs the work of Eliot--born Sept. 26, 1888, in a large two-story
house at 2635 Locust Ave. in St. Louis--who embraced the Mississippi
in metaphorical terms and constantly drew upon its force for imagery
in his poems and plays. "I feel," Eliot wrote late in life to a St.
Louis newspaper editor, "that there is something in having passed
one's childhood beside the big river which is incommunicable to those
who have not."</TE>
<TE>   His dapper youth shared nothing with Wright's but the river, Eliot
being the firmly upper-middle-class son of a brick manufacturer and a
novice poet. Eliot's boyhood also had little else in common with the
straw-hat, Huck Finn bumptiousness of Twain's: The future poet of
"The Waste Land" attended Smith Academy, founded by his paternal
grandfather, and some of the short stories and verse he contributed
to the Smith Academy Record include scenes set along the Mississippi.
Although he soon headed to Massachusetts' Milton Academy before
entering Harvard College in 1906, Eliot never forgot the waters he
grew up on. "The river cast a spell over the entirety of my life," he
explained. "It was my Harvard."</TE>
<TE>   To Eliot, the Mississippi's fascination wasn't about people but as
a force of nature like the vast Atlantic Ocean he experienced through
summering in Gloucester, Mass. In later life he contemplated writing
a book of childhood reminiscences titled "The River and the Sea,"
celebrating his memories of the two great natural forces that pervade
his poetry. Although he never got around to that one, some of Eliot's
finest works derive in part from his feel of the Mississippi. "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," for example, refers to the name on
an old red-brick furniture warehouse that still stands along the
levee in St. Louis. The poem's fictive fog is actually soot from the
smokestacks of the factories that lined the riverbank and once fouled
the water and poisoned the air. Yet Eliot also saw through the
industrial haze to pen his greatest ode to the Mississippi River in
his deeply religious and philosophical 1941 poem "The Dry Salvages":</TE>
<TE>   I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river</TE>
<TE>   Is a strong brown god--sullen, untamed and intractable ...</TE>
<TE>   His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom, ...</TE>
<TE>   And so it remained in Eliot, flowing through his soul long after
he abandoned St. Louis. His contemporary and compatriot genius with
the American language, Fitzgerald, was born 550 miles up the river
from St. Louis, in St. Paul, Minn., on Sept. 24, 1896, in a six-unit
brick building at 481 Laurel Ave., just a mile and a half from the
river's banks. St. Paul at the turn of the last century was
conservative and provincial, although the Mississippi River had
ceased to be the city's primary lifeline to the world beyond with the
advent of the railroads.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, Fitzgerald saw the great river as a mere mercantile
highway utterly devoid of romance, just a stretch of ugly warehouses
and docks full of bums. The city had turned its back to the river,
which Fitzgerald noted in his 1922 story "The Popular Girl": "The
continuity of these mausoleums was broken by a small park, a triangle
of grass where Nathan Hale stood ten feet tall with his hands bound
behind his back by stone cord and stared over a great bluff at the
slow Mississippi. Crest Avenue ran along the bluff, but neither faced
it nor seemed aware of it, for all the houses fronted inward toward
the street."</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, St. Paul is reclaiming the finer heritage of its
riverfront, where Fitzgerald's fans can now visit the row house where
he is said to have been conceived, as well as the Victorian-era house
that F. Scott and wife Zelda rented at 626 Goodrich Ave., described
in his 1921 essay "Author's House." Already a celebrity after the
wild success of his first novel, "This Side of Paradise," Fitzgerald
is thought to have written large chunks of his second major work,
"The Beautiful and the Damned," in the Goodrich Avenue house's tower
room, which afforded a bird's-eye view of the Mississippi River.
"It's small up there, and full of baked silent heat until the author
opens two of the glass windows that surround it and the twilight
blows through," he wrote about his St. Paul aerie. "As far as your
eye can see, there is a river winding between green lawns and trees
and purple buildings and red slums blended in by a merciful dusk."
Fitzgerald also worked in St. Paul on his "Tales of the Jazz Age,"
his lauded collection of short stories, and wrote other stories about
the area, though he never returned to St. Paul after he and Zelda
left the Midwest in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald's signature sense of social stratification may well
have developed from growing up in "genteel shabbiness" in St. Paul,
where the Mississippi River served as a demarcation line, the poor
living down on the river flats and the rich above them on the bluffs.
The brilliant youngster forded the gap, organizing high-toned secret
clubs, riding in sleighs to Town and Country events, studying at the
posh local Ramaley School of Dance and mingling with the city's
finest families despite his empty pockets.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, St. Paul threw a centennial bash to celebrate
Fitzgerald's achievements, an event spearheaded by National Public
Radio host Garrison Keillor. "Mississippi River towns have given
birth to numerous writers of merit," he declared. "The delta claims
Faulkner; St. Louis T.S. Eliot; and St. Paul has F. Scott Fitzgerald.
We're proud of him." Keillor's acknowledgement is true of all the
great American modernists, including Wright, if only one looks close
enough at their work to see it.</TE>

<DH>THE HOUSE OF BLUE MANGOES, A Novel, By David Davidar,
HarperCollins: 512 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN EHRENREICH</AU>

Program.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Tolstoy strove to render history human, pulling its sweep down
into the lives of individual men and women, and Pasternak saw history
as a great wind that mercilessly blew his characters about, there is
at least one more approach to writing the grand historical epic
novel: Call it the ornamental epic, in which history is just a
sentimental set piece, like an exotic garden or a formal tea party,
that provides color and a bit of excitement to characters otherwise
lacking in depth.</LD>
<LD>   "The House of Blue Mangoes," the first novel by David Davidar,
takes its place among the last group. Lushly set in southern India,
the novel covers three generations of the Dorai family, beginning in
1899 and stretching to 1947, just before independence. The Dorais,
for the most part, try to ignore history, or "politics," as they
often choose to call it. At the novel's beginning, history is
symbolized by a road recently plotted through Chevathar, the family
village, which is famous for the sweetness of its native blue
mangoes. The road, in all its egalitarian straightness, renders
irrelevant the maze of paths that tradition has worn through the
village to keep the castes from polluting one another.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the obvious social inequities (which do not appear to
interest Davidar), all had been peaceful in Chevathar, "[u]ntil the
road, the accursed road, had come along and upset the balance."</LD>
<TE>   Soon a girl is raped by strangers who wander into Chevathar on
that same accursed road, and long-simmering caste tensions erupt,
leading to the downfall of the Dorai patriarch, Solomon, "that most
fair-minded of men." Solomon's elder son, Aaron, falls into a life of
dissipation and petty crime, whence he makes a seamless transition
into revolutionary activism.</TE>
<TE>   When Aaron's involvement in an assassination attempt on a British
official results in his imprisonment and death, his brother Daniel,
having witnessed the nasty effects of social engagement on his father
and brother, decides to secede from politics in an attempt to step
outside the march of history. He makes his fortune selling "Dr
Dorai's Moonwhite Thylam," a skin-whitening cream, and reestablishes
the family compound in Chevathar, naming it Neelam Illum, the House
of Blue Mangoes. Daniel invites his entire extended family to join
him on the family land, as long as they agree to leave the forces of
historic change behind. "I've seen politics up close and find it
abhorrent," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel's plan doesn't quite work out, of course. He remains
unaware of Gandhi's satyagraha movement of nonviolent resistance
until the village boys begin burning their British-made clothes. His
son Kannan (daughters don't count for much in this novel) inherits
Daniel's antipathy to politics and, with his head buried deep in the
sand, successfully ignores it almost to the very last.</TE>
<TE>   Davidar appears to share the Dorais' prim aversion to the muddle
of politics and historical engagement. He renders repugnant almost
every character on whom modernity has any claim, from the scheming
lawyer Vakeel Perumal, who cartoonishly exclaims, "Tradition and
custom are the handiwork of puny little men and perverted priests,"
to the anti-British revolutionary leader who has a gaze "that
betrayed his essential nature--flat and unblinking as a viper's."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to sense a certain nostalgia for the (deceptively)
benevolent village life of the 19th century. "A general sorrow has
come over the land," laments Solomon just before the 1899 caste
battles ignite. "It seems as though the evening of the world is upon
us."</TE>
<TE>   It is to Davidar's great advantage that the history of the period
is so fascinating, for without its minimal intrusion, we would be
left with little but the soapy operatics of his plot--the predictable
fraternal spat, the marriage that goes wrong in all the time-worn
ways. He seems to lose interest at times in his characters, leaping
over years with barely a comment, only to sum up clumsily in a
sentence or two, as when Daniel's mother dies and the narrator lets
out: "He was grateful he had his wife and children around him, but it
was only now that he realized the extent to which he'd depended on
his mother."</TE>
<TE>   It is the details that pique Davidar's interest more than anything
else. He devotes long, loving digressions to the dangerous sport of
well-jumping, the intricacies of traditional siddha medicinal
practice, the complex social rites of the colonial afternoon tea, the
best way to hunt a man-eating tiger, the subtle differences among the
many varieties of mango. If only he had as much enthusiasm for the
humans who fill his novel, "The House of Blue Mangoes" might not feel
as adrift as its recurring metaphor, the blue mango, which is at
times possessed with a "monstrous flaw" or is the tastiest thing
around, or, perhaps, stands for nothing at all.</TE>

<DH>BLINDED BY THE RIGHT: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative,
By David Brock, Crown: 336 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD GITLIN</AU>
<BD>Todd Gitlin is the author of, most recently, "Media
Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our
Lives."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Decades ago, self-revolted ex-communists personified History with a
capital H when they brought back news of grand error and grand
turnabout. Big ideas were at stake--and to blame. The six fine
writers who contributed to the 1949 classic "The God That Failed" had
chosen communism in the dire 1930s before coming to realize its
systematic inhumanity. Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, Stephen
Spender, Richard Wright, Louis Fischer and Andre Gide, intellectuals
all, wrote thoughtfully, even serenely.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, Whittaker Chambers' "Witness" (1952) was a fervid
exercise in spiritual self-renewal, flooded by the certainty that
History, having betrayed Chambers by recruiting him for Soviet
espionage, was now on his right side. Chambers, having arguably done
far more direct damage, was correspondingly more agitated in the
aftermath.</LD>
<LD>   David Brock's "Blinded by the Right" is a confession of a tawdrier
color, though no less a classic contribution to this significant
literature of our time. Arguably, Brock played a more momentous part
in his movement than did his confessional predecessors in theirs.
Accordingly, he is hugely contrite. He has much to be contrite
about--much, much more than he owned up to in a confessional article
published in Esquire in 1997. Anyone wishing to understand America in
the 1990s will have to read his book.</LD>
<TE>   This time the conspirators are assassins of character (of Anita
Hill, Bill Clinton), not of Trotsky. The right-wing crowd Brock fell
in with in the late 1980s and 1990s was not terribly interested in
ideas. These well-fed propagandists and lawyers (including an
appellate court judge) moved among Washington D.C. townhouses and
restaurants scheming to obstruct liberal causes and bring down the
elected government of Clinton, whom they mistook for the antichrist.</TE>
<TE>   These slash-and-burn power-seekers fancied themselves
"conservative" but were, and are, Brock says, "a radical cult,"
well-placed, well-funded and ruthless, who organized single-mindedly
to get power by smearing their opponents and who succeeded
brilliantly, with no small assist from him.</TE>
<TE>   As a student at UC Berkeley in the early 1980s, young Brock (born
1962) found himself revolted by a stifling "political correctness,"
an atmosphere he exaggerates. Berkeley seems to have sent him around
the bend, but it does not seem to have taken much to put him in a
crusading state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   From Berkeley onward, a network of right-wing foundations, think
tanks and publications recruited, welcomed and subsidized him,
escorting him from assignment to assignment, putting him on the
national map.</TE>
<TE>   Right-wing campus journalism brought him to the attention of the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Washington Times in the Reagan years, which in
turn took him to the Heritage Foundation, from which he launched
himself as a freelance writer for the American Spectator, then onward
and upward into the innards of what he calls "a highly profitable,
right-wing Big Lie machine that flourished in book publishing, on
talk radio and on the Internet through the '90s."</TE>
<TE>   Enamored of Clarence Thomas, Brock came to national notice as the
author of a Spectator article, "The Real Anita Hill," which gave the
world the memorable smear, "a little bit nutty and a little bit
slutty."</TE>
<TE>   "Doing everything I could to ruin Hill's credibility," Brock
writes, "I took a scattershot approach, dumping virtually every
derogatory--and often contradictory--allegation I had collected on
Hill from the Thomas camp into the mix," producing "a witches' brew
of fact, allegation, hearsay, speculation, opinion, and invective
labeled by my editors as 'investigative journalism.'"</TE>
<TE>   Boosted by Rush Limbaugh, Brock rolled this piece into a
bestselling attack book by the same name. "Inventing" a conspiracy
theory, he writes, he "unconsciously projected onto the liberals what
I knew and saw and learned of the right wing's operations."</TE>
<TE>   How could such a career fail to flourish? He took money from a
fervent Republican investor named Peter Smith ("I was a whore for the
cash"), who put him in touch with a crew of Arkansas Clinton-haters.
Failing to unearth a Clinton love child, they did deliver the state
troopers who fed Brock with unsubstantiated allegations about
Clinton's sexual exploits.</TE>
<TE>   These Brock dutifully loaded into a Spectator article that, in
passing, mentioned a woman named Paula who alleged sexual harassment
by then-governor Clinton. On the strength of this mention, a young
woman named Paula Jones came forward to sue Clinton, permitting her
right-wing lawyers to take depositions on the now-president's sex
life, and the rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   Brock has an important idea about the schemers who brought down
Clinton. Among the pungent details in his self-purgative, name-naming
memoir are these about the right-wing Washington organizer Grover
Norquist: "Grover admired the iron dedication of Lenin, whose dictum,
'Probe with bayonets, looking for weakness' he often quoted, and
whose majestic portrait hung in Grover's Washington living room."</TE>
<TE>   The morning of George W. Bush's inauguration, the same Norquist
told a Republican "unity breakfast": "The lefties, the takers, the
coercive utopians.... They are not stupid, they are evil. EVIL." Such
overkill is not incidental. When sufficiently well-funded ("sugar
daddy" Richard Mellon Scaife shoveled more than $200 million into
right-wing causes), rhetorical extravagance moves the rhetoric to a
state of extremity at which evidence does not matter and hatred burns
out of control. Brock was good at this genre, and he was only one
fevered slinger of false allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Another, he writes, was former George W. Bush lawyer and
now-Solicitor General Ted Olson who, he reveals, anonymously noted
for the Spectator that "the appropriate comparison for Clinton may
well turn out to be Don Corleone." What fuels such furies? What
accounts for the take-no-prisoners ferocity of what Hillary Rodham
Clinton in 1998 was mocked for calling a "vast right-wing conspiracy"
to smear her husband long before he set foot in the Oval Office? Even
about himself there remain mysteries, for Brock maintains that he
"never shared" the "hard-right ideology" that he served.</TE>
<TE>   He does try out one interesting notion. A goodly number of his
co-conspirators are closeted gays, as Brock was. They called
themselves "laissez fairies." Most, he writes, were "in a constant
state of panic about being discovered." They were, Brock thinks,
classic projectors of their own inner demons.</TE>
<TE>   But this is too simple. Brock knew many heterosexual ragers too,
not the least of which were many young attractive women. Why their
fanatical bitterness toward Clinton and all his works? The strength
of Brock's account does not lie in analysis. It's in his atmospherics
and his moral revulsion, his revolt against himself and his lies.</TE>
<TE>   To supply sufficient motive to the protagonists of his tale, he
might have reflected on the right's demonization of Clinton. Long
before Monica Lewinsky had sent her curriculum vitae to the White
House, Clinton was cast as the draft-dodging, non-inhaling,
Hillary-marrying, zipper-lowering, deep-South-betraying smarty pants
who had the talent and audacity to win--and rescue the Democrats from
the marginality to which the Reagan movement had consigned them.</TE>
<TE>   When he dwelt in "the depths of depravity," Brock did not reflect
much on the moral or political consequences of the Clinton-haters'
corrupt crusade. Certainly his allies did not quiver with conscience
qualms. They wanted results, period--and obtained them. Between
judges and journalists, they succeeded brilliantly. Their impeachment
drive crippled Clinton, stopped Al Gore in his tracks and ended the
brief Democratic interregnum.</TE>
<TE>   Now the question arises of why Brock, who cut corners as "a
witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine," a knowing liar who
"mounted a cover-up to protect [Clarence] Thomas," deserves to be
believed as a whistle-blower. One reason to take him seriously is
that he is not particularly self-serving.</TE>
<TE>   On Page 7, he admits to what he himself calls "an embarrassing
lie" during the time when he reacted to left-wing excess at Berkeley
by veering right as a journalist for the student-run Daily
Californian. He acknowledges other, bigger living lies: keeping from
friends the facts that he was adopted and gay.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that, late in the game, he wrote a remorseful letter to
Hill, confessing that he had maligned her. Hill left him a voicemail
message in response. Even as he was turning, he "could not get up the
nerve to return Hill's call," Brock writes. Eventually Brock got up
the courage to detoxify, finding Hillary Clinton innocent of the
voluminous charges his buddies leveled against her.</TE>
<TE>   There does not seem to have been a Hollywood moment, an Aha! when
he decided to end his career as a paid propagandist and resolved to
save himself. He tells us how he wearied of lying while confronting
the Juanita Broaddrick rape charge, an accusation against Clinton
whose plausibility melted away the closer Brock approached it. "When
I examined the underlying record" on Whitewater, he also writes, "I
found that rather than implicating Hillary along the lines suggested
by the Republicans, it exculpated her."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a few trivial errors in his Berkeley pages, Brock's
account overall rings with plausibility. On Thomas and Hill, his
account dovetails with Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson's book, "Strange
Justice." On Clinton and Arkansas, his account dovetails with
previous unrefuted accounts by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons and Jeffrey
Toobin.</TE>
<TE>   Attack journalism will have its way with Brock and may shake some
details, but the last harsh laugh is likely to be his. Still, no one
concerned about truth will be laughing. Brock has the decency to come
clean and apologize, but his onetime allies ride unrepentant and
high.</TE>

<HD>Saving Capitalism From Itself</HD>
<DH>JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES: Fighting for Britain, 1937-1946, By
Robert Skidelsky, Viking: 580 pp., $34.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>Peter G. Gosselin is a national economics correspondent
for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first blush, John Maynard Keynes might seem an unusual choice as
one of the last century's most influential people, and "Fighting for
Britain, 1937-1946," the third thick volume by Robert Skidelsky of
the British economist's life, might seem a tough sell, especially to
an American audience.</LD>
<LD>   After all, Keynes was a terrible snob, particularly when it came
to the United States ("I always regard a visit as in the nature of a
serious illness"). Early in life, he flouted enough social
conventions to make the average 1960s hippie look like an Eagle
Scout. (He had a series of lovers, male and female. Even once he had
become a government official, he dashed off a book calling the prime
minister, David Lloyd George, a "goat-footed bard" and "half-human.")
He was a mama's boy; he wrote his mother regularly and dined with his
parents most weekends until his death at 63.</LD>
<LD>   But Keynes also pulled off one of the great intellectual coups of
the century, an accomplishment as original in its way as Adam Smith's
initial discovery of the inner logic of a market society. He figured
out how to look at an economy from the top down, just as Smith had
figured out how to view it from eye level out.</LD>
<TE>   And the former aesthete and rebel did something else as well; he
demonstrated the power of his top-down approach in a series of policy
proposals that, although not immediately embraced by the British and
American leaders on whom he pressed them, turned out to be what each
society needed at the time. Keynes' encounter with Franklin D.
Roosevelt in the midst of the Great Depression, described in
Skidelsky's second volume on Keynes, offered a glimpse of the advice
and its initial reception. The economist gained an audience with the
president at which he lobbied for budget deficits on a scale
unthinkable at the time to pump up consumer demand and revive growth.</TE>
<TE>   "He left a whole rigmarole of figures," a peeved Roosevelt
complained. Keynes was no kinder, remarking that he had "supposed the
president was more literate, economically speaking." But when FDR
finally managed to run the kind of deficits Keynes had recommended,
with the American entry into World War II, the policy worked like a
charm. United States output nearly doubled; unemployment fell through
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Getting it right on such a grand scale helps explain why Keynes is
considered so influential. But it doesn't answer why a reader should
wade into "Fighting for Britain, 1937-1946." The book covers the last
nine years of Keynes' life when, in a role that amounted to being
Churchill's Treasury secretary, the economist orchestrated the
financing of Britain's war against Germany and sought--in large part
unsuccessfully--to craft a postwar economic order that left Britain
with some of its prewar empire and a degree of freedom from the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Skidelsky's previous two volumes on Keynes' life, "Hopes Betrayed,
1883-1920" and "The Economist as Savior, 1920-1937," cover Keynes'
early years through his involvement as a young treasury official in
the Versailles Peace Conference (which settled World War I on terms
that he predicted would produce another conflagration) and on to the
writing of his masterwork, "The General Theory of Employment,
Interest and Money."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond rounding out one's picture of Keynes, there are at least
three reasons why an American reader in particular would tackle this
volume. All have to do with the parallels between the period leading
up to World War II and the extraordinary political moment at which
the United States now finds itself.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, the world appeared to be moving from peace, or at
least limited conflict, to generalized global struggle. Keynes was
faster than almost any of his contemporaries in realizing that the
coming of war would utterly change the British economy, requiring
policymakers to drop concern about depression in favor of worries
about rising demand, inflation and shortage. Whatever the differences
between this era and that, Keynes' efforts to gauge the economic
dimensions of the shift from peace to war provide a useful
counterpoint to the untenable picture now being painted by President
Bush of a nation at war with its economy at peace.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, Americans saw themselves as innocents drawn
into a conflict they would sooner have avoided and fighting only for
such grander goods as defeating evil. Virtually all American
histories of the period leading up to World War II are written from
this perspective. But not all British histories.</TE>
<TE>   To many British, and especially to Keynes, the terms of United
States war loans to England as well as American postwar economic
plans were clearly designed to weaken the United Kingdom and leave it
servile. "America must not be allowed to pick out the eyes of the
British Empire," he fumed as the full dimensions of the economic
damage to his homeland became clear. In laying out such a drastically
different account of United States aims in a past war, the book
provides an important counterweight to the wildest claims of purity
and innocence advanced by the United States in the current conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, both now and then, there is a new urgency to reconciling
what the recently deceased Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick
described as the right of consenting adults to engage in capitalist
acts with society's broader needs for order, security and allegiance.
For nearly two decades, Americans have assumed that the answer lay in
private growth. But with the Enron scandal leaving people bereft of
retirement savings and the terrorist attacks revealing the weak links
in the private provision of public goods such as airport security,
the answer looks more like a dodge.</TE>
<TE>   Keynes faced the problem under very different circumstances. War
production was beginning to fill the pockets of once jobless workers
with cash just as British factories, occupied with munitions, were
unable to produce for them. There seemed to be only two options for
what to do: Nothing, which would have resulted in inflation, bare
shelves and perhaps social chaos, or rationing, which Keynes argued
would push Britain in the direction of the very totalitarian regimes
it was then battling.</TE>
<TE>   Keynes came up with an alternative: forced savings. "It is for the
state to say how much a man is entitled to spend out of his
earnings," the economist declared. "It is for him to say how he will
spend it."</TE>
<TE>   The idea was direct, forceful and still respectful of individuals'
right to lead their own lives. That Keynes could devise it on the fly
and in the midst of frantic war preparations offers some hope that
Americans, in a wealthier and calmer time, might find solutions to
their economic problems that meet the same exacting standards.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this final volume is haunted by failure. Keynes failed to
sell his notion of forced savings. He failed to save Britain from
American domination. He failed to even survive negotiations over the
postwar order, which left him spent and vulnerable to a chronic heart
condition. But the subsequently announced death of his ideas has
proven spectacularly premature. As Skidelsky's biography
demonstrates, that is because--beyond the specifics of theory--Keynes
engaged in a life-long search for a middle way between the excesses
of capitalist competition and the brutalities of totalitarian order,
one that represents the very best liberalism has to offer.</TE>

<DH>THE EYRE AFFAIR: A Novel, By Jasper Fforde, Viking: 374
pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE JAMES</AU>
<BD>Jamie James is the author of the novel "Andrew and
Joey."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome to Wonderland. The year is 1985. The Crimean War is in its
131st year; cloned dodos are popular pets; air travel by dirigible is
the favored way of skipping about the realm. And life as we know it
is rent not by political or religious strife but by literary
factionalism. The nightly news reports fierce street fights between
surrealists and classicists. The Stratfordian orthodoxy is under
siege by militant Baconians and rowdy advocates of Christopher
Marlowe.</LD>
<LD>   And our heroine, Thursday Next, a LiteraTec--as police detectives
in this bookish world are called--is out to thwart the literary
terrorism of criminal archfiend Acheron Hades, whose gang hides out
in the lawless People's Republic of Wales. Next's uncle Mycroft (a
name borrowed from Sherlock Holmes' even brainier brother) has
invented a machine that transports the user into works of literature.
When he tries out the Prose Portal on his wife, she gets lost in
Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," where the elderly poet
of the Lake District gets fresh with her.</LD>
<TE>   When Hades, an amalgam of movie and cartoon bad guys along the
lines of Mike Myers' Dr. Evil, gets the device in his clutches, his
first caper is modest, the kidnapping and execution of a minor
character in Dickens' "Martin Chuzzlewit," but then he raises the
stakes by kidnapping the eponymous heroine of Charlotte Bronte's
"Jane Eyre." All England is in an uproar: "Within two hours every
LiteraTec department was besieged by calls from worried Bronte
readers. Within four hours the president of the Bronte Federation had
seen the prime minister." As the investigation progresses, Next's
boss has police officers desperately trying to follow breaking events
in the case by reading Bronte's novel.</TE>
<TE>   Overflowing with brazen joke thievery and appropriated plot
devices, Jasper Fforde's "The Eyre Affair" is a tour de force in its
particular genre--science fiction literary detective thriller--as
small as that genre may be. Characters pop in and out of works of
fiction in a manner patented by Woody Allen (in his short story "The
Kugelmass Episode" and the film "The Purple Rose of Cairo"), and a
scrappy suburban performance of "Richard III" is an inspired spoof on
midnight screenings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." The narrative
moves at a breakneck pace. Readers who accept the principle of
pastiche that underlies the novel's conception will be rewarded with
a clever entertainment that works well both as an adventure yarn and
as a witty sendup of contemporary trash media.</TE>
<TE>   Although it champions literary masterpieces, "The Eyre Affair" is
far from forbiddingly erudite. If you've forgotten the plot of "Jane
Eyre," don't doubt that Next will provide a handy synopsis, and
Fforde's literary allusions cease well before the end of the 19th
century, thereby omitting any mention of potentially pesky modernist
authors. Much of the humor is sophomoric: If reading about characters
named Millon de Floss or Landen Parke-Laine or Victor Analogy makes
you wince, then "The Eyre Affair" probably won't amuse you.</TE>
<TE>   In this debut, Fforde would have benefited from a more disciplined
style: Many of his sentences have a clumsy, amateurish quality that
unintentionally evokes the works of Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn
Drew ("He had a large ring on his middle finger with a curious and
distinctive pattern on it"); malapropisms crop up in others ("I
looked over the parapet but I couldn't see anything remiss"). And the
flat romantic subplot is obviously there only to satisfy convention.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eyre Affair" is transparently aimed at Hollywood and indeed
comes with art-direction tips to the special effects crew: Fforde
worked for 13 years as a camera technician in the film industry, and
it shows. That's hardly damning nowadays, or even unusual, but some
of the novel's humor might work better on the screen than it does on
the page: Early in the book, for example, in a spoof of the
gun-toting parson in a Western, Next's life is saved when a copy of
"Jane Eyre" in her breast pocket takes a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is useful to recall that many of the literary masters who
make cameo appearances in "The Eyre Affair" didn't scruple to boil
the pot themselves; Poe, Dickens and Chesterton, after all, were the
Grishams of their day. Lovers of great literature with a fondness for
light genre fiction and a tolerance for whimsy will feel instantly at
home in "The Eyre Affair" and find the end of the book, predictable
though it may be, drawing nigh all too soon.</TE>

<DH>THE GRIT BENEATH THE GLITTER: Tales From the Real Las
Vegas, Edited by Hal K. Rothman and Mike Davis, University of
California Press:  392 pp., $50, $19.95 paper PALM SPRINGS: The
Landscape, the History, the Lore, By Mary Jo Churchwell, Ironwood
Editions: 234 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Las Vegas is fully Disneyfied, or so it seems from the confines of
the air-conditioned automobile as we cruise past postmodern pyramids
and palaces, outsized Coke bottles and Harley-Davidson motorcycles
and a phantasmagoria of miniaturized urban skylines. Once nothing
more than a desert oasis known only to the native Paiutes, then a
self-invented Sodom where gambling and prostitution were not only
tolerated but celebrated, Las Vegas embodies a wholly child-safe and
family-friendly vision of American pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   "Reinvention has been the essence of the place," write co-editors
Hal K. Rothman and Mike Davis in "The Grit Beneath the Glitter," a
fascinating collection of essays compounded of scholarship, memoir
and critique, "but what can you expect from a town with no compelling
natural reason to be where it is?"</LD>
<TE>   The unapologetic phoniness of the Strip--so provocative and yet
somehow comforting, intentionally so--conceals a tawdry and sometimes
sordid reality. "Indeed, the grander the illusion," quips one of the
contributors, Norman M. Klein ("Scripting Las Vegas"), "the more
dysfunction it hides." So "The Grit Beneath the Glitter" invites us
to look beyond the Strip and behold the human face of the 1.3 million
people who live and labor in greater Las Vegas--the 15,000 food
servers and the 10,000 room cleaners, for example, the showgirls on
the Strip and the girl gangs in the neighborhoods, even the inmates
of the Nevada state prison at nearby Jean.</TE>
<TE>   At its most ambitious moments, the book can be approached as a
corrective to half a century of mystification and myth-making about
America's fastest-growing city and the world's most popular tourist
destination. "Las Vegas has become the favorite setting for hip
anthropologists to mock the distended appetites of the majority," the
co-editors write. "But Vegas is another world when you enter the
gaming palaces from the employees' entrance in a back parking lot.
(And we can safely bet that no Rolling Stone correspondent or
postmodernist philosopher has ever done this.)"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, of course, is famous for his harsh take on Los Angeles in
"City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles" and "Ecology
of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster." Rothman has
approached the study of history from an environmentalist's stance in
"The Greening of a Nation? Environmentalism in the United States
Since 1945." The same edginess and environmental concern are apparent
in their choice of contributions to "The Grit Beneath the Glitter."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, for example, "Lighting Las Vegas" by Jay Brigham explains
where the electricity that so famously and so extravagantly
illuminates the Strip comes from, and "Build It and the Water Will
Come" by Jon Christensen does the same for the liquid that feeds
those spectacular fountains at the Bellagio. And Robert E. Parker's
essay, "The Social Costs of Rapid Urbanization in Southern Nevada,"
points out that "[t]he unrelenting construction, coupled with high
winds, creates conditions that literally makes Las Vegas air unsafe
to breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Other contributors, however, offer a more intimate glimpse of the
"real" Las Vegas, and they leave us with a sense of what it's like
behind the glittering neon facade. Brian Frehner, for instance,
recalls the curious experience of growing up in Las Vegas in the
1970s: "Having 'juice' was everything when I was a kid," recalls
Frehner, referring to the fine art of using connections to cadge
freebies. "You couldn't actually see it, but you knew when someone
had it." And Kit Miller introduces us to some of the men and women on
whose hard work the whole glittering enterprise is based: cooks, pot
washers and waitresses, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "Serving wench" Cindy Trudell, for example, remembers the good old
days: "When the mob was running Vegas," she recalls, "everyone made
money."</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta have your meters, always test the wires," says Mario
Basurto, whose job it is to maintain the neon signs for which Vegas
is so famous. "You can get shocked pretty bad, 480 volts." Even a
room service waiter is at risk of a shock: "[W]hen you knock on the
door," says Mark Zartarian, "you never know whether the person on the
other side has got a gun ... a naked woman, or both."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs, too, can be seen as an icon of pop culture, a place
where Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra retreated when they weren't
playing Vegas or making movies in Hollywood. But Mary Jo Churchwell,
a Palm Springs native who returned to the desert community in
midlife, insists on showing us a kinder and gentler era and a more
inviting landscape than we are accustomed to seeing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our shelf of local lore is woefully short," she announces at the
outset, and she finds the outsiders who have written about the place,
ranging from Cleveland Amory to Norman Mailer, to be condescending
when they are not clueless.</TE>
<TE>   So she sets herself the task of telling the tale from the point of
view of the so-called "Prickly Pears," the men and women who
pioneered the little village of Palm Springs in the 1920s, when it
was described by one such desert-dweller as "a place of two or three
score of unpretentious cottages scattered along half a dozen palm-
and pepper-shaded streets."</TE>
<TE>   "For pastime sometimes we'd get out and sit on the curb there
across from the Desert Inn on Palm Canyon and take a .410 shotgun and
shoot bats. Out of the air," recalls another old-timer about the
summer days when the temperature soared and the population dwindled.
"The constable would be with us. He'd shoot them too, you know."</TE>
<TE>   Churchwell discharges her task with wit, grace and wry good humor.
The stories that she tells so well, reaching back to the 1850s and
ending with a visit to what she calls "my private corner of
paradise," are invariably charming and often deeply nostalgic. Still,
she is always mindful of the irony that suffuses every effort at
building cities in the desert, no less in Palm Springs than in Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, for example, she pauses to consider the strange combinations
that grow when people, plants and even water are imported from
somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "The best you can say for eucalyptus is that it's not tamarisk, a
thoroughly successful tree introduced from Arabia in 1909," she
quips. "It can only be managed, that is, pulled up, dug up, burned,
sprayed, bulldozed ... and still it sends up shoots with a new and
vengeful vigor, all over the place, every day of the week."</TE>

<DH>SELLING BEN CHEEVER: Back to Square One in a Service
Economy, A Personal Odyssey,  By Benjamin Cheever, Bloomsbury: 286
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.T. MAX</AU>
<BD>D.T. Max is a contributing editor to the Paris Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memoirs are normally acts of exorcism, but "Selling Ben Cheever" is
more an act of masochism. Having received a chilly reception from his
publishers when he approached them with the draft of a new novel, his
third, Ben Cheever decided to quit writing and take a series of
service jobs. "This is a book about failure," he writes in his
preface, "and I haven't even been consistently successful at that."</LD>
<LD>   That's an odd, courageous and profoundly un-American thing to say.
Failure is a story few people, writers included, want to get close
to, which makes Cheever's voyage through the minimum-wage economy at
the age of fortysomething both affecting and exceptional.</LD>
<LD>   For his sins, Cheever goes to work, mostly in the malls in and
around White Plains, N.Y., "eat[ing] dog food ... in discreet little
bites," as he puts it. He is a salesman at Nobody Beats the Wiz,
where he has to ask the assistant manager for a bathroom break. He
makes sandwiches at Cosi, the upscale cafe, where he keeps forgetting
the ingredients and where he is nicknamed "Slow G" for Slow Gramps.
He sells cars at a GM showroom, when anyone with an ounce of talent
is on the Toyota lot next door. At times he does adequately, but he
never really does well. He tends to quit just before being fired.</LD>
<TE>   Although born into the preppy classes--he is the son of the writer
John--there is nothing condescending in his experiences. Once he is
about to sell an expensive Mac to a woman at CompUSA when another
comes in asking for screw sleeves. He desperately tries to satisfy
her, to get back to his big score, only to be interrupted by a man
wanting a cable. "At my back I could almost hear that other sale
going away, slipping from my grasp," he writes with an edge of
desperation. Eventually, he decides to try to cut his losses: When he
runs into his first customer again he started "gushing apologies
....'Oh, it's all right,' she said. 'I already bought the computer.'"</TE>
<TE>   Cheever is also brave enough to let himself be the least appealing
character in his book. Even his kids, blond mementos of his earlier
life, are repulsed by how far he has sunk. When one accompanies him
to work at the Wiz, he asks if his father is still a writer. "Sure I
am," Cheever replies, adding to readers, "the bluff being a basic
parental move." There's an admirable honesty to any writer willing to
record that moment.</TE>
<TE>   Another time he sells H. Cabot Lodge a computer and tells him that
he too "has a famous name." Lodge is polite but could care less:
Cheever is the help. And there are all the anonymous characters who
parade through these pages: the indignant blond with the good figure,
the man in suspenders who degraded Cheever when he accidentally
dropped a Buffalo chicken nugget in the mayonnaise. People who have
money are always jerks, one CompUSA salesman tells him. Nothing in
this book would suggest otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Life is tough on those who sell, and when Cheever makes $4,000 one
month as a GM salesman, he almost cries. "It's shaming to admit, but
this counts as one of the half-dozen happiest moments of my life," he
writes. "My heart was racing, my pulse was roaring in my ears. I
could feel tingling in the soles of my feet."</TE>
<TE>   Ashamed but insistent: That's Ben, your sales associate. He learns
never to say "May I help you?"--we'll just turn away--and instead
"Who's the lucky person buying a new car today." In a word, he learns
to sell and, in the process, passes on a few of the profession's
dirty little tricks.</TE>
<TE>   Don't buy the repair warranty at CompUSA. Check the numbers the
car dealership gives you. If the sales guy pushes a certain computer,
it's because it's a "spiff"--marked for extra commission. Here's
another one: car salesmen always give you the leasing cost and the
financing cost. Why? That way you think you're making the decision,
but either way he's making a sale.</TE>
<TE>   As Cheever masters these techniques, you see him changing, and
each little alteration in his personality breaks your heart. Because
what Cheever is doing isn't so different from what we are doing,
melding ourselves to our workplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Human relationships, we begin to see in the course of "Selling Ben
Cheever," are about selling because all interaction is really
persuading. And the secret to persuasion is the ability to make
others trust you. One Wiz instructor writes on the blackboard:
"F.U.D. Fear. Uncertainty. Doubt" and tells Ben that overcoming them
is the key to a sale. Take the customer out of his anxieties and you
bring him to the cash register. This book is full of such Dale
Carnegie-like tips.</TE>
<TE>   These revelations, ugly little insights into the business of
business, don't make you angry by the end. They make you feel alive.
You see them as part of the endless social mechanism by which we love
and are loved. If part of the time you are the customer, the rest of
the time you are the salesman. We all do it. To know this is to know
something important, something ultimately calming. "Selling Ben
Cheever," to use what the publishing industry calls a "selling
quote," is a smart, brave and unusual book that should be read by
anyone interested in the shape of the modern workplace--that is, of
modern life.</TE>

<LD>IRISH WILLOW</LD>
<LD>   By Chris Arthur</LD>
<LD>   The Davies Group: 234 pp., $19.95</LD>
<TE>   For all their crafted loveliness, essays start and end in a single
point of view. Call it solitude. Call it elitism. The play of
language and meaning is literature's highest form of artifice. It is
also the scene of some of the deepest dredging a consciousness can
reveal. And watch, the author's childhood is always a large part of
the subject matter, in this case a middle-class Ulster Protestant
childhood. It is well that the author begins and ends with what he
knows. Essays demand such precision: the balance between the note of
authority in the author's voice and the hint of randomness is
crucial.</TE>
<TE>   On the neat, structural surface, "Irish Willow" is a collection of
essays on patterns and meaning and reasons for doing things and
different ways of living, what Chris Arthur calls "series of fallings
through."</TE>
<TE>   In a bad essay, a reader senses the desperate grasping for
metaphor; in a good essay, there is the feeling of wandering and
meeting a conclusion, a lack of effort because meaning is everywhere,
if we only tune ourselves perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these essays achieve that artlessness, and the writing in
all of them is unusual. The story behind the pattern of "Blue Willow"
china, the source of the old Norse word for "book" and the burdens of
religion in Northern Ireland are bonus insights in a
well-proportioned collection of memories.</TE>
<TE>   We are indeed, as Arthur hoped, plunged "without warning into
unexpected pools and oceans."</TE>

<TE>   MY FORBIDDEN FACE: Growing Up Under the Taliban, A Young Woman's
Story</TE>
<TE>   By Latifa</TE>
<TE>   Talk/Miramax: 210 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Like the "Diary of Anne Frank," "Zlata's Diary" and "A Chorus of
Stones," "My Forbidden Face" is the story of war told by a child
caught in the middle of growing up. Latifa (a pseudonym) is 16 when
the Taliban take power in Kabul, where she and her family live.</TE>
<TE>   She has already seen more than a decade of war. Her mother, a
doctor who cannot practice under the Taliban, has already sunk deep
into a depression of isolation, tortured motherhood and suffocating
repression. Her sister, a journalist, escapes to Pakistan, then to
America. One brother stays soft and kind; the other is hardened
beyond recognition after his own childhood is guillotined by brutal
civil war and a stay in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Latifa's future dissolves before her eyes when the Taliban take
power. She must wear a burka; she cannot pursue her education, much
less a career; and she cannot even seek medical help in her own
country when she gets pleurisy, because doctors cannot treat women.
Her mother is besieged by midnight cries for help from women who have
been raped or beaten in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Latifa starts a clandestine school for younger children, boys and
girls. "They want to rob us of life," she writes of the Taliban. Last
May, Elle magazine flew Latifa and her parents to Paris so that she
could tell her story. A fatwa was decreed against them, and they were
unable to return until the Taliban were ousted. This is her story,
told with a young girl's unflinching faith in the future.</TE>

<TE>   AQUARIUMS OF PYONGYANG</TE>
<TE>   Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag</TE>
<TE>   By Kang Chol-hwan and Pierre Rigoulot</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Korean by Yair Reiner</TE>
<TE>   Basic Books: 238 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   "Aquariums of Pyongyang" is the first book to appear in the West
describing firsthand the hard-labor concentration camps in North
Korea, where 150,000 to 200,000 people are imprisoned. When Kang
Chol-hwan was 10, in 1978, he and his family were sent to a camp to
be "reeducated." His grandparents were wealthy North Korean
Communists living in Japan, who returned with their children to North
Korea because Chol-hwan's grandmother was especially committed to its
communist future.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she was brought, after her husband's mysterious
disappearance, to Yodok, North Korea's largest camp. This is where
Chol-hwan and his sister, father, grandmother and uncle spent 10
years (other family members were "excused" for various reasons).
Chol-hwan learned to hunt rats to supplement starvation rations of
corn and acorn paste. He saw hangings and beatings (including women
beaten for becoming pregnant).</TE>
<TE>   When his family was released in 1987, Kang found himself in danger
of being arrested again for listening to "banned radio." In 1992, he
escaped to South Korea via China, one of few who managed to escape
before the famine in North Korea reached its peak. He is now a
journalist in Seoul. "All during my childhood," Kang writes, "Kim Il
Sung [North Korea's leader] had been like a god to me. A few years in
the camp cured me of my faith."</TE>

<HD>From Berlin to Broadway</HD>
<DH>KURT WEILL ON STAGE, By Foster Hirsch, Alfred A. Knopf: 406
pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY SMITH</AU>
<BD>Wendy Smith is the author of "Real-Life Drama: The
Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before his death in 1950, Kurt Weill had to contend with critics
in both his native and adopted countries who dismissed his success in
America as an unworthy commercial compromise of the great music he
had created in Germany before he fled Nazi persecution in 1933. To
them, the syncopated rhythms and mordant melodies of "Die
Dreigroschenoper" (The Threepenny Opera) and "Mahagonny" were the
"real" Kurt Weill, and the smoother, sometimes more sentimental
sounds of Broadway hits such as "One Touch of Venus" or even the
ambitious "Lost in the Stars" were, to quote Harold Clurman,
"synthetic ... increasingly facile ... artistically nondescript."</LD>
<LD>   Nonsense, declares Foster Hirsch, who has no use for "the
persistent legend of two monolithic Kurt Weills confronting each
other across vast cultural and geographic distances." His
appreciative study of Weill's theatrical work makes an ardent brief
for the "essential continuity" in the career of "the century's first
major crossover composer," and "crossover" is not a put-down in this
author's lexicon.</LD>
<TE>   A professor of film at Brooklyn College who has published books on
topics ranging from film noir to the Actors Studio, Hirsch clearly
has considerable sympathy for the composer who wrote in 1946, "In a
deeply democratic country like ours, art should belong to the people
[and] should be 'popular' in the highest sense of the word." Indeed,
"Kurt Weill on Stage" is a welcome addition to the never-full-enough
shelf of serious nonfiction for the general reader: written in
unpretentious, accessible prose; effectively but not excessively
researched; substantive without being overly long. Hirsch shares
Weill's belief that people can be entertained and enlightened at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   The text focuses almost entirely on Weill's work; discussion of
his unorthodox but enduring marriage to Lotte Lenya, for example, is
brief though insightful. This makes sense: Comments throughout the
book reveal Weill as a man almost no one knew intimately, and the
central drama of his life was artistic. Whether you see it as a
decline into facile commercialism or, as Hirsch does, a consistent
and courageous struggle to create a new form of music theater,
Weill's career raises questions still pertinent today about the
relationship between high culture and popular art. These are not
uniquely American questions, but they are especially relevant  in a
nation where modern mass media were created. And it seems very
American that they're exemplified here by the son of a Jewish cantor
who saw no conflict in translating the ideals of radical German
artists to the Broadway stage.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch wastes no time on Weill's birth in 1900 or childhood in
provincial Dessau but jumps right to his immersion in the heady
cultural stew of Weimar Berlin. While studying with composer
Ferruccio Busoni, a champion of "pure" abstract music, 21-year-old
Weill joined the Novembergruppe, an organization of painters,
sculptors, playwrights and musicians who disdained elitist art and
"consciously addressed a broad popular audience." This commitment led
Weill from the concert hall to the theater, and though his early
short operas were primarily dissonant, atonal works, they began to
bear traces of jazz, that "emblem of openness and modernity" that
thrilled Weill and his friends on their visits to Berlin nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   His first collaboration with Bertolt Brecht was a one-act opera
based on five Brecht poems about a mythical American city.
"Mahagonny-Songspiel" caused a sensation at the German Chamber Music
Festival in 1927: not, as Hirsch astutely notes, because it was a
jazz opera (it wasn't) or because its songs were deliberately cast in
melodic, pop form. "It was the fact that the songs had been embedded
in a sophisticated musical texture with distinct high-cultural
overtones that was to cause either delight or outrage." (There are
many passages of sustained musical analysis in "Kurt Weill on Stage,"
and in keeping with Hirsch's overall approach, they are lucidly
written for a general audience.)</TE>
<TE>   "Die Dreigroschenoper" continued the partners' assault on operatic
tradition, as they pushed the performers to talk-sing Weill's
seductive music in a manner that emphasized the words and framed
(over the director's vehement objections) a presentational production
style that stressed the actors' distance from the characters. It was
a smash and a scandal. "Serious musicians thought [Weill] was a
traitor," remarked conductor Maurice Abravanel, "and he was given up
by the avant-garde because he wrote successful things." The Nazis,
who hated genre mixing almost as much as race mixing, mounted
demonstrations at the 1930 opening night of "Mahagonny," which was
even more politically and artistically provocative in its full-length
version. When they came to power in 1933, they shut down three
productions of Weill's opera "Silbersee," and the composer hastily
left town. After an uneasy 30 months based in Paris, where he found
no solid cultural or commercial base, he arrived in New York.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, though only one-third through his text, Hirsch has
established the themes he elaborates in his coverage of Weill's
American career. Weill was already a convinced populist who sought a
wide audience. He did not believe working on Broadway compromised his
art: One of the first shows he saw there was "Porgy and Bess," which
according to Hirsch "remained for Weill at once a model of the kind
of American opera he wanted to create and a reminder of the Broadway
musical's flexible boundaries." He had always sought out prominent
and influential collaborators in Germany; stateside he teamed with
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights Paul Green (for "Johnny Johnson"),
Maxwell Anderson ("Knickerbocker Holiday," "Lost in the Stars"), Moss
Hart and Ira Gershwin ("Lady in the Dark") and Elmer Rice ("Street
Scene").</TE>
<TE>   Detailed accounts of these shows' creations demonstrate the same
Kurt Weill who played good cop to Brecht's "combative rogue cop"
during the stormy rehearsals for "Die Dreigroschenoper." He was,
writes Hirsch, "a cunning strategist who knew how to get what he
wanted"; he kept his cool until tantrum-throwing collaborators ran
out of steam and found that their quiet colleague had won the
allegiance of cast and crew. Only his letters to Lenya, filled with
nasty comments on difficult co-workers, reveal the anger and
frustration he concealed beneath a professionally unflappable
exterior. Hirsch's shrewd use of their correspondence suggests a
central element in Weill's bond with his wife; he needed someone he
could be honest with, and "at heart [Weill and Lenya] remained two
refugees huddling together against a world in which they often felt
misunderstood and unappreciated."</TE>
<TE>   Yet unlike many of his fellow refugees, Weill was happy in America
and intensely patriotic (he became a citizen in 1943). He tagged
along during a tour of "Knickerbocker Holiday"--though the producers
told him he wasn't needed--because, he declared, "I want to see this
glorious country." He strove to capture the nation's sounds in his
work. His first New York show, "Johnny Johnson," was a virtual
pastiche of American music from military marches to cowboy songs,
with some surreal numbers and symphonic underscoring to assert his
high-art credentials. He created a rueful romantic ballad ("Speak
Low") for Mary Martin in "One Touch of Venus" and gave Gertrude
Lawrence "The Saga of Jenny" to bump and grind to in "Lady in the
Dark," but he also wrote a 61/2-minute aria for a character in
"Street Scene" and never abandoned his goal of writing an American
opera. In "Lost in the Stars," he explained, his aim was "to do a
'musical tragedy' for the American theatre so that the typical
American audience (not a specialized audience) can accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Were these ambitious, unconventional Broadway musicals as good as
"Die Dreigroschenoper" or "Mahagonny"? "[They] never reach the level
of his collaborations with Brecht," Hirsch acknowledges, adding
parenthetically, "what else in the musical theatre of the twentieth
century has?" He is content to praise Weill's American shows for the
diversity of their beautiful music and the seriousness of their
intentions, which points the way toward such boundary-smashing
productions as "West Side Story," "Chicago" and virtually every Hal
Prince-Stephen Sondheim show from "Company" to "Sweeney Todd." Yet
these works share with Weill's German catalog a social and political
bite that, it must be admitted, is absent from his American musicals,
a point Hirsch ducks altogether.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think it would have been caving in to the high-art purists
to acknowledge that aspiring to get a typical American audience to
accept musical tragedy is not quite the same as confronting the
Weimar public with acrid theatrical commentary on their society's
bitter contradictions. Hirsch's engaging book is strong on
description and appreciation, a little light on truly probing
cultural criticism. I doubt such criticism was ever his goal, so it
makes more sense to admire "Kurt Weill on Stage" for what it does
achieve: a persuasive argument against "rigid judgmental
divisions--between serious and light, between opera and musicals,
between Europe and America, Berlin and Broadway--which Weill spent
his life trying to abolish."</TE>

<DH>CRITICAL TIMES: The History of the Times Literary
Supplement, By Derwent May, HarperCollins: 606 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE WALDEN</AU>
<BD>George Walden is former chairman of the Booker Prize
and the author, most recently, of "The New Elites: Making a Career in
the Masses."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It comes as a surprise to be reminded that, for all its amiable
idiosyncrasy and august image, at 100 years old the Times Literary
Supplement is younger than the airplane and pretty well as modern as
Stravinsky and non-figurative art. Derwent May affects no venerable
stoop. Dry institutional history this is not: Of 600 enthralling
pages, only some 50 deal with the journal's origins and editorial
intrigues under press barons from Lord Northcliffe to Rupert Murdoch.
In "Critical Times," May has written a review of reviews in narrative
form, a running cultural critique of the 20th century that keeps you
reading to find out who says what about whom next.</LD>
<LD>   The TLS has what the French call "a confidential circulation" that
has never topped 50,000. Two-thirds are sold abroad, mostly to
Americans. That leaves about 12,000 in Britain, of which perhaps half
go to universities and libraries. Individual subscriptions of 6,000
in a population of 59 million, despite a vast expansion of higher
education, is modest. It seems the highly educated have better things
to do than read their country's preeminent literary magazine, even
though it covers stage, cinema and art shows and sports superbly
designed covers in color.</LD>
<TE>   And, as if this weren't enough, rivals have increased, including
some excellent literary supplements distributed free, notably in
America. Given all this competition and the ravages/seductions of the
visual era, it is amazing that this 100-year-old literary dog
continues to dance at all (and it is picking up pace: Under editor
Ferdinand Mount, the circulation has increased by some 10,000 with no
narrowing the formidable coverage).</TE>
<TE>   In literature, there is much fun to be had. And TLS has often led
the game. There is even an element of suspense. Who will deflate
reputations begging to be pricked? We all have our favorites. Would
the TLS critics ever "get" T.S. Eliot or Ezra Pound? They did--Eliot
quite quickly, Pound eventually. And how long would E.H. Carr, the
TLS' communism expert, get away with intellectual murder in his
stubborn rationalization of a literally murderous regime? From the
mid-'30s almost till his death in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   To revert to the TLS' beginnings in 1902, if we expect to find
out-of-touch Edwardians getting things badly wrong, we will be
disappointed. In general the solidity, intelligence and readability
of many early critics are impressive. Monkish fellows they may have
been, many of them Etonians and classical scholars, yet by and large
they and their immediate followers were a formidable bunch, at once
intellectually well-grounded and up with the times.</TE>
<TE>   Some monks were jollier than others, and a poker-faced E.V. Lucas
could write of Kenneth Grahame's "The Wind in the Willows" that "as a
contribution to natural history the work is negligible." Though when
they hit the nail, they hit it square. On Edith Wharton, in 1904:
"Studying new combinations of circumstances, new types of people and
new theories of conduct." On G.K. Chesterton: " ... a cordial
promiscuous gusto, an unpruned fertility of healthy and manly
thinking." On "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man": "Mr. Joyce
gives us wild youth, as wild as Hamlet's, and full of wild music."
Naturally there was uncertainty about D.H. Lawrence, but generations
are there for the changing and, as we have learned, the intellectual
establishments that we should distrust the most are the ones who seek
to neuter their avant-garde by pre-emptive assimilation.</TE>
<TE>   Had the TLS founding fathers been as otherworldly as we imagine,
they would hardly have shoveled books at a young woman reviewer named
Virginia Woolf, who was 23 when she got her first 3 pounds per
column, and her fine intelligence illuminates the first part of the
book. Her startling subtlety, tremulous yet substantial, confirms
that without her Bloomsbury would have been not much more than a nest
of upper-class sexual naughtiness. "How neat and acute that silvering
greyness is--the sparkle that is really dull," she wrote of a
collection of topical essays, catching in a breath an era of literary
consumerism that was still to come. She had her blind spots
("Ulysses" was "a memorable catastrophe"), but made it up with praise
for Joseph Conrad and other awkward fellows.</TE>
<TE>   Of the battles that swarmed beneath the surface, one was American
versus English literature. It wasn't that American writers were
ignored, just that at first they tended to be noticed more often than
they were liked. F.T. Dalton dismissed Pound as "a strange mixture of
the commonplace and the recondite," exquisitely missing what was to
prove the chief strength of American writing--its enviable ease of
transition from the demotic to the cerebral and back. Another
reviewer was as shocked by Hemingway's "unconcern for the
conventional features of good writing" as by his heroes' capacity for
drink. Yet another disliked "The Great Gatsby" for "the really very
unpleasant characters of this story."</TE>
<TE>   Even the blessed Virginia could be sniffy: "There is every reason
to believe that America can bring something new to literature; it is
high time, we may add, that America did"--though she later confessed
that Walt Whitman's new preface to "Leaves of Grass" "rivals anything
we have done for 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, TLS reviews were to illustrate, inadvertently,
how the English preference for social comedy over Balzacian comedie
humaine shrank our novelists' horizons, privileging the easy, knowing
rictus over the reflective smile. The (at times unbearable) lightness
of The Movement--the 1950s set comprising John Wain, Philip Larkin
and Kingsley Amis--contrasted painfully with the avoirdupois of
Nabokov, Bellow, Updike et al. The last two were well noticed in
general, though "Lolita" caused the TLS the same unease as it caused
the American publishers who turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   Many editors, from John Gross to Mount included, have striven to
embrace America, though the imbalance in coverage is to an extent
organic. The TLS is a London-based periodical, and even in the global
village no paper can alienate its roots. Marshall McLuhan was
glowingly reviewed in the TLS, almost as if it foresaw the
compensatory boon for print of the Internet, but in retrospect he
underrated the extent to which the global and parochial can coexist.
His village turns out to be more of an electronic, Spenglarian
megalopolis, and in literature as in life, the local is where the
heart is. So it was inevitable that Amis should be treated as if he
were the equal of Updike and Larkin of Wallace Stevens. May recounts
some of the delicious gossip surrounding the Booker Prize but, had
American authors not been arbitrarily excluded, the gossip would have
been transatlantic and many an award different (that's in stark
contrast to the National Book Award, which is open to all
English-language authors).</TE>
<TE>   The ascent of literary theory, Gross feared, would ruin reading,
as if "no one were allowed to go to church without taking a degree in
theology." Even Elaine Showalter, a supporter of the new canon,
feared "a new orthodoxy, as muffling as scholastic Latin."
Soothingly, Robert Alter suggested that the study of literature in
Britain had always been "under-conceptualised" and was merely
catching up. As I write, the war has flared again, with Raymond
Tallis and Richard Sennett arguing about whether or not Michel
Foucault knowingly infected his partners in San Francisco after
contracting AIDS. If he did, says Tallis, he was living his lie about
AIDS being a myth of the "anti-sexual forces of authority." Tough
stuff for a gentlemanly journal, but then, as W.B. Yeats (for some
reason under-reviewed in the early TLS) wrote, an intellectual hatred
is the worst.</TE>
<TE>   The end of anonymous reviewing came in the mid-1970s, gradually,
sensibly, under Gross. Lawrence Durrell was in favor (less faceless,
catty reviewing), Nikolaus Pevsner against (what happens when one's
friends write bad books?). Star reviewers like Gore Vidal can still
be attracted, if the bait is to vilify Updike, though the growth of
specialism, notably in science and philosophy, employs an army of
mouse-poor academics whose rewards are as meager as Woolf's: In
London's laughably overpriced restaurants, a thousand words will buy
you a single good meal for two, which could explain why the meals
tend to be delivered more promptly than the reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essential for the preservation of the quality of the
culture of a minority that it should continue to be a minority
culture," Eliot laid down in "Notes Towards the Definition of
Culture," a view that would argue against anything so vulgar as the
TLS' promotion campaigns. H.F. Carlill's 1948 review disagreed:
"There is an ethos, a sensibility, that one can imagine permeating a
whole community and becoming part of the tradition of every member of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Carlill's is the argument for pushing circulation without dropping
standards. What else can we do except keep the good things going,
while we continue to imagine? Eliot was on safer ground when he said
how wrong it was to see life as a smooth-running machine, and that
irritation was essential to culture. On that criterion, the TLS is
both admirably cultured and ultra-democratic, for as May shows in
"Critical Times," there is something in its history to irritate just
about everyone.</TE>

<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suspicion, suspense, thrills and mystifications, perfidious
conspiracies concealed in the highest reaches of government and
dogged detection syncopated by tenacity are all served up in Philip
Shelby's spellbinding yarn, "By Dawn's Early Light."</LD>
<LD>   Shelby Ryder (no relation to her author), a financial analyst in
an investment banking firm fired and discredited for having blown the
whistle on a criminal scam, is recruited by MJ-11, a small, elite
division of the General Accounting Office specializing in scrutiny
and pursuit of anomalous activities that may pose a threat to
national security. The diviner's talent and the techniques of
competitive intelligence that stood her in good stead on Wall Street
are enlisted in hunting down furtive foes of the state and of a
society lulled and befuddled by pursuit of money, SUVs and other
consumer goods.</LD>
<TE>   Lurid events ensue and are calmly handled, as if foiling a
conspiracy to kill the president of the United States to force
American foreign policy off course were all in a day's work. The
action grows more vivid by the page, the perils prove more daunting
than any that Pauline had to face, the collateral damage vaster.
Undeterred by the attentions of a formidable killer or by the
casualties clogging public space, Shelby and her fellow MJ-11
scrutineers pursue the lurking treachery and menace that hang
half-concealed over Washington. Sharp minds, sharper computers and
boundless technology expose insidious influences and vicious
bottom-feeders. The complex plot is foiled. The commonweal will be
preserved--at least until next time. "By Dawn's Early Light" is a
lively, enthralling fable forcefully told, just waiting to be made
into a movie.</TE>
<TE>   No thrills, little mystery and a paucity of suspense mark Margaret
Yorke's excellent "A Case to Answer." Well-crafted, well-written,
easy to read, easy to set aside and take up again, Yorke's yarn
revolves around little people leading little lives in a small country
town not far from London, telling little lies (at least most of the
time), vaguely committing to fragile, short-lived friendships. It is
a banal world of work, work-deprivation, retirement, gardening,
hustling, indifference, fish and chips, single mothers, avoidance of
eye contact, lusterless loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   Even the crime is petty: car-napping, pilfering, breaking and
entering. It is into this colorless context that Imogen, a fat,
foolish, sullen teenage girl, out for revenge against dysfunctional
parents, causes trouble for everyone around her and brings about the
death of the nice elderly lady who has taken her in.</TE>
<TE>   In her ensuing anger, Imogen pretends to be pregnant, which
attracts the attention she craves but cures neither her silliness nor
her sulks. We are supposed to feel for her, but all I felt was
exasperation. The tale, on the other hand, captivates by its
fastidious realism. You might find it slow. I'd call it deliberate,
and the deliberate drift inveigles one along toward an end that, as
in life, is no end at all but makes for good reading.</TE>
<TE>   In "Widow's Walk," crime prospers predictably in Boston and
environs, crime-hunting thrives and triumphs as it always does in
Robert B. Parker's novels. An elderly banker-millionaire is found
shot in bed. Murder or suicide? His stunning airhead of a trophy wife
is the prime suspect. Can the blond really be as dumb as she makes
herself out to be? Can snitches' slurs be trusted? Were hit men hired
and, if so, by whom? The sexy red-headed lawyer who represents the
widow brings in Spenser to winkle out who did the dirty deed; and
Spenser, backed up by Hawk and the old team, soon finds himself
caught in a cat's cradle of conspiracies. Suspects (and non-suspects
too) begin to fall like leaves in wind before Spenser unravels the
web of intrigue, indiscretion, malversation, defalcation and
skulduggery. Parker proves fun to read as ever; Pearl the Wonder Dog
(ah! woe) is growing old, but Spenser and true love Susan remain
reliably resourceful and facetious. One mystery, though, remains
unsolved: Why do people have to pause for a shower when danger looms
and they are in a hurry?</TE>
<TE>   In "Flesh and Blood," Jonathan Kellerman's new thriller, Alex
Delaware, clinical psychologist and sleuth extraordinaire, is back on
the warpath. One of his old patients, Lauren Teague, has been shot
and dumped in an alley off Sepulveda Boulevard. As Alex and his
sidekick, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, investigate her
execution-style murder, they uncover her penchant for stripping, her
entrepreneurial lubricity, her prudent investments, her long-standing
hang-ups and carousel affairs. The inquiry into who might have offed
the precociously promiscuous university student, who was also
nervous, needy, neurotic and pining for a father, or at least a
father figure, broadens to include a notorious Hollywood madam, a
millionaire sex tycoon and his brood, several members of the
university faculty and another girl student who mysteriously
disappeared long before.</TE>
<TE>   Delaware drives a lot, broods a lot and exasperates his
girlfriend. But fewer clues turn up than reflective ruminations, and
the investigation treads water. Dialogue is almost as clever as ever;
action is more muted than words; violence is brief and spare; final
revelations are convulsive and unexpected. Kellerman is not exactly
at the top of his form, though near it. If you're a hardened Delaware
addict, you'll go for the familiar formula. If you are not, you can
give it a miss.</TE>

<DH>CELESTIAL TREASURY: From the Music of the Spheres to the
Conquest of Space, By Marc Lachieze-Rey and Jean-Pierre Luminet,
Cambridge University Press: 208 pp., $60</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET WERTHEIM</AU>
<BD>Margaret Wertheim is the author of "The Pearly Gates
of Cyberspace: A History of Space From Dante to the Internet."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Artists and scientists, Robert Oppenheimer wrote, "live always at the
'edge of mystery'--the boundary of the unknown" and for no group of
scientific practitioners is this characterization more apposite than
cosmologists, they who dare to envision the universal whole.</LD>
<LD>   Few areas of inquiry bring human minds so constantly into contact
with the event horizons of current understanding, so posing the
greatest challenges. As a creative response to the ineluctable desire
to know how and from whence we arise, cosmological theorizing, for
all its claims to truth, is an exercise of the grandest sort in
myth-making. That at least is the thesis underlying Marc Lachieze-Rey
and Jean-Pierre Luminet's sumptuous "Celestial Treasury."</LD>
<LD>   Ostensibly a history of (primarily Western) cosmological thinking,
"Celestial Treasury" advances a far more radical agenda. Rather than
presenting their subject as a progressive history, onward and upward
from pagan darkness to the light of contemporary scientific genius,
Luminet and Lachieze-Rey subversively interweave ancient and modern
ideas, continually, if gently, alerting the reader to profound
resonances between past and present.</LD>
<TE>   For all our superior observational technology, our sophisticated
theoretical frameworks and our fiendishly complex mathematics, we are
not so far from our forebears as we often like to think.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the ancient Greeks' idea that everything in the physical
world is composed of four basic elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Antiquated baloney, you might think, but Luminet and Lachieze-Rey
point out that contemporary physics rests on a not-dissimilar
premise.</TE>
<TE>   Today the four "elemental" constituents said to be responsible for
all phenomena are the four fundamental forces: gravity, the
electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces (which
hold together the nuclei of atoms). These forces, they write, "have
an identical function to the elements of the classical world."</TE>
<TE>   In our drive to know the universe, it is the imagination that
engages first, long before the analytical or empiricist spirit kicks
in. Johannes Kepler, the great precursor to Isaac Newton and the
founding father of modern astrophysics, envisioned the universe as
God's play: As he saw it, the aim of the astronomer was to learn to
play God's game. To do that, the mind must be open to the "facts,"
but critically it must also be creatively susceptible. As Albert
Einstein once declared: "The gift of fantasy has meant more to me
than any talent for abstract, positive thought."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout history, the creative impulse has been a central engine
of cosmological theorizing. Take, for example, the Greek and medieval
view that the dance of the planets and stars must be explained by a
combination of strictly circular motions. Just as a windup ballerina
can be made to perform a complex dance, even though her mechanism
consists only of circular gears, so cosmologists for 2,000 years
believed the motions of the heavenly bodies could be described by an
intricate celestial clockwork.</TE>
<TE>   The apotheosis of this imaginative mechanizing was the dizzyingly
elaborate system of the Alexandrian astronomer Claudius Ptolemy. So
complex was Ptolemy's system that in the 13th century Alfonso the
Great, seeing the labors of his astronomers, is said to have remarked
that had he been present at the Creation he would have given the Lord
some hints about simplification. The Ptolemaic conception of the
cosmos dominated both Arab and European views of the heavens until
the 17th century, when Kepler, Newton and others radically
re-envisioned the universe, replacing the cosmic gears with a
quasi-infinite network of stellar masses held in place by the force
of gravity.</TE>
<TE>   But be not so quick to judge Ptolemy's vision. Luminet and
Lachieze-Rey (an astronomer and astrophysicist, respectively) note
that in principle a Ptolemaic-style system could account for the
heavenly dance with a high degree of accuracy. In the 19th century,
the French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier demonstrated
that, in fact, any periodic motion can be described by a combination
of circular motions.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, physics today retains a love affair with the circle.
Current favorite contender for a unified theory of the four forces is
string theory, which holds that all particles can be understood as
the various vibrational states of microscopic circular loops, or
"strings."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout history, cosmological ideas have refracted again and
again through our mental prisms, metamorphosing into new variations
on old themes. One of the great joys of this book is seeing the ways
in which certain tropes keep returning, as if they hold some peculiar
power of enchantment over the human mind.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps my favorite example is the continually recurring
fascination with the Platonic solids: a unique set of five forms
whose crystalline symmetry has held artists and astronomers, mystics
and mathematicians in thrall for thousands of years. As with the
cube, whose faces are all squares, the Platonic solids are perfectly
regular polyhedra, having all their faces the same. There are just
five such forms possible: along with the cube (which has six sides),
are the tetrahedron (four sides), the octahedron (eight sides), the
icosahedron (20 sides) and the dodecahedron (12 sides). Since their
discovery, these five forms have been imbued with almost mystical
power.</TE>
<TE>   Plato paired the first four with the four basic elements: Earth
was paired with the cube, water with the icosahedron and so on. The
fifth, the dodecahedron, he equated with the supposed fifth element,
or quintessence, the mysterious substance of which the celestial
bodies were said to be composed.</TE>
<TE>   In the 17th century, Kepler thought he had found in these five
forms the secret of the planets' arrangement in the solar system. He
turned out to be wrong, but, bizarrely, the idea of a polyhedral
arrangement to the cosmos has resurfaced within the framework of
general relativity, which allows for some truly extraordinary
topologies, including ones in which space takes on a
pseudo-crystalline structure.</TE>
<TE>   One such arrangement is an infinite lattice of dodecahedrons.
"Celestial Treasury" includes an exquisite computer image of this
enigmatic spatial structure from the Geometry Center at the
University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   In making their case for cosmological resonances through the ages,
Luminet and Lachieze-Rey critically rely not just on words but also
on pictures. The uniqueness of this book lies in its juxtaposition of
historical images with those generated by contemporary astrophysics,
such as the contrasting of Kepler's polyhedral model with the
Minnesota computer model.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, illustrations from medieval manuscripts of the six days
of biblical creation sit side by side with computer simulations of
black holes and the origins of space time; Renaissance visions of
stellar vortexes are paired with photographs of spiral galaxies taken
by the Hubble Space Telescope.</TE>
<TE>   Replete with extended foldouts and delicately detailed inserts,
"Celestial Treasury" is a stunningly beautiful survey of the science,
mythology and iconography of the cosmos through the ages. This is the
most gorgeous coffee-table cosmology book in years.</TE>
<TE>   Such lavish production bespeaks its origins: The book is an
offshoot of a 1998 exhibition entitled "Figures du Ciel" at the
Bibliotheque Nationale de France, and it is from that library's
extensive collection that most of the older images are taken.</TE>
<TE>   As with two recently ended and superb exhibitions in our own
city--"Treasures of the Great Libraries of Los Angeles" at the UCLA
Hammer Museum and "Devices of Wonder" at the Getty--"Celestial
Treasury" demonstrates that science can be an engine not only of
knowledge but also of aesthetic inspiration. Beneath the radar of
pedagogical impulse, science, like art, stirs our imaginations.</TE>

<HD>Elegies for a Vanished World</HD>
<DH>THE COLLECTED STORIES  OF JOSEPH ROTH, By Joseph Roth,
Translated from the German by Michael Hofmann W.W. Norton: 282 pp.,
$27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY WILENTZ</AU>
<BD>Amy Wilentz is the author of, most recently, "Martyrs'
Crossing: A Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mark of a Joseph Roth short story is the leap into a kind of
magical elegy. The pain of loss is everywhere in his work, especially
in the stories collected here by Michael Hofmann, his adept
translator. Roth the writer emerged from the rubble of a lost world,
the world of Europe before World War I, where everything was known or
knowable and nothing would ever change--or if it did, never for the
worse.</LD>
<TE>   And then, in the blink of an eye, an archduke was assassinated and
the whole elaborate artifice fell apart. Roth has made that historic
moment into a psychological moment, too, for his characters: Loss of
innocence goes along with loss of home, or of homeland. His fictional
terrain is a land of specific places--the bad corners of certain
cities, squalid little villages near bigger villages, train stations
along the way, town squares, parks and cemeteries--in a world where
all the reasonable maps have been lost or, worse, burned. "Already,"
one of his narrators says, "I had forgotten my birthplace, the little
town in Russia which no longer exists. It has been blown up by guns,
burnt down by fires, trampled upon by boots, and now the golden maize
flowers where once were dirty lanes and houses, and the wind blows
over the streets and pavements of my childhood. Other towns grow rich
and powerful or, if they are condemned to die, they die slowly, death
torments them for a hundred years or a thousand. But our little town
it abruptly mowed down with its big sharp scythe."</TE>
<TE>   The pain of loss is here, it is true, but also the handiwork of
artistic reconstruction, the life-giving force with which Roth tries
to rebuild and refurnish his lost homeland. As he remembers specific
moments, he reconstructs the disappeared: both the people and the
places, and, of course, the times. There is the moment in "The Blind
Mirror" when Fini, a drab little office girl, comes alive to romance,
walking with a man in the park, "different by night, warm and
nurturing. She couldn't see what was behind the trees, what was
happening in the stupefying light of the lamps, those stalled silver
lightnings that plunged the distance to the next light in deeper
darkness." There is a moment in the dazzling "Strawberries" when
night falls over the fields: "How suddenly the evenings used to fall
there with remote glittering stars in a frozen blue sky, with short
vehement darkening indoors, with howling devils in the stoves, with
ghosts spun from nothing. The sun was visible for half an hour a day.
It was pale and white, obscured by a frozen windowpane. Narrow paths
were trodden into deep snow; people walked between tall white walls
of snow." (Not just war but poverty, too, patrols the perimeter of
Roth's literary universe, just as it did Galicia, the part of Ukraine
where he was born.)</TE>
<TE>   To read this seductive collection is to be invited into a writer's
notebook--a very great writer's notebook. The book has some of the
odd pleasures one might have got looking into Proust's trash can. It
bobsleds down from the pristine summits of perfect, resonant
storytelling to the very depths of artistic raveling and
exasperation. In some cases, you can almost feel Roth saying to
himself, "No, that's never going to work" and simply putting down his
pen and turning to his whisky and the evening's entertainment. Roth
has been compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and they do share a similar
obsession with lost worlds. But a few of the pieces published in this
collection ("The Triumph of Beauty" comes to mind) are reminiscent
not so much of Fitzgerald at his best but of the American writer's
incessant Saturday Evening Post spewings--they are minor, tossed-off
works of an obvious master.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's a privilege to be disappointed over and over by so
able and profound a writer because the disappointment comes from the
stuttering brilliance of what is achieved even in Roth's slapdash
moments and from the knowledge that much higher goals were reached in
his other works. In this collection, story ideas and characters are
begun, then left off and then come up again in a different guise in a
different story further on. You can see the hero of "The Honors
Student," the odious, apple-polishing hypocrite Anton Wanzl, in a
later incarnation in the overweening, self-regarding, deceitful
narrator of "Youth," but both stories are ambitious attempts, not
final immutable works, the first one published in 1916 in Osterreichs
Illustrierte Zeitung, an Austrian newspaper, the second unpublished
in Roth's lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the pieces collected here were not published while the
writer lived; five others are unfinished. One cannot help but wonder
whether--for all their brilliance, for all the fairy tale magic of
them, for all their pure, frost-encrusted, plowed-dirt Eastern
Europeanness--Roth intended them for publication at all. (One is
reminded of Kafka's famous command to his executor: "Burn
everything!" His will was disregarded in this matter, of course.)</TE>
<TE>   Roth was himself almost an archetypal figure of Eastern European
fiction. Born at the eastern edge of what was then the
Austro-Hungarian empire (the ungainly but seemingly unshakable
colossus that in its last days included Prague and Vienna, Moravia
and Silesia, Ukraine and Poland as well as the recently tormented
Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia), he served in the Austrian
army during World War I and later became a journalist in Vienna
working for German newspapers. But for Roth--who was also a Jew and
therefore embodied the conflict that was eating away at old
Europe--fact proved inadequate to the trauma, upheaval and
fascination of his times, so he turned to fiction; he married, he
lived in France, continued to file dispatches to various respected
papers and traveled around post-revolutionary Russia.</TE>
<TE>   His theater became the exile's diaspora, and so he became a
modernist. You cannot read these stories or indeed any of his novels
without thinking that this is the soil from which all great 20th
century fiction grew. Roth's was a difficult life, and not only
because of war and exile. Only six years after they were married,
Roth's wife had a schizophrenic breakdown from which she never
recovered (his father also had died in an insane asylum). While she
sickened, he went on to greater and greater success with his work,
including "The Radetzky March" (1932), his near-allegorical novel
about the decline of the Hapsburg empire--about the end of Europe as
he knew it. Exiled from Germany, his work blacklisted by the Nazis as
they readied for the next war, Roth retired to Paris, where he sank
deeper and deeper into monarchism politically and alcoholism
personally. He died in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   It's odd how in his stories especially--in part because they are
flawed--Roth lets us see how close elegy is to humor or, at least,
that the two are built on the same foundation of loss. You feel he is
always on the verge, though possibly in tears, of telling a Jewish
joke. For example, in his story about a destroyed Russian town ("This
Morning, a Letter Arrived"), he writes about all the residents who've
been dispersed to the four corners, including the baker Mendel
Surokin, who "now runs a restaurant in Tokyo, is married to a
Japanese woman, and has six children." One day, Herr Kobritz, a
wealthy traveling tradesman from the same town, finding himself in
Tokyo, "sat down in a restaurant, and was served some excellent fish.
The fish was completely according to his taste and rich Herr Kobritz
was already beginning to philosophize, expounding his theory that the
whole world was just a village, one big village. How else was it
possible to explain that he could travel to the end of the world, to
Tokyo, there to be served fish of the very sort that his cook at home
prepared for him?" This of course is when the chef and owner, looking
quite Japanese, walks up to him and says, "Good evening, Herr
Kobritz." Kobritz, postponing the punch line as in any good joke,
thinks: "So the world really was just one big village, where everyone
knew the wealthy Herr Kobritz."</TE>
<TE>   Of course Kobritz, who represents the old order, is wrong, and
what gives him the illusion of being home--the presence of the baker
Surokin in Tokyo--is in fact prima facie evidence that home has been
destroyed. "My strongest experience," Roth wrote, "was the War and
the destruction of my fatherland." How like Roth to twist it, to play
with the pain and, finally, to make a joke of it.</TE>

<HD>Everyone Into the Talent Pool</HD>
<DH>A series of showcases gave minority actors the chance to be
seen and networks the chance to improve their record on diversity.
But will the faces on TV change?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON and DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Smith and his entourage glided through the crowded lobby of
North Hollywood's El Portal Theater, greeting other guests waiting
for the ABC talent showcase to begin. Emmy Award-winning director
Paris Barclay scrambled for a seat inside the large theater, and
actor-turned-producer and director Charles Haid schmoozed, while
network honchos and casting directors hobnobbed.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, who has his own production company, and most of the other
attendees were scouting for fresh talent--new faces to light up their
upcoming projects. Such showcases are commonplace in L.A., but this
one and others staged in recent weeks were strictly for actors like
Howard Walker, Kyme, Mark Fernandez and Esther Riggin--minority
actors, some experienced and some less so. The showcases represent a
collective attempt by the networks to answer years of criticism that
the major networks have chronically bypassed minority performers and
reneged on promises to make their prime-time casts more diverse.</LD>
<LD>   While hoping for the break all actors long for, the performers at
the minority showcases have become part of a larger game this
spring--recruits in the primary networks' first major quest for
minority talent, timed to coincide with the frenzied casting season
for series prototypes, or pilots.</LD>
<TE>   The actors' backgrounds varied. Walker has attracted notice from
casting agents who compare him to Chris Tucker or Eddie Murphy, but
has little professional experience. Kyme has made several appearances
on stage and TV, and in movies including the early Spike Lee film
"School Daze." She is hoping to get back in the game after taking
time off to have a family.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years of doing stand-up, Filipino comic Mark Fernandez,
in his late 20s, wanted to get in front of the right people. "It's
just really tough to get the industry folks to come out and see you.
It's gotten quite frustrating. I wanted to come out here because I
really, really want to get into TV and film. I figured I would [take]
my shot."</TE>
<TE>   "Being in front of 80 casting directors can only lead to good
things," said a beaming Gwendoline Yeo, who participated in CBS'
showcase for Asian actors.</TE>
<TE>   The showcases were born out of a controversy, making them
significant not only to the minority actors who took the stage, but
to the entire television industry. Some industry executives maintain
that while they would like more minorities on comedies and dramas,
the talent pool is not large enough. They also privately gripe that
producers and studios--the primary gatekeepers in show
development--have been slow to react to initiatives for more
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the advocates pushing for change say little would have
been done without the threat of lawsuits and advertiser or consumer
boycotts by a multiethnic coalition that includes the NAACP, the
National Latino Media Council, American Indians in Film &amp; Television
and the Asian Pacific Media Coalition. The coalition has given low
marks to the networks' diversity attempts. Last year, for example,
there was an increased number of African Americans cast in regular
and recurring roles, but few Latinos, Asians and other minorities
were cast.</TE>
<TE>   Since July 2000, when NAACP President Kweisi Mfume first blasted
the networks for perpetuating what he called a "white landscape," the
coalition has pressured the networks and made it clear this year that
it wants results as soon as this spring, when the networks announce
their roster of new programs for next season.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to see real change in the new shows, or else we're
going to have a real problem," says coalition leader Karen Narasaki,
executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium.</TE>
<TE>   The showcases held in December and January by ABC, NBC, CBS and
Fox were open to black, Asian American, Native American and Latino
talent. Casting agents from each network attended their rivals'
showcases. In addition to the traditional showcases, NBC attracted
more than 150 Latino and Asian Americans to the Laugh Factory in West
Hollywood for an open-mike comedy competition.</TE>
<TE>   How many actors will be actually funneled into pilots is still
unclear, and reaction among the actors and the casting executives who
watched them is mixed. Although NBC's executive vice president of
casting, Marc Hirschfield, was pleased with the response to the
competition, he cautioned that the showcases may not produce an
immediate change in front of the camera: "It's going to take some
time before we get some really solid results."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, for one, found the experience discouraging. He beat out
four other finalists at the Laugh Factory show and won a week's paid
engagement at the club. But other opportunities have not blossomed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had two or three meetings with agents, but nothing really
happened," he says. "The agents I talked to say they would only take
established people who wanted to go to the next level. So in a sense,
I'm right back at square one. I'll keep on plugging, but it's a
little frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Yeo said, "I got six different meetings out of
the showcase. I went on six auditions, and I got call-backs on two of
them." That led to parts on UPN's new comedy "Random Years" and
"General Hospital."</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm so happy with the way things have turned out," she
says. "I hope this is just the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   That was the length of most of the scenes in the showcases, and
how long the participants had to make an impression on casting
directors.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC African American and Native American showcases were held
in large venues, such as the El Portal and the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage. The performers were miked as they acted out scenes
from plays and their energy was uniformly high. A few even ad-libbed.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox showcases had a more intimate feel, staged at Area 51, a
smaller space nestled next to the Improv on Melrose Avenue. Instead
of plays, the scenes were from movies such as "Good Will Hunting" and
TV shows such as "Boston Public."</TE>
<TE>   John Heinsen, a Fox casting executive for such comedies as "That
'70s Show" and "Titus," arrived at the network's Asian American
showcase with high expectations. Sitting in the cramped space,
Heinsen took notes as he watched a willowy actress named Esther K.
Chae. He smiled as Chae's mood switched with an arch of her eyebrow
or a twitch of her lip.</TE>
<TE>   "I like her subtle physicality," Heinsen said later. "You watch
'Ally McBeal' and the whole show is based on that."</TE>
<TE>   Some casting directors approached the showcases with specific
projects in mind. Susan Buck is casting ABC's upcoming sitcom
starring Latino comic George Lopez and thought she would find several
candidates at that network's December Latino showcase. But no one
there seemed right for the comedy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly some of these actors who I will bring in for
other things," Buck says. "I'll put them in my file."</TE>
<TE>   At the Fox Latino showcase, some of the performers appeared to
make an immediate impression, while others struggled to project their
voices to the back of the small club.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Native American event had other difficulties. Some actors
failed to provide head shots--instead, they gave mimeographed copies
of a photograph with a resume on the back. One applicant, Georgina
Lightning, hadn't updated her paperwork in several months, scrawling
"Add--West Wing--Guest Star--Nov. 21/01 Airdate" at the top of her
resume.</TE>
<TE>   If the networks and others approach the showcases with a degree of
trepidation, to the actors they represent another coveted chance to
be seen. Many performers say the initial experience was invigorating;
for a moment, anyway, the barriers to stardom seemed to vanish.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great opportunity to see all these great people who
should be getting roles," says Walker, a 24-year-old actor from Miami
who performed at the ABC African American showcase.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, in his early 20s, and his showcase partner, Benita Krista
Nall, performed a raucous scene from "Johnny &amp; Wilma," by Joseph
Bologna and Renee Taylor, in which a man battles with his girlfriend
over who should be more sexually aggressive. At one point, Walker
pulled off his pants and shirt to display his slim, muscular build,
and the women in the audience roared.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really good and confident up there," Walker says. "I think
everyone in television should have been here to see what we have to
offer. Diversity in television is long overdue, and so many of us
have been overlooked."</TE>
<TE>   Haid, a former "Hill Street Blues" co-star who is now an executive
producer of "The Court," ABC's new Supreme Court drama starring Sally
Field, repeatedly praised the participants.</TE>
<TE>   "We often don't get a chance to see talent on this level," he
says. "It's so nice to see them acting in a theater, not doing a cold
read of a scene in front of us. It takes away some of the pressure.
The circumstances are much better."</TE>
<TE>   But the showcases were intended to level the playing field, not
declaw the highly competitive beast known as Hollywood. For many
performers, the auditions were followed by silence.</TE>
<TE>   Walker's agent, Stephen Rice of the Diverse Talent Group, knew
that Walker had made a big impression and ABC is considering signing
the actor to a holding deal, ensuring access to him for some future
project.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes these things don't translate into something right away,
but it will pay dividends in the long run, I'm sure," Rice says. "The
showcase gave him more exposure in the community. Everyone at all the
networks knows who he is."</TE>
<TE>   Rebekah Salgado, 25, is also keeping her hopes up, even though she
didn't get many calls following her "Good Will Hunting" scene at the
Fox Latino showcase.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of people came up to me after the performance and told
me I was excellent," Salgado says. "But nothing has really happened.
I just have to be optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Salgado quit her full-time public relations job
(she's still working as a freelance consultant) to pursue her
passion, a move frowned upon by her strict parents. Among her credits
are Town Person in the direct-to-video film "Local Boyz" and Young
Woman on PBS' "American Family."</TE>
<TE>   "When you believe in something as much as I do, you have to stay
hopeful," Salgado says.</TE>
<TE>   Also waiting for a response from the African American showcase was
Kyme. She was different from most of her showcase colleagues, having
already tasted a bit of fame as one of the leads in "School Daze,"
Lee's 1988 follow-up to his breakthrough film, "She's Gotta Have It."
Set in an African American college, "Daze" featured a clash between
light- and dark-skinned students, and also starred Laurence
Fishburne, Giancarlo Esposito and Tisha Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   After the film, Kyme pursued New York stage roles and appeared on
Broadway in several shows. She and her husband moved to Los Angeles
in 1996, and she immediately landed an agent and manager. The couple
had a daughter soon afterward, and "that put me out of commission for
a while," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm starting to get out there again, going for co-starring
and guest spots. It's a good mixture in terms of being a mommy. The
business has always been very good to me."</TE>
<TE>   The actress found out about the showcase through her manager, and
she was selected after an audition. In her late 30s, Kyme is not
concerned about competing against newer, younger talent or being
overqualified.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not odd for me to be doing this at all," she says. "Just
look at TV. You don't see a lot of women my age and [women] who are,
as I like to call myself, dark chocolate. Very few of us have gotten
the sitcom, the hourlong drama. How many of us have our name above
the title? There're not many of us who can sit back and say, 'I've
arrived.'"</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the showcase, Kyme says, "The phone has not
exactly been ringing, but let's see what pilot season brings. I'm
hopeful that I'll be seen for some roles that I would not have been
seen on before.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always optimistic. I believe the people who are putting on
the showcases are sincere. I'm not sure if it's going to be the same
old thing because the same people are still in control. We'll just
have to wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   Esther Riggin's look is admittedly unconventional: She says her
Asian features are rounded out by her Cherokee and Irish ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have difficulty convincing people that I'm not too ethnic,"
the Harvard graduate says.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll ask me what I am," she says. "If it's a specifically
Asian role, they want the character to look really Asian. In other
roles, they feel funny casting me with two Caucasian parents, which
is understandable."</TE>
<TE>   Riggin, who was already working steadily in smaller roles in films
and on TV, landed a new agent from the CBS showcase. From the Fox
showcase, she caught the attention of a new manager, Rhonda Young, a
former casting director who has cast films and TV series such as
"Taxi."</TE>
<TE>   "I had a manager before, but he was not really doing anything for
me," Riggin says.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was in the meeting with Rhonda, she picked up the phone
and got me three auditions while I was just sitting there," the
actress continues. "It makes all the difference."</TE>
<TE>   At the Fox showcase, Riggin performed a scene from "Before
Sunrise," the talky European romance starring Julie Delpy and Ethan
Hawke. Wearing a tight ivory-colored dress, she displayed a
confidence and grasp of her character that distinguished her from
other participants.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, she read for a regular role as a sassy legal
assistant on a CBS pilot, "Queens Supreme," being produced by Julia
Roberts' Shoelace Productions. Days later, she read for another
pilot, "Hong Kong Cafe," about friends who run a bar where they show
martial arts films. She did not land any roles.</TE>
<TE>   Although she benefited from the showcases, Riggin is also
concerned about being pigeonholed: "You hope that casting directors
have the imagination to see past [the ethnic appearance]. I worry
that this might hurt me in case they're thinking, 'We're not going
ethnic at this point.'"</TE>
<TE>   Still, she says, the momentum makes it easier to keep the faith in
an industry in which performers' confidence is tested every step of
the way</TE>
<TE>   Few of the performers appear more committed or determined than
Gwendoline Yeo, a participant in CBS' Asian showcase.</TE>
<TE>   Yeo applied for a showcase spot with more than just a rundown of
her credits.</TE>
<TE>   She has her own Web site touting her talents and aspirations.
Under the category of film, the Singapore-born Yeo wrote that she
"loves the world of the independent [film], playing a dominatrix in
Sabina Franca's 'The Studio.' Plays a stiff businesswoman in Victor
Neschaut's 'Issues.' Currently working on an action flick with James
Hong where she plays a genie."</TE>
<TE>   Performing a scene from the film "sex, lies, and videotape" at the
CBS showcase, Yeo wore just a bra, a low skirt "and a Chinese tattoo
in the middle of my chest."</TE>
<TE>   Coalition leader Narasaki says some performers are benefiting from
the showcases and she feels the networks are making a sincere effort.</TE>
<TE>   However, "we've made it very clear that there have been promises
made that we expect to be kept," she says. "We were extremely
disappointed last year, and we have support for taking action if
things don't get better this season."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen J. Smith, ABC's vice president of talent development
programs, echoes other organizers in expressing confidence that
Narasaki and her colleagues will eventually, if not immediately, see
an improvement in ethnic representation on the small screen.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really, really busy with staffing pilots," Smith says.
"The point is, we're providing valuable exposure for people who might
not otherwise have been considered. What's very clear is there really
is an abundance of talent out there."</TE>
<TE>   ABC President Alex Wallau adds that the success of the showcases
should not be measured in numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important is that we cast as wide a net as possible and
broaden the talent pool," he says. "Then in the creative process, the
chips will fall where they may. At the end of the day, we're not in
the quota business. We're not ordering this.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole business is very hard and complicated. When you put
the layer of trying to cast a wider net out there, it makes it even
more complicated. But these showcases make it easier for the talent
to be seen. It expedites the process, so that someone in the crisis
of a casting session can go to people other than those already in the
pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   Of 88 minority performers who participated in ABC's showcases and
script readings, 51 were called to audition for parts in current
network prime-time and daytime series, as well as for the Disney
Channel, which, like ABC, is owned by Disney. Five have been cast in
shows.</TE>
<TE>   And despite the roaring applause that followed ABC's African
American showcase, initially only a few of the 14 actors who took
part have been contacted for follow-up meetings with agents or
producers. However, several now are being called for auditions.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was initially slow after ABC's Native American showcase,
but in recent weeks, most of the 14 participants have been called to
read for parts on daytime soaps such as "General Hospital."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some are up for roles on the network's upcoming
miniseries "Dreamkeepers," which will feature a predominantly Native
American cast.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, participants from the network's Asian American showcase
last December have snared roles on "The Practice" and other shows.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's diversity chief, Mitsy Wilson, was pleased with the reaction
to their four showcases. By early March, seven of the 81 hopefuls had
been offered guest or recurring roles in episodes of "Will &amp; Grace,"
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" and "MAD
TV."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we got a remarkable response," Wilson says. "We're
getting cards and e-mails from some of the people in the showcase
saying they're so grateful we offered them the opportunity.''</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps foremost, the showcases underscore the tentative
relationship that exists between ethnic talent and Hollywood--at this
point a matter of cautious optimism, hedging one's bets and, on the
part of network executives, not antagonizing minority lobbyists who
are both vocal and frustrated by the industry's perceived lack of
cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   For the actors, meanwhile, it's often less about symbolism than
the ongoing struggle to find a job.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, the diversity issue is casting its shadow
over Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Networks hope to improve their record. Producers and studios are
being asked to be more inclusive without sacrificing creative visions
or the quality of shows. And performers in the showcases are clinging
to their dreams that finally, just maybe, that lucky break is just
around the corner.</TE>

<DH>Their 'In the Bedroom' characters were hardly friends, but
Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei have grown close, bonding over the
filming, nominations and their similar career attitudes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Oscar race is loaded with story lines featuring fresh faces, old
pros, front-runners, long shots and years in the wilderness, but few
combine more of these elements than the one starring the two
actresses nominated for their performances in Todd Field's "In the
Bedroom": Sissy Spacek (best actress) and Marisa Tomei (best
supporting actress).</LD>
<LD>   Spacek and Tomei make an unlikely pair. Spacek is from Texas, is
seemingly easygoing (although not about her work) and speaks with a
gentle Southern accent. Tomei, from Brooklyn, is jittery and edgy,
and occasionally slips into Brooklynese. Both women are more
resilient than their manners suggest--which is why they're here.</LD>
<LD>   "We're god-sisters!" Spacek says.</LD>
<TE>   An unstated, though much discussed in the industry, factor in
these nominations is that these two have been "away" for so long.
It's been 15 years since Spacek's last nomination (for best actress
in "Crimes of the Heart"). In the interim, she's raised two kids and
kept her hand in by taking one or two roles a year. Tomei has had a
sturdy if unspectacular career on stage and in films--both studio and
indie--since winning a best supporting actress Oscar for 1992's "My
Cousin Vinny," but no nominations and certainly nothing high profile.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's funny, because I sound like the broad who's been in
vaudeville and come back around and now she's going to do the
talkies," Tomei jokes. "So there's something very old school about it
that I like. I'm still young, so I guess it's all good. I've been
doing lots of plays, lots of other movies. It's really rare to be in
a film that I like so much and that people are responding to."</TE>
<TE>   Tomei and Spacek became joined at the hip first while making the
movie and then while promoting it, and themselves, in the year since
it premiered to acclaim at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. Now the
Miramax-supported marketing that followed their Oscar nominations has
only intensified this relationship. It helps too that they aren't
competing in the same category. Then they'd be more like real
sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "We see each other more than we see anybody else," Spacek says,
seated next to Tomei in a restaurant near Lincoln Center. "What's
weird is that we've gotten to know each other in a different way
since the movie is finished, because when we were working it was very
intense and we were these two other people, Ruth and Natalie."</TE>
<TE>   "And let's face it," Tomei points out, "Ruth didn't like Natalie
too much."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Ruth (Spacek) is the tightly wound wife of Matt (Tom
Wilkinson, Oscar-nominated for best actor) and mother of Frank (Nick
Stahl), a college-age kid who's having a summer fling with Natalie
(Tomei), an older woman with two kids and a violent, estranged
husband. Ruth disapproves of their relationship because Natalie is
from the wrong side of the tracks, carries too much baggage and
threatens to divert Frank from his future prospects. Subsequent
events prove Ruth right, although that doesn't make her any more
sympathetic or Natalie any less so.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bleakness of the material, both actresses say they had
fun making the movie, aside from the fact that it was made for less
than $5 million and was shy on creature comforts.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no tension," Tomei says, "because you know there's a
foundation for you, and when you're in a scene, you know that you're
throwing the ball back and forth. There's a relaxation because you
trust all of the elements that you're working with."</TE>
<TE>   "I think also that we were all really excited about the script and
our roles, and we were really genuinely happy to be there," says the
52-year-old Spacek, who seems to be the kind of person who's really
genuinely happy about a lot of things. "And it's so rare that you
make a film [in] Maine. It was a beautiful place and a real special
time. Todd made me feel, and I bet he did you [Tomei] as well, that
it was the center of the universe. Nothing else was happening outside
of Camden, Maine."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly one of the things that distinguishes "In the Bedroom" is
the performances, which the academy has recognized--for a lot of
reasons. One may be that Spacek and Tomei played convincingly against
type.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Spacek, who has been nominated for Oscars five
times before and won a best actress award for playing country singer
Loretta Lynn in "Coal Miner's Daughter"(1980), is associated with
down-home characters. Ruth, on the other hand, is rigid, controlling,
upper-crusty New England. Tomei is best known for her Oscar-winning
turn as a vulgar, street-smart auto enthusiast in "My Cousin Vinny."
By contrast, Natalie is vulnerable, endearing and, finally,
heartbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously they are delighted to be back in the Oscar game, but
it's tempered by the fact that Stahl wasn't nominated. Both women
feel the film wouldn't have worked as well as it has without him. As
Spacek says, the audience has to feel the same thing for his
character that his parents do, and this has to be accomplished in a
limited amount of screen time. Audiences also have to believe that he
could be both bookish and mad about this girl who's anything but.
Perhaps Stahl didn't suffer enough to be nominated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people underestimate how hard that was," Tomei says of
his performance. "Todd told me that he had looked at many other young
men and there were some very good actors, but they all already had
irony in their personality. Nick could tap into that pure part of
himself in a way that is probably hard for a lot of men, let alone a
lot of young men actors. He opened himself up."</TE>
<TE>   "Watching you two on screen was incredible," Spacek says to Tomei.
"The scenes between you and Richard [William Mapother, who played her
husband] were so different. When you're with him [Stahl], it's like
you were luminescent. You looked his age when you were with him."
Tomei laughs with delight--and a little discomfort. She's 37. Stahl
is 22. Who wants to be reminded of that?</TE>
<TE>   Age and experience do have their compensations, however. For both
women, the experience of attending the Oscar ceremony won't be quite
as terrifying as their first ones. For one thing, they'll have each
other. After all, being singled out is gratifying but also scary, and
normally there's nobody to fall back on who is in the same boat. Then
there's the anxiety they feel about whether they belong in the same
league as the other nominees, or even the people who didn't get
nominated.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that I think has changed for me is that when I
first went, and this may have been your experience as well, I felt
like an impostor," Spacek says. "And I didn't know anybody. You feel
like a little church mouse."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the same thing," Tomei says. "I always felt like I should
have said in my speech, 'Nice to meet you.'"</TE>
<TE>   "And now," Spacek says, "I look around a room and I see these ..."</TE>
<TE>   "Friends," Tomei offers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a sense of belonging to the film community that
we feel now," Spacek adds.</TE>
<TE>   "That's starting," Tomei says in a small voice. "Not quite there."</TE>
<TE>   And here the women part company. Spacek is a much-revered six-time
nominee who's been out of the limelight. To some observers, Tomei was
an interloper who did not deserve her Oscar, maybe because the
character she played in "Vinny" was lightweight, an amusing
caricature in a popular but negligible comedy, and maybe because she
didn't have much of a track record or show-biz pedigree (unlike, say,
Mira Sorvino, daughter of actor Paul Sorvino, whose 1995 best
supporting actress Oscar for a similarly crass character in a
similarly fluffy film, "Mighty Aphrodite," didn't elicit protest).</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the opposition to Tomei's victory was so rabid that it
was rumored that presenter Jack Palance misspoke when he read off the
winner. In other words, the Oscar really belonged to another
nominee--which became a kind of Hollywood urban legend and, of
course, is not true. This year's nomination--not to mention her
performance--may give Tomei the respect and credibility she earned
but didn't receive with "Vinny."</TE>
<TE>   The two actresses differ too in their responses--in ways you might
not expect--to the industry people they're suddenly rubbing elbows
with at festivals, parties and awards shows. Tomei has spent much of
the last three years in L.A., and is visible there and in New York,
so she doesn't attach much importance to "running into the right
producer at the supermarket." Spacek, on the other hand, lives on a
farm in Virginia and, aside from the movies she works on, acts as if
she doesn't get out much. It's not the socializing she's excited
about (although she seems to be enjoying it). It's the chance to
hobnob with people who have projects pending and might have a role
for her.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever their expectations, one thing both women have to cope
with is the Oscar marketing machine, which is almost as hyped as the
nominees are.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than denigrate it, Spacek says she wishes she had Miramax
behind some of her earlier films, the ones she liked that didn't go
anywhere. Of course, the media is an enabler here, and it has grown
exponentially since Spacek first arrived on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone mentioned to me the red carpet is so much bigger because
there are so many more people," Spacek says. "There's so many more
interviews, so many more stations, there's a bigger market. It ups
the ante. It's been a billion people [watching the show] for quite a
while. You try not to think about that. You try to think about what
this really is. It's a celebration of moviemakers."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if maybe this is the best time--post-nominations,
pre-Oscars--before there are winners and losers, Spacek, who has won
and lost, says, "It probably is. It's like having a film in the can.
It hasn't come out yet, it has the potential, so you have all this
hope for it."</TE>

<DH>Breaking free from the standard chamber setting, the
Emerson Quartet takes a page from the theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN DAVIDSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The string quartet concert, as a species, is deliberately dull to
watch. In this purest and most hidebound of performance genres, the
audience is supposed to set its ears on full alert and give its eyes
a rest. Listeners stare at the walls, at four stationary entertainers
dressed in black, and at row upon row of napes. That's the way it has
always been.</LD>
<LD>   There are reasons for this scenic blandness. The classical music
establishment quails at the thought that lights and action, once
allowed into the temple grounds, will usurp the power of music. Give
people something exciting to watch, the thinking goes, and they will
soon stop listening altogether. A few ensembles have done battle with
these conventions. The Kronos Quartet began using costumes and
theatrical lighting decades ago. Now the Emerson Quartet, one of the
most visible string quartets in America, has begun confronting the
idea that a concert is inherently a theatrical experience.</LD>
<TE>   "The Noise of Time," an 80-minute theater piece by British
director Simon McBurney, acts as an atmospheric frame for the Emerson
Quartet's performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's brief, tormented
String Quartet No. 15. McBurney's dramatic meditation, which is
getting the first of five performances at UCLA's Freud Playhouse on
Wednesday, springs from the belief that in a visually saturated
culture, people crave something to look at. Where the eye wanders,
the mind is sure to follow.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney, who founded the London company Theatre de Complicite
(recently shortened to Complicite), selects his words so deliberately
that his thought process can almost be heard down the line from
London. An unadorned concert hall, he explains, evokes "the idea of a
neutral space in which you listen to the music. But of course it's
not neutral, it's full of associations. And people can go to these
concerts and feel as if they're missing something, as if you can't
hear what is being played, almost as if you can't attune your ears. I
realized there was the possibility of creating a different kind of
context, so that the ears and the mind are tuned up in a different
way, and audiences can listen to the heart of this very intimate
piece."</TE>
<TE>   And so, at the opening of the evening he designed, the musicians
do not shuffle onstage, drop into their chairs, adjust the stands,
fuss with the music and begin to tune, as they do in almost every
chamber concert. Instead, an illuminated antique radio squawks and
buzzes on a black stage. Four silent actors dressed in the bad,
mouse-colored suits of Soviet times--Shostakovich's times--prowl the
stage in slow motion while a chattering soundtrack and flickering
projections evoke that gray and bitter era. Truncated reminiscences
by Shostakovich's friends overlap with a fitful narration. Recorded
swatches of his music weave through hectoring speeches, applause and
bits of BBC radio news, which the composer listened to clandestinely.
The effect is of a shredded documentary.</TE>
<TE>   When, after an hour, the string quartet begins, a reverent,
ancient-sounding canon seeps from the dark periphery of the stage.
Each musician stands alone in a tight little circle of light.
Gradually, they converge, accompanied by slow-moving mimes and
playing as they go, until at last they take their seats in standard
quartet formation.</TE>
<TE>   The 15th Quartet, written in 1974, is one of Shostakovich's last
and most defeated works, an airless piling up of slow upon slow--six
adagio movements in a row. "Play it so that flies drop dead in
midair, and the audience starts leaving the hall from sheer boredom,"
the composer instructed, only half-joking. Nothing could have been
less patriotic for a Soviet artist than to express this crushing of
the soul, and Shostakovich had gotten into trouble before with the
cultural commissars for his excesses of gloom. But he knew that he
was finally close to his oft-anticipated death, and depression was
one of the few forms of self-indulgence he had left.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after a predawn, post-concert flight from Toronto to New
York, the members of the Emerson Quartet straggle into their
manager's office a few blocks from Carnegie Hall, four middle-aged
buddies grinning and joshing like college roommates who never fell
out of touch. It seems unfair, somehow, that these pleasant,
privileged fellows should be so adept at traversing the glaciered
emotional landscapes of Shostakovich's music. The quartet (which will
be in residence at the Ojai Music Festival this summer) is 25 years
old this season, and while other groups have splintered or endured
traumatic turnover in personnel, this one has remained unaltered
since 1979. The four friends finish each other's sentences and
casually bat insults across the table with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is a chemical reaction!" the violist, Lawrence Dutton,
exclaims at the end of one particularly rhetorical paragraph.</TE>
<TE>   "Or an allergic reaction," violinist Philip Setzer comments dryly.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the bulky and unflappable Setzer, who
radiates a benign, fatherly tranquillity, the quartet's members exude
intensity. Dutton, the tallest and most boyish of the bunch,
overflows with enthusiasm, as if playing in a string quartet were a
project he had just dreamed up. ("Coming back to a familiar piece
like the Mendelssohn A minor after a few years is wonderful!" he says
enthusiastically, with a grin. "It's still great. It's still hard.
It's still an amazing experience!")</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Drucker, a slender and olive-skinned violinist with
mournful eyes, a corona of tight, black curls and an intensity of
expression that could be mistaken for a bad mood, is equally
youthful, though in a darker way. Cellist David Finckel, who seems to
devote less time to sleep than to tending his goatee, is continually
coming up with new outlets for his energies: a record company that he
runs out of his living room; recitals that he and his wife, pianist
Wu Han, give around the globe (when he is not traveling with the
quartet); the La Jolla Chamber Music Summerfest, which the couple
managed for three years.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the group has hung together by setting itself new
challenges. It plowed through all six Bartok quartets in one sitting,
matched all the Beethoven quartets to sympathetic works from the 20th
century, made live recordings of Shostakovich's complete quartets,
and even teamed with a physicist, Brian Green, for a series of
concert-lectures on the scientific properties of music and the
musical properties of science.</TE>
<TE>   It was Setzer, the group's programming philosopher, who first
thought of marrying Shostakovich's quartets to a literary form,
perhaps readings from the composer's letters. In 1997, he approached
Lincoln Center's programming head, Jane Moss, who was just then
assembling a series of events meant to merge concert music with
theater. Moss immediately suggested McBurney, whose production of
Eugene Ionesco's "The Chairs" had made critics swoon. McBurney's
brother Gerard, Moss remembered, happened to be a scholar of Russian
music.</TE>
<TE>   Setzer and Moss broached the subject with McBurney, who was
disappointingly perplexed. "It seems to happen quite often that
people give me things others think are impossible to stage," he says
now. "I knew the 15th Quartet and I didn't think that there was
anything I could add. It's so painful, so quiet, so exquisite, like a
delicate piece of glass." The idea of interspersing its movements
with readings or historical explanation seemed impossibly
heavy-handed.</TE>
<TE>   But Setzer persisted, and when McBurney eventually heard the group
in concert, he developed an irresistible desire to work with them. "I
realized that the only way to approach this was not to do anything to
the music--neither to accompany it nor to break it up, but to allow
it to speak for itself." Gerard McBurney began feeding his brother an
enormous amount of material about Shostakovich, who, 27 years after
his death, remains just as elusive, inspiring and deeply frustrating
a figure as he was during his troubled lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich wrote music of blistering extremes. An honored--and
terrified--citizen of the Soviet Union, a global figure under the
thumb of an insular regime and an equivocal propagandist in an
undeclared war, he was also a great composer at a time when large
numbers of people awaited each new symphony with anxious fervor. He
was 20 when the premiere of his First Symphony made him a national
celebrity in 1926. But the art that gave him stature could also cut
him down, as was made perfectly clear to him in 1936, when Stalin
went to see Shostakovich's international hit opera, "Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk," and hated it.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, Pravda published what may be the most ominous
review in the history of music criticism. "The music croaks and hoots
and snorts and pants in order to represent love scenes as naturally
as possible," read the anonymous article. "The composer seems to have
deliberately encoded its music, twisted all its sounds so that it
would appeal only to aesthetes and formalists who have lost all
healthy tastes."</TE>
<TE>   The article then took a thuggish tone, hinting that the composer's
career "might end very badly." That was enough to convince the
29-year-old Shostakovich that he was about to join the legion of the
dead and disappeared. It was a fear, his friends reported, that never
really went away.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney had no appetite for preceding Shostakovich's final
quartet with a biographical sketch, so he exploded the narrative into
images and aimed for an emotional portrait. "I didn't want simply to
create the story of his life, which would have required a ludicrous
amount of compression, but to make a musical response. It's not
sequential, but kaleidoscopic. It comes at you in a series of
fragments." Incidents from the composer's life flit through the play
and the man himself appears in fractured form. A huge close-up of
half his face is projected on a screen. Empty articles of clothing
are paraded like bodiless puppets. His rough, unpleasant voice
emerges dully from speakers.</TE>
<TE>   When McBurney began rehearsals with the Emerson Quartet in New
York for the work's 1998 premiere at Lincoln Center, he had the
musicians play the piece over and over again, first sitting in
standard formation, then facing the audience instead of each other,
then spread out to the corners of the room. When the director and his
brother lay on the floor between the players, McBurney suddenly could
hear the clarity of the separate lines and feel the counterpoint
threading through the air above him. The players too were forced to
consider how firmly the music bound them across an empty space and
just how far the intimacy of togetherness could stretch.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney cautiously inched the musicians toward theater, often
letting ideas flow from them. "They were joking about Jewish
influences in Shostakovich's music and I said, 'Why not stand in a
line and play like a Jewish street band?' David [Finckel, the
cellist] was game and he said, 'Sure, I'll play standing up.' It was
incredibly moving. They looked like some pathetic street band, but
the music sounded very, very distant, like a memory of an echo."</TE>
<TE>   "Starting from the back of the stage--it's what you try to get at
when you play in concert," Setzer says, "when you say, 'Let's see if
we can play this as if it were coming from another world.'"</TE>
<TE>   Complicite and the Emerson Quartet have performed the piece
several dozen times since then, but Dutton still recalls those early
rehearsals and first performances as a relentless mixture of anxiety
and excitement. "'Noise of Time' took us in directions we'd never
been pushed before," he says. "That's Simon's genius. He was leading
us on a path of self-discovery. He never laid out for us what he
wanted to do. We took little, incremental steps. Which didn't make it
easy for us."</TE>
<TE>   "I was terrified," Finckel interrupts, firmly upping the ante. "My
heart had never beat so fast all through a piece as on that first
night in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the members of the quartet fall into a friendly round of
competitive suffering. "I remember having screaming pains through my
shoulder from the tension," Dutton offers.</TE>
<TE>   What shocked the quartet at first was not just the strangeness of
playing in a new setup or on a darkened stage, but of having to be
constantly conscious of how they looked and what they did. Dutton
mentions the chastising experience of sharing the stage with people
of great physical presence, actors who shadow the musicians and mimic
their every move. "It's like you feel a spirit around you," Setzer
says.</TE>
<TE>   McBurney didn't force them to do anything they objected to, but he
did insist that they not make any extraneous gestures, that they keep
still when they were silent, not slacken into a ritual of ticsand
slumped shoulders. Their rests, the players agree, have become more
disciplined, more reverential. The quality of quiet is deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporating a theatrical element into straight music-making
affects the Emerson's innermost gears. These days, the quartet plays
even its ordinary concerts standing up, as in "The Noise of Time,"
and they are pleased with the results. (Finckel sits, but on a raised
podium.) "The physical aspect of being able to use your whole body to
play is very freeing," Dutton says. "We sound better, it's more
visually interesting and the communication is easier. I think it goes
back to working with Simon."</TE>
<TE>   If the Emerson Quartet took to McBurney's directing, it's partly
because the four already perceived an aspect of wordless theater in
the music they played. "We always thought in dramatic terms,
especially with Shostakovich," Setzer says. "We thought of [the
quartets] as little Chekhov scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Shostakovich's music reads like a play: The characters are in
frequent discord, the situations are complicated, the emotions
jagged. The Emerson Quartet works to render the elegance of friction
without smoothing it down.</TE>
<TE>   The four have always refused to fuse their voices into a single,
corporate sound. "It's not too hard to blend," Dutton says.
"Basically, strings blend. What's interesting is to hear people's
personalities."</TE>
<TE>   They are audibly there. Setzer, with his grave, patrician reserve,
and Drucker, with his feverish, thoughtful intensity, switch off
between first and second violin, and when they do, the whole ensemble
shifts. Dutton digs into his viola with hell-bent vigor, while
Finckel anchors the group with the expansive nobility of his playing.</TE>
<TE>   Their art is keeping these differences in equilibrium, merging
them when necessary, as in Shostakovich's 15th. "The Noise of Time,"
with its cryptic signs and tales, brings the audience in on the
constant chatter that courses through a string quartet: The Emerson
players listen to each other, converse in looks, set tempos with the
twitch of a shoulder and ride a crescendo in perfect sync.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Noise of Time," this intimate collaboration has led the
four men into the soul of a solitary man who desperately needed his
friends and who also communicated in strange and cryptic ways.
McBurney brings up a story told by cellist and conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich--Slava to his friends--that is included in "The Noise of
Time." Shostakovich would phone Rostropovich and summon him urgently
across Moscow. When he arrived at the composer's apartment, the two
musical men would sit in silence for an hour or more, until
Shostakovich got up and said, "Thank you, Slava. Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you know who Slava is or not, I don't think it
necessarily matters," McBurney says. "The power of the story is
enough. It tells you about Shostakovich's need for silence, which
required the active participation of someone else. The noise on his
soul was too much for him to bear alone."</TE>

<HD>Bad Acting Worth a Good Laugh</HD>
<DH>At the Groundling Theatre, a talented cast pretends to be
fledgling actors who don't know any better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every Monday night for the past six weeks, a perky den
mother-agent-acting coach in a beehive wig who calls herself Beverly
Winwood greets visitors to the Groundling Theatre on Melrose and
announces, just before the lights dim: "I'm going to let you in on a
secret--these people are talented!"</LD>
<LD>   The crowd hoots with laughter, even though the actors about to
perform are in fact quite gifted: Jennifer Coolidge, fresh off a
Broadway run in "The Women"; Cheryl Hines, co-starring as Larry
David's wife in HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"; Paul Reubens, who
created Pee-wee Herman on the Groundlings stage in 1978; Lynne Marie
Stewart, known to television viewers as Pee-wee's sidekick Miss
Yvonne on the 1986-90 show "Pee-wee's Playhouse"; and  another dozen
current or former members of the Groundlings improvisational troupe.</LD>
<LD>   But as for the overzealous, under-experienced thespians portrayed
by these actors ... to call them raw would be putting it kindly.</LD>
<TE>   On any given Monday, "Beverly Winwood Presents the Actors
Showcase" might start with a tender scene from "Children of a Lesser
God," which degenerates quickly into crude sexual pantomime at the
hands of wooden Thad Ripple and dim-but-hardly-deaf Honey Thayer
(played by Nat Faxton and Christen Nelson, respectively).</TE>
<TE>   Cut to "A Streetcar Named Desire," with the hyper-effeminate
Stanley Fishwipe (Patrick Bristow) putting a queenly spin on the
usually brutish Stanley Kowalski. Rapper-actor Danger (Jordan Black)
and ex-convict Lewis Poole (Phil LaMarr) provide an unfathomably
hostile interpretation of Biff and Happy in an excerpt from "Death of
a Salesman." In their chemistry-deficient selection from "Fame," the
chemistry-deficient team of Willard Carrington (Jim Rash) and Gemini
Frank (Carrie Aizley) apparently believe they're strutting their
stuff in a flattering manner.</TE>
<TE>   But does Carrington really believe agents and casting directors
will be wowed by his wandering British accent and absurdly amateurish
prop camera made of toilet paper rolls taped to a shoebox?</TE>
<TE>   After the final blackout, the performers, still in character,
network desperately in the lobby. Beverly (Susan Yeagley) hands out
Twinkies, while Antelope Valley Theatre fixture Berle Dawson
(actually MAD TV producer Michael Hitchcock), sweaty and still winded
from a "Rent" dance routine, distributes fliers promoting his
hand-puppet classes.</TE>
<TE>   Huddling backstage, Eric Idle, Kevin Nealon and Liza Minnelli
mingle ... oh wait, that's actually Antoinette Spolar-Levine, whose
"Liza" took part in an ensemble scene from "Sex and the City."
Levine/Minnelli's "Sex" cast mate is Karen Maruyama, whose stolid Pu
Ping Chow character seemed perpetually out of sync with her chatty
girlfriends.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea of show business is trying to get a job," Maruyama
says about the showcase experience. "You want to make a good
impression, but you may put out this kind of horrible way you want to
be perceived and it's so not right. There's something funny but sadly
pathetic about that."</TE>
<TE>   Creating a good revue about bad acting is no easy task, according
to "Showcase" creator-director Tony Sepulveda. "We did some scenes
where people just talked in a monotone--it doesn't work and you get
bored really quick."</TE>
<TE>   Adds "Fishwipe" Bristow, "Forgetting your lines is so stock--what
Tony's done is made us play the bad choices of actors who don't know
themselves and who are putting themselves in what they think is a
strong light."</TE>
<TE>   "The point of this show is not to make fun of actors per se, but
of inappropriate choices," Sepulveda says.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go out of town and see talent shows, people just have no
idea because there's no real industry people there to guide them. I
look at actors sometimes, and I'm amazed I have to say, 'You're 15
years old, don't play a 30-year-old.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda should know. A former Groundling, he now picks actors
for "The West Wing" and "Will &amp; Grace" as vice president of casting
for Warner Bros. Television.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a showcase about actors who don't know any better, who
have never done anything in their lives. It hasn't registered yet
that you really can't sell yourself to the industry that way," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've tried to make this cast do is commit to their
characters, but their characters are so inappropriate--I think that's
what people are laughing at. The funny comes from the fact that the
actors really believe 100% in who they are. We're not writing jokes,
we're finding inappropriate readings."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Bristow "Any actor can identify with that, and say, 'Oh, my
God, I've been in a scene [like that] before I got better, not
knowing what I was doing.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda and company workshopped "Showcase" in August. Reubens
saw a performance and was invited to take part. He and Stewart chose
a scene from "Butterflies Are Free."</TE>
<TE>   "The moment I laid eyes on this script, I said, 'We gotta do this:
bad blind acting!' This will be great." Aside from the improbable
casting--mature, zaftig Stewart plays an ingenue (originally played
in the 1972 movie by Goldie Hawn) who discovers her hunky neighbor
(Reubens) is blind--Reubens dug into his bag of bad acting tricks to
come up with the scene's running gag. "I mouth all my partner's
dialogue," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Sepulveda was on hand at rehearsals, continually lowering the bar.
"He'd say, 'That's too subtle,'" Reubens recalls. "'Make it bigger.'
Or, 'That's a good choice. Let's find a weaker one.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly Winwood" began previews in February and immediately
generated industry buzz. Jack Black, Cheri Oteri, Garry Shandling,
Larry David, Jane Kaczmarek, Kevin Nealon and Eric Idle have come by
to check out the shenanigans in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But will "Beverly" play to people who aren't show people, or are
the references too inside?</TE>
<TE>   "Winwood" Producer Allison Kingsley, who served as the Groundling
Theatre's executive director for six years before parting amicably in
2000, said the source material is so familiar and the characters so
vivid that a broad audience should have no trouble getting the joke.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had friends come in from out of town who know nothing about
the industry, nothing about acting, and they've just loved the show
because it's about character choices and it's funny."</TE>
<TE>   Adding one more layer to the show's fake/real dynamic is the fact
that the actors playing the actors are hardly above the fray. Like
any working professional, they want new gigs. Says Reubens, "I'm
making this time commitment to the show, and you start thinking,
maybe something would come out of it. And then I go, 'What, are you
nuts? No one's going to cast me from this!'"</TE>

<HD>After the Hue and Cry</HD>
<DH>David Hare looks anew at 'The Blue Room,' his play starring
Nicole Kidman that was often overshadowed by sensation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>British playwright David Hare calls "The Blue Room" "sort of an
encyclopedia of defensive and offensive strategies that people use in
the pursuit of love. What we feel about someone before we make love
to them and what we feel after. What survives and what gets wrecked
between desire and fulfillment."</LD>
<LD>   What survives in this case is a play best known for actress Nicole
Kidman's brief onstage nudity during its initial productions in
London and New York in 1998. It premiered in London at the intimate,
251-seat Donmar Warehouse, where the drama offstage for tickets
rivaled the drama onstage in what one London critic called "pure
theatrical Viagra."</LD>
<LD>   Kidman says today that she was stunned by the attention. "I
actually didn't realize what was at stake for me. I just thought I
was doing a play. I got lost in the rehearsal room," she says. "I
didn't read any of the press leading up to it."</LD>
<TE>   The flood of publicity surrounding the show may have kept "The
Blue Room" from being widely produced in the U.S., says Sheldon Epps,
artistic director of the Pasadena Playhouse, where the play opens
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw 'The Blue Room' on Broadway and really admired it," Epps
says. "I thought a lot of the virtues of the play were overshadowed
by the sensationalism, and one of the advantages of being an artistic
director is that you have a chance to reexamine work you admire."</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from Viennese writer Arthur Schnitzler's
turn-of-the-century play "Reigen" (also the raw material for Max
Ophuls' classic 1950 film, "La Ronde"), "The Blue Room" is subtitled
"a play in 10 intimate acts."</TE>
<TE>   Through 90 intermission-free minutes, just two actors portray 10
couples in 10 locales who meet, merge and maybe connect.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by David Schweizer, the Pasadena production stars
Arabella Field as the woman and Lenny Von Dohlen as the man, each
donning and doffing not just clothes but characters of various
classes, professions, ages and experiences. By the time the ronde is
played out, an actress, playwright, model, student, au pair,
politician, cab driver, married woman, aristocrat and prostitute
couple and uncouple in a circle of encounters that concludes with the
last man meeting the first woman.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a few years since Hare created those couplings, and,
reached in Paris, where he is working on a screenplay, the dramatist
pauses a moment to reflect. "I suppose the play is asking the
question: What is fulfillment?" Hare suggests. "None of the
characters in the play find fulfillment with each other, but you
sense in the air that it is possible."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman was in London making "Eyes Wide Shut," the late Stanley
Kubrick's 1999 film based on a Schnitzler novel. Playwright Patrick
Marber ("Closer") introduced Kidman to Sam Mendes, artistic director
of the small but high-profile Donmar Warehouse. Over lunch, she and
Mendes discussed working together, and he suggested a contemporary
"La Ronde" done with two actors. He took the idea to Hare and, says
Kidman, "David jumped on board."</TE>
<TE>   He apparently looked a bit before he leaped, however. Noting that
he'd earlier adapted Chekhov, Brecht and Pirandello and was in each
case "very faithful" to the text, the 54-year-old playwright says he
was initially wary about making so many changes to Schnitzler's play.
But encouraged by Mendes--"he said, 'Why don't you just try?'"--Hare
wrote the play in just a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "Schnitzler wrote his scenes never intending for them to be
performed," Hare says. "He never imagined it, partly because they
were obscene and partly because they weren't really in a dramatic
form. When Ophuls made his film, he used no more than a fifth of the
original text. It's a work with which people have been very free."</TE>
<TE>   Hare allowed himself to be equally free. As he wrote in the New
York Times in November 1998, he treated "Schnitzler's text as a
starting point for a more modern, maybe more romantic view of sexual
yearning." When he was finally done writing and rewriting it, he
wrote, even he wasn't sure "about who exactly is the principal author
of the play."</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote what I wanted to write," Hare says today, "then did
fiddling around for Nicole to play to her strengths. It was a process
I really enjoyed, a bit of bespoke tailoring fitted for Nicole and
[her co-star] Iain Glen. I was choosing a few cuts, fitting the
collar to the actor. That's good fun as a playwright--seeing what you
see in the actor and bringing it out.</TE>
<TE>   "With Nicole, I saw a great sweetness in her, which is generally
missed. You often see her as an ice maiden or lofty or unattainable,
and one thing I tried to do was to make it warmer as it went on. Most
plays start out warm and end up cold; this starts out cold and ends
up warm, and I enjoyed that."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman has nothing but praise for the play and playwright. "The
roles are so distinctly written," says the actress, phoning from a
film set in Sweden. "He writes so well for women. I really have such
admiration for him in that regard. He never judges women. He's much
tougher on his men. The women's motivations are more pure. His men
are far more complicated. He forgives his female characters. His
judgments tend to lie on his male characters, which is important; we
need that slant, because so many male writers don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing "whirlwind of publicity was frightening to us all,"
Hare says. "In London, I thought it had to do with sex--most of the
English critics are middle-aged men, and it was a long time in their
own lives since they'd seen anything like Nicole. And in New York,
most of it was about fame. People in New York would be there not just
to see her but would be looking for the Hollywood stars in the
audience. We thought the phenomenon would go away, and it never went
away."</TE>
<TE>   Caro Newling, executive producer of the nonprofit Donmar, says she
thinks many audience members "had never been to a theater in their
lives and were coming because of Nicole. But everyone interested in
the theater wants to see a new play by David Hare. He has his finger
on the pulse and knows how to reflect society back to society. He is
the very leading playwright of his generation, and has been extremely
influential since he started writing plays and will be until he
stops."</TE>
<TE>   Reared in Sussex, the Cambridge-educated Hare in 1968 co-founded
the Portable Theatre Company,  which introduced many of his ideas of
political theater. His first full-length play, "Slag," was produced
in London in 1970, and since then he has written more than two dozen
original plays, translations and adaptations, several screenplays and
books.</TE>
<TE>   He has written about a Rupert Murdoch-like press baron in "Pravda"
(with co-writer Howard Brenton), Oscar Wilde in "The Judas Kiss,"
idealism in "Skylight" and the theater in "Amy's View." Beginning
with his acclaimed look at postwar Britain in "Plenty" in 1978,
Britain's National Theatre produced 12 of his plays and adaptations
over two decades, including the dense, thought-provoking trilogy in
the early '90s of "Racing Demon," "Murmuring Judges" and "The Absence
of War," which examined Britain's contemporary church, judicial
system and politics, respectively. In 1998, the same year "Blue Room"
was produced, Hare himself performed in London and New York his "Via
Dolorosa," a monologue on the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an extraordinary number of plays of an extremely high
standard," says British director Richard Eyre, who headed the
National Theatre when Hare wrote much of his work. Besides receiving
many Olivier and other awards at home--he became Sir David Hare in
1997--Hare has been nominated for Tony Awards for U.S. productions of
"Plenty" in 1983, "Racing Demon" in 1996 and "Skylight" in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to write to live," Eyre observes. "It's what justifies his
life. There's a sort of dogged optimism. Walter Benjamin, I believe,
said that one should possess optimism of the spirit and pessimism of
the intellect, and that seems to terribly well describe David. He
believes in the primacy of the theater as an artistic medium, so
writing for the National is putting his talent where his heart is."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the playwright says, "Richard and I felt very strongly
that a national theater should reflect national life. That you should
be able to go there and see something you recognize of your own
existence. It shouldn't be a library with volumes about other periods
of other people. I think one of the things theater does best is
illuminate undercurrents that journalism misses and that we ourselves
are so busy and don't notice in our own lives. Theater can show you
the direction of change in society."</TE>
<TE>   After the trilogy, Hare turned to plays examining different
aspects of love--in "Skylight," "Amy's View" and "The Judas
Kiss"--which perhaps coincidentally follow his second marriage, in
1992, to French fashion designer Nicole Farhi. Says Hare: "I was just
exhausted in writing these three big, epic plays and interested in
what you could do with smaller resources."</TE>
<TE>   Eyre thinks Hare "felt he had to move on to a different territory.
I think he's very much led by subjects. He gets the sniff of
something that seems good and follows that. That's how the trilogy
started--with 'Racing Demon,' about the Church of England, which
seemed initially to be quasi-documentary and developed into something
very profound."</TE>
<TE>   Playwrights have a responsibility, Hare implies again and again.
"I have such a clear idea of what a play should be about," he says.
"I think I'd be a better playwright if I didn't. I've spent my life
believing in something, namely a social theater. I can't personally
write a play, no mater how trivial, without some idea of what I want
the politics to be and what politics inform the play. I need to ask
what it's about, and why the play exists--I can't work without that."</TE>
<TE>   Hare has complained in print of plays "running off into the
distance in a chicken-headed flight from content," and when "The Blue
Room" was first produced, some critics felt Hare was doing the same.
"The piece has this rep for being a series of sex trips, and we're
not backing away from that," says Schweizer, the director of the
Pasadena production. "You need actors who have some personal
charisma, good old-fashioned sex appeal and the chameleon-like
ability to transform themselves. Arabella and Lenny are both really
attractive, and they'll shed their clothes at a certain point--but
it's not the point.</TE>
<TE>   "David Hare, as always, is making really incisive observations
about the intersection between social class and sexuality and
behavior," Schweizer continues. "There is also a kind of
theater-loving playfulness, a sense of mischief about theater-making
and how to use the theater. Suddenly a scene will seem almost like a
Noel Coward ancestor and then you'll be on the street, neo-John
Osborne."</TE>
<TE>   Hare's knowledge of the theater extends to offstage
practicalities, according to British producer Robert Fox, who has
produced several Hare plays in London and New York. "A lot of writers
don't understand the process," Fox says. "They understand writing.
He's very practical as well as creative. He's very smart about how
things get done and what works in casting and publicity. He
understands all the elements that go into producing a play, which is
good for a producer, because one has a shorthand with him."</TE>
<TE>   Fox is producing "Breath of Life," a new Hare play scheduled to
premiere on London's West End next September with Maggie Smith and
Judi Dench (who won a Tony in 1999 for her work in Hare's "Amy's
View"). Hare doesn't really write parts for particular actors, he
says, "but it happens that if you write in certain age groups, people
suggest themselves. When I finished the play, it was clear Maggie
Smith was the preeminent choice. Judi Dench was Maggie's idea. The
part as it was written wasn't the way people had seen Judi before,
and it hadn't occurred to me. Maggie said she always wanted to do a
play with Judi."</TE>
<TE>   "Breath of Life," Hare says, "is about the way a woman's life is
shaped so completely differently by our improved living standards and
health in the West so women in their 60s don't see themselves as old
people. Women of a certain age are still living rich and fulfilled
lives, something almost unimaginable in previous centuries. My
parents seemed like old people at 60, but Maggie and Judi don't. The
span of our imaginative lives is now so much more attenuated, and we
keep our vitality so much longer."</TE>
<TE>   Hare directed three films in the '80s, then stopped. Each was less
successful than the previous one, he says today, "and I felt the
climate for the kind of film I wanted to make wasn't very friendly. I
felt the toil of raising the money and [the response] from audiences
was becoming progressively less rewarding. I simply felt in my 40s
that I very much wanted to see how far I could go as a playwright and
work at that exclusively."</TE>
<TE>   He has continued writing films, however. Due later this year, for
instance, is his adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel "The Hours," directed by Stephen Daldry and
produced by Scott Rudin. That film stars Kidman as Virginia Woolf.
The actress says Hare wrote "the most beautiful character for me.
Judi Dench and I were talking the other day about how he's very
difficult to learn because his sentence structure is unusual and you
have to learn it word for word. You want to learn it properly. You
really want to do it justice."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman says she'd love to do another play with Hare, either in New
York or London, commenting on both the caliber of his writing and his
ability to make her laugh. "There are few people in the industry
where you can say, 'I really like this person and admire what they're
doing,' and David is one of those people," Kidman says. "I hope to
have a lifelong relationship with him."</TE>
<TE>   Kidman brought Hare a film project about artist Lee Miller, she
adds, but first Hare must complete the screenplay for "The
Corrections," Jonathan Franzen's highly publicized novel. Writing in
Paris, where there are fewer intrusions on his time, Hare says when
he tells people that's what he's doing, "everybody reels in horror.
Everyone says, 'You must be out of your mind,' including Franzen."</TE>
<TE>   With "The Corrections" as with "The Hours," he appreciates the
novel more as he works on the screenplay. "You do enter a very long
relationship with the work," Hare says. "I think it is tapping me
into something we don't have in England--American social novels.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose in the literary world, the British genius traditionally
is for the performing arts and the American genius is for the novel.
The sheer fertility of the American novel is just dazzling to the
English. I am lucky enough to be part of a generation of 30 or 40
good, interesting playwrights, and I don't think the field is as rich
in America as it is here."</TE>
<TE>   Whether he's working on a play or screenplay, Hare says, he writes
most days. "I've done it for 30 years. It's a way of life. You just
have to not be frightened of being alone all the time. I was thinking
today that I wouldn't know what else to do."</TE>

<HD>And the Decade-Old Winner Is...</HD>
<DH>The test of time isn't easy to pass. That's why films that
hold up after Oscar's moved on should be honored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LORTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As I rolled over in bed and hit the snooze button to shut off the
announcement of Academy Award nominations that was rudely waking me
up, I muttered my annual slew of bitter remarks: "Stupid awards ...
as if you could call one film the best ... it's supposed to be art
after all...."</LD>
<LD>   Then, as I withdrew my groggy hand from the radio, it struck me.
As long as we've already got the Oscars, the Golden Globes, the
People's Choice Awards, the MTV Movie Awards, the AFI awards and
others lined up for this season, we should add one more: Awards for
Films Released 10 Years Ago That Got Trampled Under Ephemeral
Mainstream Hype. It could trump them all.</LD>
<LD>   What would I call it? The Decade Displacement Honors? The Offset
Oscars? No, I've got it: The Hindsight Awards.</LD>
<TE>   I can see it now: the Hindsight--a miniature statue of an
unclothed male looking hurriedly over his shoulder, his expression
resembling my cat's surprise every time the vet takes her
temperature. It's handed to the weary filmmaker, finally vindicated
after an endless decade of hope, perspective and cultural
re-contextualization.</TE>
<TE>   The applications are obvious. After all, is "Titanic" truly more
impressive through a glass darkly than "The Sweet Hereafter" from our
advanced vantage point of 2002? Does "Platoon" seriously outgun "Full
Metal Jacket" after all the smoke has cleared? Is the interminable
travelogue "Around the World in 80 Days" really deserving of ...
anything?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everyone's answers to these questions will be
different--but I'll bet five buckets of $7 popcorn that with each
passing year, opinions on what film was "most notable" tend to unify
as what is "truly memorable" is borne out through a process of
natural artistic digestion.</TE>
<TE>   As the world turns, the number and character of titles that remain
in the public and critical consciousness are necessarily refined by
the sheer volume of ever-increasing product squeezed through the
colander of time and video shelf space. In the long run, the
essential cannot help but remain. The cream, by natural selection,
rises to the top.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a quick list of "best pictures" for the last 10
years--"The Silence of the Lambs," "Unforgiven," "Schindler's List,"
"Forrest Gump," "Braveheart," "The English Patient," "Titanic,"
"Shakespeare in Love," "American Beauty" and "Gladiator"--yields only
one masterpiece. You be the judge. The rest are mostly bloated,
self-important footnotes to film history, and in most cases,
footnotes in the careers of their own makers.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, a competing list of "Un-Awarded Films Most
Likely to be Relevant to Cinema Theory and History" reveals this
sampling: "Three Colors: Red," "Heavenly Creatures," "Babe," "Lone
Star," "The Sweet Hereafter," "The Celebration," "Election" and
"Dancer in the Dark," to name only a few.</TE>
<TE>   As anyone wise beyond their years from early exposure to PBS can
tell you: "One of these lists is not like the other." And here is
where the Hindsight comes in.</TE>
<TE>   The key feature of the concept is the "Hindsight Interval."
Essentially a cooling-off period, the interval would allow the chaff
to fall away and reveal which films actually stand up as
masterpieces, which movie was truly influential, and which of the
"instant classics" was able to somehow become a genuine classic over
time.</TE>
<TE>   Consider how many serious disciplines award achievements as
important and groundbreaking as the contenders profess themselves to
be on such a frenzied, yearly schedule, before their full import can
truly be assessed. Not many. In this regard, handing best picture to
"Braveheart" may be comparable to bestowing the Nobel Prize on "cold
fusion" the week it was discovered. How ironic to so quickly laud a
film that purports to celebrate John Nash's lifelong wait for
recognition. The impact of his real-life work was slowly and surely
determined by specialists across the globe. And whoever heard of
Nobel aspirants holding back all their best discoveries until a week
before the Nobel deadline?</TE>
<TE>   Now, I don't want you to worry that my suspiciously "arty" bias
means the Hindsight Awards ceremony would be bland or suffer from a
lack of entertainment value. We'd be as fun as any other awards show:
a huge crowd, red carpet, attractive (though, by necessity, aging)
stars and the usual slate of impressive-sounding categories: Best
10-Year-Old Film, Best Looking Effects for Their Time, Best Topical
Film That Remained Topical for More Than Six Months and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there'd be those special Hindsights, the categories
unique to my august vision: the Embodiment Award for the film that
came closest to its own hyperbole of 10 years before. Was it really
an enduring triumph? Time will tell us.</TE>
<TE>   The Reapy, on the other hand (short for Re-Appraisal Award, the
statuette crafted to depict Orpheus peeking back at the underworld),
would go to those Oscar movies that failed to live up to their
elevated caliber after a big win.</TE>
<TE>   Last but not least would be the Lifetime Apology Address given by
a filmmaker who spent his life squandering time and materiel on a
grand scale in the mass production of anemic dross. His remarks would
be immediately followed by forced acceptance of the "Look Back in
Anger" bust, carved in the likeness of Orson Welles.</TE>
<TE>   So come join us! Oh, I know it will be a lot of hard work, but in
just a few years we'll acquire the mantles of tradition and dignity.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, perhaps it is better to get all this award
stuff over as soon as possible each winter. The recognition of films
that stand the test of time is a natural process, and maybe it's best
to keep it under wraps so only secret cinematheques and film scholars
will know what's really going on. After all, without Oscar season,
where would the film industry dump its worst releases? Who wants
those spread out through the whole year?</TE>
<TE>   I guess I can always go to my fallback idea for social reform: not
inaugurating chief executives until 10 years after the presidential
campaign.</TE>

<HD>Indulging a Love of Horseplay</HD>
<DH>One of the founders of Cirque du Soleil goes back to his
roots with 'Cheval,' an equine-based big-top show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH KAYE MCCALL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the Year of the Horse, according to the Chinese calendar, a
designation that will be underlined this week when Gilles Ste-Croix's
"Cheval" gallops into Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   A new touring production, "Cheval," which means "horse" in French,
mixes four-footed and two-footed performers with elaborate sets,
costumes, lights and a bit of a story line into a form of
in-the-round entertainment that's unusual, at least in North America.
It's one in which a full-time blacksmith, equine massages, 200 pounds
of carrots a week and specially blended arena footing figure into
production logistics.</LD>
<LD>   "When I started my show, I wanted to go back to the origin of
circus," Ste-Croix says.</LD>
<TE>   The director, 52, knows something about the art form. He's one of
the founders of Cirque du Soleil. As that company's director of
creation, he developed such shows as "O," now running in Las Vegas,
and "Dralion," which just opened its second Los Angeles County run in
Long Beach. Now a consultant for Cirque, he started "Cheval" in 2001,
in part to pursue an interest that goes back to his childhood,
growing up with horses on a farm outside Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past 20 years, I've been making different circus shows,
but more in the Asian way," he says. "The Chinese don't use animals
in their shows. All the juggling with the foot and the plate and the
contortion, it's all resting on the humans.</TE>
<TE>   "'Cheval,' for me, is a way of bringing back the origin of
[modern] circus, which was with horses, but putting it in the context
of today, with an environment that technically is modern--a set which
has lights through it, smoke effects, and all that put together with
costume design and live music."</TE>
<TE>   With a cast of 30 horses and 27 equestrian artists from around the
globe, the $6-million production has an original score, a live
orchestra and two female vocalists. Costumes, lighting and sets all
have the flavor of Cirque productions, and many of them are created
by Cirque collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the show unfolds beneath 69,513 square feet of
hand-painted canvas designed by Cirque tent architect Guy St-Amour.
In this case, however, the look is reminiscent of a Loire Valley
castle. "It had to be unique. I wanted it to feel like you walked
into a cathedral," Ste-Croix says.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators enter the 1,500-seat big top via another tent, this one
a stable, which allows them to get a backstage look at the featured
horses as grooms ready them for the performance. Individual stall
tags indicate each horse's name, theatrical resume and breed (there
are 17 breeds, from draft horses such as Percherons and Belgians to
quarter horses and Friesians, originally bred as carriage horses).</TE>
<TE>   A loose narrative links 16 equine acts. An aspiring Romeo,
portrayed by French Canadian comedian Christian Ferland, 36,  must
overcome his fear of horses to win a woman. "Cheval" opens with a
scene of traveling performers following a horse-drawn wagon. A net
filled with golden platters soars skyward, seemingly levitated by
carriage lights.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ferland's clownish character roams the sidelines,
occasionally trying to join in as one act follows another in the
ring. The comedic element hits high gear in the second half when
Ferland--who had no horse experience when cast--meets his equine
thespian equal, Bohemio. A French-trained horse with movie
credentials ("Lucky Luke," 1991), Bohemio sits down, rolls on his
back and refuses to budge, while lovelorn Ferland tries every
stratagem to get on his back.</TE>
<TE>   In typical Cirque du Soleil fashion, however, "story line" is a
relative concept, sometimes present, sometimes not. The main
attraction here is the gathering together of a wide range of
accomplished equestrian performers, mostly from European circuses and
shows. Many have provided their own horses, and some are showcasing
their own tricks for "Cheval." There is a bareback act starring five
members of the Zamperla Zoppe circus family, of Italian heritage;
9-year-old Ermes tops a three-tier human pyramid on galloping horses.
Cossack riders, who careen off onto moving horses at speeds of 32
mph, were choreographed by Moscow Circus veteran Igor Kassaev.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheval" also showcases Caroline Williams, an eighth-generation
circus performer and the 32-year-old niece of the late Ringling Bros.
animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. Born in Germany, where she
trained in dressage, Williams plays Ferland's elusive love,
enchanting him the moment he spots her in chartreuse riding dress
aboard a glistening black Friesian horse. Never mind that she's being
serenaded by a violinist as her horse circles and moves in an elegant
passage--think springy trot with lots of attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' gift for communicating with horses shines during an
extraordinary "liberty" act, which means that the horses aren't being
ridden and aren't linked by a lead line. Wearing a strapless black
gown and heels, she directs six bay Andalusian horses from center
ring as they spin in pairs, change directions, form lines and move as
one.</TE>
<TE>   "Every move I make means something to them," explains Williams,
who first rode in the spotlight at 2, and was training and working
with Lippizaner stallions by age 10. "When I move my shoulder in and
my body back it means 'come toward me.' When I'm sort of present and
looking straight at them, that means 'stay over there.' It's body
language and voice commands," she explains. Williams uses German,
French, and occasionally Italian with the horses, which Ste-Croix
purchased from a European show. They were in an Italian circus for a
while, she notes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a definite relationship. It's talking, it's playing off that
horse's character. But if they don't want to do something, they're
not going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   An American miniature horse owned and trained by Williams, 30-inch
Chabo, does in fact occasionally preempt Williams' signals in a
whimsical act with three gypsy dancers. "He's completely wise to the
whole show thing," she says. "He's supposed to do three pirouettes
with the girls in the beginning and on the fourth one the girls
leave," Williams explains. "Every time we practice, it's exactly that
way. But when it's a full house, he's the ham. He's pirouetting--and
I'm not telling him, 'Pirouette.'"</TE>
<TE>   Not that this concerns her. She lists Chabo's talents like a proud
mother (he can "pray" on command, lie down, wave his feet). "He's
really a treasure, I love him."</TE>
<TE>   Which is precisely what Ste-Croix wants to get across. "What we
are trying to convey is that with care and with understanding and
with partnership, you can obtain a great deal. This show is the proof
of it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It was in 1999, after finishing "Dralion" and a long string of
other Cirque shows, that Ste-Croix decided to pursue a horse show,
something that simply didn't fit the Cirque style. He knew the
history of modern circus, which is credited to Philip Astley in the
late 1700s. An English cavalry hero, Astley began showcasing his
talents as a trick rider as a way of promoting a business teaching
riders. He experimented with the right size ring to create maximum
centrifugal force for vaulting (42 feet; "Cheval's," designed for a
lot of different acts, is 46 feet).</TE>
<TE>   "He's really the first one who staged a show with horses in a
circle rather than a [rectangular] arena," Ste-Croix notes.</TE>
<TE>   The circular format spread, shaping the modern circus. Today's
equestrian productions in Europe increasingly overlap the traditional
domain of ballet and performing arts. Theatre Zingaro, a noted French
equestrian company, is regularly featured at France's Avignon
Festival and will be coming to Orange County in October with a
production that has toured Europe and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Ste-Croix was familiar with the shows and the equestrian
performers from his years scouting for Cirque. "Cheval" began
rehearsals in February 2001 and had its Montreal premiere in May. It
opened in August in Denver, then went to San Diego and Las Vegas. The
troupe plans to visit 19 cities in all during a three year tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Ticket-holders may have to get their own Chardonnay," wrote a
reviewer in Denver's Rocky Mountain News, "but the horses do just
about everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Ste-Croix continues to add to the show. He has just brought in a
new act, Hungarian jugglers riding bareback, for the Orange County
show.</TE>
<TE>   "Gilles is very fast," says "Cheval" equestrian choreographer
Bernard Quental, who worked for a number of years with Theatre
Zingaro. "If he wants to try something, it's always 'tonight.' We try
to test it right now, today, and we know if that works or not."</TE>
<TE>   Williams smiles. "You see it happening. You can see [Ste-Croix] in
a creative mood and you're like, 'Uh-oh.' He just has this very
special imagination, and he sees things, little tiny details, that
other producers and director don't. I've never experienced it
before."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Ste-Croix is developing a school for equestrian performers,
horses and riders, scheduled to open this fall in
Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, southeast of Montreal. "The idea is
really to create behind-the-scenes new artists, new approaches to
shows with horses," he explains. Along with training in equestrian
arts and horse care, acting, dancing, and performing skills will be
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Cheval" will next travel to San Jose following its
Costa Mesa run. Ste-Croix hopes to include Los Angeles on the tour,
but no dates have been set yet.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit of the horse drives this thing, not me," Ste-Croix
says, hoping that "Cheval" will have the kind of popularity the
Cirque has achieved. "Horses have always been in our fantasy as well
as in real stories. I think horses can be brought mainstream again."</TE>

<HD>Rethinking It Through</HD>
<DH>Director Trevor Nunn's radical reworkings of 'Oklahoma!,'
'My Fair Lady' and others stem from his passion for challenging the
text.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Sitting on a couch in a midtown Manhattan office, British director
Trevor Nunn repeats lyrics from "Oklahoma!" as though they are holy
writ. "We know we belong to the land and the land we belong to is
grand," he says in the clipped tones of his native East Anglia.</LD>
<LD>   Were it not for the fervency, the juxtaposition might seem
ridiculous: the by-now almost hackneyed sentiments in the mouth of a
man widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest directors of the
English language; the onetime artistic director of the Royal
Shakespeare Company; outgoing director of the Royal National Theatre,
master interpreter of classic (Shakespeare, Shaw, Ibsen) and
contemporary theater (Tennessee Williams, Robert Bolt, Tom Stoppard);
and master impresario of such mega-productions as "Nicholas
Nickleby," "Cats," "Les Miserables," "Chess" and "Sunset Boulevard."</LD>
<TE>   But Nunn is dead serious. For most Americans, Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" has been a staple of musical comedy puffery
since it first cheered embattled audiences in 1943. But the musical
has Chekhovian echoes for the director. In Nunn's National Theatre
revival, which opens March 21 on Broadway, the sunny cowboy Curly
still battles the dyspeptic Jud for winsome Laurey, but it is
foremost a story of a group of pioneers, decent but inarticulate,
attached to the land, stumbling along as the lawless order of the
West yields to a brave new manifest destiny of 1905 America.</TE>
<TE>   "What Hammerstein encapsulates in his book is the absolutely
fundamental tenet of the new American society these people wanted to
create," Nunn says, "climaxing in Aunt Eller's wonderful reminder to
the people, 'I want to teach you a little saying and learn the words
by heart the way you should: I don't say I'm no better than anybody
else, but I'm damned if I ain't as good.' So the lives of these
relatively simple people can affect us profoundly because we are in
touch with the decisions that have brought us to where we are."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, flinty Aunt Eller is the backbone of this
"Oklahoma!," the show that launched what is still today the most
successful and influential musical collaboration in Broadway history.
Nunn also had the temerity to bring in Susan Stroman to
re-choreograph the show, jettisoning Agnes de Mille's groundbreaking
dances. But if one wants to get a handle on exactly how the director
himself came to be where he is today--from Royal Shakespeare Company
wunderkind at age 27 to the Music Man of Broadway and the West End at
62--producer Cameron Mackintosh invited comparison with another
musical theater character.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a part of Trevor that is Professor Henry Higgins," says
Mackintosh, who has had an extraordinarily successful and lucrative
alliance with Nunn with "Cats," "Les Miserables," "Oklahoma!" and
most recently the revival of "My Fair Lady," currently in the West
End. "There is nothing he likes more than finding an Eliza Doolittle
to reinvent or taking a great classic and making it seem fresh.
That's part and parcel of Trevor's life."</TE>
<TE>   It is the pedantic professor who is dominant during an interview
on the morning after the second preview of "Oklahoma!" at the
Gershwin Theatre, although his appearance--the sloe-eyed, rumpled
countenance; dark thick mane and goatee; thin frame in jeans and blue
work shirt--yields a hint of the much-rumored ladies' man who has
been married three times, always to actresses: Janet Suzman, dancer
Sharon Lee Hall, and his present spouse, Imogen Stubbs. Long known to
have a combative, churlish relationship with the British press, in
which he is alternately regarded with awe or attacked for making
buckets of money with commercial vehicles, Nunn appears to be biding
his time until he can sprint over to the Gershwin to work on
"Oklahoma!"</TE>
<TE>   He has his work cut out for him. Broadway's "Oklahoma!" comes with
high expectations, stemming from the success of the initial
production at the National Theatre in 1998 and subsequent transfer to
the West End, where it won four Oliviers (the British equivalent of
the Tony). When the show opened in London, English and American
critics raved. "A masterpiece of a musical, a huge hit," wrote
Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph. The New York Times' Ben
Brantley, in a roundup of London theater at the time, opined,
"Triumphant ... miraculously fresh-feeling."</TE>
<TE>   But the first previews at the Gershwin have not gone as well. ("It
ain't miraculous yet," says one production associate a week into the
run.) Audiences were complaining of its length (then 3 hours and 15
minutes).</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the challenge of getting the new leads up to snuff
with cast members imported from the English run. British actress
Josefina Gabrielle, a Nunn discovery, is re-creating her star-making
performance as Laurey, along with Georgia-born Shuler Hensley, who
won an Olivier for Jud, Aunt Eller's morose farmhand. Jessica Boevers
is the new Ado Annie; Justin Bohon, the new Will Parker; and, most
important, Patrick Wilson of "The Full Monty" fame is stepping into
the boots of Hugh Jackman, the Australian actor who originated the
role of Curly at the National before he was whisked off to movie
stardom in films such as "X-Men," "Swordfish" and "Kate &amp; Leopold."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, the chronically busy Nunn has another new revival to
maintain: "My Fair Lady," also a National Theatre smash hit that has
transferred to the West End. This on top of tending to his
80-hour-a-week duties as  the National's artistic director at South
Bank, where he will remain until early next year, when Nicholas
Hytner takes over. At the National, he is scheduled to direct a
Stoppard trilogy, collectively titled "The Coast of Utopia," as well
as a revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire," starring Glenn Close.</TE>
<TE>   Within such a context, press must seem a necessary evil, one that
Nunn apparently endures by going on at length when responding to even
the most basic questions, bringing up all sorts of irrelevant
details. Asked, for example, if he played "cowboys and Indians" as a
child growing up, the son of a humble furniture maker, he offers up a
tangential paragraph about his relationship with Peter Hall, one of
his predecessors at the National, who also happens to be from his
hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is not until Nunn responds by e-mail to follow-up
questions that he comes to life, expressing a directness and
sarcastic humor in his replies. There's also, despite the numerous
honors and acclaim, a thin-skinned petulance.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point is his response to critic Spencer's description of
him as "the most appalling public speaker ... boring ... entirely
defective in the humor department." Nunn writes, "I suppose it
depends on who you talk to about my 'public speaking.' Try asking
Judi Dench about my recent eulogy for her late husband, Michael
Williams. A long time ago I did win a prize at school for public
speaking; I have debated at both Oxford and Cambridge unions, have
addressed the Royal Academy ... and the Royal Television Society, and
the last five speeches I have made on the South Bank have caused
flocks of people to say or write that they have just heard the best
speech ever at the National. But clearly you can't please all the
people all the time." So there.</TE>
<TE>   What Nunn is articulate about is the work itself, according to
many of his collaborators. "We love him," says Ted Chapin, Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein Organization president, whom Nunn set out to woo six
years ago for the rights to "Oklahoma!" Two years later, he sought
the rights for a revival of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's "South Pacific,"
which opened last year at the National to far less praise. "He was
very captivating, discussing the serious nature of what 'Oklahoma!'
was all about. He pointed out just how good a dramatist Oscar
Hammerstein was. With Trevor, everything is challenged, investigated,
discussed, thought out. Absolutely nothing is ever arbitrary."</TE>
<TE>   Both "Oklahoma!" and "South Pacific" follow other hit revivals of
American musicals directed by Brits, including Hytner's "Carousel,"
Sam Mendes' "Cabaret" and Michael Blakemore's "Kiss Me, Kate." Some
of these directors have been able to mine the darker veins of these
works.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, at the time of the London opening of "Oklahoma!," told
British journalist David Gritten in the Daily Telegraph that Fred
Zinnemann's 1955 film of the musical had thrilling locations but not
the crumpled, dirty clothing and sweat one might expect to find out
in the West. "There's a sense they all have a fridge and a telephone
in their homes," Nunn said. Still, a grittier look notwithstanding,
isn't "Oklahoma!" just about whether Laurey will go to the box social
with her handsome cowboy or with the slovenly Jud? Does the book
really deserve all that meticulously applied scrutiny?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it starts with the British tradition to honor words,"
Chapin says. The darkness in many of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein
musicals was always there, he adds, but American directors "have been
more inclined to make jolly musicals out of what's there because of
this musical comedy mentality and also because that was the world in
which these shows were first introduced. Entertainment value was
paramount. People remembered the comedy numbers, not the ballads."</TE>
<TE>   Nunn is circumspect when considering whether Brits, by virtue of
historical and geographic distance, might be able to see American
musicals in a new light. He points out that it was Harold Prince, an
American director, who mounted the definitive revival of "Showboat"
in 1994. "It would be presumptuous of me to say that there is any
distinction," he notes, going on to explain that he and his
colleagues come from a tradition in which they continually
re-approach classics--Shakespeare, Chekhov, Shaw, Wilde--whose
meaning changes "from decade to decade, sometimes from year to year."</TE>
<TE>   "Our habit of mind is completely the same when it comes to
American musicals. We say, 'How can we inquire into this masterpiece
to discover fresh resonances?' I'm not an expert by any means, but
I'm absolutely fascinated by American history, the Civil War and the
civil rights movement. And I'm sure that being an outsider can lead
to a particular kind of admiration and particular critique, which
would not be the same if one was, on a daily basis, part of that
society."</TE>
<TE>   Nunn observes that Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein were actually quite
innovative in their critiques of American society, hewing closely to
the original source material for both "Oklahoma!" and "South
Pacific." The former was Lynn Riggs' short-lived 1935 Broadway drama,
"Green Grow the Lilacs," an affectionate memoir of his growing up in
Indian territory at the turn of the century. Says Nunn, "Both Rodgers
and Hammerstein divined that there were larger issues that underlie
the Riggs' play, and one was this outbreak of mass violence between
farmers and the cowboys, which would threaten everything this
community was trying to build if cooler heads, like Aunt Eller, were
not to prevail. They were asking the question, 'Are we grown up
enough, decent enough, common-sensical enough?'"</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, he adds, in "South Pacific," based on James Michener's
wartime tales, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein chose in 1949 to remind
Americans that they had just fought a war to prove that all men were
created equal--something that was not yet true for millions of
African Americans. In the musical, Emile DeBecque, a French
plantation owner, is in love with an Arkansas nurse who is aghast at
his "colored" children, the issue of an interracial union. Observes
Nunn, "He's the one who says, 'I know what you're against; what are
you for?' And it is a shattering moment."</TE>
<TE>   Mackintosh maintains that Nunn's a genius in that he is able to
pose these questions not only intellectually but emotionally. "Trevor
has a deep passion for the work," he says, noting that the two have
argued vociferously at times over creative differences. "He is
completely unashamed about embracing sentiment, and that's what makes
his productions so powerful. Even when we're at odds, I know he will
always wish to serve the production. He will keep talking and talking
and talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   If Nunn is more than willing to go into battle with both critics
and producers, he is protective when it comes to his actors,
according to Gabrielle, his Laurey in "Oklahoma," and Henry Goodman,
who realized a triumphant Shylock in Nunn's 1999 National production
of "The Merchant of Venice." The former, when told of the director's
reputation as a Svengali to actresses, laughs. "I don't deny that he
brought out things in me that I never knew were there," says
Gabrielle, who made her mark in the dance world first as a soloist
with the National Ballet of Portugal. "And the day after we opened in
London, I did say [like Eliza Doolittle], 'What's to become of me?'
to the resident director. But Trevor guides, he doesn't dictate."</TE>
<TE>   Goodman, who makes his musical Broadway debut on Tuesday, taking
over for Nathan Lane in "The Producers," praises Nunn for giving
actors a net over which they feel safe to pursue their instincts.
"Early on, he establishes a base camp from which to take on Everest,"
the actor says. "We talked about ['Merchant of Venice'] nearly a year
before we did it. He comes well-equipped for all eventualities
because you never know what's going to hit you."</TE>
<TE>   Stroman suggests that the Higgins label belies Nunn's comfort with
strong women. "I know Trevor's wife, Imogen Stubbs, and she is very
strong and very bright. He's definitely attracted to women who are
fearless, who will challenge him. What makes this 'Oklahoma!'
different is that the women are more like pioneer women; they have a
stronger, more freeing spirit. The women stand their ground. In a
number like 'Many a New Day,' which was originally staged with women
brushing their hair and dancing in bloomers, the women now mock the
cowboys and toss Curly's hat around. I wouldn't have done this show
had it not been for Trevor."</TE>
<TE>   Some British critics, such as Sheridan Morley, writing in the
Spectator, have faulted Nunn for putting the National's resources
into "South Pacific" (presumably because he couldn't get the rights
to "Mary Poppins," Morley adds sarcastically) instead of developing
"unknown Sondheims."</TE>
<TE>   But Mackintosh said that Nunn's ability to elevate musicals such
as "South Pacific" and "My Fair Lady" to equal rank with dramatic
classics may be one of his lasting legacies at the National. "He
proved that you could do musical work and still be considered a great
director," Mackintosh says. "It wasn't slumming."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, one would be hard-pressed to include in that list Nunn's
"Starlight Express," Andrew Lloyd Webber's lightweight musical about
trains that was trashed by U.S. critics when it came to Broadway in
1987 but won commercial approval in London. By e-mail, Nunn insisted
that "Starlight" was an "attempt to create a visceral,
non-linguistic, rule-breaking theatrical event, expressed through the
competing genres of popular music.... It ran for 17 years, and if
there weren't a dearth of London theaters, would be running still. I
think of it more as an experiment with the idea of 'installation'
rather than show."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Nunn believes that the media attention paid to his
mega-productions has unfairly eclipsed his nonmusical work and his
innovations as an administrator who created several new theaters
while at the Royal Shakespeare Company and reorganized the ensemble
system there and at the National.</TE>
<TE>   Any discussion of Nunn's new work should probably start with the
huge endowments he has created for both theaters as a result of his
musical hits. By his estimates, Nunn left the Royal Shakespeare with
an annual income of $1.5 million from "Les Miserables" royalties, and
the National is likely to benefit from "Oklahoma!" and "My Fair Lady"
for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   As for the charge that he is not nurturing new work or audiences
at the National, Nunn succinctly replies via e-mail that the National
is producing more new plays that at any other time in its history,
that new theaters are being developed for experimental work, and that
"we have hugely broadened our audience."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's done a very good job," critic Spencer says. "He's
kept the place full, done very good work with these musicals and ran
a very strong ensemble company. The writing was weak in early years
but is much stronger now."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the National of late has been lauded for premiering such
new plays as Joe Penhalls' award-winning "Blue/Orange," Mark
Ravenhill's "Mother Clap's Molly House" and the currently running
"Humble Boy" by Charlotte Jones, starring Diana Rigg and Russell
Beale.</TE>
<TE>   Stoppard's trilogy looks to be a fitting coda to his tenure at the
National, given how the director describes its themes: "How do you
approach utopia? Even, if we can identify utopia, how do we reach it
and at what price? Is it fine to kill people along the way because a
better society would be at the end of it?"</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to see what attracted Nunn to the project. The one
thing that appears to unite most, if not all, of his work is a
fervent belief in the humanistic evolution toward a just society.
Quoting Victor Hugo's preface to "Les Miserables," he says, "Yes, I
do believe like him, like Chekhov, that a mixture of God's blessing
and brave people and taking the necessary action will deliver the
future we believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Stoppard says such a belief, while not naive, is hard to defend
given the present political and religious climate worldwide, but that
such sentiments are vintage Nunn. One of the protagonists in all
three plays, he adds, is Alexander Herzen, a Russian radical who went
from elation to despondency at the state of social development in
Europe. "But he did not end up a pessimist," Stoppard says. "He had a
fundamental faith that history had no libretto and that it was very
much in our hands how history turned out. We should not think we were
just characters in some ridiculous comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, no doubt, will continue to explore that faith in his work as
a freelance director next year. He would say nothing of his plans
apart from the fact that he is developing a movie ("contemporary and
set in both Britain and America") to fill in a part of his resume
that is comparatively scanty ("Hedda," "Lady Jane" and "Twelfth
Night"). He also hopes to do a revival of a Stephen Sondheim musical
("one of his masterpieces"), and has opera and television projects in
the pipeline. "But it will all happen, from now on, according to a
schedule that's more about living, more about family--with things
like vacations, which I have not had for five years."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Nunn will even have the opportunity to explore for the
first time the land that the characters of "Oklahoma!" profess to
love so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm determined one day to go down the old Route 66 and stop many
times along the way, to have the full American experience," Nunn
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I did have a life-changing experience of going up into the
Rockies in a small plane some years back. It was the most frightened
I've ever been while also being the most awed. I had the feeling,
'Wouldn't this be a rapturous way to go?'"</TE>
<TE>   "Oklahoma!" opens Thursday at the Gershwin Theatre, 222 W. 51st
St., New York. $20-$90 (212) 307-4100 or (800) 755-4000.</TE>

nominated? Think again. Awards won't change the status quo.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's March, it's Oscar season, I'm writing an article for a great
metropolitan newspaper, so that must mean there's some craziness
going on with African Americans in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The last time I wrote a piece on black people and gold statues was
about eight years ago when spotting a black person at the Academy
Awards was as hard as ... well, spotting a black person at the
Academy Awards. This year, it's a whole new Oscar show. You'd have to
travel nearly three decades in the Way Back Machine to a time when
three--count 'em, three--black people have been nominated for Oscars
in the same year.</LD>
<LD>   And not those cut-rate best supporting Oscars, but the
guaranteed-to-meet-leading people variety: Will Smith in "Ali,"
Denzel Washington in "Training Day," and Halle Berry in "Monster's
Ball." And they've got to have put in some great performances to get
those nominations 'cause I don't know anybody who's seen more than
one of those films.</LD>
<TE>   Plus, as a bonus, the great Sidney Poitier is being tossed one of
those honorary "thanks for still being alive" Oscars they give away
every year. So, with all that, you'd think it'd be a great day for
black folk in Hollywood. You'd think. But behind every statue of a
naked man is a little controversy.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of people, mostly outside of Hollywood, making a
big deal out of whether this year's Oscar race is truly a turning
point for blacks or just a blip on the fluke meter. Do nominations
mean long-term gains for black artists, or come the Monday after the
Sunday of the awards show, will talented brothers and sisters with
Yale acting school degrees still be lining up for bit parts in
keepers like "How High"?</TE>
<TE>   Sure, some actors got a nod, but where are the nominations for
black directors, sound recorders and craft servicemen? Darnell Hunt,
director of the Center for African American Studies at UCLA wonders,
"Will this turn out to be more of a symbolic gesture than an
indication that things are fundamentally changed?" Kweisi Mfume, the
top dog at the NAACP, was quoted as saying: "Almost 90 years after
D.W. Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation' and ... we're still at the same
point, asking the same questions. Why are so many roles and so many
individuals overlooked by the academy?"</TE>
<TE>   The academy.</TE>
<TE>   And that right there is the problem with the rumpus du jour:
Things in Hollywood may stink for blacks, they may keep on stinking,
but they're not going to get any better using the Oscars as a
measuring stick for any kind of achievement.</TE>
<TE>   I've got a real problem wrapping my head around the idea of the
Oscars being of any real consequence. It's not like they've ever been
a contest measured in fairness. Is it fair Cher's got one and Betty
Bacall doesn't? That Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton got blanked
seven times each? Most actors go to their graves without so much as
getting invited to an after-party, let alone being nominated for an
award.</TE>
<TE>   And you can't say the academy has ignored legitimately great
performances from Hollywood's best African American talent:
Washington, Poitier, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lou Gossett Jr., Morgan
Freeman, Dorothy Dandridge, Paul Winfield, Adolph Caesar, Diana Ross,
Whoopi Goldberg.... So unless somebody's talking about instituting
some kind of quota system for people of color--and if so, then I'd
say Latino and Asian American talent have got the biggest beef if,
unfortunately, not the loudest lobbying groups--I'm not sure there is
or can be a requisite number of blacks nominated each year.</TE>
<TE>   But more than anything else, nominations or no, do we really need
Hollywood to hip us to outstanding performances by black actors? Does
anyone really take pride in having their artistic abilities judged by
the same people who bestowed upon us "Driven" and "The Wedding
Planner"? Maybe the guys who did the "Rollerball" remake consider it
an honor, but personally I admire the likes of Sean Penn and Woody
Allen, cats a little too secure to need other people's approval.</TE>
<TE>   That there's any kind of rowdy-dow over three nominations makes it
pretty obvious that blacks still have a long way to go in show biz.
When Juneteenth Day finally arrives in Tinseltown, it'll be easy to
spot. It'll be the day when three or four or 10 minorities are
nominated in three or four or 10 categories and nobody cheers and
nobody complains and I'm not writing any articles about it. It'll be
a great day when a rainbow of people getting Oscars is just another
day.</TE>

<HD>Secrets of an Oscar Seer</HD>
<DH>Predicting the winners is a lot like handicapping. It helps
if you ignore your own favorites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andrew Beyer, the superlative handicapper and horse racing columnist
for the Washington Post, once wrote about meeting an ancient gambler,
still a regular at the track and still studying the Racing Form with
undiminished fervor. "If I'd put this much time and effort into
studying the law," the man told him, "I'd be on the Supreme Court by
now."</LD>
<LD>   I know what he means.</LD>
<LD>   After decades of closely studying the Oscars, I have very little
concrete to show for it, not even a peerless record of
prognostication (more about that later). Still, I and my fellow Oscar
watchers, like Beyer's "addicted horseplayers," wouldn't have it any
other way. The Oscars are so important in the international film
cosmos as well as Hollywood and so ultimately unpredictable that once
you get the urge to handicap them, you're hooked for life.</LD>
<TE>   I have learned over the years that picking the Oscars is in fact
an awful lot like picking winners at the track. There are numerous
factors that can influence the outcome, and their indications are
often contradictory. Your task as prognosticator is not only to
identify the relevant circumstances, but to determine, by instinct as
much as intellect, which one will be predominant for any given race.
While it's relatively easy to explain, on the morning after, why a
particular actor or film won or lost, figuring it out ahead of time
is considerably more challenging. Especially so this year.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the competition for nominations, which was far less wide
open than generally perceived, the race among the finalists is the
most frustrating in memory. Talk to veteran Oscar sages and the
phrases they use are "fuzzy," "unclear," "an absence of momentum" and
"weirdly evenly balanced." So, even though I will not shy away from
making choices, this seemed to be a good year to look at how Oscar
predictors work, to share with the world, or at least the percentage
that cares, the precepts we live by.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with some general guidelines, of which the most
central is the understanding that the Oscars, very much like any
award, have only a tangential relationship to the quality of a given
film. What an award does is express the taste of a particular group
of people, nothing more, nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   So the task is not figuring out what a "good" film or performance
is, but determining what academy members like. It means, and this is
often the hardest thing for beginning prognosticators to get used to,
completely forgetting about one's own likes and dislikes, one's own
ideas of quality. Even if your personal taste is impeccable, it not
only doesn't matter, it will likely get in your way.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the Oscars were awarded by you and your immediate family
or, by extension, the people you work with. Because you've put in a
great deal of time with those groups, you could probably say, with a
fair chance of success, what direction their taste runs to. Just
living in L.A. and absorbing the zeitgeist of the town gives you an
advantage over those who live in other cities, even cosmopolitan New
York. A taste for a certain film is simply in the air, and if you pay
attention, anyone can pick up the scent.</TE>
<TE>   If you work in or around the movie business, that's, of course, an
added advantage, but civilians can compensate by paying attention to
the winners of the various guild awards that precede the Oscars.
Although a correlation you can take to the bank doesn't exist, the
winners of the Directors Guild, Writers Guild, American Society of
Cinematographers and Screen Actors Guild awards, the Eddies for film
editors, and so on, can be powerful indicators of trends that might
be developing.</TE>
<TE>   And trends do develop, often at the very last minute, so much so
that this piece would have a better chance of being accurate if it
could be written for next Sunday's paper. One of the best examples
was the 1998 best picture race, when the feeling that "Shakespeare in
Love" would upset the favored "Saving Private Ryan" grew and grew,
but so slowly that it wasn't until a day or two before the event that
its victory seemed likely.</TE>
<TE>   The final, and most critical, precept is to familiarize yourself
with the history of the Academy Awards. Although the membership of
that group changes every year, it changes at a glacial pace, and the
ethos of the Hollywood community remains remarkably constant. Just as
you can recognize characters from today's movie business in F.
Scott's Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby stories though they were written more
than 60 years ago, so the academy often votes in ways it always has.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first indicators to look for, especially in the best
picture category, is how many nominations each of the contenders
had--simply because it indicates strength across the breadth of the
academy membership. Which means this year's race will likely come
down to "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "A
Beautiful Mind" and "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   At first blush (and possibly even at final blush), "A Beautiful
Mind" seems the picture to beat. With its artfully tidied-up reality
and its uplifting message, it has seemed, from the moment it hit
screens, like a movie that was almost genetically engineered to win
the best picture Oscar. If one were to pick a favorite, this would
have to be it.</TE>
<TE>   But there are, as there always are, contradictory indications.
Although pictures without best director nominations rarely win the
big prize, "Moulin Rouge" has done a savvy job with its marketing,
turning a negative--its perceived lack of appeal to older
voters--into a positive by harvesting tributes from impressed senior
citizens such as Robert Wise and Stanley Donen.</TE>
<TE>   The film did win the Producers Guild award, which has correlated
with the Oscar win in nine of the previous 12 years. On the other
hand, the Producers Guild changed its membership this year,
increasing its total voters by close to 25%, and such a radical
change in its makeup throws its predictive prowess into question.</TE>
<TE>   And what about "Lord of the Rings"? It did get 13 nominations, but
films with a lot of nominations don't always do well. Two things
speak in its favor: Because splitting tickets between director and
film is not uncommon (it happened two of the past three years), Ron
Howard's likely win in his category could help "Rings" in this one.
And those with long memories will remember that the last time a Ron
Howard-directed picture was up for the top prize was 1995, when the
highly touted "Apollo 13" lost to a film very much like "Lord of the
Rings": Mel Gibson's "Braveheart."</TE>
<TE>   So, in direct contradiction to one of my own rules, I'm going to
abandon the obvious favorite and pick "Lord of the Rings" because I
have a personal preference for it. If I'm destined to go down with a
ship, this one seems to suit the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Selecting Ron Howard as the best director winner flows from three
usually reliable Oscar factors. No. 1, he took the Directors Guild
prize, which has correlated with the Oscar in all but five years.
Second, it's important to remember that with the acting branch as its
biggest component, the academy always seems to smile on performers
when they branch out into other fields: witness Ben Affleck and Matt
Damon's 1997 best screenplay victory for "Good Will Hunting."
Finally, following years of not being nominated by the fussy
directors' branch, the well-liked Howard has at last made it into the
tent after nearly a quarter of a century behind the camera, and
there's a feeling that this is going to be his year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sean Penn, Will Smith and Tom Wilkinson all have their
partisans, the best actor category is considered to be a two-man race
between Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. Under ordinary
circumstances, this award would be Crowe's. He plays the kind of
up-from-adversity character the academy likes (as opposed to
Washington's hostile rogue cop), he's in a film that's a fair bet to
win it all, and he took the usually reliable (11 of the past 14
years) SAG award.</TE>
<TE>   Two factors, however, are hurting his chances. No. 1, he won last
year for "Gladiator," and the academy, ever mindful of its history,
may not be willing to put him in the tiny pantheon of back-to-back
best actor winners that contains only the well-liked duo of Spencer
Tracy and Tom Hanks. Being involved in a series of well-publicized
scrapes--the academy frowns on controversy--also will likely count
against Crowe as well.</TE>
<TE>   So, although the academy probably does not care for his "Training
Day" character, or "Training Day" itself for that matter (it got but
two nominations), that leaves the overdue Denzel Washington as the
winner. Very much in his favor is the fact that he should have won
the year before last for "The Hurricane," but suffered unfairly when
that film was caught up in a controversy of its own. The academy has
a history of giving awards after the fact. Paul Newman, for instance,
took the Oscar for 1986's "The Color of Money" when he should have
won for the last film he was nominated for, 1982's "The Verdict."</TE>
<TE>   For those looking for an upset, Oscar history also shows that the
academy has frequently been partial to British actors, and with even
Sissy Spacek saying how impressed she was with his ability to
convincingly play American, "In the Bedroom's" Tom Wilkinson might
surprise some folks.</TE>
<TE>   The best actress category also comes down to a two-person
situation. The favorite has to be Spacek, because she is a respected
veteran who has not had a role of this caliber in some time; the
academy loves what it perceives to be a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Spacek has been nominated five times before and
won for 1980's "Coal Miner's Daughter." And if there's anything the
academy likes as much as a return to form, it's a young actress who'd
never previously had an Oscar-caliber role making the most of her
opportunity. Hilary Swank did that with "Boys Don't Cry" (1999) and
Halle Berry just might do the same with "Monster's Ball." Although
not the initial favorite, her nomination has been gaining momentum
the past several weeks, and it's increasingly possible that she could
catch Spacek at the wire. In fact, after her SAG victory, she looks
like she's done just that and should walk home with the statuette.</TE>
<TE>   Best supporting actor is perhaps the toughest race to call, with
only Ethan Hawke in "Training Day" considered to be out of the
running. Jon Voight is a veteran who hasn't been nominated in 16
years, but he's already won (for "Coming Home") and his work in "Ali"
is not a breakthrough. Jim Broadbent's performance in "Iris" was
enormously admired, but there does not seem to be much heat behind
that picture.</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves two respected British actors, Ben Kingsley in "Sexy
Beast" and Ian McKellen in "Lord of the Rings." Kingsley, though
superb as a soulless gangster, has already won for "Gandhi" and is in
a film that may not have been as widely seen as it deserved. Which
leaves McKellen, a brilliant actor who was the sine qua non of a very
popular film and won the SAG award. That combination will likely be
difficult to resist</TE>
<TE>   Best supporting actress, on the other hand, is probably the
easiest race to call. Although Maggie Smith, like Judi Dench in
"Shakespeare in Love," gives just the kind of showy British
performance the academy usually can't resist in a supporting role,
one of her co-stars, SAG winner Helen Mirren, is nominated along with
her, and having two actors from the same film (Kate Hudson and
Frances McDormand in "Almost Famous," Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon
in "Thelma &amp; Louise") in most cases means they will cancel each other
out.</TE>
<TE>   With Kate Winslet put aside, again for "Iris'" lack of heat, that
leaves two young but experienced actresses in career best roles. But
Marisa Tomei has already won an Oscar (for the very different "My
Cousin Vinny"), which should make Jennifer Connelly, "A Beautiful
Mind's" major surprise, the not-surprising winner.</TE>
<TE>   There's a caveat to all these choices, and that is, as that
ancient horse player would no doubt attest, in handicapping races it
is always possible to know too much. The more you start to recognize
a variety of factors as potential key indicators in the academy's
decisions, the harder it becomes to decide which one is going to be
predominant.</TE>
<TE>   With the academy, as with many things in life, it is possible to
overthink a situation, not realizing that the most obvious choice may
also be the best one. It's a lesson I'm continually trying to learn,
and if I don't get it this time, the Brooklyn Dodger fan I once was
reminds me that there's always next year.</TE>

<LD>   Marquee players: The Soundtrack of Our Lives, a psych-rock sextet
that last month won best artist at the Swedish Grammis (and which
appears Tuesday at the Roxy in West Hollywood).</LD>
<LD>   Unlikely cheerleaders: Parasol Records, a Midwestern independent
label and mail-order house. Parasol has been touting TSOOL since last
summer, when it landed U.S. distribution rights from the band's
Swedish label, Telegram/Warner. Mostly through www.parasol.com,
TSOOL's third album, "Behind the Music," has sold about 2,000 copies.</LD>
<TE>   Because we liked 'em: Why go after a major Swedish band? The
label's other Swedish connections are small bands. But nobody's music
seemed to hog the stereo at Parasol headquarters like TSOOL. "We were
just trying to get some visibility for our favorite band," label
spokesman Michael Roux said. "Parasol should not have been involved
in a record [that big]."</TE>
<TE>   Sweet sounds of Scandinavia: Fans of melodic pop, take note--in
the last month alone, four bands signed to Parasol's labels have
released albums. Starlet's third album, "When the Sun Falls on My
Feet," offers jangly guitar pop in the vein of Wilco. Club 8's
"Spring Came, Rain Fell" brims with gentle dream-pop that suggests a
muted version of Swedish forebears the Cardigans. Lasse Lindh's "You
Wake Up at Sea Tac" sprinkles hard-edged guitar into
singer-songwriter melodramas. And the Acid House Kings' "Mondays Are
Like Tuesdays and Tuesdays Are Like Wednesdays" applies cinematic
flourishes to strummed ballads.</TE>
<TE>   The invasion: TSOOL's Tuesday appearance is part of a North
American tour that began with a 10-band Swedish showcase in New York.
Who's promoting this tuneful deluge? The Swedish government, for one,
as well as Export Music Sweden, an industry cooperative. Engagements
in Montreal and Austin, Texas, for the South by Southwest festival,
preceded the L.A. gig.</TE>

<LD>As a fan of world cinema and Latin cinema in particular, "A New
Mexican Revolution" (by Lorenza Munoz, March 10) gave me hope that
things are turning around.</LD>
<LD>   Viewing Latin cinema in this country or even L.A., however, is
something of a crapshoot.</LD>
<LD>   A film like "Y Tu Mama Tambien" will be seen by a small portion of
its potential audience for two or three weeks at five or 10 theaters
(if they're lucky). The larger audience (those of us who don't run
out the first week of a film's release and subsequently miss it when
it's pulled) have to wait for either a VHS copy or a DVD to see it at
home.</LD>
<TE>   I love films; they are nourishment to me. I don't see them once
and forget about them. I will see a good film five or six or 10
times. A good film is like a good book, a good friend; there is
always something to learn or absorb no matter how many times you read
or, in this case, see it.</TE>
<TE>   That's the thing that really bothers me about the current state of
home video and Latin cinema (or world cinema for that matter). Why is
it that a film like "No One Writes the Colonel," by the Mexican
genius Arturo Ripstein, has to be bought from a distributor in Hong
Kong in order to be seen in Los Angeles, when the film itself was
shot a mere 200 or 300 miles from the Civic Center?</TE>
<TE>   It's absurd.</TE>
<TE>   Would it be asking too much to have the Latin film community
consider doing what has been recently done in Russia (via the Russian
Film Society, issuing some 150 films by Russian filmmakers) by
establishing a film society for all Spanish-speaking countries
(Spain, Portugal and Cuba figure in there too) to make not only
recent films (those which are not being distributed in the U.S.) but
also classic films (which make up a vast and rich treasure trove of
amazing examples of cinema) available on DVD to the North American
audience?</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who spend hours glued to movies on Channel 34 or 22,
watching very bad prints of some of the great films of the 1940s and
1950s, would love nothing better than to see not only these films
reissued, but the hundreds of great films that have come out of
everywhere from Mexico to Argentina treated with the respect and
admiration they deserve and made available to an audience that has no
idea they exist.</TE>

<TE>   Thanks for the article on Mexican movies, but if someone lives out
in the boonies or doesn't have the money to visit the one or two
theaters showing these and other foreign films, what can one do? Wait
for them to come out as rentals. Only one problem: Very few foreign
films are available to rent outside Hollywood (probably--I wouldn't
know 'cause I don't live in Hollywood). It's as if we have the
attitude that no one can make a good movie except an American.</TE>
<TE>   I'm still trying to find a copy of "Santitos" (Mexico, 1998) and
"The Terrorist" (India, 1998) for rent. You can't even buy "Santitos"
apparently. As for "The Terrorist," Hollywood Video has it in its
database, but just try to locate a store that has a copy. I gave up.</TE>
<TE>   Based on my unofficial record-keeping during the past three or
four years, perhaps one out of 20 foreign films and perhaps one out
of seven or eight independent films I see ads for in your paper are
available for rent 12 to 24 months after their theatrical release.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, I guess I shouldn't complain because, after all, my
local Blockbuster has 473 copies of "Get Carter" and 693 copies of
"American Pie 2." And, no, the Sundance and Independent Film cable
channels don't broadcast very many of these movies either.</TE>

<TE>   There are not enough filmmakers to show the Mexican daily struggle
to survive. Those who do, like Alfonso Arau and other filmmakers
mentioned in the article, have to go into exile to avoid political
persecution.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Mexico does not encourage young people from
lower classes to go into filmmaking by offering programs that could
reach poor regions of the country. Instead we get filmmakers who come
from higher social classes with perhaps more opportunities to reach
for resources so they can make their films.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, that is the way it works, and, sadly, that does not allow
people outside Mexico the opportunity to see and hear a rich culture
with other voices trying to be heard.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I understand that there is now a trend, among American museums, to
create new space that integrates (markets?) a museum's identity with
its collections.</LD>
<LD>   However, it is astonishing to me that the Rem Koolhaas design (or
any other) would be unanimously agreed upon by the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art's board of trustees ("Methodical Process, Radical
Result," by Suzanne Muchnic, "Art in a Proper Setting," by
Christopher Knight, March 3).</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles continues to be one of the world's most enigmatic
cities, and I suppose its architecture should reflect this.
Controversy has a long history with architecture.</LD>
<TE>   However, I suspect that the Koolhaas design, if built in Paris,
Rome or London, would be embraced as a bold statement reflecting the
city's future. Los Angeles, aesthetically poor and always defining
its future, doesn't need such statements--for better or worse, Los
Angeles lives the future every day.</TE>
<TE>   Are there no enlightened citizens to demand that a respectable art
collection be enhanced by something better than concrete and Mylar?</TE>
<TE>   It will take years to gather the $300 million-plus in private
funds. This allows time to search for ways to keep the Mylar tent
from discoloring in the intense sun and dirty air of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   While we are at it, make it pedestrian unfriendly by raising the
galleries from the original design to an even higher level off the
street, symbolically making art even more elitist.</TE>
<TE>   THOM CAMACHO</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So LACMA paid $200,000 per architect in its design competition to
come up with Koolhaas' taut wires and opaque circus tent?</TE>
<TE>   Tell you what, for 20 bucks, LACMA can have 10 minutes of my time
and need merely provide me with a pen and some bar napkins. I'll
guarantee you I can design a much better museum that fits the
character of the city and is a better showcase for art than the
pretentious designs being considered.</TE>

<HD>What's All This Detroit Noise?</HD>
<DH>The raw sound of the city's bands is earning notice. But
they scoff at the idea of a single style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics dig 'em, and fans are catching on to the White Stripes, the
Motor City boy-girl duo whose growing popularity is making the
concept of the "Detroit sound" synonymous with its raw,
folk-garage-blues.</LD>
<LD>   "White Blood Cells," the band's third release on the Long Beach
label Sympathy for the Record Industry, finished No. 4 on the Village
Voice's influential critics' poll this year, and the duo sold out
four dates at New York's Bowery Ballroom in an hour. It has even been
popping up on KROQ amid all the aggro crunch-rock, and the band
recently signed a deal with BMG affiliate V2 Records.</LD>
<LD>   The Motor City is a fertile ground for groups that share at least
a glancing kinship with the Stripes' sound, a minimal yet flexible
style that can evoke the Velvet Underground, the Cramps, the Who and
Eels while remaining its own animal. Among the most prominent are
soul-rockers the Detroit Cobras and eclectic punk-R&amp;B-popsters the
Dirtbombs, both of whom can be heard on "The Sympathetic Sounds of
Detroit," a compilation album produced by Stripes singer-guitarist
Jack White.</LD>
<TE>   So is this a phenomenon in the making? Will the attention given
the White Stripes bring a flood of Detroit bands into the mainstream,
a la Nirvana and Seattle a decade ago?</TE>
<TE>   The natives do seem to have noticed an increasing number of
looky-loos popping up in Detroit to see what's what. But as Detroit
Cobras singer Rachael Nagy puts it, "It's laughable, because there's
not one sound. It's not like Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   Nagy sees only a general similarity among some acts. "What
everyone's calling the Detroit sound right now is just true-to-form
dirty garage," she says. "It's raw, and that's as close as you can
tag it, but it's not really a sound. It's just dirty."</TE>
<TE>   The current grass-roots Detroit acts come in a dazzling variety
pack of styles, from the aforementioned soul- and
proto-punk-influenced groups to Meatmen-style rude punk (the Clone
Defects), shoe-gazers (Slumber Party) and pop of all stripes (the
Waxwings, the Sights, Outrageous Cherry, Volebeats). And this is just
a drop in the bucket.</TE>
<TE>   "No two bands in Detroit sound even vaguely close to each other,"
contends Pat Pantano, one of the Dirtbombs' two drummers. A
photographer who has shot the White Stripes and many other groups,
Pantano illustrates his point with an anecdote about one of the
scene's few common threads--Ghetto Recorders, the studio owned by
Dirtbombs bassist Jim Diamond where many bands cut their singles and
albums.</TE>
<TE>   "I went there one day, and in the studio was the Clone Defects,
who sound sort of like the Dead Boys," Pantano says. "A few days
later I had to go back, and at that point it was Slumber Party, which
is four girls who do this sort of ethereal, almost silent music with
a lot of harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a high school diploma among the lot of the Clone
Defects, and the singer for Slumber Party has a PhD in microbiology,
but that night I went to the bar, and they were all drinking
together. It's just that kind of world." He shrugs. "And that's why
it's hard [for outsiders] to pinpoint it."</TE>
<TE>   Sympathy for the Record Industry owner Long Gone John, who has a
long association with Detroit acts, isn't sure there are so many more
stellar acts in the Motor City than elsewhere. "But Jack [White]
really loves to wave the Detroit flag and pull other people along
with him," says the indie mogul, who released the "Sympathetic
Sounds" anthology last year.</TE>
<TE>   The White Stripes represent his label's greatest success, but he
has released other personal Detroit favorites as well, including the
Cobras, the Come Ons and the Von Bondies, whose 2001 debut, "Lack of
Communication," was produced by White.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Motor City's history, the diversity only makes sense.
Indeed, over the decades the phrase "Detroit sound" has been applied
to numerous seminal styles, including the proto-punk of the Stooges
and the MC5, the legendary soul of Motown Records, the R&amp;B-rock of
Mitch Ryder and the pioneering techno acts of the late 20th
century--not to mention Eminem and Kid Rock.</TE>
<TE>   What ties this loose amalgamation of acts together is an
appreciation for music that has stood the test of time and a pursuit
of excellence that can't be measured by record sales or even
popularity. This is fueled in part by demographics--not just the
racial mix that helped foster the historical diversity of sound in
the first place, but also the city's ghost-town quality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big city that's become half the [population] size it was,"
says Jim Ransweiler, who grew up in Detroit and now lives in L.A. He
runs the indie punk label Scooch Pooch Records, which released a
Cobras single in 1996 and plans a retrospective of virtually unknown
'70s Detroit punk band the Sillies for later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an empty place," Ransweiler says. "There's not enough people
to support a hundred different scenes, like here in L.A. So everybody
supports everybody else. And [the setting] does create a mind-set.
There's a lot of vacant buildings and things that sit there rotting."</TE>
<TE>   One common characterization of Detroit bands, many say, is that
they don't tend to dream of making it big. Groups get together, notes
Dirtbombs guitarist Tom Potter, because there's not a lot to do. Even
the non-musically inclined Detroiter can't help noting the richness
of the city's legacy, and musicians tend to be more obsessive there,
adds the group's singer-guitarist, Mick Collins.</TE>
<TE>   This combination of isolation and knowledge fosters an insular yet
freer environment, in which the individuality of the White Stripes,
for example, is encouraged and celebrated rather than ridiculed for
not being commercial, as they might be in New York or Los Angeles,
where bands are more inclined to focus on making it.</TE>
<TE>   If it turns out that major labels don't find much to keep them in
Detroit for more than a night or two, perhaps the spotlight on the
White Stripes will spark some curiosity among listeners about what
else the Motor City has to offer in a pop climate that seems to be
slowly turning away from slick teen pop and glib angst-mongers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Detroit Cobras could have a wider [audience],
absolutely," says Long Gone John. "They're not freaky or weird, they
don't alienate people. If more people could see them, why wouldn't
they like them? They're a great rock 'n' roll band."</TE>

<HD>A Muralist's Talent Scaled Down</HD>
<DH>The foundations of Diego Rivera's masterpieces are visible
in a show of his intimate, lively drawings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the drawbacks of being a famous artist is that viewers get
used to thinking of your work in larger-than-life-size dimensions.
Diego Rivera is a case in point. His monumental murals in Mexico
City, Cuernavaca, Mexico, New York, Detroit and San Francisco are the
stuff of legends.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the 1930s and '40s and into the '50s, Rivera's gigantic
masterpieces were lightning rods for political controversy. They
still stir deep passions, galvanizing peoples' ideas about social
justice, economic inequity and art's place in the struggle.</LD>
<LD>   These public paintings matched a personal life that was neither
private nor ordinary. Married five times to four women (who accounted
for three of his four children), Rivera, who lived from 1886 to 1957,
hobnobbed with Picasso; traveled throughout North America, Europe and
Russia; formed a union with fellow revolutionary artists David Alfaro
Siqueiros, Rivera de la Cueva and Jose Clemente Orozco; and shared
his home in Mexico City with Leon Trotsky, not to mention wife number
3, Frida Kahlo. A prodigious worker and generous teacher who was
repeatedly embraced by and expelled from his hometown's Communist
Party and art academy, Rivera was no stranger to the glamorous
fanfare of celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   At the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, "Diego Rivera:
The Brilliance Before the Brush" strips away the myths that have
grown up around the life and work of Mexico's premier modern artist.
Organized for Denver's Museo de las Americas by curator Tariana
Navas-Nieves, this straightforward show reveals the humble heart of
Rivera's art: his talent for translating direct observations into
simple emblems that resonate with complex emotions and pulse with the
dignity and drudgery of everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   The modest, refreshingly intimate exhibition consists of 42 pencil
sketches the artist made when he was a restless thirtysomething in
search of himself, before his artistic identity was established and
his place in history secured. Each charming drawing occupies a
single, 6-by-8-inch page plucked from a pocket-size sketchbook Rivera
took on a trip to rural Tehuantepec, a town and region in eastern
Oaxaca, where Mexico's isthmus reaches its narrowest point.</TE>
<TE>   As works of art, Rivera's drawings impress because of their
tautness, power and efficiency. With great economy of means, the
confident draftsman uses only a handful of decisively drawn lines and
a few quick scribbles of shading to create scenes as engaging as they
are stylized, at once spare and vivid.</TE>
<TE>   All but three of his images depict people, mostly men, women and
children carrying baskets, jugs, and mats to and from the market, or
crouching alongside stacks of produce, bread and clothing as they
sell the products of their family's labor to other farmers and
craftsmen. Rivera is at his best in composing variously sized groups
whose members all do different things.</TE>
<TE>   For example, "Sketch for Tehuanas in the Market #20" locks seven
silhouetted figures in a rectangular composition that has the
solidity of a brick wall. In contrast, "Sketch for Buying Huaraces
#17" abandons architectural stability for sweeping curves and fluid
lines, giving form to the give-and-take of face-to-face negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sketch for Tehuanas Conversing #27" fuses three women in a sturdy
pyramid of vertical and horizontal lines, their thickly woven skirts
and protective headdresses echoing one another like the refrain from
an unforgettable melody. In another picture, a ring of people turn
their backs to the world, forming such a tightly knit cluster that
it's hard to tell how many there are. And in one of the most
schematic, least detailed images, three people are positioned in a
spiral around which your eye spins as it takes in the scene's casual
dynamism.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera captures the hustle and bustle of a day at the market,
which provides both respite from solitary toil and money to buy
provisions that can't be produced at home. Like any good dramatist,
he knows that punctuating action-packed vignettes with a few quiet
moments intensifies the effects of both. He provides such points in
depictions of people sitting as still as statues.</TE>
<TE>   The lone woman in "Sketch for Pinole Vendor #41" crouches on the
ground against a blank wall. Resting her chin on her hand and her
elbow on her knee, she looks as if she's used to carrying the weight
of the world on her shoulders, without complaining for a minute. In
another work, a woman seated at a table could be lost in her own
thoughts if she didn't appear to be too exhausted to entertain any.</TE>
<TE>   End-of-the-day fatigue and disappointment are palpable in an image
of a couple seated on the ground behind an empty bowl and beside
their standing child. In "Two Figures, Sketch #40," the strain of a
relationship reverberates between a younger couple. They play a
waiting game in which his stubbornness collides with her patience.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a quarter of Rivera's images are portraits of women. None
is beautiful by conventional standards, but all embody a sense of
fresh-faced vitality. Rivera accentuates their un-idealized
individuality by emphasizing idiosyncratic details, oddly
proportioned features or character-defining expressions.</TE>
<TE>   His two portraits of men fall short of such loving observation.
Little more than caricatures, they exaggerate oddities so extremely
that they become theatrical cliches. Likewise, the infants in three
drawings lack any spark of life, revealing that Rivera's forte is the
tumult of the marketplace and the beauty of women it draws out of the
home and into the street.</TE>
<TE>   All of his drawings are animated by a sense of in-the-street
immediacy. Like handmade snapshots, they not only capture slices of
life, but also render it via the simplest of media, pencil on cheap
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly archival, the pages of Rivera's sketchbook have yellowed
with age, a golden border warming their stark white centers. With an
eye to posterity, and a nod to his own marketing savvy, Rivera has
signed every drawing, filling his sketchbook with images significant
both for what they depict and because he made them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Brilliance Before the Brush" presents works from a pivotal
time in Rivera's development. After spending 14 years in Europe,
studying Realism in Spain, Modernism in France and Renaissance
frescoes in Italy, he returned to Mexico in 1921.</TE>
<TE>   His first commission, completed in 1922, was criticized for being
too indebted to Byzantine art to speak the language of the people.
Mexico's secretary of public education, Jose Vasconcelos, sent Rivera
to Tehuantepec to "de-Europeanize" his style. Excited by the daily
dramas he witnessed, he forged, in his little sketchbooks, an
accessible style that would become the foundation and trademark of
his murals.</TE>

<HD>A Relationship Started at the Drive-In Is Kindled Again at
New Universal Label</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Drive-In broke up last year just as the edgy band was
ascending the rock ladder. Then the record label and management team
it had been working with, Gary Gersh and John Silva, split up in late
2001.</LD>
<LD>   But it's a cozy affair again: the Mars Volta, a new band featuring
ATDI singer Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez, is managed by
Silva and has become the first signing to a new record label headed
by Gersh.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just great because it's all still in the family," says
Gersh, whose yet-unnamed label is being funded and distributed by
Universal Records. "I couldn't think of a better way to start the new
label.... Omar and Cedric are two people I believe in immensely, and
I believe they have the potential to do something that not only will
a lot of kids want to hear, but will be important and stand the test
of time."</LD>
<TE>   Gersh and Silva have been closely associated since the former
signed Nirvana at Geffen Records in 1991 and the latter came on as
the band's manager. Later, Gersh was president of Capitol Records,
with a roster including Silva clients the Beastie Boys and Foo
Fighters. In the late '90s, they teamed to form their G.A.S.
management and record label firm.</TE>
<TE>   The label's first signing was ATDI, with the album eventually
released after G.A.S. merged with the Beasties' Grand Royal label,
which in turn made a distribution deal with Virgin Records. The
partnership ended when Gersh wanted to get back into the major-label
world.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of credit is being given to Universal Music Group Chairman
Doug Morris and Universal Records President Monte Lipman for making
the Mars Volta deal with Gersh's label happen. Several other labels
had been in the bidding, with Warner Bros. Records apparently the
main rival.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, though, stepped in and sweetened the deal, including
funding for Rodriguez's independent GSL Records.</TE>
<TE>   The new band, showing influences ranging from Bob Marley to King
Crimson, will begin work on an album in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh says that the signing is the perfect tone-setter for the
label as he begins to hire staff.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity that has been presented for us is incredible," he
says. "Doug and Monte would really like to have a young, stealth kind
of A&amp;R staff that finds great artists and focuses on the
record-making process, and then it's our job to run them through the
Universal system."</TE>
<TE>   NEW ASYLUM: As the leader of Minneapolis alt-rock quartet Soul
Asylum, Dave Pirner emerged from the '80s indie scene to become a
breakthrough mainstream success in the early '90s. Now he's returning
to the indie world--this time as a solo artist. His first album will
be released in June by Los Angeles-based Ultimatum Music.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels really good to be outside all that whatever it is going
on in the music industry," say Pirner, 37. "It's really good to be
back in the world of people who are music fans. It has a coming-home
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The album was recorded during the past three years in New Orleans,
where Pirner has lived since the mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   "It came together slowly," he says. "I wanted to do everything
myself and pay for everything myself, and after having made those
big-budget records, I wanted to come to grips with making a record
that was up to my standards. But we worked very hard to make it in an
organic and homespun way."</TE>
<TE>   The sound of the music, he says, is distinct from his group work,
reflecting some of the styles of his adopted home.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that makes it different than what I do with Soul Asylum
is it doesn't rely on the loud, loud, loud guitars, but kind of
explores the 'R' in R&amp;B, I guess," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pirner and Soul Asylum are still a going concern. The
band, which hasn't made an album since 1998's "Candy From a
Stranger," recently celebrated its 20th anniversary with a
Minneapolis club show, is playing occasional concerts, working on new
songs and will soon be looking for a new record deal.</TE>
<TE>   FREE AGENT: Joe Henry's ambitious "Scar" was among the
best-reviewed albums of 2001. But now, for the first time in a
decade, he's without a record contract.</TE>
<TE>   It's his choice. The L.A. singer-songwriter terminated his deal
with Walt Disney Co.-owned Mammoth Records and is taking time to
assess his options, ranging from major-label interest to self-release
avenues.</TE>
<TE>   "With a lot of music, 50,000 people can hear it and it should
still make money," he says. "My friend T Bone Burnett says that if a
new band comes out and sells 75,000 records, everyone should be
celebrating."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, as escalating costs make many million-selling albums
unprofitable, the industry has increasingly focused on the search for
mega-hits, squeezing out moderate-selling acts.</TE>
<TE>   Henry points to the experiences of other friends as developments
that point the way for him, including Tom Waits' deal with L.A. punk
label Epitaph Records, and the Aimee Mann-Michael Penn independent
release venture United Musicians.</TE>
<TE>   While waiting to sort out his situation, Henry's been working on a
movie score and has just produced an album by R&amp;B great Solomon
Burke, which will be released by the Fat Possum label. The album
features Burke with a small combo, and songs written for the project
by Van Morrison and Elvis Costello, plus previously unrecorded songs
by Waits, Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Chuck D., who did the theme song for the Fox TV
series "Dark Angel," is serving as executive producer for a
soundtrack album from the show. Featured will be an extended version
of the theme--teaming him with MC Lyte--and new tracks from John
Forte featuring Tricky, MC Lyte, Samantha Cole and Niki Harris, plus
previously released songs by Foxy Brown, Q-Tip and Mystic. It's due
in late April or early May from D.'s SlamJamz label via Artemis
Records....</TE>
<TE>   English electronica label Ministry of Sound is close to a U.S.
distribution deal with MCA Records. It may include recordings by
Fischerspooner, a New York act generating a buzz for its retro
electro-pop music and its elaborately staged, hedonistic
performances....</TE>
<TE>   Frank Black has done a version of Waits' "The Black Rider" for his
next album, "Black Letter Days." Recorded live in the studio to
two-track tape with his band the Catholics, the album is due from the
What Are Records label in late summer.... The Pet Shop Boys have
signed with U.S. independent label Sanctuary Records, with a new
album, "Release," due April 23 and a tour to follow....</TE>
<TE>   After six albums on Virgin Records, English singer Julia Fordham
is on her second label in less than a year. Atlantic's Division One
folded late last year shortly before the scheduled release of her
"Concrete Love" album. She's now signed with Vanguard, which will
release the soul-laced album, produced by Larry Klein, on June 18.

<LD>   NORAH JONES</LD>
<LD>   "Come Away With Me"</LD>
<TE>   Blue Note</TE>
<TE>   Despite training in jazz, Jones has musical instincts that seem
tied far more closely to a soulful, sometimes country-accented brand
of pop that is showcased marvelously in this album debut.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old Texan's deliberate, molasses-like vocal style is
so understated that it may seem one-dimensional on first listening,
but the restraint eventually hooks you with its haunting allure and
underlying sense of longing.</TE>
<TE>   Moving between such extremes as the honky-tonk lament of Hank
Williams' "Cold, Cold Heart" and the pop-standard turf of Hoagy
Carmichael and Ned Washington's "The Nearness of You," Jones seems
equally comfortable and controlled. She even turns John D.
Loudermilk's semi-novelty "Turn Me On" into a teasingly sensual
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also has some impressive originals from songwriters Lee
Alexander and Jesse Harris, who play in her band and contribute such
smart, fresh numbers as numbers as "Don't Know Why" and "Seven
Years."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Arif Mardin, who has worked with such exquisite singers
as Aretha Franklin and Dusty Springfield, has enough faith in Jones
and the material to keep the arrangements intimate and tasteful.</TE>
<TE>   In this age of media overkill, Jones, who will be at the House of
Blues in West Hollywood on April 3-4, is getting a lot of attention.
But don't think that it's just hype. The highlights here reflect an
individuality and honesty that are reminiscent, in a much more
low-key way, of Shelby Lynne's extraordinary "I Am Shelby Lynne"
collection.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   SUPER FURRY ANIMALS</TE>
<TE>   "Rings Around the World"</TE>
<TE>   XL Recordings/Beggars Group</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to dismiss as frivolous a band that calls itself Super
Furry Animals, has a song titled "Happiness Is a Worn Pun" and
incorporates prank phone calls into its centerpiece title track. But
on the U.S. release of its sixth album (last year's U.K. version plus
a seven-song bonus disc), the Welsh quintet joins the league of XTC,
Pulp and Blur among Britain's most consistently rewarding, witty
purveyors of imaginative pop and cultural anthropology.</TE>
<TE>   A recurring theme in "Rings" (in stores Tuesday) is the fate of
regional and individual identities in a shrinking world, with singer
Gruff Rhys imagining the Caspian Sea merging with Irish lakes and
Korean suburbs as a backdrop to heartbreak. In the title song, he
fears that "sooner or later we will melt together" as cell phones
make solitude anachronistic--although with its hyper-Beach Boys
bubbliness, it may be the most joyous song about satellite
telecommunications since "Telstar."</TE>
<TE>   Melting has been good for the music, with SFA gleefully and
confidently layering sunny Beatles psychedelia and seductive
Bacharach strings with three or four subsequent generations of rock,
adorned with lightly applied techno filigree and a variety of
peekaboo sonic surprises. Like much great pop music, it is frivolous,
but with purpose.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   CUSTOM</TE>
<TE>   "Fast"</TE>
<TE>   ARTISTdirect</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to music, you're not always looking for the great
love of your life--that special artist worth a long-range commitment.
Sometimes a little fling is all you want, and who's to say there's
anything wrong with enjoying a first-rate seduction, even if you know
you're getting snowed?</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Custom, a singing-songwriting guilty pleasure who
purrs in your ear like a Brit-rock urchin (though he's from New York)
and showers you with promises of exotic adventure and erotic
edginess. Sonically, lyrically and melodically, his debut album (in
stores Tuesday) lays it on so thick that you don't have time to
deploy your defenses. It's more fun to play along with these blends
of swaggering grandiosity and tender vulnerability, concocted from a
shot of Bowie/Cure youthful ache, a dash of Queen bombast, an
infusion of Nine Inch Nails' tortured soul.</TE>
<TE>   Custom (whose real name is Duane Lavold) taunts his teenage
girlfriend's father in "Hey Mister," storyboards a cinematic tale
about assassin and target in "Streets" (he's also a filmmaker,
wouldn't you know?), and describes a messy romantic triangle in
"Morning Spank," all with faux-gritty and raunchy-naughty flair.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to believe a minute of it to enjoy it thoroughly.
And there's no need to hate yourself in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   THE REPUTATION</TE>
<TE>   "The Reputation"</TE>
<TE>   Initial</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Elmore has been hurt--by boyfriends, by the breakup of
her band Sarge after a quarter-note in the spotlight in 1998, by
"so-called friends" who vanished after she shelved her pop
aspirations to focus on her Northwestern Law School studies. But her
piquant dissection of such transgressions on her new band's upcoming
debut resists fits of sulking or rage.</TE>
<TE>   Duplicity and rejection, loyalty and self-reliance--it's pretty
much the same mud fellow Midwesterner Liz Phair wallowed in, but
Elmore bakes it with resolve, guitars firing, keyboards fluttering,
drums struggling mightily to keep up. One stride ahead of the
pop/punk rattle, Elmore's flat-like-an-angel vocals belie some of her
songs' feral content: You've learned to play the victim perfectly /
If everything's my fault you're not to blame / for all your simpering
diatribes on how I've caused you so much pain.</TE>
<TE>   Her streaming anecdotes give the listener the feeling of walking
right into the middle of life-altering events. Maybe, now that Elmore
is hitting the clubs and not the law library, we have. The Reputation
performs tonight at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, Monday at Spaceland in
Silver Lake and Wednesday at the Glass House in Pomona.</TE>

<TE>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</TE>
<TE>   "Blade II" soundtrack"</TE>
<TE>   Immortal</TE>
<TE>   The teaming of some the biggest names from the genres of hip-hop
and electronic music gives the soundtrack to "Blade II" a unifying
concept. But despite the genre-crossing duets, including Cypress Hill
with Roni Size and Paul Oakenfold with Ice Cube, this is still a
collection (due in stores Tuesday) of various artists, and as such it
suffers from the inconsistency that plagues many compilations.</TE>
<TE>   Eve and Fatboy Slim's "Cowboy" is a complete mess, with Eve
rushing out cliches over the normally skilled Slim's clanging
instrumentation, which sounds like a child banging kitchen utensils.
On the opposite end is Massive Attack and Mos Def's "1 Against 1,"
whose rhythmic digital beats make an excellent contrast for Def's
up-tempo rhyming. Also notable is "Tao of the Machine," a natural
meshing of BT's large trance hooks and the Roots' rapid-fire
delivery.</TE>
<TE>   These and the other successful tracks, including Moby and
Mystikal's dark "Gettin' Aggressive," work because the styles find a
way to coexist. But more often, one artist overpowers the other, as
Redman does to Gorillaz in "Gorillaz on My Mind." The idea behind the
"Blade II" soundtrack is a good one. Maybe by "Blade III" it'll be
perfected.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Baltin</TE>

<TE>   CLINIC</TE>
<TE>   "Walking With Thee"</TE>
<TE>   Domino</TE>
<TE>   Let's see: Hail from Liverpool. Endorsed by the alchemist laureate
of modern rock, Thom Yorke. Named buzzworthy by Rolling Stone.
Original shtick--they wear surgical masks while performing.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing, because the arty babble emanating from this quartet's
second album is so ... well, dirty. Imagine a surf/punk band with
broken guitars locked overnight in a cobwebbed studio, and here is
what you get--wobbly organ lines and assorted keyboard squalor that
pulse behind Ade Blackburn's measured bleating. The haunting results
feel as if the players have scared the songs out of their
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   While their sound makes for an intriguing change of pace, songs
such as "Harmony," "Come Into Our Room" and the title track merely
brim with drama rather than deliver any sort of payoff. Perhaps
that's enough. But maybe--amid all that smoldering and no fire--you
root for Clinic's drone to exceed its buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Clinic performs Tuesday at the Troubadour in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   --K.B.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Billy Bragg &amp; the Blokes, "England, Half-English," Elektra.
Having explored 20th century Americana via Woody Guthrie lyrics and
collaborations with Wilco in two albums, the London leftist returns
his social critic's attention with new insights and vigor to life as
an "Anglo hyphen Saxon in England.co.uk." Bragg celebrates the
proliferation of other multicultural U.K. hyphenations in both words
(the Ian Dury-like title song) and music (with former 3 Mustaphas 3
string player Ben Mandelson and former Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan
leading the Blokes). S.H.</TE>
<TE>   ** Ol' Dirty Bastard, "The Trials and Tribulations of Russell
Jones," D3. With a real life more chaotic than any of the ones
depicted on his crazed recordings, this Wu-Tang Clan member must have
patched together his third album (due Tuesday) in between trips to
rehab and prison. ODB's maniacal, rancid raps ring with his typical
paranoia, but he seems like a guest on his own project. In fact, a
bevy of cameos from less charismatic rappers and the collection's
B-level production create their own set of tribulations--for
listeners.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Vocal Sampling, "Cambio de Tiempo," Ciocan Music. It's been a
long road to U.S. release for this third album by Cuba's astonishing
a cappella vocal group. Recorded two years ago and released last year
in Europe, the 14-song collection got derailed here by Sept. 11. The
wait is worth it. The six-man group, founded for fun in 1992, has
perfected its vocal ventriloquism and expanded its repertoire with
outstanding original songs by leader Rene Banos, such as the clever
narrative "Melodia de la Impaciencia."</TE>

<LD>   CHUCHITO VALDES JR.</LD>
<LD>   "Encantado"</LD>
<TE>   Town Crier</TE>
<TE>   The brilliant pianist-composer Chucho Valdes long has been a star
of Afro-Cuban jazz, but now his influence extends to another
generation, through the dynamic work of his son, Chuchito. Like his
father, he commands a leonine keyboard technique, ferocious rhythmic
energy and a palpably charismatic performing style. All these virtues
come through vividly on this glorious recording, one of the more
persuasive Afro-Cuban releases in recent memory. For starters, Valdes
exploits the full range of the keyboard, unleashing a mighty arsenal
of lightning quick octaves, thunderous tremolo chords and fast-flying
scales. As composer, Valdes proves himself conversant in various
facets of Afro-Cuban music, from the lush romanticism of his "Bolero
en Chicago" to the ingenious harmonies of "Son Cha Cha Cha" to the
exuberant rhythms of "Homenaje Bebo" (a tribute to the elder
statesman of the great family, Bebo Valdes). Best of all, Chuchito
presides over an unusually effective band that respects Afro-Cuban
tradition while gently coaxing it into a more modern age. The sheer
chordal complexity of this music, as well as the originality of solos
from reed player Laksar Reese and Valdes himself, reaffirm the
vitality of ancient Afro-Cuban musical forms for a new century.</TE>

<TE>   JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome Home"</TE>
<TE>   Dreyfus Jazz</TE>
<TE>   French jazz often is stereotyped as lyrical and understated, but
pianist Pilc quickly sabotages such preconceptions. The sheer
explosiveness of the opening track, a radical reconsideration of
Miles Davis' "So What," proves that Pilc has other priorities in
mind, his sharp dissonances, oft-steely tone and Herculean virtuosity
at times placing him closer to Cecil Taylor than Claude Bolling.
Similarly, the tonal intensity and rhythmic drive that Pilc brings to
John Coltrane's "Cousin Mary" and the outlandish new harmonies he
applies to Coltrane's "Giant Steps" underscore the pianist's fervor
and fearlessness. Even in ballads, Pilc revels in daring techniques,
thoroughly changing rhythmic values in "Stella by Starlight" and
taking Duke Ellington's "Solitude" into harmonic regions it has not
gone before. Though bassist Francois Moutin and drummer Ari Hoenig
prove thoroughly in tune with Pilc's ever-shifting moods, ultimately
it's the intellectual depth, musical erudition and digital prowess of
Pilc's pianism that distinguish this disc, which arrives like a gust
of fresh air.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   MARK COLBY</TE>
<TE>   "Tenor Reference"</TE>
<TE>   Hallway Records</TE>
<TE>   Great jazz musicians do not necessarily acquire fame commensurate
with their talent, as the career of tenor saxophonist Colby attests.
Although admired as a first-call studio player and top-notch educator
in Chicago, Colby hardly is known as a headliner, but this recording
could go a long way to change that. The man's solos combine a
composer's control and forethought with an improviser's sense of
spontaneity and expressive freedom. In the jazz standard "Beautiful
Love," he crafts unusually poetic cadenzas that easily withstand
repeated hearings; in his own "Blues of a Kind," he produces utterly
distinctive timbral effects; and in the classic ballad "My One and
Only Love," the delicacy, honesty and emotional surge of his playing
are unforgettable. That the recording was made live in a nightclub
only adds to the significance of Colby's achievement, for it is not
easy to attain this degree of nuance in a rowdy setting.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   MISHA MENGELBERG QUARTET</TE>
<TE>   "Four in One"</TE>
<TE>   Songlines</TE>
<TE>   The term "avant-garde" often scares listeners, but unconventional
music rarely has been made more accessible than in this beguiling
disc from indefatigable Dutch pianist Mengelberg. Joined by the
versatile trumpeter Dave Douglas, Mengelberg shrewdly opens the
recording with two decidedly nonthreatening tracks, the first as
whimsical as its title ("Hypochristmutreefuzz"), the second
unabashedly melodic ("Reef"). And though subsequent tracks such as
"Kneebus" may open with a bit of musical anarchy, even in these
instances it isn't long before a discernible tune--or at least a
fragment of one--rings out. Along the way, Mengelberg and friends
provide snippets of oompah marches, Gypsy melodies, swing rhythm and,
of course, the pianist's famously ephemeral, pointillistic piano
style.</TE>

<HD>From Sour Notes to Right Keys</HD>
<DH>Music: BMG is on track to post a profit in 2002, after
years of bad press, management and artistic turmoil, and financial
setbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The champagne flowed freely at the posh Argyle Hotel on Grammy night
as Bertelsmann Music Group Chairman Rolf Schmidt-Holtz toasted the
victory of his latest star, Alicia Keys, who took home five awards,
tying a record for the most by a female artist on a single Grammy
telecast.</LD>
<LD>   The soul singer's success and her critically lauded debut album,
"Songs in A Minor," have put the German music giant back on the map.
Keys' album has sold 8 million copies worldwide and generated
$10million in profit for BMG's new J Records, a joint venture with
legendary music executive Clive Davis. Keys' breakthrough was a sweet
surprise for BMG, which has weathered years of bad press, threats by
artists to leave the company, management turmoil and financial
setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   These days, BMG appears to be making progress in repairing its
struggling Arista and RCA labels, which have delivered hits by
Outkast, Pink, Usher and Alan Jackson. So far this year, BMG has four
of the top 10 best-selling records and ranks second in U.S. market
share among the five major music corporations.</LD>
<TE>   Not bad for a music company that was in such dire shape last year
that its German parent, Bertelsmann, the world's fourth-largest media
conglomerate, considered getting out of music altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's $17 billion in sales last year came from many
sources, including music, book publishers Random House and Gruner &amp;
Jahr and Europe's TV behemoth RTL Group. And Bertelsmann Chief
Executive Thomas Middelhoff is preparing the company, founded in
1835, to go public.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing Bertelsmann's music business, though, has taken a lot of
effort. For the fiscal year ended in June, BMG's $3.2 billion in
sales marked a 12% drop from two years earlier. Schmidt-Holtz refused
to discuss the financial details of BMG's downfall--as did BMG's
Chief Operating Officer Michael Smellie. Company sources, however,
said political infighting and other mistakes made under the previous
management cost BMG about $400 million in operating losses in fiscal
2001.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a management shakeup, Middelhoff forced out BMG's top
two executives, Michael Dornemann and Strauss Zelnick, whom the
corporation now blames for most of the music unit's financial and
morale problems. Fifteen months ago, Middelhoff installed
Schmidt-Holtz, 53, a former TV executive, as BMG's music chief. Since
then Schmidt-Holtz has announced 1,500 layoffs worldwide after
discovering, among other things, that BMG's North American music
division had not posted a profit since it was launched in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Starting to See Signs of Life'</TE>
<TE>   With the help of some hit records and cost cutting, BMG says it
broke even in the last six months of 2001 and expects to turn a
$100-million-plus operating profit for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finally starting to see signs of life after a long,
disastrous turn of events," Schmidt-Holtz said in his first extensive
interview since taking over the music company.</TE>
<TE>   "When I arrived, what I found was a company in shambles. A
financial mess. A political nightmare. We had lost all credibility
with our artists and our labels. We had lost the backing of our own
shareholders. Nobody believed in BMG. And why? All because of ego and
arrogance on the part of BMG managers. Corporate arrogance nearly
killed this company."</TE>
<TE>   BMG blames Dornemann and Zelnick for infuriating the artistic
community after driving Davis from power at Arista, the label he
founded 25 years ago and now is home to Santana and Whitney Houston.
Dornemann and Zelnick also locked horns with Zomba Group record chief
Clive Calder, head of BMG's other top creative engine, which releases
music by Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.</TE>
<TE>   Dornemann would not comment about BMG. Zelnick issued a statement
that said, "I spent six enjoyable years at BMG. I am proud of the
work I did and of my team's performance."</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann fired its controversial management team, but was
forced to enter an expensive, face-saving joint venture to keep Davis
that cost BMG more than $100million in start-up costs for the J label
and permitted him to raid Arista of dozens of top executives and
artists, including Keys. It also means Bertelsmann reaps only 50% of
the profit from J, including Keys' hit album.</TE>
<TE>   Dornemann and Zelnick squandered hundreds of millions of dollars,
sources say, on a variety of misguided ventures, according to an
internal company audit of BMG commissioned by Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corporate Infighting Damaged Credibility</TE>
<TE>   The corporate drama that decimated BMG has drawn comparisons to
similar upheavals that ravaged music divisions at AOL Time Warner
Inc. and EMI Group, which led to an exodus of top executives and
artists as well as a massive erosion in profit and market share.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite simply, all of this political infighting robbed [BMG] of
its credibility," COO Smellie said. "It hurt us. There's no point in
pretending it didn't. The creative values of the company were
severely eroded. It's a hard thing to turn a company around after
devastation like this."</TE>
<TE>   A big chunk of BMG's losses stems from an estimated $60 million in
severance packages for Dornemann, Zelnick and other former
executives, including former BMG tech guru Kevin Conroy, according to
company sources. That's more than half of the additional $100million
paid in exit packages for the 1,500 employees who are losing their
jobs during the restructuring of BMG's corporate operation.</TE>
<TE>   The company also was forced to write off more than $40 million in
Internet investments, direct-marketing schemes and other botched
ventures launched by Zelnick and Conroy with Dornemann's approval.
BMG racked up an additional $40 million in losses for its German
division after management problems there and a significant downturn
in the music market.</TE>
<TE>   But BMG's biggest financial hit stemmed from the Arista fiasco, in
which the company ate nearly $100million in write-offs and lost
revenue last year. By the time Davis left the label, the clever
entrepreneur had emptied the talent pipeline at Arista.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Millions Spent to Pacify Top Artists</TE>
<TE>   When new Arista President Antonio Reid arrived, there was little
product to release, no artists in the studio and few executives left
to run the label. The result: BMG's hottest creative engine released
only a few records during the first six months of 2001, which cost
the company an estimated $50 million in sales. In addition, sources
say Reid spent about $25 million hiring a staff, signing acts and
renegotiating several key deals to pacify top artists, including
Whitney Houston, who were upset about Davis' departure. Reid also
racked up about $25 million in write-offs as he cleaned house at
Arista, cutting ties with a variety of acts and executives before
starting over.</TE>
<TE>   This does not account for the $100 million BMG previously paid to
Reid and his partner to buy the second half of their Atlanta-based
LaFace label--a move by Zelnick to lure him to New York to replace
Davis at Arista.</TE>
<TE>   "You know people talk about temperamental artists, but these are
gifted individuals who create music," Schmidt-Holtz said. "What do
arrogant executives bring to the table? Nothing at all. In fact, they
destroy value. They open a company up to risk. And in the end, their
bungling causes thousands of people to lose their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt-Holtz said he had no idea that BMG was in such bad shape
when he agreed to take over. Neither did the company's executive
committee until last March, when he shared the results of an internal
audit that detailed BMG's financial state.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee's first reaction was, 'It can't be true,'" he said.
"They thought I was kidding.... The truth was a real shock for them.
I said, 'Listen, either we drastically change the way we do business
or we die.'"</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt-Holtz and Smellie implemented a massive overhaul designed
to save Bertelsmann nearly $200 million by the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plan to Capitalize on Elvis Presley Treasures</TE>
<TE>   The pair significantly slashed BMG's artist roster and
orchestrated its exit from music deals in small markets such as
Turkey and the Scandinavian nations.</TE>
<TE>   They also cut acts in the U.S., shut down RCA's urban division and
dumped several money-losing joint-venture labels.</TE>
<TE>   BMG is negotiating an end to its joint venture with Bad Boy
founder Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, who it will pay more than $30 million
to leave. The Bad Boy label reportedly is losing $25 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt-Holtz also has decided to unleash an international Elvis
Presley campaign, hoping to capitalize on RCA's vault of Presley
treasures.</TE>
<TE>   A package of Presley hit singles is scheduled for release in some
markets before year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel quite good about how J and Arista and RCA are
progressing," Smellie said. "But of course, when you dig around and
discover how much money it cost to get where we are, and how wacky
the decision-making process was, you almost have to scratch your head
and say, 'It's a little like Alice in Wonderland, isn't it?'"</TE>

<HD>Amid Middle East Strife, a New Focus on Economies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the midst of intense strife in the Middle East, a new trend is
taking shape to encourage economic development in a region that is
crucial to the world in many ways.</LD>
<LD>   As tanks and suicide bombers raise the death toll, leading
industrialists in Israel and Jordan say a "Marshall Plan" of economic
development is the only real solution to the region's troubles.</LD>
<LD>   The original post-World War II Marshall Plan revived Europe's
economies by shipping them food, fuel and technical assistance for
industry. As used by business people in the Middle East today, the
words "Marshall Plan" are shorthand for trade agreements with
developed markets in the United States, Europe and Asia; investment
in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure; and
stepped-up education for the region's young people.</LD>
<TE>   Peace would be essential to start such development. But as in
Europe half a century ago, business people are confident such
assistance could have a dramatic economic effect and help secure
long-term peace in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I just spent eight days in Washington, and at Harvard Business
School and in New York, talking about a Marshall Plan and getting
support," says Stef Wertheimer, an Israeli entrepreneur who has built
industrial parks and companies in Israel for more than half a
century. Now he is branching out to Turkey and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman, also speaks of the related
issues of economy and peace. "A Marshall Plan could do far more than
military efforts to bring stability and better prospects to this
region," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Salah has built factories in an industrial zone in Irbid, Jordan.
Factories in the zone supply underwear to Victoria's Secret and Ralph
Lauren and electronic parts to Motorola Inc. under a free-trade
agreement with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Salah and Wertheimer are not dreamers but number-crunching
businessmen who understand that a major cause of trouble in the
Middle East is the lack of development that leaves most countries
with high unemployment and widespread poverty. Economic output of
most of the region's countries amounts to less than $2,000 per person
per year, a sum one-tenth the size of Israel's economy and
one-twentieth that of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   To many that will seem a paradox. The Middle East, after all, is
known for oil riches. Yet most of its countries are poor and
undereducated. Israel's economy has no oil but has brainpower and
industry; its gross domestic product per capita is more than double
that of oil-rich Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   For decades such disparity didn't seem to matter to the developed
countries of Europe, Asia and North America. As long as the Middle
East kept pumping oil, was the attitude, its poverty and instability
were not causes for concern.</TE>
<TE>   But since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, attention is being paid.
With 8% of the world's population, the Middle East produces only 2%
of the world's economic output and is the point of origin of 60% of
the world's terrorist organizations, according to a report by the
Milken Institute, a Santa Monica-based research organization that
works to promote development in the region. (That economic comparison
is made all the more dramatic by the fact that the Milken researchers
include Central Asia and North Africa in statistics on the Middle
East.)That's why the need for economic development is a background
issue in Vice President Dick Cheney's current 12-day trip through the
region and an issue for the summit of Middle East countries to be
held in Beirut this month.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is backing a peace plan, proposed by Saudi
Arabia's crown prince, that calls for a separate Palestinian state
and normalized relations between the Arab states and Israel.
Investment is poised to flow into the region if peace can be achieved
along such lines, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the strife of the last year has reduced Israel's
economic output by 5%, or</TE>
<TE>   $5 billion, and increased its unemployment, venture capital still
is coming to Israel's high-tech companies, says Rami Kalish, managing
director of Pitango Venture Capital in Herzliya, the high-tech suburb
of Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   But a peaceful environment would mean better business. "A few
years ago, when things were a lot better [in relations with the
Palestinians and Arab nations] we had plans to do more business with
neighbors," Kalish says, referring to Egypt, Jordan and the West Bank
and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The region's need is for jobs and training, says Wertheimer, who
has built a global machine-tool company and four industrial parks in
Israel that also serve as centers of training for Israeli and
Palestinian workers.</TE>
<TE>   Wertheimer, who fled Nazi Germany as a boy, has pursued a vision
of Israel doing business with its neighbors. He was building an
industrial park in Gaza two years ago when violence erupted and the
project was stopped. He has just completed an industrial park in
Turkey and hopes to build facilities in Jordan, a country notable in
the Middle East for its relatively high education levels.</TE>
<TE>   "We in Israel--like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon--do not have oil
but we have industry and can prosper through trade," Wertheimer says.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, in fact, is eager to play a part in regional trade. It is
setting up duty-free zones on the Mediterranean, including the Aegean
Free Zone Development and Operating Co., a complex of factories and
shipping facilities in Izmir--the ancient trading city of Smyrna--on
Turkey's western coast.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also is eager for development. Salah's Century Investment
Co., which has attracted manufacturing to Jordan through joint
ventures with companies in Hong Kong, Britain and the United States,
wants to expand facilities in Irbid, in northern Jordan, possibly
raising capital by listing his company on U.S. stock markets.</TE>
<TE>   If there were more stability in the area, a road from Irbid
through Israel to the port of Haifa on the Mediterranean could be
built, allowing for greatly expanded Jordanian trade with Europe and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Jordan is a good place to do business; American companies can
feel welcome there," says Joseph Jacobs, founder and chairman of
Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., which helped build a
potash production plant at the Jordanian port of Aqaba in the 1970s.
Jordan has since doubled the plant's output and its exports of
potash, a key fertilizer ingredient.</TE>
<TE>   Yet like every other country in the region, Jordan's economy has
suffered from war and violence. It has been hurt by the collapse of
Iraq's economy since the Persian Gulf War a decade ago. It remains
dependent on Iraq for energy and for export sales. The
Israeli-Palestinian strife, with blockades on the West Bank, has cut
export opportunities for Jordan's industries.</TE>
<TE>   Every economy in the region--except Israel--suffers from an
abundance of underemployed young people who are frustrated by their
lack of opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing changes in the Middle East, the frustrations of its
rapidly growing populations will always present a threat of further
violence and hatred of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But with development, those same young people could become the
builders of thriving, diverse economies and successful societies.</TE>
<TE>   Major sources of foreign investment--multinational companies,
banks and international pension funds--are eager to back projects in
the region if peace can be brought about, U.S. investment managers
say.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the world's largest banks have commitments from the
oil-rich states of the Middle East to invest in development in the
region. For those states, threatened by continued instability, such
investment would be a form of self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   The original Marshall Plan helped Europe in one of the darkest
hours of its history. The need is at least as great for a similar
plan to do likewise for the Middle East today.</TE>

<LD>James Flanigan's analysis of Merck &amp; Co's profit outlook failed to
consider the opposite side of the research/patent protection/profit
equation, i.e., the cost of prescription medicine and the search for
cures for those who need them ["Drug Firms Trying to Ease Doubts of
Investors," March 10].</LD>
<LD>   Merck Chairman Gilmartin is disappointed because 2002 profit will
be flat, about the same as 2001, $7billion, and that patent
protection of an average of 12 years is not enough. I suggest that
patent protection is too long, because it stifles research from going
beyond the guaranteed cash flow.</LD>
<LD>   An example of this occurred recently when the FDA approved a
multiple sclerosis drug used in 110 countries but forbidden from sale
in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Biogen Inc. has had protection under the Orphan Drug Act since FDA
approval was granted in 1996. None of the current MS drugs provide a
cure and they are effective in less than 50% of the patients, but we
had Biogen resisting the medication's approval in the U.S. because
its profit would be lower.</TE>
<TE>   Biogen has not released any information on its success in going
beyond their protected drug toward a cure since 1996, and their
product costs patients $900 per month.</TE>
<TE>   I am pleased to read of the size of Merck's R&amp;D budget, and that
they are pushing into the field of brain and nervous system
disorders. Assuming for argument that they develop a breakthrough,
will they bring a cure to market or something short with 12 years of
patent protection?</TE>

<HD>Life Settlements Not Same as Viaticals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a licensed life settlement company, we applaud and fully support
recent efforts to inform California consumers about companies that
attempt to defraud consumers through the investment in certain life
insurance transactions known as viatical settlements ["Lawmakers
Probe Viatical Fraud," Feb. 27].</LD>
<LD>   However, there is an important distinction to be made between life
settlement companies that purchase senior citizens' unwanted or
unneeded life insurance policies with institutional funds, and the
sale of interests in viatical settlements to individual investors.</LD>
<LD>   The sale of unsecured interests to individual investors nationwide
has left many credulous individuals holding hundreds of millions of
dollars in policy investments that are far from predictable. These
investments have proved to be extremely risky and may violate state
securities laws.</LD>
<TE>   The viatical industry began as a way for terminally ill patients
who owned life insurance policies and had a life expectancy of two
years or less to sell those policies and receive money to pay medical
bills from investors who purchase a share in their death benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, a similar vehicle, known as a life settlement, can
provide senior citizens with an option of selling their no longer
wanted or needed life insurance policies and to receive money to meet
their changing needs.</TE>
<TE>   Life settlements are purchased by licensed life settlement
companies with financing provided by world-recognized banks and
insurance companies, all subject to appropriate regulatory oversight.
We commend all efforts to help consumers and their advisors to
understand this legitimate and sophisticated financial planning tool.</TE>

<HD>Repeat After Me: Consulting a Tax Pro Can Save Time and
Money</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My wife and I live on Social Security, my pension and our
individual retirement accounts. Last year we took $10,000 out of one
of our IRAs and gave it to our son and daughter-in-law to help with
the down payment on their house. We filed a gift tax form and made
estimated tax payments using a form the IRS sent us.</LD>
<LD>   Now we're doing our taxes and it turns out that $10,000 gift put
us in a higher tax bracket, which means we'll pay a bundle. But I
recently read in your column that each person can give up to $11,000
a year to anyone without paying gift taxes. So I'm wondering: Was our
gift taxable after all?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Here's another case in which a consultation with a tax pro
could have saved time, money and hassle.</LD>
<TE>   You shouldn't have filed a gift tax form when you gave your son
the money. You were allowed to give him that much without gift tax
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   You probably owe income taxes on the withdrawal, though, because
it came from an IRA.</TE>
<TE>   Although earnings in an IRA are tax-deferred, you generally must
pay income tax on money that comes out (unless the money comes from a
Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals).</TE>
<TE>   People are allowed to take $10,000 out of their IRAs to purchase
their first home or to help a parent or child buy a first home. They
still must pay income taxes on the money, but they avoid the 10%
penalty for early withdrawal that might otherwise apply.</TE>
<TE>   You can try to fix this yourself, but it's probably best to take
your paperwork to a tax professional and have him or her sort this
out for you. The pro will make sure you get credit for the estimated
taxes you paid and help you fix the gift tax return you filed in
error.</TE>
<TE>   Tax law can be confusing, which is why many people find it helpful
to get a tax professional's advice now and then. Anyone who's tapping
a retirement fund, or who's planning to make a large gift, would
benefit from first running the plan past a certified public
accountant or enrolled agent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can't Avoid Taxes by Giving Away Money</TE>
<TE>   Q: After reading your advice about gifts and taxes, I started to
wonder whether I could make disbursements from a trust fund and give
the money to other people without having to pay taxes on the money.
What I am not sure of is whether the $11,000 amount is the total I'm
allowed to disburse without gift taxes or whether that is the total
that the receivers will not have to pay tax on.</TE>
<TE>   A: Neither, and nice try, but any money you take out of your trust
fund probably would incur income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Like the previous reader, you're stumbling over the differences
between the gift tax system and the income tax system. They're quite
different, but people get tangled up about them all the time. Some
people even think they can deduct money they give to an individual,
such as a family member, a friend or the panhandler they pass on the
way to work each day. (In fact, only gifts to qualified charities
qualify for the charitable donation deduction, and then only if you
itemize your deductions on your tax return.)</TE>
<TE>   To repeat: You can't avoid income taxes that are otherwise due by
giving the money to individuals. Chances are, though, that there
won't be any gift tax consequences to your generosity, unless you
give more than $11,000 to any one person each year or give a total of
more than $1 million during your lifetime. And gifts are tax-free to
the people who get them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Determining Insurance Needs Is the Best Policy</TE>
<TE>   Q: My wife and I have had whole life policies for about 12 years.
I could purchase larger amounts of term life insurance for both of us
with larger death benefits and still have money to invest. Should I
cancel my whole life and buy term? Or should I keep the whole life
policy? I'm 40, my wife is 36, and we have two children younger than
8.</TE>
<TE>   A: You're coming at the question backward. First you need to
determine how much insurance you need. Then you can make some
decisions about which type of insurance you should own.</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of rules of thumb about how much insurance people
should have, but most of these rules aren't very useful. You'll hear,
for example, that people need life insurance equal to five to eight
times their income. That would result in too much insurance for
single people, who often don't need life insurance, and perhaps too
little for many people with big families, big debts or disabled
children.</TE>
<TE>   You're better off spending a little time with the "insurance need"
worksheet at www.latimes.com/money. You'll also find a primer there
on the different kinds of insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Whole life policies, such as the ones you own, tend to be much
more expensive than term life insurance. But whole life policies can
offer lifetime coverage and an investment component that term life
does not.</TE>
<TE>   The most important thing is to buy enough insurance to protect
your family.</TE>
<TE>   If you can't do that with a whole life policy because you can't
afford the premiums, then get term insurance.</TE>

<HD>Allocating Assets Gets Tougher for Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Basic asset allocation rules recommend that investors keep their
portfolios balanced among stocks, bonds and money-market accounts.
The idea is that one of those three will always be working for you.</LD>
<LD>   But there are times when none of those three major asset groups
has much, if any, appeal. This may be one of those times.</LD>
<LD>   "I see a paucity of value in financial assets," said Steven
Galbraith, investment strategist at brokerage Morgan Stanley in New
York. That makes it tough for him, because he's charged with telling
Morgan clients how best to allocate their money.</LD>
<TE>   Investors' concerns about the performance potential of stocks,
bonds and cash may be leading them to look for other places to put
money to work. The housing market seems to be one beneficiary; more
consumers also may be more inclined to spend money than invest it.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what investors face when they consider the near-term merits
of each of the three major asset options:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonds: Let's start here because this has been the best-performing
of the three asset classes for the last two years. That has been
true, at least, of the highest-quality bonds, such as Treasury
issues, bonds of major companies and most municipal issues.</TE>
<TE>   High-quality bonds performed very well in 2000 and 2001 because
the economy was deteriorating. Worried investors wanted a safe haven,
so they rushed into Treasury securities. What's more, as the economy
weakened, longer-term interest rates began to decline in mid-2000,
about six months before the Federal Reserve began to cut short-term
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Falling market interest rates meant that older, higher-yielding
bonds automatically rose in value. The result: Investors enjoyed a
"total" return (interest earned plus capital appreciation) of 10.4%
on the average government-bond mutual fund in 2000 and 6.7% in 2001,
according to fund-tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But it looks like bonds' time in the sun has expired. As economic
data in recent weeks have pointed to a surprisingly robust rebound in
business activity, many investors have been dumping bonds, betting
that interest rates are headed higher. The selling itself has driven
market yields higher, in turn eroding the value of outstanding bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for other
long-term interest rates, rose to a nine-month high of 5.41% on
Thursday, before retreating a bit to end Friday at 5.33%. That's
still up from 5.05% at year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in bond mutual funds enjoyed a good run in January and
February, when interest rates still were pulling back. But bond fund
total returns have eroded badly in recent weeks. The biggest of all
bond funds, the Pimco Total Return fund, now sports a year-to-date
total return of 0.5%. Its return had been 2.4% as of Feb. 22, so the
give-back has been substantial.</TE>
<TE>   When Fed policymakers meet Tuesday, they aren't expected to raise
their key short-term interest rate, now at 1.75%. But the central
bank is expected to nod to the economic rebound by shifting its
"bias" on rates to neutral. That would be the first step toward
raising short-term rates.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market always anticipates the Fed--hence the whiplash in
long-term yields in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, there is plenty of disagreement among
professional investors about the strength of the economic recovery,
how much (and when) the Fed might tighten credit, and whether bond
investors are overreacting so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, history shows that a strong economy usually isn't a
friend to the bond market. So the investment outlook for high-quality
bonds, for the time being, isn't encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Money-market accounts, or "cash": Investors who have been parking
their dollars in money-market mutual funds, bank CDs and other
short-term accounts for the last year have endured the lowest returns
in 40 years, as the Fed has held down rates to minimize the
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Fed may be on the verge of raising rates, however,
cash accounts aren't likely to provide dramatically better returns
any time soon. For one thing, the Fed doesn't want to risk raising
rates so quickly that it stifles the recovery, most analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Economists at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. told clients Friday that the
Fed's first rate increase probably won't occur until
summer--assuming, they said, that the U.S. unemployment rate rises in
spring after sliding the last two months. "Politically, the Fed
probably won't tighten [credit] while the unemployment rate is
rising," they said.</TE>
<TE>   Shorter-term market yields could perk up even before the Fed
officially changes its benchmark rate. Indeed, six-month Treasury
bill yields already have risen from a low of about 1.6% in January to
2.07% as of Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't filtering through to money-market mutual funds yet:
The average annualized seven-day yield on taxable money funds fell
last week to a new record low of 1.35%, according to fund tracker
Imoneynet.com.</TE>
<TE>   Most banks, meanwhile, continue to keep a tight lid on CD yields.
Nationwide, the average 1-year CD yields 2.21% now, up slightly from
2.13% two weeks ago, according to Imoneynet.com.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Cash accounts pay lousy yields, and they aren't
heading back up to significant levels soon. After taxes and after
even minimal inflation, real returns on money funds are negative.</TE>
<TE>   The only good thing one can say for cash accounts is that they
continue to offer relative safety compared with bonds and stocks.
Whatever you put into a cash account you're virtually guaranteed to
get back, not counting inflation's effect.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stocks: After a rough start this year Wall Street is back in the
black, as measured by key indexes.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is up 1.6% in price year
to date. The average New York Stock Exchange stock is up 2.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq market, loaded with technology issues, hasn't yet
climbed out of its bear-market hole: The Nasdaq composite index is
off 4.2% for the year, though it has rallied from its February lows.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the equity market seems to be responding positively to
the idea that the economy is recovering, which should (eventually)
translate into higher corporate earnings. But the almost universal
lament of market strategists and money managers is that most stocks
aren't cheap relative to the earnings outlook. That leaves
professional stock pickers worried about the market's ability to hold
on to, and add to, its recent gains.</TE>
<TE>   Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., sums up the view of
many pros: "The best time to buy stocks is in the middle of a
recession," he notes. That was last fall. Now, "The market is in the
riskier phase of the bull market. Valuations are lofty" given the
rebound in share prices since September while earnings remain
depressed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' apprehension has made for a volatile market, where
bouts of heavy profit-taking can quickly follow sharp price gains. "I
see investors being much more disciplined sellers now," said Morgan
Stanley's Galbraith.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the ongoing weakness in technology, biotechnology and
telecom is weighing on many mutual funds that had picked up shares in
those sectors last fall. That helps explain why the average domestic
stock fund's gain so far this year is a mere 0.4%, according to
Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy is in fact on the mend, the stock market ought to
have a far better chance of producing good returns this year than the
bond market or cash, many pros agree. But many also agree that this
could be a classic stock-picker's market--meaning that those who pick
well can win big, and those who pick poorly can lose big. In other
words, there's substantial risk out there.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, for investors truly focused on the long-term, none of
these near-term concerns may affect their asset-allocation decisions.
But if your sense has been that this is a particularly frustrating
period to be making money choices, there may be at least some comfort
in knowing that that view is widely shared.</TE>

<LD>U.S. Indicts Andersen Over Shredding</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors hit accounting firm Andersen with a criminal
indictment for allegedly orchestrating the "wholesale destruction" of
tons of Enron Corp. documents, raising new doubts about the company's
survival.</LD>
<LD>   The one-count indictment is the first of what Justice Department
officials hinted could be a string of criminal charges arising from
the collapse f energy giant Enron, which filed for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2 amid an accounting scandal.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment did not name any individuals, but it caused fear
among Andersen's work force. Many employees are worried that the
charge could mean the demise of the 88-year-old firm.</TE>
<TE>   Others fear that the death of the fourth-largest accounting firm
also could reduce pressure for reforms and leave the industry even
more rife with conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Telecom Firms Come Under Scrutiny</TE>
<TE>   Probes of the telecommunications industry widen, as the Securities
and Exchange Commission demanded internal accounting documents from
WorldCom Inc. and Qwest Communications International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a congressional panel has asked telecommunications
carrier Global Crossing Ltd. to turn over information concerning its
accounting practices and executive compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The letter from leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
made 22 specific requests, including seeking the names of outside
accountants who worked for Global Crossing, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is reviewing certain Global Crossing accounting
issues.</TE>

<TE>   SEC Seeks to Take Exec's Stock Options</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued a New Jersey
businessman, seeking to strip him of bonuses and stock options that
the agency alleges were granted as the result of fraudulently
inflated financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   It is the first time in a securities fraud case that the SEC has
tried to take away an executive's stock options, although the agency
previously has gone after executive bonuses and profits from stock
sales.</TE>
<TE>   The move came only days after President Bush demanded more
accountability of corporate executives in a speech that outlined a
10-point plan to deal with executives who mislead investors.</TE>

<TE>   Delta Drops Travel Agent Commissions</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines has stopped paying commissions to travel agents
booking its domestic flights, and other airlines are expected to
follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Delta, citing its $1-billion loss last year and the growth of
Internet ticketing sites, said it would keep paying commissions on
tickets bought overseas and as incentive bonuses to select agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A travel agents trade group blasted Delta's move, and said it
would force travelers to pay agents higher fees for bookings. At the
same time, the end of commissions could put smaller agencies out of
business.</TE>

<TE>   Disneyland Paris Adds Studios Theme Park</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., which transformed the near-bankrupt Disneyland
Paris into Europe's most visited tourist attraction, added some
Hollywood glitz to its French resort with the opening Saturday of a
theme park modeled on its studio tour in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-acre park, called Walt Disney Studios, is billed as a
tribute to American and European cinema and is next to Disneyland
Paris.</TE>

<TE>   TRW to Fight Northrop Bid by Divesting</TE>
<TE>   TRW Inc. launched a counterattack to a hostile takeover bid by
rival Northrop Grumman Corp. as it announced plans to break up the
company by spinning off or selling both its automotive and aircraft
parts businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Escalating the fight for the defense industry's biggest remaining
prize, TRW officials said its board unanimously agreed to accelerate
long-held strategic plans to divest itself of nondefense-related
businesses while urging shareholders to reject Northrop's proposal to
acquire the company for $47 a share, or $5.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's move, which was expected because it had rejected the same
offer the previous week, fueled speculation among investors that
Northrop would increase its bid or withdraw the offer. By week's end,
TRW stock had risen 1.1%, closing Friday at $50.84.</TE>

<TE>   Survey: 'Living Wage' Laws Reduce Poverty</TE>
<TE>   "Living wage" laws, adopted by dozens of cities and counties in
recent years, reduce overall poverty levels despite causing some job
loss, according to a cautiously worded study from a conservative
economist.</TE>
<TE>   David Neumark, a Michigan State University economist, is known for
his opposition to minimum-wage hikes. His findings were released
through the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   Neumark still is no fan of an increase in the minimum wage, which
he maintains won't reduce poverty and could even exacerbate it.
Living wage laws have the opposite effect, he said, because they are
more targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Beneficiaries are more likely to be adults heading poor households
instead of those in middle-class homes.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. to Pursue Curbs on Tobacco Marketing</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is demanding sweeping changes in tobacco
marketing and manufacturing practices as part of a federal lawsuit
that many observers had expected to be dumped by the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   In documents given to industry attorneys, the Justice Department
said it would seek a court order forcing tobacco companies to reduce
levels of nicotine, the habit-forming substance in their cigarette
brands, "to the greatest extent possible."</TE>
<TE>   They called for other anti-smoking measures, including elimination
of cigarette ads in stores, use of graphic warning labels filling at
least 50% of the space on cigarette packs and print ads, and a ban on
lobbying against ordinances directed at secondhand smoke.</TE>

<TE>   Movie Theater Firm Plans to Go Public</TE>
<TE>   Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz has filed for a $345-million
initial public stock offering by his Regal Entertainment Group.</TE>
<TE>   The widely anticipated move is another step in consolidating his
position as the nation's No. 1 movie theater owner.</TE>
<TE>   It also signals a possible turnaround in the financially troubled
film exhibition business, which has seen eight major chains file for
bankruptcy protection during recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, total box-office revenue increased for the 10th
consecutive year, rising 10% to $8.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance grew roughly 5% to 1.5billion moviegoers.</TE>

<TE>   Letterman Spurns ABC Offer, Stays With CBS</TE>
<TE>   David Letterman agreed to a new contract with his current network,
leaving jilted suitor ABC measuring the damage its bid might have
done to ABC News and "Nightline," the venerable program Letterman
would have displaced.</TE>
<TE>   After weighing the two offers, the 54-year-old late-night host
signed a three-year agreement with CBS, with an option for two
additional years.</TE>
<TE>   ABC quickly announced in the wake of Letterman's decision that
"Nightline" will remain in its current time slot opposite Letterman's
program and "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" on NBC.</TE>

<TE>   Regional Recovery Plan Boosts Tourism</TE>
<TE>   A regional recovery plan crafted to keep the Los Angeles-area
economy on track appears to be working, especially in attracting more
tourists than anticipated in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau said industry
analysts expected international visitors to Los Angeles would drop in
2001 by 800,000, but the actual number was closer to 650,000.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic tourism was forecast to decline 5%, but rose by 1.2%.</TE>

<HD>Legal Heavyweights Add Punch to the Microsoft Case</HD>
<DH>In the states' corner is Brendan Sullivan, a Beltway
litigator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When the Microsoft antitrust trial began nearly four years ago, the
coalition of state attorneys general that joined the Department of
Justice was largely consigned to cheering from the sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   But after the Justice Department settled its dispute with the
software giant late last year, nine dissenting states decided to take
control--and one of their first acts of independence was hiring
lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan, 60, has little antitrust experience, but he is one of
Washington's best-known litigators. Some of his peers have described
him as an "absolute nightmare," the courthouse equivalent of a
nuclear war.</LD>
<TE>   "If anyone can take on Microsoft, it's Brendan," Iowa Atty. Gen.
Tom Miller said. "He's certainly handled these high-pressure cases
before."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's entry in the Microsoft antitrust case is the states'
not-so-subtle way of saying, in the words of Tom Greene, senior
assistant attorney general for California: "Now it's our turn."</TE>
<TE>   Over the span of his 35-year career, Sullivan has shown a taste
for the controversial. He successfully defended former Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros against federal
conspiracy charges and kept Lt. Col. Oliver L. North out of prison
during the Iran-Contra scandal.</TE>
<TE>   When one of North's interrogators griped about Sullivan's frequent
objections, the attorney snapped: "Sir, I'm not a potted plant. I'm
here as the lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   "Most of his opponents think he's a junkyard dog," said North, who
now works as a conservative radio commentator.</TE>
<TE>   The Microsoft trial will test Sullivan's skills. Many people
already consider the case largely over because a settlement was
announced, and Sullivan will face a Microsoft litigation team well
versed in the subtleties of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Overcoming such hurdles is a Sullivan trademark.</TE>
<TE>   He is known for controlling the pace and tone of a case. During
the 1987 congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra affair,
Sullivan launched a series of objections as legislators grilled
North. The tactic worked, stalling the rapid-fire questioning and
giving North time to focus and explain his conduct. The normally
loquacious North would remain silent until Sullivan nodded in
approval.</TE>
<TE>   "My son wanted to become a lawyer because of Brendan," North said.
"He inspires complete confidence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He Tells Clients to Speak Only in Courtroom</TE>
<TE>   For all his courtroom bluster, Sullivan is tight-lipped in public.
He typically refuses to be interviewed about his career, his life or
his clients. He declined to comment for this report.</TE>
<TE>   "His philosophy is that we should speak as little as possible, and
only then in a courtroom," said Connecticut Atty. Gen. Richard
Blumenthal. "If he could force us--elected officials--not to talk to
the public or press, he would. He just shakes his head over the fact
that we do."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan is known as a canny strategist. On the second day of
North's testimony, he and his wife, Betsy North, arrived at Congress
to appear before the House and Senate select committees after only a
few hours of sleep. The previous night had been filled by strategy
meetings with Sullivan, calls of encouragement from loved ones and
outright worry, North said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were both exhausted," North recalled. "She was sitting right
behind me [in the hearings] and she dozed right off."</TE>
<TE>   Television crews began running close-ups of the sleeping woman. At
a break in the hearings, Betsy North became hysterical and offered to
leave, North said.</TE>
<TE>   "Brendan walks up to her and says, 'Promise me you'll go back out
there and go to sleep again. It shows you have absolute confidence in
what your husband is saying,'" North said.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan grew up in a small town near Providence, R.I., the son of
a chemical company executive who also served as a local police
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan attended Georgetown University and Georgetown University
Law Center, where he gave a hint of his future as a litigator--he
headed an effort to change the school's regulations forbidding
consumption of beer on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't drink in those days, so it's not that he had an
interest in demon rum," said longtime friend and former restaurateur
Richard McCooey. "He liked the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan has been involved with controversial cases since the
early days of his career. In 1969, a 19-year-old Army private was
shot to death running away from a work detail in San Francisco. Three
days later, 24 soldiers staged a sit-down strike and later were
arrested and charged with mutiny. Sullivan, then an Army captain,
volunteered to defend them.</TE>
<TE>   As the case rolled out, Sullivan's military foes charged that he
was trying to turn the trials into "some sort of antiwar circus."
During the proceedings, nearly six months before the end of
Sullivan's Army service, he was transferred to Vietnam. The orders
sparked a public outrage, Congress threatened to investigate the
matter and the secretary of the Army rescinded the order.</TE>
<TE>   The case attracted the attention of the late Edward Bennett
Williams, a well-known criminal defense lawyer in Washington.
Williams hired Sullivan when the firm had a staff of 18. Over the
years, Williams &amp; Connolly grew to a 200-lawyer firm known for a
savvy courtroom presence and for taking on difficult cases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   States Impressed by His Aggressive Trial Skills</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Sullivan defended Catholic priest Guido John Carcich, who
was accused of embezzling more than $16 million from church
fund-raisers. Sullivan cut a deal with Maryland Atty. Gen. Francis
Burch that allowed Carcich to serve only one year of house arrest.
The settlement, hugely unpopular with the public, ultimately forced
Burch to drop his campaign for governor.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, HUD Secretary Cisneros was accused of lying,
obstruction of justice and conspiracy for misleading FBI agents
investigating how much he had paid a former mistress. If convicted,
he could have been sentenced to as much as five years in prison on
each of the 18 counts.</TE>
<TE>   But after four years and $10 million spent investigating Cisneros,
independent counsel David M. Barrett acknowledged the weakness of the
prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan negotiated a deal for Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to a
single misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI, served no jail time and
paid a $10,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   The states are hoping Sullivan's aggressive trial skills are
enough to bring about success against Microsoft, a company that is
among the most intimidating industrial behemoths of the modern era.</TE>
<TE>   "Brendan's definitely a fighter," said California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer. "That's exactly what we need."</TE>

<HD>Legal Heavyweights Add Punch to the Microsoft Case</HD>
<DH>In software giant's corner, a high-stakes trial attorney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Through the long years of Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust case, the
software behemoth has made a point of hiring some of the nation's
most combative, hard-nosed attorneys to do battle with the Justice
Department. That strategy has produced angry judges, frequent rebukes
and a guilty verdict in the biggest antitrust trial in a century.</LD>
<LD>   But as the crucial penalty phase of the trial begins Monday, a new
face will be among the company's formidable legal ranks: former Iran-
Contra prosecutor Dan K. Webb, a Chicago trial lawyer best known for
his unflappable demeanor.</LD>
<LD>   Some experts and observers of the Microsoft case say the arrival
of Webb is a sign that the Redmond, Wash.,-based company wants to
project a kindler, gentler image while bringing quick closure to the
case.</LD>
<TE>   For the 56-year-old Webb, the payoff is the challenge of handling
the biggest antitrust case since the breakup of Standard Oil Co. a
century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, who has been involved in such high-profile cases as
Iran-Contra, the Tylenol poisonings and Big Tobacco, declined to be
interviewed. A Microsoft official would not elaborate on why the
company hired him.</TE>
<TE>   Experts note that Microsoft recently agreed to modify its
controversial settlement with the Justice Department and nine states
in an attempt to appease the District of Columbia and nine other
state holdouts. Webb's involvement in the case may have helped
mollify Microsoft's famously combative top executives on the witness
stand.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer--who once had
doctors repair his vocal chords after he damaged them by yelling at a
Microsoft pep rally--was soft-spoken and chuckled frequently during a
videotaped deposition he gave last month at which Webb was present.</TE>
<TE>   Ballmer's performance stood in contrast to that of Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates. Four years ago, the brilliant software mogul was
smug, uncharacteristically forgetful and acted detached in a
videotaped deposition played during the antitrust trial.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officials say Webb's appointment does not signal a
change in the company's legal strategy. Webb, who has handled more
than 100 jury trials since 1973, will provide additional expertise
alongside co-counsel John Warden, a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has brought in other lawyers throughout the long-running
case, including appellate expert Carter Philips to help with
antitrust appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski
(D-Ill.), who's now a Chicago-area political and business consultant,
said it isn't coincidental that Microsoft may be taking a different
approach.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bill Gates is stubborn--and there is every reason to believe
that he is--Webb's the guy you want to have to get him to see the
other side," said Rostenkowski, whom Webb defended after the
congressman was indicted on federal corruption charges in 1994. "He's
a hands-on defender and a good listener....My biggest mistake was to
[initially] hire a Washington insider instead of hiring Dan to defend
me."</TE>
<TE>   Rostenkowski, who pleaded guilty to two charges of mail fraud in
1995 and served a 17-month prison sentence, said he doesn't know
whether another lawyer would have spared him punishment. But he said
he always "felt comfortable" with Webb and has no regrets hiring him.</TE>
<TE>   Webb honed his career as a U.S. attorney in the early 1980s and
later as a veteran trial lawyer with Chicago law firm Winston &amp;
Strawn.</TE>
<TE>   As a U.S. attorney, he cracked down on corruption in the judicial
system of Cook County, Ill., convicting more than 60 lawyers and
police officers on extortion, bribery and other charges. He also won
convictions in the 1983 Tylenol extortion case.</TE>
<TE>   Webb's stature as one of the nation's leading trial attorneys was
perhaps cemented when he was selected in 1990 as chief prosecutor in
the trial of former White House National Security Advisor John M.
Poindexter.</TE>
<TE>   The rear admiral was convicted on all five criminal charges of
deceiving and lying to Congress as part of an effort to conceal the
Reagan administration's actions in the Iran-Contra scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In private practice in recent years, Webb has supplemented his
white-collar criminal work with commercial litigation on behalf of
Fortune 500 companies.</TE>
<TE>   He defended the tobacco industry against lawsuits brought by the
states in a federal court in Texas in 1998. Webb's clients paid $15.3
billion to the settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, he engineered a surprise victory for General Electric Co.
by persuading a federal judge to dismiss criminal charges that the
company was conspiring with South African trading company DeBeers to
fix the world price of industrial diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan has a clearheaded and credible way of explaining things and
mounting the most effective defense possible," said William J. Baer,
a former top lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission who worked with
Webb on the GE case.</TE>
<TE>   Baer said Webb's strength is being better prepared that his
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The GE case may represent the paradigm for how Webb might approach
the Microsoft case.</TE>
<TE>   Like Microsoft, GE had a strong-willed chairman, Jack Welch, who
vowed never to plead guilty or pay a huge fine to settle Justice
Department price-fixing charges. GE also had a huge stable of lawyers
when it hired Webb to coordinate its defense.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, who once told the Chicago Tribune that he works such long
hours that "I almost never have lunch," worked on the case nearly
around the clock with two dozen other lawyers in a small suite of
offices near the court in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He said he won the complex case by narrowing it to a few key
points. "You have to key your brief into what a particular judge is
thinking or ruling," he told The American Lawyer in a 1995 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Webb's first appearance in the Microsoft case came in October
during a scheduling conference before U.S. District Court Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who is presiding over the penalty phase of
the antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   Webb recently has taken on more prominent roles--helping to
prepare potential witnesses in the case, such as Ballmer, and
fine-tuning Microsoft's settlement with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts wonder whether Webb can quickly master the
intricacies of the antitrust dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The case is entering its closing phase this week after a
three-year trial and a sweeping federal appeals court ruling last
summer that threw out a lower court breakup of Microsoft, but ordered
new proceedings to determine how Microsoft should be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to bring in somebody cold and introduce them to
all the antitrust concepts we work with today," said Andrew Gavil, a
professor of law at Howard University. "That's not to say that Dan
Webb is not up to the task. But the Microsoft case is very complex,
and the evidentiary record is extensive."</TE>

<HD>Fed Rate Hike Not Likely Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless Federal Reserve policymakers intend to shock financial
markets, they won't be raising the central bank's benchmark
short-term interest rate at Tuesday's meeting--despite overwhelming
evidence that the economy is recovering.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and cohorts are expected to
keep the "federal funds" rate, the Fed's target rate for overnight
loans among banks, at 1.75%, a 40-year low. But they also are
expected to change their official "bias" on interest rates to
neutral, from what has been a position that emphasized the risks of
further economic decline.</LD>
<LD>   A neutral stance would mean the Fed believes the risks to the
economy are balanced--meaning that business activity could slump
again, or could expand fast enough to threaten higher inflation.</LD>
<TE>   A neutral stance would be the central bank's initial step toward
tightening credit, assuming the economy continues to revive.</TE>
<TE>   A poll of major Treasury bond dealers Friday by Reuters news
service showed that 19 of 24 dealers expect the Fed to shift to a
neutral stance. As for when the Fed might order its first rate
increase, bond dealers and economists are sharply divided. Just eight
of the 24 bond dealers expect the first rate hike to come at or
before the Fed's June 26 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, Laurence Meyer, a Fed governor from 1996 until last
month, riled the bond market when he forecast that the central bank
would order its first rate increase by midyear, and that the federal
funds rate would be at 3% by year's end and 4.75% by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasting Fed moves is a dicey business. Few analysts expected
the dramatic cuts the Fed made in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists believe the Fed would prefer to go slow in raising
rates from current generational lows. But its hand could be forced by
a significant rise in inflation or by a plunge in the dollar's value.</TE>
<TE>   So far, inflation has continued to be relatively tame, and the
dollar has weakened only modestly against the yen this year, while
gaining value against the euro.</TE>

<HD>Tax Laws Offer Extra Credit for Teachers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a little extra credit for teachers in the economic stimulus
bill that President Bush signed a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   The new law, which primarily affects businesses and unemployment
benefits, allows teachers who buy books and supplies for their
classrooms to deduct as much as $250 a year for these expenses, even
if they don't usually itemize deductions.</LD>
<LD>   The modest break advances a growing trend of providing tax relief
for the nation's teachers--often as a way to lure people into the
field.</LD>
<TE>   Several states--most notably California--also have special tax
rules for teachers, some of which can save a bundle for those who
teach in grammar and secondary schools.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world, we would be paying our teachers a fair wage
so we wouldn't have to monkey with the tax system to give them this
little bite," said Jim Southward, an enrolled agent in San Carlos,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   In the real world, teachers need to know about taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the rundown:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Federal Deduction</TE>
<TE>   Under the economic stimulus act, qualified educators can deduct as
much as $250 a year in expenses for books, supplies, computer
equipment, services and supplementary materials used in the
classroom, beginning with the 2002 tax year.</TE>
<TE>   Qualified educators are defined as anyone working 900 or more
hours a year as a kindergarten through 12th-grade teacher,
instructor, counselor or principal in a public, private or parochial
school providing elementary or secondary education as determined by
state law.</TE>
<TE>   This federal deduction will be a "before-the-line" item, which
means that even teachers who do not itemize deductions will be able
to claim it, said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst with CCH Inc.,
a Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of tax information.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that this deduction lasts just two years. It won't
cover expenses incurred after Dec. 31, 2003, and it doesn't come
close to what teachers actually spend on school supplies, educators
contend.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some studies that have shown that the average
elementary school teacher spends $2,000 a year on supplies for their
classrooms," said Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers
Assn. in Burlingame, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California Tax Credit</TE>
<TE>   The teacher retention credit, which can shave as much as $1,500
off a California state tax bill, went into effect in 2000, but only
about 214,000 of the state's 300,000 teachers claimed it last year,
the Franchise Tax Board reports. The board expects more teachers to
claim the credit on their returns this year.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the straightforward federal tax break, the California
teacher retention credit is complex. To qualify, a teacher must be
credentialed and have taught at least four years in an elementary,
secondary or vocational trade school serving grades kindergarten
through 12. Those working with emergency or internship credentials do
not qualify.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of the credit will vary based on the teacher's years of
service and what percentage of the family's income comes from
teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers with four to six years of service can claim as much as
$250. The maximum credit rises to $500 after six years of service, to
$1,000 after 11 years and to $1,500 after 20 years. However, the
credit cannot exceed 50% of the state tax owed on teaching-related
wages.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers whose spouse is not a qualified educator must figure out
which portion of their joint tax liability is attributable to
teaching, potentially limiting the credit they can claim. (This
limitation is calculated on form 3505, which must be filed with any
return claiming the credit.)</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if teachers derive some of their income from nonacademic
work--for instance, for coaching the volleyball team--that amount
must be deducted from the calculation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling you, it's brutal," said Alfonso U. Bundoc Jr.,
enrolled agent with Premier Tax Service in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are the principal of the school and you also teach, you
are supposed to look at your contract to see how much of your salary
is allocated to teaching and how much to administration," he said.
"If I make [$50,000] and my contract calls for 50% teaching and 50%
administrative, I can only count [$25,000] toward the teacher
retention credit."</TE>
<TE>   But for those who qualify, the credit is generous enough to make
the extra tax calculations worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike deductions, which reduce taxable income--thus saving a
person in the 30% tax bracket roughly 30 cents on the dollar--tax
credits reduce the tax paid on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</TE>
<TE>   Those who qualifed for the teacher credits but failed to take them
in 2000 should amend their returns by filing a form 540X, Bundoc
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds better politically than it works out in real life, but
it still helps our teachers," Southward said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other States' Breaks</TE>
<TE>   Several other states also have tax breaks for teachers, though
none as generous as California's, said Daniel Schibley, an expert in
state taxation with CCH.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Virginia teachers can take a deduction for as much
as 20% of the cost of tuition for taking continuing teacher education
courses required by the state.</TE>
<TE>   In Maryland, a teacher can get a credit of up to $1,500 for
tuition for graduate-level courses they are required to take to
maintain certification.</TE>
<TE>   A few states also allow teachers to exempt all or part of their
teacher retirement payments from state tax, Schibley said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the rules for these exemptions often are complicated and
include caveats and phase-outs. If you're not sure about which
credits or deductions you can claim, seek professional tax advice.</TE>

<TE>   A Little Relief</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a new tax break for teachers, there are a few other
consumer-oriented tax breaks in the economic stimulus bill.</TE>
<TE>   * AMT relief: Personal tax credits for adoption, disability,
children and education will continue to be exempt from the
alternative minimum tax through 2003. These exemptions would have
expired this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Archer medical savings accounts: These accounts, which allow the
self-employed and small-business owners to save for some medical
costs on a tax-free basis, were extended through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Foster care: A provision in the law expands the definition of
those considered a foster-care child and who may receive tax-exempt
payments for their care.</TE>

<HD>For Elian Gonzalez, a Hero's Status--but a Normal Life?</HD>
<DH>Politics * Cuba says it can give the boy his national
recognition, which includes his own museum, as well as his privacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EUGENE ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>CARDENAS, Cuba</DL>
<LD>The most famous 8-year-old boy in the world lives on a busy street in
a pale-green stucco house, nice by Cuban standards but hardly
luxurious. He attends the neighborhood school, and in the afternoon
he can be seen playing soccer and tag with friends in his little
frontyard. Occasionally someone will walk past wearing a T-shirt with
his picture on it. Out on the sidewalk, a policeman stands watch day
and night.</LD>
<LD>   It's been more than a year and a half since Elian Gonzalez came
home. This is what he came home to--a life that is both more private
and more public than most of us could imagine.</LD>
<LD>   The story of Elian is the stuff of myth. Shipwrecked and left
motherless in a desperate voyage of flight. Kept from drowning, some
people believe, by heaven-sent dolphins. Rescued from the sea by the
provident hands of a fisherman. Adopted by exiles as a symbol of hope
and freedom. Taken to Disney World. Brought out each afternoon to be
photographed at play. Claimed by his father, who braved peril to come
take him home. Fought over in the courts by lawyers and in the
streets by multitudes. Taken at gunpoint by commandos, reunited with
the father and finally flown home to a hero's welcome.</LD>
<TE>   That's a lot to go through before your seventh birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Fidel Castro, who turned Elian into the symbolic son of the entire
nation, vowed that when the boy got back to Cuba, he would resume a
normal life. The Cuban exiles in Miami predicted Elian would be
exploited to help prolong Castro's rule.</TE>
<TE>   Who was right?</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas is about a three-hour drive from Havana. To get there,
you head east past grim Soviet-style apartment complexes and cheery
little beach resorts, past rolling green countryside, past one of
Cuba's few oil fields, past the city of Matanzas with its commodious
deep-water port, where ships too big to squeeze into the Havana
harbor come to call.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Matanzas there is a tollbooth, where motorists must pay
two U.S. dollars, a princely sum by Cuban standards. Think of it as a
kind of departure tax because that booth is the gateway to Varadero,
which seems like another country.</TE>
<TE>   Varadero is Cuba's preeminent beach resort, a 20-mile spit of
scrubland and pristine beach jutting into the Florida Straits. It is
by far the most prosperous-looking place on the island.</TE>
<TE>   The streets are broad and well paved, the houses and apartments
look tidy, the people look particularly well fed and well dressed.</TE>
<TE>   There is an 18-hole golf course, one of only a couple in the whole
of Cuba. There are fine restaurants that serve fresh lobster. And the
beach is lined with big Cancun-style luxury hotels--normally full of
Canadian, Spanish, Italian and German tourists but rather empty since
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, works in Varadero, as did
his mother, Elisabeth Brotons, who perished trying to take her son to
America. She was a hotel maid and he was an admissions booth
attendant, but both were part of the developing new Cuban elite:
Those who work in jobs where they receive tips from foreigners in
dollars. In a country where the average state salary (in Cuban pesos)
equals about $15 a month, a waiter in a hotel restaurant is a wealthy
man.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few miles down the highway lies Cardenas, and suddenly
you're back in Cuba. It's a fairly prosperous little town, given that
so many of its residents work in Varadero.</TE>
<TE>   A rental car cruising the streets of Cardenas is hair-on-fire
conspicuous and can only be looking for one thing. So people start to
answer before you even get the question out: "Where's Elian's house?"</TE>
<TE>   The first set of directions are a bum steer, leading to Elian's
grandparents' home near the port, where the whole family used to
live.</TE>
<TE>   The second sends you straight to the little pale-green house, or
pretty close--actually, to a similar pale-green house two doors away,
where the lady of the house almost has a conniption at the arrival of
two foreigners, one carrying a notebook and the other laden with
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   She is torn between the instinct to show good manners and the
fervent desire that this not be happening to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Please have a seat," she says. Then, as soon as we are seated:
"I'm afraid you have the wrong house. Please come with me."</TE>
<TE>   She takes us to the right house, where the polite policeman
stands, and after telling him five different ways that she does not
know us, has never seen us before and certainly will never see us
again, scurries back home and shuts the door.</TE>
<TE>   The policeman asks if we have come to see Juan Miguel, and we say
yes. He explains that the family is not home at the moment, but
perhaps we could come back in a while. He is as gracious as he can
be, but also someone around whom you would not want to make sudden
moves.</TE>
<TE>   Well, then, to pass some time. To the museum. Elian's museum.</TE>
<TE>   After Elian returned to Cardenas, the Cuban government took a big
former firehouse, spruced it up with a coat of ocher paint, gutted
the inside and turned it into a museum commemorating the victorious
fight to bring the boy home to Cuba. Officially it is called the
Museum of the Battle of Ideas, but everyone knows it as "the Elian
Museum."</TE>
<TE>   The chief attraction comes first: a statue titled "Dignity," by a
sculptor named Andres Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   It is a modernistic but clearly figurative statue of Elian, gazing
hopefully into the future. The medium is bronze but the surface is
mottled, as if it were made of clay. Elian is recognizable as
himself, not as some generic Cuban boy. In one fist he holds a toy
Superman. He is supported not by the earth or any solid surface but
by a sea of hands, representing the Cuban people. One of the hands is
holding a Cuban flag.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the museum exhibits are artifacts from the struggle:
The Cuban flag that flew at his grandparents' house in Cardenas
during the long months Elian was in the United States. The T-shirt
worn by one of the fishermen who rescued him. E-mails and letters
blasting the "Miami Mafia" and demanding Elian's return. A picture of
Elian at Disney World, wearing mouse ears. A picture of a
demonstration on his behalf at the Plaza de la Revolucion in Havana,
which drew 1 million people. A mock-up of the open-air stage that
Castro built outside the American Interests Section in Havana--the
closest thing to an American Embassy--so he could hold Elian
demonstrations where the Americans would have to see and hear them.</TE>
<TE>   There are the school notebooks kept by Elian's classmates who were
brought to the United States to keep him company while he awaited
permission to go home.</TE>
<TE>   A teacher came, too, to give the kids the same class work they
would have been receiving in Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   One of the notebooks is open to a page where the youngster wrote:
"Every Cuban is a soldier."</TE>
<TE>   There are relief busts of Cuba's great historical heroes, the
founding fathers of independence and the revolution. And there is a
book of photos from the museum's opening, with a personal note from
Castro: "The battle of ideas cannot be lost and will not be lost."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, this is one of two museums dedicated to Elian. The
other, more of a shrine, has been set up in Miami, in the little
house where Elian lived with the distant cousins and uncles who will
forever be known as the Miami Relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?"</TE>
<TE>   The policeman stationed in front of Elian's house, more politely
than ever, gently guides us away from the house, toward a man
standing on the corner.</TE>
<TE>   The man introduces himself as a local official of the Cuban
Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so happy that you have come to Cardenas," he says. "We
understand that you would like to talk with Juan Miguel, and of
course that would be fine, but it would be impossible without
specific prior approval from Havana."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Havana had said they had no objection at all, that it
was up to Juan Miguel. Could we ask him?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, of course. But only with approval from Havana."</TE>
<TE>   This was no surprise. The Cuban government has kept journalists
away from the family, and the truth is that this is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Cubans in general dote on their children, and Elian, after all, is
a child. It is probably impossible for him to lead an entirely
"normal" life, whatever that is, but the government says it is
determined to try to give him the chance. A constant stream of
foreign journalists coming to visit would be counterproductive. He's
more than done his bit to provide fuel for the global media machine.
He's earned the right to play in his front yard without being
photographed.</TE>

<HD>Clad in Red and Purple, They Laugh Off Old Age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As gauntlets go, it seemed a fairly benign one.</LD>
<LD>   In 1961 a youngish (29) English poet wrote a poem that began:
"When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple with a red hat that
doesn't go, and doesn't suit me." And with that, Jenny Joseph
unwittingly drew a line in the dirt for a less-serious old age for
women determined not to regret the sobriety of their youths.</LD>
<LD>   "Warning," Joseph's short poem chronicling a woman's old age with
frivolity and fun, has since been printed on mugs, posters and
T-shirts. In 1996 the BBC took a poll, and "Warning" was the nation's
favorite poem.</LD>
<TE>   As if that weren't enough, in the last few years, so-called Red
Hat societies--roughly 2,000 social gatherings of women of a certain
age who, like the woman in the poem, wear red hats and purple dresses
as a badge of fun--have sprung up around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Hat Society is hosting its international convention in
Chicago in April. Activities will include a pajama-party breakfast,
shopping and panels on communication and success.</TE>
<TE>   The first society was started a few years ago in Arizona by a
woman who was taken with Joseph's poem. Red Hat societies are
notoriously free of rules, but members must be at least 50 and must
wear red hats and purple dresses to their public gatherings (often
held in restaurants). Younger members--"princesses in training"--may
attend, but their uniform is pink hats and lavender dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally Red Hat societies limit their membership to fewer
than 20 women, so the conversation can flow freely. Judi Tanguay, who
leads a group based in West Hartford, Conn., started it with her
closest friends, a bevy of women who vacationed together for years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I turned 50 I gave everybody a copy of the poem, and I asked
that everyone bring something purple when we went out to dinner,"
said Tanguay, now 52. Later she saw a clip on television about the
Red Hat societies.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just tailor-made," Tanguay said. "I think it's a great way
to tell people that you really don't have to grow up, and you can let
that little kid inside of you come out. It's perfectly fine."</TE>
<TE>   They have dubbed themselves the Beguiling Red Hat Biddies, a name
rooted in Tanguay's friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on one of our trips at a B&amp;B dining room, and a senior
bus was in there," Tanguay said. "We got all silly talking about the
blue hairs, and 'Are we going to be like that, too?' We decided that
we'd be biddies and keep doing this for as long as we can."</TE>

<LD>My sister, Kate, and I always get a present from our Grandma in
Ireland for St. Patrick's Day.</LD>
<LD>   It's usually a little box of shamrocks. The box came this morning,
but as soon as we opened it, a little man popped up. He wore a green
velvet suit and a red pointed cap.</LD>
<LD>   Kate gasped. "Are you a leprechaun?"</LD>
<TE>   The little man took off his cap, bowed, and said: "I am. I know
you have a grand St. Patrick's Day parade here, and I have a mind to
see it."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my gosh!" I said. "Let me call Mom."</TE>
<TE>   The leprechaun frowned. "Don't do that or I'll disappear. No adult
can look at a leprechaun. I'll be whisked immediately back to
Ireland."</TE>
<TE>   Kate touched him with a gentle finger. "You are so cute!"</TE>
<TE>   "Cute? Cute? I am Liam of Shannon, Lord of the Leprechauns. Show
me some respect, girl!"</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," Kate whispered.</TE>
<TE>   "Now can we go to the parade?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, Lord Leprechaun." I put him in the top pocket of my
T-shirt so he could poke his head up and hide if there was danger.</TE>
<TE>   Off we went. The parade was just starting.</TE>
<TE>   Liam of Shannon kept jumping up and saying "Grand band!" and
"Listen to those pipes! I'm powerful fond of pipes."</TE>
<TE>   Everything was fine until our next-door neighbor came up beside
us.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, kids," he began, then stopped and asked: "What have you got
in your pocket, Kevin? Is that a mouse?"</TE>
<TE>   "Mouse indeed?" A small, offended person popped up. "I am..." then
poof! He wasn't there anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no," Kate wailed. "That was ..."</TE>
<TE>   I put my fingers to my lips. If we told, he wouldn't believe us
anyway. Nobody would.</TE>
<TE>   But Kate and I knew we had entertained Liam of Shannon, Lord of
the Leprechauns.</TE>
<TE>   And he had really enjoyed the St. Patrick's Day parade.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Bunting says, "Happy St. Pat's to one and all!" This story

<HD>SUVs Should Be Driven Into a Truck Lane</HD>
<DH>Big guys on the right, little guys on the left. It has a
nice ring, doesn't it?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fine, OK. You want your SUV truck. You need it. Not only that, it's
your right. Right? Didn't the Army do battle in Kuwait and Iraq so
you can drive as much iron as you can afford? Don't the United Auto
Workers and the visionaries at the Big Three (do they still call them
that?) know what's best, as always?</LD>
<LD>   I feel as if I'm back in the early years of the tobacco debates.
Common sense is a weak rival to desire.</LD>
<LD>   So maybe it's time to alter course radically in this debate about
highway mileage standards.</LD>
<TE>   Conservationists and sensible citizens of all stripes would do
better to surrender their complaints against the gas-guzzling SUV
crowd. It's apparent with the latest vote in the Senate that they
aren't going to win anyway. The country is tight in the grip of a
socially aggressive fad that just won't yield to reason.</TE>
<TE>   Before we make ourselves crazy, we should reach accommodation.
Live and let drive.</TE>
<TE>   The SUVers want all the advantages of trucks, great. Let 'em roar.
They don't want to be held to the mileage standards of regular
automobiles? Swell, never mind.</TE>
<TE>   Safety has emerged as the molten core of the freedom-of-choice SUV
debate--more important than energy independence, our shaky and
dangerous sources of oil supply, global warming and the last of our
wilderness. For now, let's concede that safety is paramount. Both for
the SUVers and for those of us who think that half a V-8 is plenty,
and it's silly to get caught up in this pyramid scam of marketing in
which every bigger SUV has to be topped by another bigger still, all
for our own good.</TE>
<TE>   SUVs are trucks; they're special. In return, and for reasons of
safety, they, along with pickups and their hybrid cousins, should be
treated as trucks. Eureka, we could start with three steps:</TE>
<TE>   * Lower speed limits. On some of the highways where I drive,
truckers are restricted to a lower speed limit--say, 55 mph instead
of 65. This is for safety's sake. Slower is safer. And since the
SUVers are concerned about safety above all, slow them down. It would
be less dangerous for them (cannot deny that, can you?) and it would
be far safer for those of us who drive Honda Civics.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I think the limit ought to be 45 mph for trucks, and
perhaps the Teamsters would support me on this. That would make for
less dangerous roads and create more jobs for truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   * Lane restrictions. Some states, including California, restrict
trucks to the right-hand lanes on major freeways. So let's put the
SUVs there too. Since they are going to be traveling slower, that's
where they belong anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who drive 33-miles-per-gallon cars instead of their
12-miles-a-gallon behemoths would at last be able to see where we're
going. Big guys on the right, little guys on the left. It has a nice
ring, doesn't it? With safety a shared concern, who could possibly
argue with the wisdom of lane separation? Oh yes, that would include
a prohibition on SUVs in carpool lanes too. For safety's sake. True,
this step won't help much on city streets. But it's a start.</TE>
<TE>   * Increased vehicle fees. This is a big one. Years ago, pickup
trucks were licensed as commercial vehicles and paid premiums for
registration. We should revamp and modernize this idea to account for
the added costs SUVs impose on society.</TE>
<TE>   As ultimately happened with tobacco, Americans decided that
personal actions jeopardizing public health should be taxed
unmercifully. The same should apply right away to SUVs with stiff new
truck fees.</TE>
<TE>   I am speaking of pollution. Not only do these vehicles burn 21/2
times more gas than a five-passenger sedan, but even in states like
California, with its strictest-in-the-nation emission standards,
truck-class vehicles are given a pollution loophole, at least through
2007. Thus, a Dodge Ram 3500 emits eight times as much carbon
monoxide per mile as my Civic, according to the California Air
Resources Board. A Chevy Suburban belches three times as much oxides
of nitrogen, a chief contributor to smog, and a Ford Excursion twice
as much.</TE>
<TE>   New research, compiled recently by Times writer Gary Polakovic,
confirms that these components of air pollution cause birth defects
in urban populations. They damage the health of young children, with
likely consequences throughout their lives. If it's right to tax
smokers, it's just as right to tax SUVers for the same reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Surely, safety-minded soccer moms in their SUVs could not argue
that the extra toll their motoring takes on the health of our young
should not come without a price.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to treat a truck like a truck.</TE>

<HD>Move Mexican Labor Deal to Center Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We're all trying to get our lives back to normal six months after
Sept. 11. Maybe that explains why President Bush is focusing on the
region of the world he knows best--Latin America--even as the war in
Afghanistan winds down, another war in the Middle East rages on and
policymakers in Washington debate the possibility of a new war
against Iraq. Normally, Latin Americans applaud whenever a U.S.
president shifts his attention, however briefly, to a region usually
relegated to the backwaters of foreign policy. But this time many are
holding back until they see what happens during Bush's visit to
Mexico, El Salvador and Peru this week.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Bush raised their expectations prior to last
September--talking about an immigration deal with Mexico, a
free-trade agreement with Chile and the like--and then didn't
deliver. Not that he didn't have good reason for being distracted.
But you can't blame the Latin Americans for not wanting to have their
hopes raised, then dashed, again. It's easy to forget, for instance,
how much progress the U.S. and Mexico had made by Sept. 5--when
President Vicente Fox arrived for a state visit--toward a labor
agreement that would have legalized up to 4million Mexicans working
in this country illegally. Bush's first stop on his Latin American
tour is Monterrey, Mexico, where he should try to jump-start those
labor talks.</LD>
<TE>   Diplomats and other experts from both countries had been meeting
for months before last September to flesh out a simple, gutsy idea
that Bush and Fox had agreed on: Let Mexicans working in this country
come out of hiding to labor openly, then return to Mexico once their
work is done. In exchange, the Mexican government was prepared to
start cooperating with our long, futile campaign to slow illegal
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, key members of Congress didn't share Bush's
enthusiasm for closer ties with Mexico and were preparing to nit-pick
to death any new migration agreement. Using the measured language of
diplomacy, Bush warned the Mexicans the going was likely to be slow.
Fox responded with an undiplomatic insistence that a deal could be
struck by the end of 2001. That's where things stood on the morning
of Sept. 11. It's as good a place as any to start anew this week.
There are hopeful signs that progress is possible.</TE>
<TE>   After all, six months ago conventional wisdom had it that
conservative GOP leaders in Congress were not ready to give even a
Republican president immigration reform that was perceived as
rewarding illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Yet last week the House narrowly approved a long-stalled proposal
backed by Bush that would allow several thousand illegal immigrants
with family ties in this country to legalize their status without
having to return to their home countries.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, conventional wisdom also had it that the new Fox
government had not convinced U.S. law enforcement that it was really
going after the criminal gangs that control the illegal drug trade
across the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on March 9 Mexican police finally nabbed one of Mexico's most
wanted drug lords, Benjamin Arellano Felix. It was a blow to one of
that country's most powerful and violent gangs and a symbolic victory
in the war against drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And although we need no proof of how hard it is to control the
borders of a big, free country, last week it was revealed that the
notoriously inefficient U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
had finally issued student visas to two of the terrorists who flew
hijacked planes into the World Trade Center. The notices arrived at
their old flight school in Florida exactly six months after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   What better evidence is there that the INS spends way too much
time and effort chasing down Mexican busboys and farm workers and not
enough finding the truly dangerous foreigners who would do this
country harm?</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Fox need to get that Mexican labor-migration deal done,
and fast. Their meeting this week is as good a time as any to get the
ball rolling again.</TE>

<HD>Andrea Yates' Prosecutors Used the Death Penalty as a Trial
Tactic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ</AU>
<BD>Alan Dershowitz's latest book is "Shouting Fire: Civil
Liberties in a Turbulent Age" (Little, Brown 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prosecutors in the Andrea Yates case never really expected, nor
even wanted, the jury to return a death sentence. They manipulated
the death penalty processing order to get a pro-prosecution jury, one
more likely to reject the insanity defense and return a verdict of
guilt.</LD>
<LD>   This tactic, well known to those who practice criminal law, is
becoming more widespread in states that authorize the death penalty.
In most cases, this tactic is more difficult to detect and expose
than it is in the Yates case. Here, one of the prosecutors
practically invited the jury not to return a death sentence. It was
either the most under-zealous prosecutor I have ever come across or
he knew exactly what he was doing. The latter seems more likely.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors knew that if Yates got the death penalty, her
case--including the merits of the conviction--would probably be
examined more scrupulously by the appellate courts. They also knew
that a death sentence would be controversial and would lead to
criticism. What they wanted was the certainty of conviction of
first-degree murder without the burdens of defending a death
sentence. They got exactly what they wanted and had planned for.</LD>
<TE>   These actions are highly questionable. By representing to the
court that they were seeking the death penalty, if they in fact were
not really doing so, they may have manipulated the system.</TE>
<TE>   Why would they, and so many other prosecutors, engage in this
charade? The answer is that legislatures and courts have implicitly
invited them to do so by establishing rules that permit prosecutors
to secure more favorable juries if they seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In cases in which the prosecutors are asking for the death penalty
they have the right to challenge for cause any juror who would be
unwilling to impose this ultimate sentence. This ensures the
prosecution a skewed jury consisting exclusively of citizens who
favor the death penalty and assuring the absence of any jurors who
oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   How one stands on the death penalty may be relevant if the
prosecutor is actually seeking to have that penalty imposed. But if
the purpose of seeking it is simply to get a more law-and-order,
pro-prosecution jury, then the practice is reprehensible. Yet the
courts have generally refused to look behind the prosecutors' claim
that they are, in good faith, seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, I brought this issue to the U.S. Supreme Court in a
murder case arising in California. The high court granted review, but
then decided to duck this issue, leaving it for another day. Nearly
35 years later that day still has not arrived, and prosecutors have
learned how to play the system for maximum success.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to prove in most cases that a prosecutor was
seeking the death penalty in order to get a favorable jury on the
guilt phase of the case. Some prosecutors are truly ambivalent. But
there are cases in which this ploy is carefully considered and even
discussed in advance with superiors.</TE>
<TE>   I do not know whether that happened in the Yates case, but it
seems unlikely that anything happened between the time the
prosecutors said they were seeking the death penalty before trial and
their decision not to press for it aggressively during the sentencing
phase. If anything, the jury's short deliberation during the guilt
phase should have encouraged them to push aggressively for what they
had said they were seeking.</TE>
<TE>   The conduct of the prosecutors in this case should be examined,
and defense attorneys should raise this issue on appeal. Perhaps the
courts finally will declare this practice unethical, even
unconstitutional. Even if the courts decline to consider this issue,
ethical prosecutors should refuse to engage in it because it is
unfair to defendants and distorts the fact-finding function of the
jury.</TE>
<TE>   The Yates case is a perfect case for the courts to use as a
vehicle to expose this scandal.</TE>

<AU>SIDNEY DRELL, RAYMOND JEANLOZ and BOB PEURIFOY</AU>
<BD>Sidney Drell is an emeritus professor of physics at
Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center. Raymond Jeanloz is a
professor of geophysics at UC Berkeley. Bob Peurifoy was vice
president at Sandia National Laboratory. All have worked extensively
for the U.S. government in technical issues of nuclear weapons.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A myth is emerging that we can develop low-yield nuclear weapons that
will destroy hardened, deeply buried targets of military interest
without contaminating the atmosphere with deadly radioactivity. Such
weapons, delivered by bombers, must penetrate below the Earth's
surface before detonating in order to create the maximum destructive
ground shock.</LD>
<LD>   There are problems with this myth: Its validity is doubtful and
its consequences are dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   Low-yield nuclear weapons have limited effectiveness against
buried targets and they would disperse significant amounts of
radioactivity.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, however, the deployment of such weapons
would likely have an extremely harmful effect on ongoing efforts to
slow--if not prevent--the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   First, some technical facts. Yields greater than 1 kiloton are
required to damage hard targets deeper than about 200 feet. Much
larger yields--in the range of 100 kilotons or more--are needed to
create enough ground shock to destroy a hardened structure at a
1,000-foot depth.</TE>
<TE>   Taking into account realistic limits on material strengths, 50
feet is about the maximum depth a warhead can dig and maintain its
integrity in dry, hard soil, the likely locations for buried targets.
Even a 1 kiloton warhead--1/20th the yield that destroyed
Hiroshima--detonated at a depth of 20 feet would eject about 1
million cubic feet of radioactive debris from a crater about the size
of ground zero at the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has produced a high-yield weapon capable of destroying a
number of underground targets of interest. Such an explosion would
dig a much larger crater and create substantially larger amounts of
radioactive debris.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. capability against a reportedly growing number of
military targets buried at relatively shallow depths--less than 100
feet--can be greatly enhanced by delivering several conventional
bombs on the same target with precision guidance. If nuclear weapons
are used to attack buried targets, however, there is no possibility
of a so-called "clean" attack, free of extensive radioactive
contamination spreading in the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Actions by the U.S. to deploy new designs of nuclear warheads for
new military missions would also strike at the heart of the current
worldwide effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Currently, 185 nations have endorsed this effort by signing on to the
indefinite extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, agreed
to in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the NPT signatories based their support on the explicit
assumption that the nuclear-armed powers would honor a commitment to
cease all underground nuclear explosive tests and continue efforts to
reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons, rather than to create new
missions for new ones. This commitment is supported by the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. has signed--along with
more than 160 other nations--but not yet ratified.</TE>
<TE>   A ban on all nuclear testing enhances our national security for
the foreseeable future. The U.S. should ratify the test ban treaty,
joining the 89 other nations that have already done so, because the
U.S. is the natural and necessary leader for advancing the cause of
nuclear nonproliferation.</TE>
<TE>   Already, three nuclear powers--Russia, England and France--and
many of our NATO allies plus Japan have ratified the test ban. China
has declared its intent to sign once the U.S. does, while India has
also expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the test ban treaty into force requires U.S.
ratification, which would then trigger the completion of an
international monitoring system to enhance our ability to verify
worldwide compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Attaching false hopes to low-yield nuclear weapons for destroying
buried targets is no reason to undermine the so-far-successful
efforts to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And resumption
of underground nuclear explosions in the quest for these so-called
"more usable" nuclear weapons would harm the nonproliferation treaty
and, thus, our national security.</TE>

<LD>Rony Brock was readying himself to fight in Afghanistan when he died
on the streets of Los Angeles. Suspected gang members killed the
19-year-old Marine last month on the doorstep of his mother's Boyle
Heights home.</LD>
<LD>   Soledad Brock heard it all through her bedroom window. Hears it
still, every night as she tries to sleep, and first thing every
morning. The question asked by gang members itching for trouble:
"Where are you from?" And her son's answer, the one that is supposed
to buy safe passage for those not in a gang: "Nowhere." Then
crack-crack-crack-crack-crack-crack!</LD>
<LD>   For a decade or so it looked as if Los Angeles' gang problem was
abating. Now the opposite may be true. And now seems a good time for
the city to finally stand up to the street gangs that terrorize
communities, to tell them that their slow-motion mass murder must
end.</LD>
<TE>   Homicide sends more Californians between the ages of 15 and 19 to
the morgue than even car accidents, the No. 1 killer nationwide. In
almost 60% of Los Angeles' slayings last year the shooter or the
victim or both belonged to a gang. California has more gangs than any
other state. And Los Angeles has more gangs than any other city.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department puts the number of gangs here at 407 and the
number of gang members at 55,760. Driving this city's streets and
shopping in its markets are members of profit-oriented Salvadoran
gangs and hate-driven skinhead gangs. Subsets of Crips and Bloods
fill Los Angeles' classrooms and idle in its parks. This is a city of
Mexican American gangs whose roots go back four generations and
Vietnamese gangs that flowered when the "boat people" began arriving
after Saigon's fall.</TE>
<TE>   Don't think the phenomenon is new. Two hundred years ago Irish,
Italian, Jewish and German gangs formed in the young nation's rapidly
shifting ethnic slums to pick pockets, run rum and knife each other
over crumbs from the Industrial Revolution. What changed in the last
30 years, besides racial and ethnic makeup, were scope and scale.
Gangs are no longer limited to large cities. And, armed with Glocks
and shotguns, they are far more deadly.</TE>
<TE>   From 1993 to 1999, California's homicide rate dropped to 30-year
lows, a trend seen nationwide. Since 2000, the number of homicides
has begun to creep back up. They are still far below the peak--except
for gang- related shootings. In 1993, law enforcement linked gang
members to 346 of 1,077 homicides in Los Angeles. That's 32%, a
proportion that held fairly steady over the next six years. In 2000
and again in 2001, however, gangsters had a hand in almost 60% of the
city's homicides. The 2001 total, 587, was about half what it had
been in 1993. The number of gang- related deaths--346--was exactly
the same.</TE>
<TE>   Two years do not a pattern make, but 2002 is well on its way to
making it three. The body count in the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division,
which patrols Boyle Heights, stands at 17 already--not counting
anyone gunned down last night.</TE>
<TE>   As of March 9, the toll was 109 citywide, compared with 89 at this
time last year and 70 the year before that. Last week alone killers
claimed 13 people in 11 unrelated shootings--four in drive-bys, one
by a rival gang, another caught in the cross-fire of a chase. One
gunman asked "Where you from?" then killed a father in front of his
son.</TE>
<TE>   Add to these numbers the wounded (at least six, one critically),
the families left bereft, neighborhoods terrorized, emergency room
resources strained and back come memories of the fear that swept Los
Angeles in the late 1980s, climaxing in the 1992 riots, an explosion
of violence rooted in many of the same social and economic conditions
that fuel gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Could it get that bad again? Consider the slowed economy. Consider
the estimated 127,000 inmates who will walk out the doors of
California prisons this year. Consider the massing swarm of
Californians in the crime-prone adolescent years--3.9 million today,
nearly 5 million by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Now consider whether this might not be a good time to get serious
about street gangs, to stand up to the young bullies who prey on
their innocent peers, to help steer those peers away from a life that
all too often follows this path: jail, prison, hospital, coroner's
van.</TE>
<TE>   This nation has had 200 years of gang violence--time enough, one
would think, to figure out ways to eliminate this domestic terrorist
threat. Throughout this 10th-anniversary year of the riots we will
discuss what works, here and elsewhere, to quell gang violence--and
what fails. We'll explore communities struggling to become
neighborhoods again, rather than war zones.</TE>
<TE>   Rony Brock lived--and died--in the sort of neighborhood that's all
too typical in this town of backyard putting greens and hillside
infinity pools: Hieroglyphics spray-painted on buildings that good
people wear themselves out maintaining. Mothers afraid to make eye
contact with the tattooed young men in the dilapidated house next
door. Children who can tell from the timbre of the crack-crack-crack
whether a shooter fired .22- or .38-caliber rounds.</TE>
<TE>   At his funeral, with its flag-draped coffin and honor guard, the
friends and neighbors who packed the church and spilled outside asked
over and over, "Why Rony? Why him?" He played football and
basketball, earned money doing chores after school, made friends
everywhere. His mother had always encouraged him to make something of
himself. After graduating from Roosevelt High in May, he enlisted in
the Marines. He wanted, he said, to buy his mom a nice house in a
safe neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Why aren't all this city's neighborhood's safe?</TE>

<LD>Naming things has always been an American penchant. You can do that
with start-up countries. Americans then named territories and 50
states whose boundaries were unrecognized by longtime native
residents who had their own names anyway. Americans named mountains
that had somehow survived eons without English names. Towns were
named for surveyors and railroad engineers. Developers named suburban
streets for relatives. Some areas set quotas of streets to be named
for veterans. Portions of California freeways carry someone's name.
We even stick our own babies with grandparents' old-fashioned names
to smooth relationships with the elders today, never mind the kid
manipulating that moniker as an adult.</LD>
<LD>   What's increasingly lucrative, however, is selling naming rights.
It makes some cents; Americans are attentive to money. Imagine how
much Americus Vespucius would pay to name the hemisphere. American
holiday football bowls, once dubbed for regional fruits or crops, now
carry the names of an air freight line or a Finnish telephone
company. The snazzy jumpsuits of racing car drivers appear sewed
together by overlapping brand patches. Individual football kickoffs
and halftime shows, hockey face-offs, even certain replays are named
for particular products, like the American Express Check of the Game.</LD>
<TE>   Stadiums and arenas, of course, have garnered multiple millions
for adding company names, the goal being publicity from every event
there. There are problems at times; in recent days workers removed
Enron's name from Houston's stadium, which will now be the Reliant
Astrodome in exchange for a mere $300 million. But this suggests
possibilities for financially pressed individuals in financially
pressed states.</TE>
<TE>   What discount retailer wouldn't want its name on countless houses?
The Wal-Mart Wallace Residence. Ralph &amp; Lisa Taylor's Target
Household. Let's invite car dealers to sponsor government buildings:
The Capitol Ford Capitol could bring millions to state coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest naming opportunity yet may be in New York City, now
run by Michael Bloomberg. He named a news service after himself and
then spent 69 million of his own dollars to be named New York's 108th
mayor. It may be too much to buy the entire city and rename it
Bloomberg. But to help cover New York's $4-billion-plus budget
deficit, officials are considering actually selling four East River
bridges--the Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensboro and, yes, the
Brooklyn Bridge, which many nonowners have attempted to sell in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Why not sell naming rights for these spans? If Abraham Lincoln can
put his name on a tunnel there and George Washington's John Hancock
hangs on another river crossing, how about the Bloomberg Bridge? It
could have the right ring--for the right price.</TE>

<LD>As I have been a precinct worker for many years, I was sorry to hear
of the problems in the last primary ("Registrar Apologizes for
Election Day Problems," March 13). I guess we were lucky. Except for
the confusing ballot, things went pretty well. My experience has been
that the registrar's staff has been efficient and driven to make
voting a pleasant experience. What is needed is more people to
volunteer (and show up). It's one day out of your life, it's
patriotic and can be fun. I always feel that I have given back a
little of what my country has given to me. Try it.</LD>

<TE>   Speaking as a person who has served as a polling place inspector
many times, I am appalled at the criticism heaped on
Registrar-Recorder Conny McCormack. In the past I have always found
her department to be efficient: It offers poll workers education,
remarkably well-devised voting materials and attention to
assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years I have been impressed by her efforts to
continuously improve and simplify the poll workers' responsibilities.
This March she was handed an impossible task, and now is being held
to the fire for not accomplishing it perfectly. And the county wants
to cut her budget instead of allowing her to augment her staff so
that she has the help she needs to properly carry out her duties.
Something is wrong here!</TE>

<LD>Re "Seizure of Farms in Mugabe's Zimbabwe," letters, March 13: I used
to cover Africa for the Christian Science Monitor. It's useful to
know that at least some resettlements have been successful and
brought prosperity to Africans. The difficult fact is that whites
wrested land from Africans some 70 to 80 years ago and the Africans
were just as upset as the white farmers now are. The white farmers
find themselves at an unfortunate turn of the meat grinder of
history.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's also unfortunate that many of the resettled Africans do
not have the skills and agricultural techniques to make a success of
farming. But others do seem to have them.</LD>

election. I quote, "We do not recognize the outcome of the election
because we think it's flawed." I guess it was because Bush is an
expert on flawed elections. It is a pleasure to read something funny

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene-o Platt's efforts to "restore" the veterans military markers at
Santa Ana Cemetery may have permanently doomed them to ultimate decay
(March 11). The markers are marble limestone markers; marble must
never be sealed, as it must breathe.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a case for stopping Platt, who probably had good
intentions, from doing something worthwhile. This is a case of the
district cemetery trustees finally realizing they have an inherent
responsibility to their cemetery. The only parties who may decide the
matter of repairing or restoring a gravestone are 1) descendant
family with permission of the district, or 2) the district, for the
protection of public health and safety.</LD>
<LD>   A good cleaning every few years would have done the trick. But
sealing with white paint and painting the lettering in gold damages
and alters these historic stones, which were meant to be pure white
marble with raised white lettering. Unless these products are removed
immediately, the future of these markers is doomed. Kudos to the
cemetery district for its wisdom.</LD>

<LD>Re "Flight School Gets Student Visa OK--for Two Sept. 11 Hijackers,"
March 13: This should have been front-page news. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, already doing a dismal job of controlling
both legal and illegal immigration, cannot even single out terrorists
after they've already killed thousands. The CIA and airline security

<TE>   Re "Bush Calls for Probe of INS After Hijackers' Visas OKd," March
14: President Bush was shocked that the INS approved visas for
terrorists. He should not have been surprised. We under-fund the INS
because there is no profit in it. Meanwhile, we spend billions for
unneeded and unwanted weapons systems that do not even work.</TE>
<TE>   The solution is simple. Tracking foreign visitors is necessary for
our defense, so we should give the job to defense contractors. They
could buy the best computers and hire the most expensive, politically
connected consultants for a fraction of the cost devoted to useless
weapons development. Defense workers could be retrained for jobs at
good salaries that would actually provide a service we need, homeland
security. But we cannot be cheap. Only big spending will make it
worthwhile for contractors to adapt to the new threats in a useful
way.</TE>

<TE>   Regarding Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge's goofy

officials think we need only one color, Code Green.</TE>
<TE>   The INS used a Code Green as it just approved student visas for
two of the dead hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   And Congress gave its own Code Green so more illegals can stay
here with our blessing after breaking our laws ("Illegal Immigrants
Aided on Residency Bid in House Vote," March 13).</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we can fly a properly colored flag over LAX every week under
the auspices of our new, more highly paid federal-employee screeners.</TE>

<LD>Re "Angola's Jonas Savimbi Was No Freedom Fighter," Commentary, March
11: Piero Gleijeses is to be commended for bringing Africa's tragic
problems to the fore in a media world obsessed with the Middle East
and for raising a much-needed alarm about the U.S. proclivity for
supporting vicious warlords just because it seems a good idea at the
time.</LD>
<LD>   However, his attempt to burnish the regressive Fidel Castro's
image as a genuine revolutionary is a major disservice. When a
usurper like Castro has his revolutionary credentials certified by
the likes of Henry Kissinger, you know he's a phony. Jonas Savimbi,
his competitor Agostinho Neto and Castro were nothing but a triad of
jockeying warlords proxying for the rival superpowers in Angola, an
unfortunate country whose natural wealth has carried the curse of
attracting voracious international predators.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Beautiful Man Is Besmirched by Enquiring Minds," by Sylvia
Nasar, Commentary, March 13: Only in Hollywood, among the
Alec-Baldwinite self-righteous but often uninformed, could a
controversy arise about John Nash and the astonishingly unique and
moving film about him. Anyone who has read the book knows what a
truly fine job Ron Howard did in bringing a complicated, difficult
story to life--no small task given the intricacies of Nash's life and
illness. That small trivialities about details could possibly affect
academy members' Oscar votes regarding the film is a sad commentary
on the life of Hollywood's collective mind. Do the same academy
members quibble about the enormous fabrications in Oliver Stone's
films? Hardly.</LD>
<LD>   The film is one of the best presentations of a life to come along
in years; Howard deserves the Oscar hands down. For anyone to suggest
that Nash's sexuality and/or anti-Semitism, tangential aspects of his
story, should influence a vote on the film is patently absurd.
Academy members who are planning to vote should most certainly read
the book by Nasar.</LD>

<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for Nasar's commentary on Nash. I am embarrassed that in
discussing the movie with others, I passed on the lies the media
wrote about him. I should have known better and have reminded myself
to be ever vigilant in the reading and hearing of "news."</TE>

<LD>Re "Jury Rejects Insanity Claim, Convicts Mother of Murder," March
13: My mother took her own life. She was well aware of what she was
doing, but emotional illness altered her perception of the value of
her life. Andrea Yates knew what she was doing, but emotional illness
had altered her perception of the value of her children's lives.</LD>
<LD>   I feel our system is unjust to define mental illness by a single,
simplistic criterion: awareness of what one is doing. Whether Yates'
own life proves to be long or short, I take comfort in my belief that
she will be pardoned the only way any of us will be, by the just
judge who took the penalty phase on himself for all humankind.</LD>

children, when does her husband Rusty go before a jury? Or is it a
husband's right to ignore his wife's depression and suicide attempts
and continue to father more children in his authoritarian household?</TE>
<TE>   Even in this litigious society of ours it seems there's room for
one more category of conviction: stupidity. I nominate Rusty Yates to
inaugurate the new legal category.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Don't Let Government Hide" (editorial, March 12) hit the nail on the
head. All too often public officials, both elected and appointed,
have acted as though their jobs give them unlimited authority to do
as they please without proper "airing" to determine if their actions
are for the public good. All people in government should act like the
Great Man said: Government of the people, by the people and for the
people.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately the pols--who do things contrary to the law and even
in spite of it--go unpunished because most of the laws mandating that
they work in the open do not detail punishment. If Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton's (D-San Francisco) SCA 7 includes punishment for
those who defy the law, fine. If it does not, it's a typical
political boondoggle designed to fool the people. Let's let the
voters know out loud, so that they will get mad enough to vote the
rascals and their henchmen out.</LD>

<DH>After 38 years, the Irish Import Shop's founders are
retiring, but L.A. will keep its Celtic cornerstone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time was when Irish music was hard to find in Los Angeles. It's
difficult to imagine such a thing nowadays when the tin whistle keens
from the soundtrack of just about every movie, when the fiddle and
the bodhran and the pipes, the pipes are calling from as many shelves
in Tower Records as the electric guitar. But in 1957, when Richard
Jones made his way to L.A. from Dublin via Canada, it was almost
impossible to find Irish airs and ballads unless you headed down to
the pub to hear them live.</LD>
<LD>   That didn't seem right, so in 1960, Jones began the first local
Irish music radio program. "The Shamrock Show" was broadcast out of
Glendale on KIEV-AM (870), and soon Irish folks from all over
Southern California were calling him to find out where they could
find things. Things from home. Music, yes, but also Barry's gold
blend tea and McVitie's biscuits; Odlum's whole meal and Cadbury
Flake bars; brack and ginger cake; Branston Pickles; blood pudding
and, most of all, Irish sausage and bacon--the bangers and rashers
that are the staple of the Irish breakfast, and dinner, too.</LD>
<LD>   Jones didn't know where to find them, either--if Bridie Gallagher
records were scarce, try finding a decent sausage. He didn't think
that was right. So he and his brand new wife, Annie, decided to open
a shop that would sell Irish music, food and sundries.</LD>
<TE>   "It was hard to find things to sell from Ireland back then," Annie
said. "Unless you could afford to go back on buying trips. Now
they'll sell you the whole country if you want, and there are
distributors calling from all over."</TE>
<TE>   Still, for 38 years, in three Hollywood locations, the Irish
Import Shop has served as corner market, and cornerstone, for L.A.'s
ever-changing Celtic community. At the beginning of the month, the
shop got a new owner, Ann Colburn, a 24-year patron.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been talking about selling for about two years now. Richard
has got lazy on me," said Annie Jones, her voice laced with humor and
the accent of County Tyrone. "No, no," she corrected quickly with a
laugh, "he wants to have a few years to just enjoy. We've always been
so busy."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 38 years of proprietorship, she said, were spent with
Richard getting up at 3 a.m. to go to work as a bus driver, then
coming into the shop to relieve Annie so she could go home to their
four children. Still, they're helping Colburn with the transition.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll stay on till she fires us," said Richard. "And even then
we'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   The spot the shop has occupied for the last 14 years--on Vine
Street just north of Melrose Avenue--is not exactly a place one might
go looking for a bit of the old sod. Wedged between a pawnshop and a
nail parlor in what is almost a caricature of an L.A. strip mall
(other denizens include a check-cashing establishment and a Subway
sandwich shop), the tiny storefront with the map of Ireland in the
window is easily missed. But anyone looking for Flahavan's oatmeal or
Kerry Gold butter finds it eventually and then keeps coming back.
Over the years, the merchandise has expanded from food and music to
all things Irish.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to have what people want," said Annie. There's Waterford
crystal, Belleek china, tweed caps and Aran Island sweaters, Claddagh
rings, Celtic cross jewelry, books and cards and plaques of the Irish
blessing. There's kitsch--T-shirts and sweatshirts and shamrock-laden
baby bibs, tin whistles and leprechaun dolls and an order of
blackthorn walking sticks on the way--but there are also Irish
newspapers and videos teaching Gaelic and step-dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Even the food has become more diverse. There's plenty of British
fare--Spotted Dick sponge cake, Batchelor's beans and Golden
Syrup--on the shelves now.</TE>
<TE>   "Food is the one thing the Irish and the British agree on," said
Annie. "And we have a lot of British customers."</TE>
<TE>   The store is small and crowded, just like markets in Ireland, and
there's as much talking done here as buying. People all over Southern
California use the shop as a cultural clearinghouse. Two weeks before
St. Patrick's Day, Colburn was fielding calls about where a person
might hire an Irish singer--"Taa, it's too late for that," she
said--and a bulletin board beside the cash register is chockablock
with the business cards of Heffernans, O'Connors, FitzGeralds and
Harrigans. Some advertise specifically Irish callings--set dance
teachers, pub managers--but others are just real estate agents and
plumbers looking for customers in the community.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Joneses and Colburn, that community is not as
cohesive as it was even as late as the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as active as it once was," said Richard. Then with a
great long laugh, he said, "Too many chiefs, not enough Indians is
always a problem among the Irish." When the laugh was done, he added,
"the set dancing has got a lot of people together again. 'Riverdance'
got a lot of people excited again."</TE>
<TE>   "The Beverly-Normandie area was very Irish when I came over [in
1964]," said Colburn. "There were pubs and businesses, and you could
walk anywhere you needed to go."</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's no real center," Annie added.</TE>
<TE>   As the Irish economy continues to boom, emigration is down all
over the country--the days when thousands of young people would do
anything to get to America are over. "We do get young people in the
shop these days," said Richard, "but they don't seem to stay around.
Nowadays they come over here for a week on business and then go back.
Used to be you came over and didn't go back for 20, 30 years. These
young folks, they're the jet set."</TE>
<TE>   Before she decided to buy Irish Imports, Colburn had thought of
returning to her native County Mayo or Dublin and opening a crafts
store or a bed-and-breakfast catering to Americans. Last year she was
downsized out of her downtown corporate job and was trying to figure
out what to do next when she heard the store was for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about it and called, thought about it some more and
called again, and then I decided to do it," she said. There were too
many coincidences, she said, including the names--"They're Richard
and Ann, and my husband [who is deceased] and I were Richard and Ann.
The timing was perfect, and I do believe in fate."</TE>
<TE>   And unexpected things do happen in the shop. Pointing to a couple
of business cards on the board, the Joneses tell of two Irish police
officers, or guarda, who recently stopped by. They were in town to
extradite a man who had committed a homicide in Dublin, Richard said,
and his friend, Pat Murphy, was showing them around--"giving them the
time"--and thought they might like to stop in the shop.</TE>
<TE>   Richard happened to mention that Annie was from Northern Ireland.
"One of the fellas asked where, and I told him outside Omagh," said
Annie, "and he asked where outside Omagh, and, sure enough, we knew
all the same people, although he was 30 years younger than me. But it
turned out my brother taught him French in school."</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't believe it," she said. "Who expects to come to L.A.
and find someone from home? But it's a small world still."</TE>
<TE>   And a small store as well. Eyeing first a stack of newly arrived
chocolate Easter eggs and then the already crowded shelves, Colburn
faced one of the first obstacles of keeping shop--fitting it all in.
"I'll never do it," she said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Although she plans to launch a Web site for the store, she has no
desire to change it much--right now she's too busy keeping up with
the St. Patrick's Day rush. And, said Richard, she's about to learn
one of the secrets of owning an Irish establishment--you don't get to
celebrate the holiday yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, we're too tired by the time the day comes," he said. "We just
go home and go to bed."</TE>

<HD>Swiped and Sent on an Oddball Adventure</HD>
<DH>Objects across the world have fallen prey to the 'roaming

<LD>Miss Abby's monkey puppet paused for a photo at the Academy Awards.
David Stockham's right shoe traveled to Buckingham Palace. The
porcelain clown statue that once decorated a doorstep was snatched
and sent on a tour of L.A.</LD>
<LD>   One day, they were ordinary objects living happily with their
owners. The next, they were living it up without their owners'
permission, having been stolen as part of a practical joke so well
established that an international organization is now dedicated to
the concept.</LD>
<LD>   The "roaming gnome" prank, as it is known, is an idea that's as
old as the hills, or at least the mid-'80s--an adventure that falls
in that peculiar place between high crime and low humor. An innocent
item is kidnapped, then sent on a whirlwind adventure. In lieu of
ransom notes: pictures and postcards. "Having a wonderful time," they
say. "Wish you were here."</LD>
<TE>   It's a practical joke tradition that appeals to people with a
taste for mischief and time on their hands--one that has extended
beyond everyday lawn ornaments to include pretty much anything that
catches the prankster's fancy and gets someone's goat.  When Mike
Biggie received Marvin the Singing Monkey via priority mail, he was
given a simple instruction: "Send a couple pictures of Marvin in
front of some recognizable landmarks."</TE>
<TE>   Biggie, who received the stuffed animal from a friend of his
father-in-law, was happy to oblige. The 35-year-old Santa Monica
resident took his new primate pal to Hollywood's Walk of Fame, Santa
Monica Pier and the Democratic National Convention--where he staged
an anti-fur protest. And, as requested, he sent pictures. Lots of
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   They were addressed to Miss Abby, a lounge singer at the
now-defunct Cheryl's Le Cabaret Piano Bar in Hilton Head, S.C.--a
woman Biggie has not met and does not intend to meet. Miss Abby is
the owner of Marvin the Monkey, who was stolen in September 2000 by a
club regular who had listened to the singer's ventriloquist rendition
of "Down by the Riverside" one too many times. The thief then sent
the monkey to Biggie, who, in turn, has been dutifully mailing Miss
Abby choreographed photos with handwritten notes from her puppet for
the past year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I opened up the envelope with this little squished puppet
inside, I could see that it would be a lot of fun," said Biggie, a
set painter for the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after receiving Marvin, he rigged a wire-armature and
copper-pipe skeleton for the puppet so he could pose the monkey in
various scenarios. The stuffed chimp now owns about 30 outfits, among
them a tuxedo (which he wore to the Oscars), a rain suit (for a trip
to Maine) and several Hawaiian shirts (for the beach)--pictures of
which have been mailed to Miss Abby with no return address.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Stockham, 29, has also been receiving mail from an
unidentified source--his long-lost running shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Stockham was living in Chicago when the right shoe in a pair of
$125 sneakers was stolen from his balcony. About a month later he
began receiving letters written from the shoe's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he suspected some friends who lived in the building of
the hoax, "but people got pretty angry at me that I kept accusing
them of stealing the shoe," said Stockham, who now lives in Utah. "I
started to wonder: Did a pigeon fly away with it?"</TE>
<TE>   He got his answer in June 1999, when he received a letter from
"Righty." In it, Righty told Stockham that he missed "Lefty" but that
he planned to travel around the world, walking "a mile on another
person's foot to see if life is any better." It was postmarked St.
Petersburg, Fla. Stockham didn't know anyone there.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later he received a second letter, postmarked
Hollywood. This time it was accompanied by a Polaroid of Neve
Campbell wearing Righty, who claimed to be having an affair with the
young actress.</TE>
<TE>   Stockham didn't hear from the shoe again for another two months,
by which time Righty had made its way across the Atlantic to London.
There, a local street artist sketched its portrait in front of
Buckingham Palace. Stockham received the drawing along with a
four-page letter detailing the shoe's trips, travails and interest in
the city's rave scene. That was the last he heard from his shoe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great story to tell," said Stockham, who often fields
inquiries from his friends as to Righty's whereabouts. "I have no
idea who did it."</TE>
<TE>   Most likely it was a friend or family member, say sociologists who
study humor. "Nice" pranks like these usually are. While practical
jokes come in all different sizes, strategies and degrees of
meanness, ranging from the mildly annoying (e.g., putting orange
juice in a milk carton) to some real stinkers (rubbing down a
neighbor's dog with limburger cheese), more often than not, the
prankster is acquainted with the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Perpetrated in the spirit of mischievous fun, the "roaming gnome"
type of prank is "victim friendly," said Gary Alan Fine, a
Northwestern University professor who has written about the sociology
of humor. "It's really an example of absurdist humor rather than a
practical joke," he said. "Most people would say it's cute. It's
clever, and it's going to make the victim laugh rather than make the
victim angry."</TE>
<TE>   But Miss Abby isn't laughing. She declined to be interviewed for
this story, saying only that she thought the prank was funny at
first, but now she is mad. According to the monkey's kidnapper, Miss
Abby purchased a replacement monkey, named Melvin, but the show was
never quite the same.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Abby did not say whether she would consider pressing charges
against the culprits. Meant as a joke or not, possession of stolen
property, whether it be a stuffed monkey, running shoe or lawn
statue, is against the law--in some cases a felony, and in others a
misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   In Newark, N.Y., two 18-year-olds claiming to be members of the
Garden Gnome Liberation Front are currently facing misdemeanor
charges for criminal possession of stolen property. Their offense:
stealing 20 garden gnomes and posing them in a baseball field as if
they were playing the game.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the lawn ornament of choice for
appropriation is the pink flamingo. In Europe, it is the gnome--where
millions of the clog-footed, pointy-capped creatures stand guard over
their owners' turf. In 1996, the Garden Gnome Liberation Front was
formed in France. Two years ago it caused a stir when it disrupted an
exhibit in a Paris park: Its members could not resist the lure of
2,000 elfin statues on display. The loosely formed group held its
first international congress in Germany earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Versions of the prank have played a part in several movies--from
"The Full Monty" in 1997 to the current French film "Amelie." In
"Amelie," the mischievous heroine steals her father's garden gnome
and gives it to a flight attendant, who takes pictures of it near
various international landmarks and sends them to Amelie's perplexed
father.</TE>
<TE>   The "roaming gnome" prank goes back to 1986, according to "Curses!
Broiled Again! The Hottest Urban Legends Going" (W.W. Norton, 1989).
Author Jan Harold Brunvand writes that it sprung up simultaneously in
Australia and in England, where a group of traveling oil rig workers
temporarily appropriated a gnome and sent its owner postcards before
returning it to its yard with a suitcase, sunglasses and a tan.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the inspiration for the prank may have come from "The Red
Couch," a 1984 photo book by Kevin Clarke and Horst Wackerbarth that
pictured an enormous red velvet sofa in various precarious
situations--perched on a window washer's platform and sitting on an
offshore oil rig, among other things. In turn, "The Red Couch" may
have been influenced by California artist Eleanor Antin, who, in the
early '70s, photographed 100 black rubber boots in various scenarios
coast to coast--on their way to church, marching--and printed them on
postcards.</TE>
<TE>   It was "The Red Couch" that influenced Ed Vandenberg when he stole
a porcelain clown statue from his friends' porch about four years
ago. The Los Feliz artist and his then-girlfriend were looking for a
unique way to celebrate their friends' engagement.</TE>
<TE>   "We had seen the clown on their steps and thought, 'Yeah. Let's
have a little fun with them and their clown.' We just walked up,
grabbed the clown and ran," Vandenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   That was the beginning of the statue's three-month trek around Los
Angeles, visiting places that were romantically significant to their
newly engaged friends. The clown made stops at the kickball field
where the couple had met and at which they became engaged. It also
visited a karaoke bar and LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The clown eventually returned to the couple's doorstep,
accompanied by a photo album, though Vandenberg and his accomplice
didn't identify themselves as the thieves until about a week later.
Like most pranksters, they struggled to keep from spilling the beans
until the prank was over. "I'm not very good at keeping secrets,"
Vandenberg said. "I desperately wanted to say when I went up to the
house, 'Isn't something missing here?'"</TE>
<TE>   Biggie, who has the monkey, has found himself in a similar
predicament. He recently learned that the club where Miss Abby
performed, and where there was a photo wall devoted to Marvin's
travels, has gone out of business, leaving Biggie with a monkey but
nowhere to send his photos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really important to me that Abby is seeing the pictures,"
said Biggie, whose original plan included Marvin hitchhiking his way
back into Miss Abby's arms in South Carolina. "Much as I love doing
the project, it loses so much of its meaning if the woman who owns
the monkey isn't actually getting the pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Could it be time to return the monkey?</TE>

<LD>They are words I never thought I'd hear myself say: Close that book
and do your homework. Turn off the light and put the book away. Put
down that book and finish your dinner.</LD>
<LD>   And they lead to endless negotiations as my youngest daughter
pleads for "just one more minute; just until I finish this chapter,
this sentence, this paragraph ... please."</LD>
<LD>   I stifle a smile even as I scold her, delighted by the
maneuverings of a child who--like her mother--would rather read than
eat or sleep.</LD>
<TE>   But her passion sometimes has me at its mercy. How do you punish a
child whose infraction is reading ... in the car, in the bathroom, at
the kitchen table; when she's supposed to be getting dressed for
school, studying long division, putting away the dishes, brushing her
teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Banish her to her room, where books are lined up on the shelves,
stacked on the floor, tucked behind the bed and between the sheets?
Somehow I can't bring myself to say it: Go to your room, young lady.
You're being punished. And don't you dare pick up a book and read.</TE>
<TE>   It's another of those reminders that the reality of raising
children often bumps up against what you think you know.</TE>
<TE>   I raised my first two by the book, so to speak; perched on my lap
where they'd learn to read. Every bedtime brought a story, every week
a trip to the bookstore or the library. Dr. Seuss, "Pat the Bunny,"
"Goodnight Moon" ... all trusted friends from infancy.</TE>
<TE>   The result? One child considers Cliffs Notes a literary workout.
The other reads with one eye on the clock, so she can quit the moment
her required time is up.</TE>
<TE>   And what of their baby sister, who came of age in a household so
busy I seldom made time with her to read? At 11, she's read more
stories than either of her sisters; she devours books they can't find
time to read.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, maybe there were clues in her demeanor, her
affection for solitary pursuits, her ability to imbue even the most
pedestrian of objects with lives and personalities. As an infant, she
was an observer, who could entertain herself for hours just watching
her hands move in front of her eyes. At 2, she'd toddle around the
house carrying shoes and combs and pepper shakers, babbling to them
as if they were alive. By the time she started kindergarten, she was
directing elaborate exchanges among the dogs, her blankie, our Barbie
dolls.</TE>
<TE>   This was clearly a child with a vivid fantasy life, a robust inner
dialogue. Maybe it didn't matter what I did; she was wired at birth
for a love affair with words.</TE>
<TE>   For confirmation, I went to Reid Lyon, head of child development
and behavior for the National Institutes of Health. There are, he
agrees, some children who have a natural affinity for reading, "just
as there are naturally gifted athletes and naturally talented piano
players."</TE>
<TE>   But reading is essentially a skill that must be properly learned
and consistently practiced before it can be done proficiently.
"Children with active imaginations tend to gravitate to reading more,
because they get a good deal of fun out of it," he says. But
enthusiastic readers share other attributes as well. They are able to
read quickly and effortlessly, so plowing through a book doesn't feel
like a chore. And they have strong, broad vocabularies that let them
link the stories they read with their own worlds.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose my daughter has those traits, though I don't think I can
take the credit. She was the one I never drilled on phonics, never
put through the paces of a reading program, never force-fed lessons
on decoding. But her first-grade class had only 20 children, and a
teacher who taught them how to sound out words.</TE>
<TE>   And she was lucky enough to land last in our boisterous home,
where someone's always talking, there's an overflowing bookcase in
every room, and the only place to find silence is inside your head.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching children to read is our country's educational priority.
So say no less than our president and any number of celebrities.
We've settled on the science; now all that's left is to get books
into the hands of kids, so that everyone has enough to read.</TE>
<TE>   But how do you get them to love it? That's just as important as
the mechanics, but it happens more mysteriously.</TE>
<TE>   I don't remember when I began to love reading, but somehow through
the long summer days and sleepless nights of my youth, books became
my escape. I'd pedal my bike to the library, fill its wire basket
with books, then settle on our back porch to read. At night, when my
imagination made me too fretful to sleep, I'd draw books from the
rack outside my room ... medical books, travel brochures,
encyclopedias. They became my late-night salvation; I'd read almost
anything.</TE>
<TE>   Books today face such competition for kids' attention from the
computer, cable TV, video games, that the fact children choose to
read is really quite a testimony to our need to find ourselves in
others, to conceive of alternate realities, without limits on what we
can think, imagine and be.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, before we start hooking our kids on phonics and pointing
out that, "See, even Shaq and Britney Spears like to read," we ought
to try stoking their imaginations, because that's what will power
their desire to read.</TE>
<TE>   Read to them, yes. But listen, as well. Even the littlest children
have stories to tell. Stop teaching tiny hands to grip a mouse and
power through a computer program. Give them crayons and paper and
paint, and the freedom to create their own visions.</TE>
<TE>   Talk to them often from the time they are small, about anything
and everything. Let them see that language shapes our world, gives
structure to what we think and see and life to our imaginings.</TE>
<TE>   Let them see you relax with a book, so they perceive reading as a
pleasure unto itself, not just as a means to find an answer, complete
an assignment, please a teacher ... or Mom or Dad.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I shouldn't be so surprised by the way reading dominates my
daughter's life. How many times have I been holed up with a book when
I should have been sleeping or getting ready for church or making
lunch or ironing something?</TE>
<TE>   How many times have I heard my daughters say, "Put the book away,
Mommy. It's time to leave."</TE>

<LD>The 18th annual STAGE (Southland Theatre Artists Goodwill Event)
fund-raiser played to sold-out houses for its three performances,
paying tribute to one of America's most prolific and popular
lyricists, Johnny Mercer.</LD>
<LD>   "Dream," the benefit for AIDS projects held last weekend at the
Luckman Fine Arts Complex on the Cal State Los Angeles campus,
featured the works of Mercer, who wrote more than 1,000 songs,
received 18 Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars.</LD>
<LD>   "Mercer knew how to write words for every composer's style. He
could fit in with all of them, which is really a gift," said last
year's honoree, Jerry Herman, who was in the audience at the Saturday
night show along with longtime STAGE benefactors John Bowab, Jacque
Mapes, Charles Pollock, Jonathan Kanes and Naomi Caryl. Bowab was
awarded the 2002 STAGE Producers Award for his dedication to
AIDS-related programs.</LD>
<TE>   Director David Galligan and musical conductor Ron Abel assembled a
stellar roster of talent, which performed 34 Mercer classics such as
"Dream" (Petula Clark, Rod McKuen and Margaret Whiting), "That Old
Black Magic" (Loretta Devine), "Glow Worm" (Betty Garrett) and
"Hooray for Hollywood" (Carole Cook). Only a few of the stars had
ever met Mercer, who died in L.A. in 1976. Whiting, who serves as
president of the Johnny Mercer Foundation, remembered him well.
"We're working very hard to bring back the great ones like Mercer,"
she said. "Their music is the history of this country, and most young
people have never even heard of them."</TE>
<TE>   Other performers included Tyne Daly, Linda Purl, Sam Harris, Nancy
Dussault, Franc D'Ambrosio, Davis Gaines, Jason Graae, Linda Michele,
Sally Struthers, Bill Hutton, Jodi Stevens, Greg Poland and Kevin
Chamberlin.</TE>
<TE>   Caryl, Garrett and Michael Kearns co-chaired the event, which
netted more than $300,000 to be shared by AIDS Project Los Angeles
(APLA), the Neil Bogart Memorial Fund and Orange County's Laguna
Shanti.</TE>

<TE>   Salzburg Style</TE>
<TE>   The scene at Amanda and Nick Stonnington's San Marino home for a
dinner honoring the American Friends of the Salzburg Festival could
have been right out of the butter-cream world of Emperor Franz Josef.</TE>
<TE>   On the sweeping terrace of the 1925 Wallace Neff mansion, florist
Tommy Farmer canopied a transparent tent with swags of greenery and
Tivoli lights, and the tables sparkled with silver, napery, St. Louis
crystal and Hermes porcelain.</TE>
<TE>   The stars of last Sunday's Gemutlichkeit were two guys named
Wolfgang. The musical menu was mostly Mozart performed by members of
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (accompanied by a neighbor's pooch,
who managed to bark on beat). In the kitchen, chef Wolfgang Puck
orchestrated a lavish menu for 130 guests. It included his Trio
salad, roasted loin of veal with chanterelles and, for dessert,
buttermilk cake with creme fraiche and strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner reservations for the fete were $1,000, but the price
included perks such as travel assistance for the festival, which
opens July 27 and continues through August in Salzburg. Benefit
chairs were Brigitta Troy and the Stonningtons.</TE>
<TE>   Attendees included Richard Colborn, Jennifer and Royce Diener,
Ernest Fleischmann, Joan Hotchkis, Clemens Hells- berg, Anthony
Knerr, Tom Blumenthal, Robin Geerts, Thea and Thomas Gottschalk,
Betty Freeman, Jane Gray Morrison, Helga Rabi-Stadler, Adelaide
Hixon, Colleen and Javier Baz, Alyce Williamson, and Annette and

<TE>   St. Jude's at 40</TE>
<TE>   It's been 40 years since the late comedian Danny Thomas kept a
solemn promise made during his salad days: to erect a shrine to the
patron saint of hopeless causes, St. Jude Thaddeus. St. Jude Hospital
in Memphis, Tenn., has grown from a one-building facility into a
renowned research center that annually provides free treatment to
4,000 children suffering from life-threatening illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 guests helped celebrate the 40th anniversary of
the Thomas legacy at the Hollywood Gala for St. Jude at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel, which raised $1 million for the hospital's endowment
fund. For the first time, Marlo Thomas missed the Hollywood benefit,
but her husband, Phil Donahue, co-emceed along with Marlo's brother
and sister, Tony and Terre Thomas. Comedienne Rita Rudner and
blues-rocker Melissa Etheridge entertained.</TE>
<TE>   Attendees included Jim Carrey, Daisy Fuentes, John Ritter, Gary
Oldman, Jay Thomas, David James Elliott, David Leisure, Dylan
McDermott, Jane Kaczmarek, Bradley Whitford, Amber Valetta, Carrie
Fisher, Thora Birch, Courteney Cox Arquette and Crystal Bernard.</TE>

<TE>   Easy Money</TE>
<TE>   Decked out in aviator shades and black leather duds, actor Peter
Fonda looked like he'd just hopped off a Harley when he mingled with
supporters of the Orange County Performing Arts Center at its Easy
Rider Returns-themed gala.</TE>
<TE>   Fonda, who starred in the 1969 biker classic with Jack Nicholson
and Dennis Hopper, told hundreds of guests attending the benefit at
the Four Seasons in Newport Beach that fund-raising for the arts
significantly affects a community. "When you think of Omaha, Neb.,
you don't think of the arts, but it was there in a playhouse
supported by the community that my father [Henry] began his career,"
he said. "That support helped broaden the minds of its residents."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the center's Sound of Music support group--sporting
biker-wear silhouettes that ranged from hot pants and cropped jackets
to trench coats and neck stoles--dined on filet mignon and crab cakes
at tables topped with miniature Harleys.</TE>
<TE>   Patsy Marshall and Diane Palumbo were co-chairwomen of the March
10 gala, which raised about $170,000. Guests also included Sound of
Music chairwoman Sally Crockett (a sister-in-law of Fonda's); Randy
Crockett; Arthur Voss; Kelly and John Hague; Harriet and Sandy
Sandhu; Kimberly and Ross Feinberg; and Robin Rae and Delvan Lewis.</TE>

<TE>   Students from the Orange County High School of the Arts performed
before a sold-out crowd of 650 guests at the "Night at the Copa" gala
in the Hyatt Regency Irvine. Singing and dancing on a stage ringed
with plastic pink flamingos, arts students entertained the crowd with
polished renditions of "Too Darn Hot" and "The Copacabana."</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the March 10 event, which included a silent auction,
were more than $200,000. Sandra McGovern was event chairwoman.</TE>

Things" commended league members for their support of community
projects for children.</TE>
<TE>   His secret to longevity? Besides having an exercise regimen,
curiosity and a sense of humor, it's cultivating a positive attitude,
he said. "You can't stop the hardening of the arteries, but you can
stop the hardening of the attitudes." Proceeds from the March 9
luncheon were about $80,000. Kelly Ringer was chairwoman.</TE>

<AU>RICK BASS</AU>
<BD>Rick Bass is the author of "Colter: The True Story of
the Best Dog I Ever Had" and the forthcoming "The Hermit's Story." He
lives and writes in Montana's Kootenai National Forest.</BD>
<DL>KOOTENAI NATIONAL FOREST, Mont.</DL>
<LD>The little mountain known as Roderick Butte possesses a magical
little forest, one of the rare uncut stands left in the lowest
elevations of Montana's Yaak Valley. Reefs of clouds drape themselves
over its peak, and artesian seeps and springs percolate out of the
steep east-facing mountain wall, home to sensitive and threatened
plants. The cliffs blush with maple and larch in the autumn. Wild
ducks nest in the hanging marshes, salamanders wriggle beneath
rotting logs and the area is favored by one of only two breeding
female grizzly bears known to be left on the entire 2-million-acre
Kootenai National Forest. (I know of one old dead tree standing
halfway up the mountain that is a territorial signpost for grizzlies,
like some kind of bear-carved totem.)</LD>
<TE>   An incredibly diverse flora clings to Roderick Butte's steep face,
which rises above the clear trout-filled waters of the South Fork of
the Yaak: big Douglas fir, alpine fir, spruce, hemlock, cedar, aspen,
cottonwood, larch, lodge pole pine, as well as amazing old white pine
along the ridge. The mountain's smooth uncut contours and dense blue
forests are a visual reference, a landmark in the days of our lives
around here. Nestled near the junctions of the Idaho, Montana and
British Columbia borders, this mountain, and the ones around it, are
more Pacific Northwest in nature than northern Rockies. This is the
lowest, westernmost part of Montana. Lush and diverse--Montana's
rainforest.</TE>
<TE>   All forests are supposed to burn from time to time. A healthy
forest needs its occasional fires--to thin the weak and overstocked
trees and recycle the forest's nutrients--every bit as much as it
needs its snows and rain. So, while it was alarming when nearly
12,000 acres burned in the Kootenai National Forest during the summer
of 2000, it was not tragic. The tragic part is what might come next.</TE>
<TE>   I belong to a conservation group known as the Yaak Valley Forest
Council, a small--and extraordinarily moderate--collection of people
who love this forest. Our group is made up of road builders and
loggers as well as more traditional "tree huggers," and we wanted to
be involved in bringing the forest back after the fire. We
deliberately refrained from involving the news media, choosing
instead to focus on working at the local level to find common
solutions to our concerns. We didn't think it would be difficult. But
then we hadn't counted on the new mentality at the U.S. Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   When forests burn, it makes sense to salvage the damaged trees for
timber, as long as that can be done without entering our last few
roadless areas or working in other fragile places that might have
already been disturbed by the fire. Environmentally sensitive logging
operations have utilized helicopters and have also harvested trees in
winter, on top of the snow instead of on the ashen ground, which is
vulnerable to slumping and erosion. Taking the burned trees, while
leaving the strongest--the survivors--can be good forest stewardship,
and can help reduce the accumulation of excessive fuel loads.</TE>
<TE>   Forest management is complicated stuff, with many factors still
unknown by even the experts, and particularly so in a changing
climate. But the Bush administration, with the same all-or-nothing,
bull-in-a-china-shop mentality it has displayed in the Arctic
wilderness and elsewhere, seems not to grasp this complexity, nor
does it seem interested in the opportunities for finding common
ground with environmentalists and rural communities.</TE>
<TE>   The Yaak Valley Forest Council wasn't asking for anything radical.
We supported the harvest of burned trees, where appropriate. Unburned
trees we wanted left standing. In addition to being precisely the
kind of trees whose genes should be passed along, these survivors
serve valuable ecological functions in preserving soil stability and
water quality. And they possess a breathtaking dignity, standing
vibrant, green and strong amid a blackened landscape. We hired two
independent ecologists, who found that about eight trees per acre
survived the burn--generally the largest trees with the thickest
bark. But the Forest Service is nevertheless advocating a giant
clear-cut of more than 130 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Forest Service's own rules allow for a formal appeals
process for groups like ours, we elected at first to work more
collaboratively. We approached the Forest Service, offered them our
research--even offered ways of providing the same number of trees for
logging without clear-cutting. And we were flatly turned down by the
Kootenai Forest supervisor, Bob Castaneda. Now, as a matter of
conviction, we are in the time-consuming and cumbersome process of
formally appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Our small battle for the soul of one small forest wouldn't mean
much but for what it reveals about the current administration's
approach to conservation. President Bush, let's remember, made a
campaign promise to put much of the nation's 700 million acres of
public lands "back to work." Since taking office, he has pursued an
aggressive policy of more logging, more mining and more drilling on
the public wild lands. The new chief of the Forest Service, Dale
Bosworth, has referred to requests by environmentalists as a form of
"analysis paralysis." The simple fact is, the new Forest Service
views the land as there to serve industry's short-term needs and
desires--not as a sacred trust to be preserved and nurtured for
future generations.</TE>
<TE>   As we found, their ideology makes them unwilling to compromise, or
better still to work together as a team. Once again, as in the days
of Ronald Reagan and former Interior Secretary James Watt, the West
is up for grabs. How inefficient--what utter waste--to be fighting
over such scraps of ideology and treasured remnants of landscape,
rather than focusing our energies in partnership with the Forest
Service on less sensitive, and more productive, areas. Since
Castaneda couldn't find common ground with us, we're left in what his
boss might see as analysis paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   But I have an idea. Chief Bosworth and Supervisor Castaneda, why
don't you come on out to Roderick Butte. Hike out across the disputed
acres, and you'll see something amazing: Some trees survive some
fires. You won't have to look it up in a book. You can walk out on
the land and see it. If you hurry.</TE>

<AU>BARBARA A. BRENNER</AU>
<BD>Barbara A. Brenner is the executive director of Breast
Cancer Action, a national grass-roots education and advocacy
organization based in San Francisco.</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Last month, in an attempt to resolve the roiling debate over whether
healthy women should have routine mammography screening, the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force announced flatly that "mammography
reduces deaths from breast cancer." It would be nice if the issue
were that simple. It's not. Some studies have suggested that
screening mammography saves lives; others have found it does not. One
thing is clear, however: The debate is drowning out other important
discussion.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the billions of dollars invested in mammography
screening and the vested interest that the U.S. government and many
organizations have in it, the mammography controversy will never die.
But many women will--unless we make some real progress in breast
cancer beyond mammography, and unless everyone diagnosed with breast
cancer has access to advances in treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The recent debate about mammography screening masks the real issue
in breast cancer diagnosis: the value of early detection. Women are
routinely told that early detection is their best protection, as
breast cancer found early is almost 100% curable. The basis for the
"almost 100%" figure is that 95% of women diagnosed by screening
mammograms are alive five years after diagnosis. Being cancer-free
for five years is considered a cure for some cancers, but breast
cancer can and does recur at any time.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, breast-cancer awareness campaigns urging women to have
yearly mammograms are based on a flawed premise. Women diagnosed
early with breast cancer fall into one of three groups. The first
group has a very aggressive disease that, no matter how small a tumor
is when it is found, cannot be effectively treated with current
therapies. These women will die of breast cancer no matter what
treatment they are given, unless something else kills them first.</TE>
<TE>   The second group has a type of either non-aggressive (indolent)
invasive disease or a kind of cancer called "ductal carcinoma in
situ" that, left untreated, will never be life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The third group responds to currently available treatments, and
finding breast cancer earlier does increase the likelihood that
treatment will work for them.</TE>
<TE>   Given these divisions and the treatments currently available,
early detection only matters for women in the latter group. We have
no way of tracking how many women historically have fallen into each
of these three groups, and we have no way of figuring out at the time
of diagnosis which group a woman belongs to. The result is that we
mistreat or over-treat a lot of women diagnosed with breast cancer in
our effort to help the others. In the end, women are left simply to
pray that they are in that lucky treatment-responsive group.</TE>
<TE>   Until we have a way of distinguishing those who will be helped by
treatment from those who won't, there are better ways to spend
limited resources than on developing methods of ever-earlier breast
cancer detection.</TE>
<TE>   Resources could be well used today, for example, on making sure
that women--and men--diagnosed with breast cancer have access to the
most current information about treatment, as well as to the medical
care necessary to take advantage of that information. While the
public's attention is focused on the mammography controversy, a woman
is being diagnosed with potentially life-threatening breast cancer
every 3 minutes in this country, whether by mammogram, breast
self-exam or clinical breast exam. With each diagnosis, another
person enters a world filled with more questions than answers.</TE>
<TE>   The answers available to a new member of the dreaded breast-cancer
sorority are likely to be determined by her available resources.
Well-educated women are far more likely to do the kind of research
necessary to take advantage of new treatment developments. Women
living in major urban areas, where the big cancer centers are
typically located, have better access to up-to-the-minute information
and treatment than folks who live in suburban or rural areas. While
we can't be sure that any currently available treatment will "cure" a
given case of breast cancer, we do know that there are some things
that will reduce the harm caused by those treatments--if a woman
knows about them.</TE>
<TE>   Take the example of axillary lymph node dissection. This is the
process of removing lymph nodes under the arm on the side of a
woman's body adjacent to the affected breast. The purpose of removing
these lymph nodes is to assess whether cancer cells have spread into
them, thus indicating a greater likelihood that the cancer will
spread to life-sustaining organs. (Breast cancer in your breast can't
kill; it's breast cancer that spreads to other organs or to bones
that does.) The problem is that removing a large number of lymph
nodes increases the risk of lymphedema, a serious and debilitating
condition characterized by swelling and pain.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that there is now a procedure called "sentinel
lymph node biopsy" that can reduce the number of lymph nodes that
need to be removed. By removing and examining the one or two lymph
nodes leading from the breast to the arm pit, doctors can learn
whether cancer cells are likely to spread to other parts of the body
without removing large numbers of nodes from under the arm. Reducing
the number of lymph nodes that are removed lessens the chance of
lymphedema.</TE>
<TE>   But to take advantage of this procedure, women often have to ask
for it--which means they have to know about it. Access to information
is critical. A woman also needs to be sure that her doctor has
performed enough sentinel lymph node biopsies to be proficient at
them, which again comes back to access to good medical care. Whether
women have access to information and care is too often a function of
where they live and how much money and other resources they have
available.</TE>
<TE>   Even with access to sentinel node biopsies, many women are likely
to face a dilemma posed by the procedure itself. Some researchers are
beginning to question whether chemotherapy is necessary when only a
few cancer cells are found in a sentinel node. But researchers don't
make treatment decisions, women with breast cancer do.</TE>
<TE>   The issues posed by axillary node dissection are among the first
faced by women with breast cancer who have access to information and
treatment choices. But whether the issues are related to surgery,
radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or alternative or
complementary treatments, each treatment decision is filled with
similar dilemmas. Every woman should have the information and access
necessary to address these challenges. It's time we moved past the
mammography dilemma to make sure that they do.</TE>

<LD>The Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review, disclosed recently in The
Times, raised a fierce outcry in the international press. The nations
targeted for possible preemptive nuclear strikes--Russia, China,
North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya--were predictably outraged.
But U.S. allies--from South Korea to tiny Papua New Guinea--were also
concerned, warning that U.S. nuclear brinkmanship would put the world
at risk. What follows is a sampling of opinion from foreign
newspapers. (Compiled by Gale Holland)</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   AUSTRALIA</LD>
<TE>   What does [the Nuclear Posture Review] say to the rest of the
international community? It says that nonproliferation of nuclear
weapons is a mug's game, and that we should all get our hands on the
damnable things.</TE>
<TE>   --Andy Butfoy, The Age</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CANADA</TE>
<TE>   If any other country but the U.S. started talking about launching
preemptive strikes on nonnuclear players, Bush would be furiously
denouncing it as an "axis of evil," a rogue state, or worse ....What
reason do the countries on the Pentagon hit list for "preemptive"
attack now have to show restraint? Either way, they are targets. And
if the Americans, even with their devastating conventional arsenal,
feel justified in dropping a "small" nuclear bomb down some Iraqi
bunker, why should lesser players not want to incinerate their foes'
major cities?</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Toronto Star</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHINA</TE>
<TE>   The new U.S. strategy is a "full-spectrum" strategy of military
deterrence, oriented at all possible future foes as well as an excuse
for the establishment of all-round military superiority ....Once the
United States gets rid of the fear of nuclear reprisal from countries
with a few nuclear weapons, the possible use of U.S. nuclear weapons
in real combat will be further augmented.</TE>
<TE>   --Zhu Qiangguo, China Daily</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Will [Vice President Dick] Cheney [during his trip abroad] grasp
the perception common outside the U.S. that never has a nation
squandered sympathy and moral advantage so quickly and with such
wantonness? And if he does, will he care? Does America mind becoming
a global hate figure? What happens to the mentality of a country when
it's not loved, only feared? What patterns of aggressive
defensiveness take root? These are the questions that trigger anxiety
....It is not so much Islamist hijackers as U.S. bombs that make the
world feel a precarious place.</TE>
<TE>   --Madeline Bunting, The Guardian</TE>
<TE>   The dangers of a nuclear war have never been greater. Because this
is no longer a Cold War. It's hotter than hell, and it's only too
real.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Daily Star</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FRANCE</TE>
<TE>   It will be said, to reassure us--in vain--that the job of military
planners ... is to foresee the worst eventualities and the means to
respond to them.... Nevertheless, the revelation ... of a [Nuclear
Posture Review] sends chills up the spine. It reveals a Bush
administration that has drawn only military conclusions from Sept.
11....It uproots the principle of atomic nonproliferation. Why sign,
or remain signatory to, a treaty which, in exchange for your absolute
renunciation of nuclear arms, does not guarantee that they will not
be used against you? In invoking the possibility of a first strike,
it accepts as normal the idea of putting to use a weapon that was
originally conceived as a deterrent. The Pentagon document is worthy
of a state in the grip of panic; not of a world power conscious of
its responsibilities. It is frightening.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Le Monde</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GERMANY</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatic niceties have never been George W. Bush's strong
suit.... But what became known [last week] topped everything that
came before it. In a 56-page secret report, Bush's military developed
sweeping plans for a future nuclear war ....The new plans ... are
creating unease in the entire world."</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Der Spiegel</TE>
<TE>   "For the non-atomic weapons states in NATO this development is
especially explosive. At least six of them, including Germany, are
obliged, in the framework of the alliance's internal system "nuclear
participation," to make available missiles that could be armed with
American nuclear weapons....The [German] government wants to avoid
having "nuclear participation" even come up for discussion. But a
debate is more urgent than ever.</TE>

<TE>   IRAN</TE>
<TE>   Like King George III, who misjudged the Boston events and lost the
American colonies, God-willing, President Bush will preside over the
end of the U.S. as a world power, but not [before] he creates more
catastrophes for other civilizations.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the world is prepared to pay the price for peace
without being cowed by American contingency plans for use of nuclear
weapons. After all, the Americans manufactured the atom bomb to use,
as they so criminally demonstrated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945,
and not for keeping weapons of mass destruction in a showcase as
pieces of aesthetic art.</TE>
<TE>   --S. Nawabzadeh, Kayhan International</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IRELAND</TE>
<TE>   European nations--Britain, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium,
Spain, Russia--with long memories of the ultimate fate of
overreaching empires are understandably uneasy. May God bless the
coalition, said President Bush yesterday, in a strategic variation on
God Bless America. May God bless and preserve us all is a reasonable
prayer as the consequences of Sept. 11 take us ever more rapidly into
a downward spiral of international violence.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Belfast News</TE>

<TE>   NEW ZEALAND</TE>
<TE>   These days, when the going gets sticky, the fashionable
smokescreen for the squirming politician or chief executive is to
blame it on Sept. 11 .... In Washington, it was the excuse needed to
draw up a nuclear hit list of unloved countries; in Tel Aviv, it gave
the chance to tighten the noose around Palestine.</TE>

<TE>   New Zealand Herald</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PAKISTAN</TE>
<TE>   The leaked Pentagon Nuclear Posture Review's ... most important,
but generally overlooked, aspect is that it raises the nuclear
threshold to a new level. It suggests that the U.S. should be
prepared to use nuclear weapons in case an ally is attacked even with
conventional weapons, as in the possible scenario of an Arab-Israeli
conflict or an attack from North Korea on South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   --Tahir Mirza, Dawn</TE>

<TE>   PAPUA NEW GUINEA</TE>
<TE>   Here's a chilling thought for the day: If the U.S. budget
appropriations for defense and military expenditure currently before
Congress are approved, Uncle Sam will shortly preside over a defense
budget that is significantly bigger than the defense budgets of all
other countries in the world combined. Perhaps the word "defense"
should be redefined.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, The National</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUTH KOREA</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and his nuclear strategists must not brush aside
the deeply perturbed voices of those who advise them to throw out
highly dangerous ideas. Their "posture" is not only imprudent but
also menacing in a manner least becoming their unchallenged status as
the world's only superpower--militarily and otherwise .... One reason
we are painfully involved in the issue, of course, is because North
Korea is one of America's perceived targets of nuclear warfare. In
spite of the North's notorious unpredictability and diplomatic
brinkmanship, this is no time for the United States to discourage the
very faint signs of change from the poverty-ridden communist state.
It would be much wiser to salvage old treaties signed by the North
and the United States or South Korea, that address weapons of mass
destruction and seek ways to get them to work better.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Korea Herald</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon wants to use nuclear weapons on a battlefield level,
which creates far more opportunities to use the weapon of last
resort. For example, they could have dropped a nuclear shell into the
Tora Bora caves, and given the worst possible example to the two most
recent nuclear states, Pakistan and India. Both these states would
have drawn the lesson that tactical use of nuclear weapons was
acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear weapons are too awful to contemplate as part of the normal
armory of any nation because the destruction they offer is so total
and all embracing. The Cold War is over, and the balance of terror is
not required. Better understanding between nations is far more
effective than aiming nuclear weapons at friends.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To counter the first economic downturn of the millennium, politicians
have put forth a spate of proposals to jump-start the economy. In a
bit of revisionist history, President Bush defended his huge tax cut
as stimulative. Then he claimed in his budget proposal, also laden
with tax-cut ideas, that "further fiscal stimulus was needed to
prevent a worsening of the recession." After bemoaning a raid on the
Social Security lock-box, Democrats quickly geared up to pile on
their own spending measures. And on March 9, the bipartisan
fiscal-stimulus package was signed into law.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the dirty little secret: It appears there wasn't a
recession after all. The six economists who make up the dismally
named but highly influential business-cycle dating committee, working
out of the National Bureau of Economic Research and charged with
calling a recession when they see one, may have gotten it wrong.
Theirs could prove to be an extremely costly mistake, because there
are hundreds of billions of dollars in the pipeline to rev up an
economy that may not need revving.</LD>
<TE>   The standard definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters
of negative economic growth. In November 2001, when the committee
declared that the economy had slipped into recession last March,
things did look bleak. Gross domestic product had shrunk by 1.1% in
the third quarter. In the wake of Sept. 11, consumer confidence was
down, the stock market exhibited few signs of life and personal
savings rates hovered near zero.</TE>
<TE>   But despite all the appearances, the economy was actually moving.
Data from the Commerce Department show that in the final quarter of
2001, the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.4%. While the
recession-dating economists don't rely on GDP to make their calls
since the numbers come out quarterly and are subject to large
revisions, the single quarter decline is noteworthy. Furthermore,
productivity growth in the quarter was quite impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with the exception of industrial production, all the major
indicators that the recession-dating committee relies on tell a
different story than that of your standard recession. While 1.2
million jobs have melted away, the percentage decline in the
workforce is modest by historical standards. Also, the unemployment
rate may have peaked at 5.8%, a level not uncommon for
non-recessionary periods. Since the committee views employment as the
single most reliable indicator, these numbers alone should cause it
to reconsider its earlier assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Even more unusual, the decline in retail sales has been just 4.1%,
compared with an average drop in the past five recessions of 7.4%,
and almost all that occurred in September. Since then, sales have
rebounded strongly. Most confounding is that income has risen
steadily throughout the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   But the act of labeling the economy "in recession" may itself have
endangered the recovery because politicians have used it to justify
policies that under normal circumstances would be considered an
outright assault on fiscal discipline. Just take the startling
deterioration in the federal budget, which has abruptly gone from
projected surplus to projected deficit.</TE>
<TE>   On repeated occasions, President Bush said he was committed to
saving Social Security's surpluses, except in the instance of war or
recession. Now, he's got both, and he's no longer afraid of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Had the recession never been so labeled, perhaps Democrats would
have been more forceful in opposing the return to deficits. Instead,
not wanting to appear unsympathetic to the hardships recessions can
cause, they have shed the pretense of being the guardians of
responsible budgeting and are advocating a host of new spending
initiatives, uttering not a word on how to pay for them. All this
under the guise of further fiscal stimulus to revive the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the fiscal stimulus package itself. Had the
recession ever materialized, this package would probably have been
deemed "too little, too late." But given what we now know, it is
better labeled "too much, not needed." The package, which will infuse
$51 billion into the economy this year and as much as $75 billion
over the following three, primarily through corporate tax cuts, will
drain the U.S. Treasury for years.</TE>
<TE>   The result of the growing deficit is likely to be higher interest
rates, which will dampen a number of economic sectors, including
business investment and housing, not to mention higher taxes to repay
the debt and balance the budget in the future. Certainly, spending
the Social Security surpluses will make dealing with the program's
woes all the harder. And if these measures have their desired
stimulative effect, they may stoke inflation, causing the Federal
Reserve Board to raise interest rates more quickly than it otherwise
would.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is not the only sector to have overspent in
response to the recession call. Articles, commentators and
politicians repeatedly reminded consumers--reprimanded them
almost--that since consumer spending constitutes two-thirds of GDP,
they had better spend if a deeper recession was to be avoided--and
they did. As a result, consumers' financial situations look
precarious. Personal saving rates have not improved, total consumer
credit stands at $1.7 trillion and there were nearly 1.5 million
bankruptcies in 2001, a record that may be surpassed this year. When
consumers do retrench, as they must, the change may be more
destabilizing to the economy than if they had ignored the calls to
spend more.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, to the six recession watchers, it must have seemed virtually
inconceivable that the correction in business over-investment in the
late 1990s would not have spilled over into the economy as a whole.
In the past, such drops in production have correlated with similar
declines in employment, personal income and retail sales. Also, it
seemed a sure bet that consumers would stop spending after Sept. 11.
High levels of uncertainty, not to mention outright fear, normally
don't precede consumption binges.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in possibly calling the recession prematurely, the
recession-dating committee broke its own rules. Typically, members
wait until hard data confirm a significant and widespread downturn.
Never before have they declared a recession when declines in
employment, sales and income were so small. The first recession of
the millennium may go down in history as the recession that never
was, but the consequence of that mistake--deficits--will not be
imaginary.</TE>

<HD>A Bullish Diplomacy</HD>
<DH>U.S. rhetoric and anti-terrorism goals have sent our allies
running for cover--but they will be back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER RUSSELL MEAD</AU>
<BD>Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author
of "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed
the World."</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>America's war on terrorism is scaring the world silly. From President
Bush's phrase "axis of evil" to Pentagon plans for disinformation and
nuclear targeting, to U.S. determination to get Saddam Hussein out of
power to deploying troops from Yemen to the Philippines, U.S. foreign
policy has pundits and politicians worldwide reaching for words like
"unilateral" and "simplistic." With the global chattering classes in
revolt against U.S. policy, even the stiff upper lip of a staunch
ally like Britain is quivering, and some Americans are wondering
whether the world and the U.S. will part company over the war.</LD>
<LD>   We should all take a couple of deep breaths and relax. Relations
between the U.S. and its allies are nowhere near as bad as they
appear to be. The U.S. isn't about to go off on an irresponsible tear
of cowboy diplomacy, and our key allies aren't going to leave us in
the lurch. While the world press is hyperventilating about splits in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a crisis in relations
between the United States and the other great powers, the underlying
logic of America's strategic approach to the war on terrorism will
win increasing support as other countries think matters through.</LD>
<TE>   This is an old pattern in the Western alliance. From the decision
to rearm West Germany to the introduction of short-range missiles in
Europe, from President Harry S. Truman's intervention in Korea to
President Ronald Reagan's denunciation of the Soviet Union as an evil
empire, virtually every U.S. strategic initiative in the Cold War set
off cries about cowboy diplomacy and simplistic unilateralism. Tens
and sometimes hundreds of thousands of anti-American students marched
in the streets; famous intellectuals wrote eloquent manifestoes;
political parties adopted pacifistic planks in their platforms;
pundits wrote long articles about the new crisis in the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the alliance held together. The Americans weren't
always right (think Vietnam), and the Europeans didn't always fall in
line (they still don't, for example, support the economic embargo
against Cuba). Nevertheless, when push came to shove, the United
States and its key allies stuck together for more than 50 years--and
this latest crisis is almost certainly going to end the same way.
Relations in the alliance have been especially strained this time
because the war on terrorism pushes all the allied buttons in the
wrong way. Change, strong U.S. leadership and war: These are the
three things our allies hate most, and the war on terrorism involves
them all.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is more likely than not that when and if U.S. forces go
into Iraq, they will have a reasonable degree of support from a
reasonable number of our key allies. It won't be unanimous, and it
won't all be ungrudging or unlimited, but that is the way it should
be. The United States maintains networks of alliances; it does not
govern an empire. Our allies are and should be free to chart their
own international courses. After all, the United States and its
allies share the same basic goals. With Hussein out of the way, U.S.
troops can leave Saudi Arabia. Israel, freed from its fear of Iraq
and its weapons of mass destruction, will undoubtedly find it easier
to compromise with the Palestinians. Palestinian radicals and Arab
rejectionists will lose much support and prestige with a new
demonstration of U.S. power and will, strengthening the hands of
those within the Palestinian leadership who are ready to deal
seriously for peace.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, by dealing with Iraq, the U.S. will be doing
exactly what the allies keep telling the U.S. they wish it would
do--attack the root causes of terrorism in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   There is something else the world has not yet come to grips with.
Although the U.S. is widely accused of unilateralism, the whole
purpose of getting rid of Hussein is to support the most important
goal of multilateral diplomacy today: preventing the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Hussein is not only defying the United
Nations Security Council by refusing to admit arms inspectors into
Iraq; he is flagrantly violating international treaty obligations
about nuclear nonproliferation.</TE>
<TE>   His defiance presents the international community with a clear
choice. If nothing is done, the whole system of international arms
control and nonproliferation will become a dead letter. That is what
happened to the League of Nations, predecessor to the U.N., when
Italian dictator Benito Mussolini defied it by attacking Ethiopia in
1935. If Hussein's defiance of his treaty and cease-fire obligations
stands, international agreements on any subject (the environment,
human rights, labor standards) also become weak, if not worthless. As
the American public loses faith in the power of international
agreements, U.S. foreign policy will become increasingly unilateral.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Bush administration's hawkishness on Iraq is the
last, best hope of all who believe that verifiable international
treaties are the world's best defense against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. There are two reasons why U.S. opinion
is ahead of the curve on these issues. First, the shock of Sept. 11
created a wartime atmosphere in the United States. Second, the
experience of leading the Cold War alliances makes U.S. opinion more
comfortable with strategic thinking and hard military options.</TE>
<TE>   As U.S. officials spend time with their counterparts abroad, the
Western alliance is beginning to move closer to the U.S. view.
Already, some governments are looking at how to prepare their publics
to support participation in the next phase of the war on terrorism.
The Bush administration can accelerate the formation of a new
alliance consensus by paying more attention to the international
effects of its rhetoric. Bush's "axis of evil" phrase, for example,
was technically accurate but politically unwise. The three countries
linked to the axis of evil--Iraq, Iran and North Korea--have long
records of support for international terrorism, and they are all
trying to develop nuclear and/or other weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good. But many people (at least some of whom should
have known better) thought that by lumping these countries in one
basket, the president was saying that the U.S. had the same policy
toward all three. Much of world's public genuinely fear that the U.S.
intends to put the same kind of pressures on Iran and North Korea
that it proposes for Iraq. Nothing could be farther from the truth,
but two months after Bush first uttered the phrase, Americans abroad
are still scrambling to explain what the president meant.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has done a good job
formulating U.S. response to the unprecedented and dangerous
international situation. Now it needs to communicate its policies
more effectively to an anxious but still open-minded international
audience. As it does so, the allies that have rallied to our side in
every great international crisis of the last 60 years will join us
once again in the common effort to make the world safe and free.</TE>

<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For U.S. Latinos, more than two-thirds of whom are either immigrants
or the children of immigrants, the past decade has been a period of
firsts. Every week or so, it seems, there is a story about the first
Latino to do this or that. But the cultural significance of these
history-making feats is not always profound. Actually, it's mostly
skin deep.</LD>
<LD>   Last Tuesday, Tony Sanchez, a $600-million oilman who traces his
Southwestern roots to 18th-century Spain, made history by defeating
Dan Morales, a third-generation Mexican American former state
attorney general, to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in
Texas. Latino voter turnout in the state reached a historic high, and
heavily Hispanic South Texas precincts went for Sanchez by a margin
of 3 to 1.</LD>
<LD>   More telling, yet definitely less glamorous, the Sanchez-Morales
contest was part and parcel of a broader trend--the mainstreaming of
Mexican American politics. No longer content to play supporting
roles, Latino candidates throughout the Southwest are diversifying
their political portfolios, expanding their electoral bases and
making statewide bids for office. For all the attention paid to
Sanchez and Morales' ethnicity, in the end, the self-financed
candidate who saturated the airwaves with ads drowned the candidate
with more experience but little money.</LD>
<TE>   The high point of the near-issueless but ethnically charged race
was a Spanish-language gubernatorial debate, which the national press
quickly called historic. But the event's broader significance was far
from clear. For one, the exchange was largely symbolic since the
majority of Latino voters in Texas receive their political news in
English. Furthermore, the candidates' reasons for debating had more
to do with gaining political advantage than with fundamental cultural
shifts. For the fluently bilingual Sanchez, who resides in the
bicultural border city of Laredo, the debate was an opportunity to
embarrass San Antonio-born, Harvard-educated Morales, who taught
himself Spanish for his race for attorney general. For Morales, who
accepted the invitation to debate, then charged that it was socially
divisive, it was a platform to paint Sanchez as an ethnic chauvinist
and to pander to white voters' fears of the state's growing Latino
presence.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers claimed that the clash between the candidates
flowed from their distinct models of Mexican American assimilation.
But that interpretation was several levels too elevated. Race and
language were merely weapons in each candidate's attempt to wound the
other. During the debate, for example, Sanchez accused Morales of
being ashamed of being Hispanic. Morales then aired TV ads accusing
Sanchez of running for governor of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It was never a question of who was more Latino," says St. Mary's
University lecturer Andy Hernandez. "It was a question of who
presented [himself] as being on the Latinos' side." After all, if
Latino voters were offended by Morales' degree of assimilation, they
would not have given him their overwhelming support in his previous
electoral bids. In California, many Mexican American officials--Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante among them--would have had an even more
difficult time than Morales did debating in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   More than a few L.A. politicians, including Democratic Assemblyman
Gil Cedillo, have taken language courses in Cuernavaca, Mexico, to
better communicate with their immigrant constituents. Lack of fluency
in Spanish has not hurt them with Latino voters. But in the Texas
race, the Morales campaign attacked the use of Spanish in public
business and impugned the Americanness of those who defied him. In
response, one Austin columnist suggested that Morales was Spanish for
Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   For political observers and Latino activists eager to revel in the
history of the moment, such rhetoric was a keen disappointment.
"They're acting like two white guys," lamented Ross Ramsey, editor of
Texas Weekly, a political newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Others long ago concluded that the Latinization of politics simply
means a change in cast. "I don't understand why anybody expects
Latinos to be different than anyone else," said San Antonio
Express-News columnist Carlos Guerra. "Texas politics is a
full-contact sport. Now it's a full-contact sport in two languages."</TE>
<TE>   Although a major party's nomination of a Latino candidate for
Texas governor was historic, it was far from revolutionary. "This
race was part of a continuum that has been building over the years,"
said Antonio Gonzalez of the Southwest Voter Registration Project.
"It is another benchmark in the evolution of Latino political
participation."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the winner of this historic Latino Democratic campaign is
a friend and major donor to President Bush. The loser was a Mexican
American running on a not-so-subtle anti-Latino message. "How much
more mainstream can you get?" asked Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to say that Mexican Americans will not influence
the way U.S. politics is played in the future. Other identifiable
national minorities have certainly left their imprint on regional
politics.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, when the boisterous Jesse Ventura won the governorship of
Minnesota on the Reform Party ticket, some declared the end of the
state's Scandinavian-dominated political heritage. But they forgot
that it was progressive Norwegian immigrants that gave the state its
penchant for third-party populism in the first place. One in two
Wisconsin residents is of German heritage, and some think the state's
culture of good government is a Teutonic legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Mormon influence in Utah, 70% of whose residents are members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is much easier to
define. The church's social conservatism permeates the state's
politics. Utah has the strictest abortion law of any state. It also
became the first state to ban the sale of cigarettes in vending
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii's politics, meantime, are more difficult to parse. Other
than the persistence of ethnic loyalties, there is little consensus
on how Asians, who have always been the majority of Hawaiians, have
contributed culturally to their state's brand of politics.</TE>
<TE>   No immigrant group influenced U.S. urban politics more than the
Irish. Their experience of colonial oppression, combined with their
renowned loquaciousness, gave them the tools with which to
politically dominate many of the largest U.S. cities. Their great
gift to U.S. politics was the elevation of patronage over ideology;
muscle over mind. But it was their own success that put most Irish
political machines out of business by the mid-20th century.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas gubernatorial primary raised hopes and fears in some
quarters that Latinos are on the verge of reinventing U.S. politics,
and perhaps they will. But by the time we know how, it will be fodder
for academic journals rather than front-page headlines.</TE>

<AU>R. KENT WEAVER</AU>
<BD>R. Kent Weaver is a senior fellow in the governmental
studies program at the Brookings Institution and the author of the
forthcoming book, "Reforming Social Security: Lessons From Abroad."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After 15 years of being largely off the national policy agenda,
Social Security came back with a vengeance in 2001. President Bush
established the Commission to Strengthen Social Security, giving it a
clear mandate to propose a way of incorporating optional individual
accounts into the system. Critics denounced the commission as a
stacked body and individual accounts as the first step in a long-term
plot to do away with the program. The stage was set for some
difficult but important negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Then came a series of events that changed the equation. Budget
surpluses that might have helped lubricate an agreement on Social
Security between conservatives and liberals vanished in the aftermath
of Sept. 11. The president's commission issued a report that, instead
of recommending a specific plan, outlined several options for reform,
thereby earning denunciations from both proponents and opponents of
privatization. And the Enron scandal--or, more particularly, the
retirement-savings losses of Enron employees--dimmed some of the
enthusiasm for privatization. It all has made the prospects for an
agreement on major substantive reform of Social Security, not
especially bright before Sept. 11, seem very dim indeed in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   This is a shame. If we want to avoid truly draconian policy
changes in the long run, Social Security's very real long-term
funding problem must be addressed quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a long-term solution will require both liberals and
conservatives to make compromises they find unpalatable. Both sides
must start by abandoning their most extreme positions. Liberals will
not accept reforms that appear likely to undermine the current system
of guaranteed benefits as the core of retirement-income policy by
undermining its fiscal base of support over time. In particular, they
will not accept the redirection of current Social Security payroll
taxes to fund individual accounts. Conservatives will not accept
putting any more payroll tax resources into the current Social
Security program. Nor will they accept injecting significant general
revenues into the current Social Security program, except perhaps for
very narrow, carefully defined purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides also need to alter their rhetoric. Conservatives need
to drop the shrill cries that we're in the midst of a severe crisis,
while liberals must acknowledge there is a real long-term financing
problem that must be solved. Both sides need to admit that investing
in equities--either through individual accounts or collective
investment of current trust fund surpluses--is not a free lunch that
will solve Social Security's financing problem, but at best a healthy
snack that will make it more manageable. In the long term, there are
only two options: cutting benefits for retirees or devoting more
resources to retirement income security.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals and conservatives must accept this simple fact: The
concerns raised by the other side about some of their favorite
proposals are probably legitimate and need to be addressed.
Specifically, liberals must agree to strong safeguards to protect
against political interference in investment decisions if Social
Security trust-fund money is invested in corporate equities and bond
markets. Conservatives must accept limitations on administrative
costs so that savings in mandatory individual accounts, especially
the accounts of low-wage workers, are not eroded by high fees charged
by fund managers. Eligible funds would have to be diverse in their
holdings across firms and sectors of the economy to prevent a repeat,
on a much larger scale, of the Enron retirement-savings debacle.</TE>
<TE>   And one other thing: While we are fixing Social Security's fiscal
situation, we must guard against making existing social problems
worse. Despite major progress over the past 40 years, the United
States still has many seniors in poverty, especially elderly widows.
Many privatization proposals could make this vulnerable group even
worse off.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that the two sides of the ideological divide are willing
to attempt an agreement rather than trying to bash each other for fun
and political profit, here are some specific ideas for bridging the
Social Security divide:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase the Social Security payroll tax by 2% of total
earnings, split equally between employers and employees. All the new
contributions would go into mandatory individual accounts. Workers
would have a wide choice of privately managed funds, but all funds
would have to have diverse holdings. Caps would be placed on the fees
of account managers to hold down administrative costs. Funding
mandatory savings accounts through payroll taxes, rather than general
revenues, provides a stable income stream that is essential if
mandatory savings accounts are to be a major part of seniors'
retirement incomes, given that partial privatization will increase
their risk in depending on market investments.</TE>
<TE>   * Gradually reduce initial benefits for future cohorts of Social
Security recipients as new individual accounts are phased in.
Replacement rates would be set so that the combined "old" Social
Security benefits and new mandatory savings accounts would roughly
equal current benefits, given conservative estimates on rate of
return for the mandatory savings component. Benefits would continue
to be fully adjusted for inflation after retirement.</TE>
<TE>   * Begin investing part of current Social Security trust-fund
surpluses in equity and corporate bond markets through multiple
funds. The size of individual funds would be limited to prevent any
disruption of capital markets. These funds would have a strict
legislative mandate to maximize return for retirees, rather than to
serve social ends, and they would be privately managed. A major
advantage of such an approach is the potential for increasing returns
on Social Security contributions. Even more important, it would ease
the cash-flow transition expected to occur around 2016 as Social
Security shifts from serving as a source of financing for the federal
government to being a drain on government revenues.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a more generous minimum benefit for retirees, paid for
out of general revenues. The current Supplemental Security Income
(SSI) safety-net program for the elderly serves few people because
its benefit levels are minimal and its assets tests are absurdly low.
International experience suggests that it is almost impossible to
eliminate poverty among the aged without increased reliance on some
form of means-tested program. A new income guarantee within Social
Security should have higher benefits and less stringent assets tests
than the current SSI program, but not carry with it automatic
eligibility for Medicaid, which would raise program costs
substantially. Seniors who could meet SSI asset tests could still get
Medicaid. To assuage concerns about high benefits luring immigrants,
benefit guarantees should be prorated based on the years that a
recipient spent in the United States as an adult--one-fortieth of the
full monthly pension for every year of residency. Recertification for
eligibility should occur automatically through filing an income tax
return, as is done in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   None of these proposals, individually or collectively, is a
panacea for Social Security's problems. But they do form a balanced
package that has elements appealing to both sides of the ideological
divide. Seeking a middle-of-the-road solution on Social Security is
not easy. But failure to reach an agreement now will pose an
unacceptable burden on future generations of retirees and their
children.</TE>

<HD>Let's Keep Koppel in Perspective</HD>
<DH>The eradication of all "serious" news from TV might
actually be a step forward for civilization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to The Nation
magazine and a columnist for L.A. Weekly. He is a journalism lecturer
in the USC Annenberg School for Communication.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does an alcoholic or drug addict deserve a new liver? And what about
that rash of pedophile priests? "Grabber" headlines from two
successive shows from a certain TV "news" show of this past week.
Jerry? Larry? A Geraldo rerun?</LD>
<LD>   Guess again. It was Ted Koppel's ABC News "Nightline." The most
"serious" of nightly news fare. And the program that was just spared
the ax, at least temporarily, now that David Letterman came up with
31 million reasons a year to stay at CBS. All of which only confirms
the notion that the national hand-wringing over "Nightline" these
past 10 days--as if the very destiny of the republic hinged on
Koppel's nightly appearance--was woefully misplaced. Why should any
of us care about the fate of so-called "serious" TV journalism?
Koppel certainly has the chops to be a serious journalist. But these
days, Ted and Cokie and Sam and the others are astronomically paid
performers playing serious journalists. That is, unless you believe
the profit-drunk guys in suits over at ABC are in the habit of paying
actual journalists $8 million a year--about 50 times what a top
flight newspaper correspondent might expect to earn at career peak.</LD>
<TE>   The eventual demise of "Nightline," and the scrubbing of network
newscasts--indeed, the eradication of all "serious" news from
TV--might actually be a step forward for American civilization and a
real gift to future generations. Shows like "Nightline" feed a
harmful fiction: that a person can be educated by watching serious TV
news. But using the tube as an instrument of public instruction is
like trying to use a hockey match to teach personal manners.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1854, when workers began laying the Transatlantic cable
that would make instantaneous intercontinental communication a
reality, Henry David Thoreau brilliantly foresaw that the global
electronic buzz, by its very nature, would only inundate us with
disconnected trivia. "We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and
bring the Old World some weeks closer to the New," Thoreau wrote in
"Walden." "But perchance the first news that will leak through into
the broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has
the whooping cough."</TE>
<TE>   Today, almost 150 years later, we've progressed only from the
broad flapping ear to the ever-open eyeball, and from Princess
Adelaide to Princess Di.</TE>
<TE>   As New York University scholar Neil Postman and others have
argued, the medium of television itself is plainly incompatible with
real education. Television doesn't just amplify and retransmit
existing knowledge. Instead, it changes and, more importantly,
subverts the very nature of knowledge. To think otherwise is to
assume you could transmit the Encyclopaedia Britannica through a
hand-shadow show. In a TV-marinated culture like ours, argument is
replaced by pictures, history is replaced by soundbites, meditation
by emotion, and ultimately, knowledge is replaced by opinion--often
by not-particularly informed opinion. In the process, citizens are
reduced to mere consumers, celebrities and movie actors are elevated
above politicians and presidents, and the national discourse is
degraded into a sort of simplistic baby talk.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of the "Nightline" show on organ transplants. If you
watched far enough into the show, the issue turned out to be not that
of convicts getting the liver transplants that should have gone to
more upstanding recipients, as was implied in the episode's set-up
piece, but rather an issue of how America's 50 million medically
uninsured have little chance of a transplant. And yet, even the
venerable "Nightline" took the low road, resorting to the lurid,
tabloid tactic of hanging the whole story on one inmate who got a new
liver. To have more honestly headlined the insurance crisis angle
would have, presumably, been "too boring" for the needs of network
TV.</TE>
<TE>   A visceral, emotional, picture-driven medium like TV is best
suited to transmit car crashes, rainstorms, freeway chases,
brush-fires and mud-wrestling. That's why, when TV does "news," it
relies so heavily on the above. And when TV pretends to propagate
political debate, it naturally favors the gossip circuses like
"Hardball," "The McLaughlin Group," or "Larry King Live."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel's "Nightline," the Sunday morning gasbag shows and the
major networks' nightly newscasts certainly have a style, tone and
temper that are undoubtedly more sober and earnest than some of their
local affiliates and cable TV counterparts. But the "language" of
TV--especially in its hyper-commercial American idiom--remains
anathema to context, exposition and narrative, the three prime
prerequisites for any grasp of history and, consequently, of complex
national or international politics.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel's emotional register might, in fact, be much cooler than,
say, O'Reilly's, but "Nightline" is just as much a slave to the
demands of superficial immediacy as is "The O'Reilly Factor."
"Nightline's" own creator, former ABC News (and Sports) President
Roone Arledge, was widely quoted years ago saying he could tell
within the first 30 seconds of each nightly broadcast whether or not
that edition of "Nightline" would be compelling enough to hold its
audience. Imagine with what horror Arledge or Koppel, or, for that
matter, the audience would react if one night a "Nightline" guest
would answer Ted's first question by saying, "You know, Ted, that's a
complicated issue. Let me think about it overnight, and I'll get back
to you."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it is precisely thinking in a linear and logical way, quietly
reflecting, intensely interpreting, understanding context and
weighing evidence and argument that opens the door to real knowledge.
Those are skills learned from learning to read and by sustained and
serious reading. By contrast, whether it's Koppel or King, what TV
mostly teaches us is how to watch television.</TE>
<TE>   In this past week's lamentations over "Nightline," it has been
endlessly repeated that today's youth don't want to watch serious TV
news programs. Which begs this question: If today's youth are
products of a television era, and Koppel and company are the last
remnants of some fading golden age of more serious TV journalism,
then why didn't some of that glory rub off on our kids? The answer,
of course, was found in the historic study of TV viewing habits
during last decade's Gulf War, which revealed that the more you
watched TV coverage of the conflict, the less you knew.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in the near future all serious TV news will disappear. In
that case we could celebrate two equally marvelous achievements.
First, television would finally and formally be relegated to the
lowly place it so richly deserves in the public educational
hierarchy: somewhere between Etch-a-Sketch and Sony's PlayStation 2.
And second, we could get back to teaching our children that there are
no easy short-cuts to education, knowledge, literacy and
understanding of the world around us. There is only the old-fashioned
way: reading.</TE>

<HD>Bills Would Block Banks From Selling Real Estate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Banking industry supporters mobilized last week to pressure lawmakers
to defeat proposed federal legislation that would prohibit banks from
selling real estate.</LD>
<LD>   The American Bankers Assn. and other industry lobbyists have sent
more than 54,000 letters to Congress urging defeat of two bills that
would preclude regulations proposed by the Federal Reserve Board and
the Treasury Department allowing federally chartered banks to conduct
real estate brokerage and property management services.</LD>
<LD>   "We're making our case as to why it's counterproductive and
illogical to exclude one branch of financial services from doing real
estate transactions," said Charlotte Birch, an American Bankers Assn.
spokeswoman. "Brokerage companies offer mortgage services, so what's
good for the goose should be good for the gander."</LD>
<TE>   The Senate and House bills would alter the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, which prohibited banks from conducting real estate investment
and development, but allowed the Fed to authorize expanded bank
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Since passage of that act, the Fed has proposed regulations
declaring that real estate brokerage and management activities are
financial in nature and therefore open to federally chartered banks.</TE>
<TE>   Banking industry supporters say that a number of state-chartered
banks already broker real estate, as do security firms, credit unions
and insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that expanding banks' services would allow for even more
consumer choice in the realm of real estate, and that's a good
thing," said David Liddle, a spokesman for Washington-based Financial
Services Roundtable, a banking industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Realtors disagrees. The trade group claims
that the concentrated market power of banks would drive smaller
brokers out of business and limit consumer choices.</TE>
<TE>   The Realtors association, which is waging its own public campaign,
is running newspaper advertisements urging consumers to pressure
legislators to support its position.</TE>
<TE>   National Assn. of Realtors President Martin Edwards Jr. said
Wednesday that his group has marshaled bipartisan support for the
House bill, which as of Wednesday had 187 co-sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering what the banking industry is trying to fix,"
Edwards said. "When the banks say consumers will get one-stop
shopping, it's really one-bank shopping they're talking about.
Consumers prefer multiple loan options."</TE>
<TE>   The Realtors association, while expressing confidence in the
outcome of the legislative battle ahead, acknowledges that some in
its field view industry changes less negatively.</TE>
<TE>   The Realty Alliance, for example, which represents independent
residential real-estate brokerage companies, sees the potential for a
business model in which agents and banks forge partnerships, similar
to those between banks and insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   But California Assn. of Realtors President Robert Bailey said that
a survey by the group's national organization revealed that 96% of
the National Assn. of Realtors' agents oppose any plan that would
allow banks' entry into real estate brokerage and management.</TE>
<TE>   "Different parts of the real estate industry have different points
of view, but the majority of our members are opposed to such a
change," Bailey said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I live in a condo at the beach. For the 26 years I've lived
there, no one has ever moved because it is so nice; the only way to
move in is if someone dies.</LD>
<LD>   Each home is distinct in part because most of the owners are
ardent gardeners.</LD>
<LD>   As older residents die, younger owners have bought into the
complex and are imposing stricter rules and regulations. They have
also hired a management company without a vote from the owners. The
company immediately gave all homeowners notice that we have to
conform to a type of uniformity where all the homes "will look
alike."</LD>
<TE>   The company said they are doing this "because it will increase the
value of our property." They said we must remove all of our potted
plants. Homeowners are now officially banned from putting anything in
individual patios that might be seen above the 4-foot patio wall, and
can no longer place any flower boxes or plants on the patio ledges.
They have also arranged to paint the entire complex within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Before these younger owners bought in and took over the board
positions, there was a pleasant and flexible atmosphere. Now we are
"ordered to remove everything" and nothing is open to discussion.
This has led to an extremely stressful situation that is affecting
our lives. Is there anything we can do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your situation is typical of the ever-changing state of
common interest developments and the boards of directors given legal
authority to run them. Original owners, faced with the initial
responsibilities of repair and maintenance, adopted a scheme that was
open and representative of the distinctiveness of the homeowners, yet
catered to the perceived homogeneity of the complex. Homeowners
expressed their individuality while enjoying the benefits of the
"community." But circumstances and people change with the passage of
time, and not all change is good.</TE>
<TE>   Examine all the homeowner association governing documents of your
development from the day you bought it. Those documents may limit
your board's authority to hire a management company unless it was
approved by a vote of the homeowners. If hiring the management
company requires additional expense, the increase in your association
budget may exceed what is permitted by the Davis-Stirling Act without
requiring a vote.</TE>
<TE>   California Civil Code sections 1365 and 1366, part of the
Davis-Stirling Act, outline procedures and requirements for
assessment increases before increases can occur. Nearly overlooked in
section 1363(g) is the reference to monetary penalties and fines and
the requirements that must be met before such fines can be levied.
Confirm that your board has met all of these requirements--if not,
any fines may be invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Assessments may still be the basis for a lien on your separate
interest if not paid in a timely fashion, even if they are not valid.
If the assessments are not valid and were used as the basis to put a
lien on property, the owner may have a claim for damages, but by the
time those damages are paid the real damage will have been done to
the homeowners and the community in which you live.</TE>
<TE>   In the 26 years of living in your common interest development, you
have no doubt experienced increased property values. Just as the
management company had nothing to do with property value increase
before they were hired, they will have nothing to do with any
potential increase afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what buyers and sellers may be led to believe, the
cookie-cutter appearance of a neighborhood can actually lower
property values. It is the individuality nurtured by you and the
other homeowners that makes your complex appealing, thus raising the
property values.</TE>
<TE>   There is no credibility to the statement that a "uniform
appearance" suddenly increases the value of your home or that tall
patio plants decreases its value.</TE>
<TE>   Every vote counts in a common interest development. Your
management company is just another vendor that does not have the
authority to rule your complex. Doing away with them may be simple.
Rally homeowners who feel the new generation of board members has
gone too far and vote in a new board.</TE>
<TE>   Presenting and electing your own board nominees might allow you to
rescind the measures about which you now complain. Once that happens,
consider amending your covenants, conditions and restrictions to
limit the extent to which rules and monetary fines can be imposed or
which restrict homeowner individuality and personal freedoms.</TE>

<LD>Known as "Al's House," this residence was built by entertainer Al
Jolson in 1942 on a private knoll in the Beverly Hills area off
Mulholland Drive.</LD>
<LD>   Jolson designed and signed his name on the pool house, then lived
in the home for many years, during which time actor Errol Flynn lived
in the guest house. Jolson died in 1950.</LD>
<LD>   Arnold Quinn, a fine arts publisher, purchased the property in
1996 and restored the house, maintaining its original Georgian
Colonial style while adding a second floor.</LD>
<TE>   "We stripped and redid the pool and brought back all of the
trees," he said. He also restored the guest house "from the ground
up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About the home: A long, gated drive leads to the house, which has
views from downtown to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3,995,000</TE>

<LD>Latin recording sensation Luis Miguel has sold his Beverly Hills home
to fashion designer and fragrance mogul Bijan for $6 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel, 31, is looking to buy a smaller home because he no longer
needs 12,000 square feet of living space, sources said. The
singer-sex symbol has another home in Acapulco, Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Bijan, 58, wanted more room than he had in the Bel-Air home he was
leasing. He had been looking for a home to buy for six years, since
his divorce from his second wife, Tracy, a spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, Bijan sold a Beverly Hills home he never lived in to
singer-songwriter Lionel Richie, a friend and client, for close to
$6.5 million. It was "too old of a style" for Bijan and needed lots
of work, his spokesman explained.</TE>
<TE>   The six-bedroom house he bought from Miguel is more contemporary
and Mediterranean in style.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1993, the three-story house, on nearly an acre of
parklike grounds behind gates, has 12 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a
Honduran mahogany library with coffered ceilings; state-of-the-art
lighting, sound and security systems; and a 22-car subterranean
garage. The house, said to be "exquisitely furnished," also has a
guest house, pool and spa.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Puerto Rico and raised in Mexico, Miguel, also a friend
and client of Bijan's, has been known south of the border as el Idolo
because he was an idol by the time he was 14, with four albums and a
Grammy for a duet with Sheena Easton.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel subsequently won three more Grammys and in 1990, he won
Latin Grammy Awards for best pop album, album of the year and best
male pop vocal performance. "Segundo Romance," his 1994 album of
classic love songs, was one of Billboard's highest debuting
Spanish-language albums. He has sold more than 45 million albums
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel bucked the crossover trend by refusing to record his songs
in English. He became the standard-bearer of contemporary Latin music
with his traditional bolero albums. Recently, he has been described
as being in "a musical slump" due to the boleros, but he also sings
pop songs and ballads, and is still one of Latin America's most
popular singers.</TE>
<TE>   He has also branched out into Spanish-language film roles.</TE>
<TE>   Bijan opened his showroom on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1976.
In 1987, he introduced a series of fragrances for women and men,
including two for basketball star Michael Jordan. Bijan also has
created wardrobes for many of the world's most powerful and visible
men, including kings, presidents, global business leaders and
celebrities. Besides Miguel and Richie, other clients are reported to
include Steven Spielberg, Ricky Martin, Prince Juan Carlos, Prince
Charles and Steve Wynn.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lewis of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, represented Miguel
in his sale, and Joyce Rey and Bernice and Janine Gershon of Coldwell
Banker, Beverly Hills, represented Bijan, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Rock star Tom Petty has purchased a home in Malibu for close to
its asking price of $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, on a sandy beach, has three bedrooms, two of which face
the ocean. Built in 1974, the house also has three bathrooms, three
fireplaces, Malibu tiles, an open floor plan and a courtyard with a
fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Petty's band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, has been together
for nearly 30 years and sold more than 30 million albums. The
foundation of the band's music has been classic rock, blues and soul
of the '50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers--known for such songs as "American
Girl," "Free Fallin'" and "Don't Back Down," as well as songs from
the group's 1999 album "Echo"--will be inducted into the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame on Monday. Petty, a guitarist and vocalist, also
won a 1989 Grammy for a performance with the Traveling Wilburys.</TE>
<TE>   Petty, 51, was married last July at another home he owns in
Malibu. Another rock 'n' roller, Little Richard, performed the
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   John London, a former radio-show host for KCMG-FM "Mega" (92.3)
who was hired in January to host a morning show on KNBR-FM in San
Francisco, and his wife, Juliette, have put their home on a two-acre
promontory in Benedict Canyon on the market at $2.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house has four bedrooms in about 4,600 square feet, behind
gates. Built in 1982, the three-story home also has city views,
soaring ceilings, a living room with a large wet bar and a fireplace;
a master suite with a fireplace; guest quarters with a separate
entrance; and a lagoon pool with a spa.</TE>
<TE>   The radio host was one of the top-rated morning DJs in the Bay
Area when he worked for KMEL in San Francisco from 1985 to 1991. He
left San Francisco to join KKBT in L.A. His "House Party" show filled
Mega's mornings with music and conversation for 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Young and Barbara Eisner, both of DBL in Beverly Hills,
have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Durst, frontman of the rock band Limp Bizkit, has sold his
Bel-Air home for $3.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Durst, 30, bought the home last fall and never moved into it. He
re-listed it in December for about what he paid for it--just under $4
million.</TE>
<TE>   The house had "vibes that were not quite correct for him," said
sources not involved in the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1969, the four-bedroom, 6,600-square-foot house, on
slightly more than an acre, was once owned by Robbie Krieger of the
Doors, and there is a stone carving on a wall of the Doors
performing.</TE>
<TE>   Durst already purchased another home, with two master suites and a
sound studio in the Hollywood Hills, and he recently listed it at
just under $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian and Tim Watson of Prudential-John Aaroe, Beverly
Hills, represented both sides of the Bel-Air deal, and they
represented Durst in buying the Hollywood Hills home, which they now
have listed.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Sullivan, who created and produced the popular CBS series
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" (1993-98), and her husband, actor Jim
Knobeloch, have listed their home on 11 equestrian-zoned acres in the
Topanga Canyon area at $4.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have moved to Australia. They grew to love it, sources
said, when they went there to film the PAX TV series "Ponderosa." She
is an executive producer of the series, in which he plays Jack.</TE>
<TE>   They built their Topanga-area home in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The home has five bedrooms, a great room, a library, a game room,
a media room and an audio room in slightly more than 10,000 square
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The property, behind gates, also has extensive grounds with more
than 400 rose bushes, a large grassy yard and a pool with a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Knobeloch, who is also an artist, played Jake Slicker on "Dr.
Quinn, Medicine Woman" and also appeared in "The Trials of Rosie
O'Neil."</TE>
<TE>   Debra Usher and Cheryl Platz of Sotheby's International Realty,
Brentwood, have the listing.</TE>

<HD>From Junkyard to Gem</HD>
<DH>A Long Beach fixer-upper is transformed into a keeper--on a
budget of $45,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Chang struggled with opposing desires when he set out last
year to become a first-time homeowner: to save money by buying a
fixer-upper and maintain his tranquil lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in sales, so I'm always looking for a deal," said Chang, 30,
a district manager for a computer company. On the other hand, he
said: "I'm a drama-free person."</LD>
<LD>   So when Chang contemplated buying a dilapidated, junk-strewn Long
Beach rental property that his father owned, he worried it "might be
too much stress for me." But after a contractor completed a six-week,
$45,000, front-to-back, floor-to-roof renovation that required little
of Chang's time, the new homeowner decided that sometimes remodeling
"is not a bad experience."</LD>
<TE>   The impetus for buying a house came in mid-2000 when Chang moved
from a two-bedroom apartment into a one-bedroom unit to be closer to
the beach in Belmont Heights. Around that time, he started a new job
that doubled his income--and his taxes. Operating from a home office,
he set up his desk in the living room, but soon wearied of that
setup.</TE>
<TE>   "It came to a point where I really needed to do something quick,"
he said. To get a tax write-off on mortgage payments, he wanted to
buy a house, but because he "couldn't afford to jump into a big house
payment," the idea for a fixer came to mind.</TE>
<TE>   While he considered other run-down properties, the grim 1930s,
three-bedroom, one-bathroom bungalow his father owned stood out
because of its setting in a tract of exceptionally tidy homes with
impeccable paint jobs and precisely trimmed lawns.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what attracted me," Chang said. "If I'm going to make this
investment, why don't I buy the worst house on the block?"</TE>
<TE>   Putting his sales skills to work, he talked his dad into selling
the house for $180,000, convincing him that it "was a legal
liability." Plus, the younger Chang stressed that he would buy the
house as is and take responsibility for hauling away the debris a
longtime tenant had accumulated, which included 20 tons of scrap
metal, dozens of used batteries and an old trash-filled boat.</TE>
<TE>   Before he went forward, though, Chang had the house's foundation
and the plumbing system checked. "I was real careful," he said.
"Those [types of problems] were two things I wanted to stay away
from."</TE>
<TE>   As he pondered how to finance the home's transformation, his
banker at Wells Fargo suggested he talk to John Sway, a loan officer
who deals only with renovation loans. In this type of home financing,
the amount the bank will loan is based on the value of the house
after the planned improvements. Plus, the bank pays the contractor
directly during construction, with the homeowner as the second
signer.</TE>
<TE>   In Chang's case, based on the work he planned to do, the house
would be worth $280,000, which would allow him to put up to $100,000
into renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, because he wanted to keep his mortgage to less than $2,000
per month, Chang decided to set a budget of $45,500 for the complete
remodel--which included adding central heat and air-conditioning--but
cutting corners where necessary and eschewing luxurious materials and
products. Except for some unusual light fixtures that his friends say
resemble hubcaps, Chang kept it simple.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's clean, it's straight and it works," he said, "I'm OK with
it."</TE>
<TE>   To eliminate the stress of paying the rent on his apartment and
the mortgage on the house while it was being renovated, Chang
factored the first two mortgage payments into the construction loan.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Chang considered acting as the general contractor,
hiring tradespeople to do the work. But because he works full-time
and thought acting as a contractor would be too difficult, he started
searching for a general contractor who would supervise the entire
project.</TE>
<TE>   Chang interviewed several contractors and finally found Michael
Hinkson of Hinkson Contracting by calling an apartment owners
association and asking for a recommendation. After the trash was
hauled away, at a cost of $2,000, the house was renovated from the
roof down. To choose the color of the roof tile, Chang took a stroll
around his new neighborhood to see what other homeowners had chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to blend in," he said. He also selected the color for
the refurbished exterior siding and stucco based on other nearby
homes, and replicated a curve in the driveway to match that in a
neighbor's driveway.</TE>
<TE>   The landscaping was chosen for its low-maintenance qualities and
included palms, a layer of plastic to keep down weeds and automatic
sprinklers set on timers.</TE>
<TE>   All the windows needed to be replaced. Chang decided to save
thousands of dollars by simple retrofits, leaving the wood framing
intact and adding French-style window inserts.</TE>
<TE>   The front, rear and garage doors were replaced, and Chang also
opted to replace all the doors inside the house. "Doors make a huge
difference when they're new," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The wood floors in the living room, dining room, hallways and
bedrooms were refinished, and a texture coat was added to all
interior walls, a feature Chang heard was popular in all new homes.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen was gutted and Chang decided to add a wood floor to
match the rest of the house. "I wanted consistency," he said. The
cabinets, counters and appliances are all basic white. A little bit
of flair was added when Chang's mom, Lise, suggested glass inserts
for the top cabinet doors. The contractor suggested adding a garbage
disposal, which Chang hadn't thought of, as well as providing each
major appliance with its own circuit to prevent power overloads.</TE>
<TE>   Lise Chang also recommended folding louver doors to cover the
washer and dryer on the service porch, and adding a linen closet in
the bathroom, which was similarly gutted and redone.</TE>
<TE>   Chang shopped for and bought the light fixtures and furniture
himself, a task he said his bachelor status made easier because he
didn't have to consult with anyone else. To keep life simple, he set
the lamps on timers, including the tiny white lights on his
maintenance-free silk ficus tree.</TE>
<TE>   Chang spends most hours of the day working in his quiet office,
which was converted from one of the bedrooms, or making presentations
to his corporate clients. When he leaves the house, the new alarm
system is set.</TE>
<TE>   The renovation was so pleasant and profitable (the house was just
appraised at more than $300,000) that Chang recently earned his
real-estate broker's license and might consider buying another
fixer-upper. But, he emphasized, "I'll definitely have the contractor
do everything."</TE>

<LD>We have long been passing along this formula to eliminate mildew that
you can use on any washable surface.</LD>
<LD>   All you do is add 1 quart of liquid laundry bleach and 1 cup of
powdered laundry detergent--less if concentrated--to 3 quarts of warm
water.</LD>
<LD>   Scrub the solution onto the mildew-affected area, and be sure to
keep it wet until the black mildew turns white (when mildew changes
color from black to white, it's dead).</LD>
<TE>   Although this is a relatively safe concoction, to be certain of
safety, use eye protection, wear rubber gloves and make sure there is
plenty of ventilation.</TE>

<HD>Southern Charm Keeps Darlington on the Schedule</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Despite drawbacks at the old raceway, it
wouldn't be a NASCAR season without a stop there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SPENCER</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a dinosaur, a throwback to the early days of Winston Cup
racing, an irregular 1.366-mile oval of gritty, crumbling asphalt
that tests the skill and courage of those who dare to challenge it.</LD>
<LD>   It rises from the sandy soil of northeastern South Carolina,
almost within an arm's length of Route 151, or so it seems.</LD>
<LD>   It is the Fenway Park of speedways. The wall between what now are
Turn 1 and Turn 2 at the egg-shaped track is a feature every bit as
distinctive as Fenway's Green Monster in left field. The wall at
Darlington is smaller but more dangerous. For more than a
half-century, it has marked cars with its signature "Darlington
stripe." Cars turn laps that teeter on the edge of disaster, and they
often brush the wall at that end of the speedway.</LD>
<TE>   The track, site of the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 this weekend,
has two nicknames, both sinister in nature: "The track too tough to
tame" and "the Lady in Black." Drivers love it or hate it. Some
drivers love it and hate it. Kyle Petty once said, in a fit of pique,
that Darlington should be filled with water and stocked with bass.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1950 as NASCAR's first paved superspeedway,
Darlington is home to the Southern 500, for years second in prestige
only to the Daytona 500. Drivers say Darlington is one of the most
difficult tracks to master. It should surprise no one that such
combative drivers as David Pearson and the late Dale Earnhardt lead
the list of all-time winners at the track.</TE>
<TE>   Among current drivers, Bill Elliott and Jeff Gordon have five wins
each at Darlington. Elliott says Darlington is a driver's track where
setup is crucial "because if your car is bad, it's only going to get
worse."</TE>
<TE>   "The surface is so old, you are constantly slipping and sliding
around the place," Elliott says. "You have to worry about conserving
tires because they wear out so quickly. You don't want the car coming
out from underneath you."</TE>
<TE>   Darlington was enlarged in 1953 from its initial size of 1.25
miles. Different installments of asphalt over the last half-decade
have made the pavement tough to maneuver on despite a complete
resurfacing in 1996. The difficult conditions are part of what makes
the track unique and generally provide an entertaining race.</TE>
<TE>   The latest trend in racing architecture is to construct 1.5-mile
tracks similar to multi-use stadiums. The new tracks have
air-conditioned, soundproof luxury boxes with all of the trimmings,
but they lack the character of Darlington, Bristol, Richmond or
Martinsville.</TE>
<TE>   The racing is predictable at new tracks because they are built
fairly flat to accommodate a variety of races, mainly open-wheel and
stock car, to recoup the cost of construction and to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Darlington's biggest drawback is its location. Although it's two
hours from Charlotte, N.C., it is hardly a world-class market, nor
can it easily accommodate a NASCAR event. Hotels quadruple rates
during race weeks and make three-night stays mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "there will always be a place on the schedule for
Darlington," says Jim Hunter, a former Darlington president and
current NASCAR vice president for corporate communications.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR might not need to go to Darlington or Rockingham more than
once a year, but without them on the schedule, it would be like
baseball without Fenway Park or Wrigley Field.</TE>

<HD>Strawberry Should Not Get Another Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEYMAN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one had more power than Darryl Strawberry. No one has less will
power.</LD>
<LD>   Two months were all that separated Darryl Strawberry from his
kids, the Yankees and the rest of the free world outside the Halfway
House in Citra, Fla., where he'd spent the past 10 months. But
Strawberry couldn't follow the rules, couldn't come close.</LD>
<LD>   Can you imagine that one of the rules was not to shave one's head,
and he couldn't follow that one? There is no way to hide a shaved
head, either.</LD>
<TE>   He wasn't supposed to have sex in the facility. But he was caught
with a female resident who is not his wife in a broom closet.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry broke so many rules in such outlandish ways it's like
he figured no one could ever touch him. He always begged for mercy
when caught before, and he always received mercy. You can see why he
got the idea he was untouchable. There aren't too many people outside
jails who have violated parole five times.</TE>
<TE>   At least there was an excuse for past indiscretions. He has a
disease called addiction. When he screwed up before, he was usually
high or on his way to getting high. There is no addiction to shaving
one's head.</TE>
<TE>   What he did in the Halfway House he did stone cold sober. He has
no excuses this time. The report issued by the Florida Department of
Corrections paints a picture of a man hellbent on breaking every last
rule in the house, a man who either did not care what happened to him
or thought his celebrity could buy him out of any fix.</TE>
<TE>   He looks like nothing more than a two-bit scammer, hustling his
way through the cushy punishment and flaunting his fame. He was
caught bartering autographed baseballs and possessing $140,000. His
friends told us for years he was indigent, and now even that looks
like a hustle to win the chance for a lifetime job with George
Steinbrenner, the chance he probably now has blown with a litany of
house-rule violations that could make Amy Fisher blush.</TE>
<TE>   Friends say his marriage was already in trouble before the
broom-closet incident, that he believes he has little to look forward
to after his release. But Strawberry should have counted his
blessings. His colon cancer reportedly is in remission. He has three
children. And he had a job with the Yankees waiting for him.</TE>
<TE>   He is not accused of using drugs while in rehab, but that almost
makes it worse. He had his wits about him while he was making a
mockery of Judge Florence Foster's last-chance ruling. He is in the
Marion County jail today, and he will return April 1 to Tampa to face
Judge Foster, who warned him in May when he was rounded up after a
four-day bender that the next time, he'd end up in jail.</TE>
<TE>   According to the reports outlined this week in his brief court
appearance in Marion County, 80 miles north of Yankee camp,
Strawberry broke house rules by smoking, exchanging baseballs for
cigarettes, misusing telephone privileges, using bad language, and
also by "contracting and exploiting himself " (presumably, that was
the broom-closet escapade).</TE>
<TE>   Residents were asked to express their holiday feelings on the day
after Christmas. Strawberry used that exercise to argue with a
Phoenix House worker and use profanities.</TE>
<TE>   One friend said when he visited Strawberry a few weeks ago, he
could tell he was doing "terrible." But the report paints a picture
of a man behaving terribly, not doing terribly.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry acted like a man with a lifetime pass, but he's out of
chances now. His name normally elicits sympathy around Yankee camp
because he was recalled as a kind man with a big bat. One player said
only a day earlier that the difference between Strawberry and Ruben
Rivera is that "Strawberry is only hurting himself."</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, Strawberry was back to having persona non grata
status.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Torre, a Strawberry supporter in the past, said "I have no
thoughts" on Strawberry. Derek Jeter, who wrote the brotherly forward
to Strawberry's autobiography, said, "I don't know what to think.
It's shocking."</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams said, "I feel for him and his family," but
Williams also pointed out that Strawberry had to know the rules, and
now must face the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner issued a terse, unflattering statement, painting an
unpromising picture of Strawberry's Yankee future. Even if Strawberry
somehow wins more mercy in court there's no way he'll be back with
the Yankees anytime soon. Even sober, you can't trust his word.</TE>
<TE>   He can't come back now. If he's invited back, who knows what he'd
do? You could picture him showing up with a cigarette dangling out of
his mouth, wads of cash falling out of his pockets and a fellow
rehabbing nymphet on his arm.</TE>

<HD>Strickland Becomes Part of Solution, Not Problem</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Point guard has kept his composure and
helped the Heat stay in playoff contention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN DEVENEY</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the season, after finally ending a summer spent in free-agent
limbo by coming to a contract agreement with the Miami Heat, Rod
Strickland sat in front of a group of reporters and gave his usual
new-team spiel: Judge me on how I play, ignore the past, the accepted
viewpoints are wrong.</LD>
<LD>   In Strickland's words: "None of you know me, but you are going by
what you read or what you heard. It's like a snowball effect.
Hopefully, by the end of the year, you will look at me in a different
light."</LD>
<LD>   Fat chance, Rod. The perception created by four arrests and two
convictions in the last five years, his repeated lateness and
nonchalance while he was in the waning days of his career with the
Wizards last season, and his fights with a teammate and a
coach--those will not be wiped away easily.</LD>
<TE>   "Rod gets in trouble," says one Eastern Conference front office
executive. "Whether he means well or what, it does not matter. The
guy gets in trouble. People don't just forget that. Your off-court
life matters, too, in this business."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but on the court, there is little doubt Strickland, 35,
is undergoing a revival and, in the process, is resuscitating the
Heat's long-shot hopes at the playoffs. This is the same Heat team
that started out 2-14, sunk to 5-23 and began entertaining talk of
lottery picks and a new coach to replace Pat Riley. But Miami, for a
variety of reasons, no longer is the same miserable group. Center
Alonzo Mourning has gotten healthy, and leading scorer Eddie Jones
has improved. The players, 10 of whom joined Miami this season, have
gotten accustomed to each other.</TE>
<TE>   But the spark for the about-face has been Strickland. After the
5-23 start, the Heat went 22-10, and Strickland averaged 11.5 points
and 6.9 assists in that span. He struggled through the first two
months of the season, first to get himself in shape after the long
summer layoff, and then while he was healing after injuries to his
hamstring. Now healthy and "in as good shape as I can remember,"
Strickland has pushed the woeful Heat back to respectability, and
even into the thick of the playoff hunt.</TE>
<TE>   His style--getting inside defenses, drawing helping defenders,
finishing when he needs to and making smart, consistent passes from
the paint--is a perfect fit for the Heat offense, which had been an
oxymoron much of the season. Strickland sets up shooters such as
Jones, Jim Jackson and Kendall Gill on the perimeter and leaves
openings for Mourning in the post.</TE>
<TE>   "He is running the show for us," Jones says. "He gets in there and
makes some tough, tough plays for us in transition. He has been doing
it for the past few months. We expect that now. He has been living up
to what we believed he could be."</TE>
<TE>   "He is a catalyst for us, driving the ball to the basket, getting
layups and breaking zones and making outside shots," Riley says. "We
would not be where we are without him."</TE>
<TE>   Having a veteran point guard running the offense has been a boost
for Riley, especially because, even through the team's early
stumbles, it still has played trademark Heat defense and is the
stingiest team in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat does not need offensive fireworks; it just needs a
careful, efficient performance on offense. To that end, Riley says he
has simplified the offense in the last few months and is stressing
mental focus over complex plays. Carelessness with the ball is
usually the Heat's downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time we start going downhill is when we start
self-destructing," Riley says. "We start throwing the ball all over
the place. So, to stop that, we have kept it simpler and have
emphasized the execution. And we have Rod in there."</TE>
<TE>   Riley's faith in Strickland is one reason Strickland chose to come
to Miami. Strickland finished last season with Portland after being
released by Washington, and he was jobless all summer as teams shied
away from his spotty off-court past. At the end of the summer,
Strickland was weighing offers for the veteran's minimum salary from
the Heat and 76ers, but Philadelphia wanted to include behavior
clauses in his contract. Miami did not. Strickland chose Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Looking around the Heat locker room, Strickland tallies the
reasons for the Heat's stunning ascension in the East: Mourning,
Jackson, Riley, the physical defense, the bench contributions. It is
suggested that he should be at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   "Shucks, I am playing ball, that's all," Strickland says. "Shucks.
We are just coming together as a team. ... I can't even explain it.
We were 5-23. And we're (29-33) now. We have to be proud of ourselves
now. We could have packed it in. These guys, they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Strickland deserves credit for his part in the Heat
turnaround, and he can hope the way he has played will result in a
smoother three months when this summer comes around. Like last
summer, Strickland will be a free agent, and of course, the
perception of his off-court life will not go away. Strickland would
like to stay with the Heat, but should the team not be able to
squeeze him under the luxury-tax threshold, he will be looking for
work elsewhere. He says he holds no grudges against teams who passed
on him during the last free-agent period--he just hopes they don't
make the same mistake next time.</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't about the other teams," he says. "I wanted to come into
a situation where I knew I would be playing for a great coach, I knew
I would be pushed by a coach I respect. Coach Riley is that.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I am glad to be in a situation where I can play good
basketball and turn the perception around a little bit. The only way
to do that was to play good basketball. Talking about it does not
help."</TE>

<HD>Tyson Can Help Justify Washington's Support</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WILBON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A great many people in the District of Columbia have demonstrated if
not their faith in Mike Tyson then at least their willingness to
allow him to ply his trade here.</LD>
<LD>   It's now time for Tyson to justify that outpouring of goodwill.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night's open forum confirmed what anybody not living in a
cave already should have known: Most folks in Washington want the
Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson fight to be held here and are willing to
passionately give voice to their reasons. What I don't want to read
or hear is that the process by which the vote was cast was somehow a
distortion of the political process or that the room was somehow
purposely stacked with Tyson supporters.</LD>
<TE>   Anybody who strongly opposed holding the fight here should have
stood up and said his or her piece. This wasn't some secret meeting;
everybody knew when and where it would take place. Reporters were
present.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the fight weren't kept outside with their noses
pressed against the glass or shouted down or intimidated into
silence. Anybody too disinterested or not brave enough to stand and
voice opposition is plain out of luck.</TE>
<TE>   This was a political process that took place in the most political
of all cities, and I'm sick of some who are conflicted up to their
ears screaming that my buddy Michael Brown is any more guilty of a
conflict of interest than anybody else in this town.</TE>
<TE>   All this region does traditionally is its "just say no" routine to
everything from a downtown football stadium to a Disney theme park to
new cell towers, then spend the next 10 years in regret.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, in particular, has been The City That Doesn't Work for
the last 35 years, largely because people are too scared or beaten
down to be proactive about anything. So whatever Brown and the
commission did to rally this show of support for the fight, good.
Politics is more than just talk.</TE>
<TE>   The granting of a license to Tyson by the D.C. Boxing and
Wrestling Commission should land the Lewis-Tyson fight at MCI Center.
Reports are that Lewis hasn't even applied any place else. I'm not
going to engage in city bashing, but let me ask you: Do you think the
fighters, promoters and Showtime would rather this fight take place
in the nation's capital or Detroit? The nation's capital or Memphis?
Please.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe now, Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, can stop running around
telling every town in America that it's the leading candidate to host
the fight. If Lewis, who after all is the champ, wanted to fight in
London or Denmark, wouldn't he have pressed the issue weeks ago when
Las Vegas bowed out?</TE>
<TE>   And let's get one other thing straight. My colleague, Thomas
Boswell, says that a projected $6 million to $10 million isn't
revenue for a metropolitan area as large as this one. Out-of-work
service industry folks can't hold out for the $50 million payday.</TE>
<TE>   A limousine driver or small business caterer who has worked
sporadically since September would be happy with a couple weeks of
guaranteed work. So would his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   I must not have said this clearly enough in a column a couple of
weeks ago, so I'll try it once more: If the District of Columbia
doesn't successfully put on a series of international events starting
with the fight--that's starting with this fight--then wave goodbye to
any serious bid for the 2012 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Now, back to Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   There's a huge and legitimate question of whether he can even get
into shape to fight by June 8. Also, Tyson will have had only six
fights in five years if he meets Lewis in June. Of those six, none
was legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   What Tyson owes the people who have more or less embraced him here
is to actually try, not to bite somebody or break his arm, but to
fight. Maybe he remembers when he used to do that. Maybe if Don King
is kept far enough away from this affair, Tyson will have another
bout ... and remember what a great fighter he was 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I've been in favor of D.C. having this fight all along but
acknowledge the risks involved in playing host to a championship
fight--everything from security concerns to fulfilling the notion
that a legit athletic competition is actually being staged.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to bite off Evander Holyfield's ear or break Francois
Botha's arm aren't what I had in mind. Nor is beating up pugs with
the names Savarese, Norris or Francis.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson issued what amounted to a prepared statement of thanks
Tuesday night. I don't want to hear that. Show us, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   You lived about 12 miles from where the big fight should be
contested. You partied in D.C., you walked into car dealerships and
grocery stores here, watched other sporting events from the best
seats. I know for a fact you hosted events for kids at your house in
Bethesda, carpooled on occasion without getting into fights with
other motorists. The point is, you should have enough familiarity and
respect for the people and issues here to care about how this thing
turns out.</TE>
<TE>   D.C.'s challenge was to attract and sanction this fight. Tyson's
challenge now is to treat the District and the event with the same
decency and respect with which he's been treated.</TE>

<DH>Downtown restaurants have reopened, stirring up hope.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>More than six months after terrorists dealt New York a devastating
blow, the city is getting on with things. Tourists are venturing
back, and many are inevitably drawn downtown to the haunting ground
zero site, as I was recently. Some come to grieve. Some come to
empathize. And some end up eating nearby, which has to be one of the
strangest dining experiences anywhere: saddening, undeniably macabre
and, at the same time, heartening.</LD>
<LD>   Going out to dine in the shadow of ground zero would be
unthinkable if it weren't an act of defiance in the face of terrorism
and a vote of support for the beleaguered neighborhood, vigorously
endorsed by the former New York mayor and the present one. When you
do make your way downtown, moved, curious and half-afraid of what
you'll encounter, you can't help but admire New York's resilience.
And precisely because the restaurants below Canal Street have been so
hard hit, you find yourself rooting for every one of them.</LD>
<LD>   For months closed streets made access difficult to this
neighborhood at the southern tip of Manhattan. Restaurants that were
about to debut when the towers came tumbling down halted plans
midstream. Most managed to open, but weeks or months later. And those
that were already established hung on, hoping things would get
better. Downtown restaurants may not be bustling, but they're back.</LD>
<TE>   Whether you choose to reserve a white-clothed table at Chanterelle
or Danube, go bistro at Brasserie Les Halles Downtown or tuck into
steaks at Harry's on Hanover Square, eating downtown offers one of
the more unusual dining experiences anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrison opened in November, one of the first places below
Canal Street to do so since the attacks, and it seemed the entire
city cheered it on. If you had to design a restaurant to suit the
spirit of the moment, this would be it. Cozy and welcoming, with its
long bar, white clapboard walls and French doors onto the street, the
Harrison already feels like a neighborhood institution. Against all
odds, the place is packed.</TE>
<TE>   After catching a cab or walking the bleak blocks from the subway,
intrepid diners come in from the cold to the warm embrace of this
American bistro from the owners of Red Cat in Chelsea. Who wouldn't
be cheered by appetizers like homemade bresaola (air-dried beef) with
garlic- and olive oil-doused fettunta ("oiled bread") topped with
pungent Taleggio cheese, or honey and lime-glazed quail served atop a
savory stew of white beans, bacon and thyme? There's a great grilled
pork chop, pan-crisped chicken in a lemony mustard sauce with mashed
potatoes, prime shell steak with rather too much balsamic vinegar
sauce, and a terrific skillet-cooked calf's liver, cut thick and
propped on a delicious bacon-onion torta, or cake.</TE>
<TE>   Service is as friendly as it gets in New York. We're all aware of
what's at stake, and it elicits a touching sense of camaraderie.
We're here, defiant, eating out. It's a small step. And though the
staff puts a brave face on it, there's no forgetting where you are.
From my table, at the back of the restaurant, I can see a flare of
white klieg lights and realize that just blocks away the world drops
off. Yet when you emerge, a woman walks her dog; someone rides by on
a bike.</TE>
<TE>   Also new is Brasserie Les Halles Downtown, a few blocks from
ground zero. The original, on Park Avenue South, is infamous as the
kitchen where Anthony Bourdain, author of the best-selling tell-all
book "Kitchen Confidential" and star of the new Food Network TV
series "A Cook's Tour," is executive chef. The formula at this spot
is identical to the midtown location's. At lunch anyone who hasn't
reserved is relegated to a seat at the mahogany bar, piled with
glasses. Waiters ferry platters of oysters and clams, French onion
soup under coverlets of cheese, the pate du jour (definitely worth
getting), a dozen variations on steamed mussels and endless orders of
steak frites. A wine bottle sits on almost every table. It looks as
if downtown's appetite has come back with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   I'm ravenous. Next to me, a seasoned lawyer interviews a younger
colleague over a hefty steak sandwich on a baguette. To my left, two
businessmen speculate about what's going to be built on the twin
towers site while I cut into my onglet (hangar steak) with a
wood-handled "gaucho" knife. The steak is the real thing, chewy and
flavorful, and, from my small sampling, by far the best thing on the
menu. Aside from sitting a little too long before they were brought
to the table, my moules poulette, steamed mussels with a swirl of
cream and chives, are fine. The deep gold fries that come with it are
crisp but taste mealy, which often signifies precut frozen spuds. Why
am I not surprised that my tarte Tatin is burnt on the bottom? The
food, in fact, is at about the same level you would get in an
ordinary brasserie on any city square in France. It's the life of the
place that everyone craves more than any gastronomic experience.</TE>
<TE>   Just as we leave, a firetruck pulls up, and two young firemen get
out. Standing on the sidewalk, joking, they look heartbreakingly
young to be shadowed by all those who were lost that day. Meanwhile,
two blocks away, visitors line up near St. Paul's Chapel (where
George Washington prayed after he became president in 1789, and which
survived the attacks unscathed) and make their way to the viewing
platform, past the broken, soot-darkened headstones of the chapel's
ancient graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   The next day it begins to snow as we walk south along Hudson
Street in TriBeCa. In front of Danube, chef/owner David Bouley's
elegant Austrian restaurant, I notice a sandwich board announcing the
weekday three-course fixed-price lunch for $21. This is an
unbelievable bargain: Danube is ordinarily one of the most expensive
restaurants in the city. We walk in, and I remove my coat in a
jewel-box marble foyer. At 1:30 p.m. the restaurant is half full--a
few couples, the odd business lunch. Three generations of a
Russian-speaking family fill a long, festive table.</TE>
<TE>   With its white lacquered ceiling, plum velvet banquettes and
Gustav Klimt-inspired paintings, Danube's ornate dining room is a
vision of turn-of-the-century luxury. Outside the tall windows framed
by cut velvet drapes, snowflakes pirouette in front of scaffolding
hung with an American flag. The red, white and blue charges like a
freight train into the serene room.</TE>
<TE>   We know we are in for something serious as soon as the canape
arrives: a single ravioli made from translucent sheets of salmon
stuffed with a mild cheese and topped with a dollop of sweet-hot
mustard. Then come Schlutzkrapfen, supple cheese ravioli with smoked
wild mushrooms in brown butter decorated with drops of iridescent
red-green pumpkin seed oil. They could blow away with a kiss. As a
main course I choose the Kavalierspitz, traditional Austrian boiled
beef, which Bouley has elevated to something astonishingly delicious.
Dessert is a pear strudel with pastry as ethereal as snowflakes.</TE>
<TE>   That night, on the way to Pico, a Portuguese restaurant around the
corner from the Harrison, we pass Chanterelle, David and Karen
Waltuck's distinguished French restaurant. Peering over the sheer
half-curtains, I see that only a handful of tables are occupied. With
its chandeliers and towering flower arrangement, the restaurant seems
like a fragile vessel afloat in a sea of darkness. I'm glad we have a
reservation the next night.</TE>
<TE>   At Pico, as we wait briefly for our table, I notice a framed
document in an inconspicuous corner: It's an official thank-you to
the restaurant for services rendered to the city of New York in the
wake of Sept. 11, when Pico was unofficial headquarters for the
Secret Service; sleeping quarters for police, firefighters and rescue
workers; and dining hall for volunteers. Imagine the chaos. All I see
now is a serene space illuminated by handblown glass chandeliers and
furnished with ornate Portuguese armoires and sideboards.</TE>
<TE>   The food at Pico is updated Portuguese, and wonderful. You can
start with crisped bacalhau (salt cod) cake with a blood orange and
radish salad, or roasted fresh sardines stuffed with coconut and
malagueta chile. I particularly like the cockles steamed in vinho
verde (Portugal's "green wine") with bay and mint. The organic
suckling pig, with its crackling crisp skin and wildflower honey
glaze, is irresistible, but I also recommend the duck baked in
terra-cotta pots with chourico (chorizo) and served with rice dotted
with raisins, or the whole roasted rack of lamb, served with a fennel
marmalade. And for dessert, the sonhos ("dreams"), miniature fritters
scented with cinnamon, meant to be dipped in raspberry jam or a
bittersweet chocolate sauce. Study up on Portuguese wines before you
come, or the list may be difficult to decipher.</TE>
<TE>   As we walk in TriBeCa the next morning, billboards for luxury
condos and penthouse suites, many of them still under construction,
seem like notices from a past that has come and gone. Yet fashion
designer Issey Miyake's new flagship Manhattan store, designed by
Frank Gehry, has just opened across the street from the
neighborhood's favorite breakfast place, Bubby's. At this informal
cafe, which started life as a pie shop, things feel more or less
normal, though less crowded than I remember. And as a result of the
crisis they've lowered their already low prices. The quintessential
TriBeCa hangout, Bubby's was here long before a single investment
banker thought about living the loft life.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain bikes are chained to a pole out front, and winter light
streams through the big windows onto a casual room of mismatched
chairs, chipped painted plywood tables and bus-bench banquettes.
Downtown artist types, mothers with baby strollers, joggers and
people on their way to work stop by for banana-walnut pancakes,
hickory-smoked slab bacon and eggs over easy, along with Bubby's
seductive grits. For a toddler, a waiter brings out an old-fashioned
wood toy. Next to me, a blond woman in her 40s meets with a potential
financial advisor. "What are your goals?" he asks, a question that
takes on new meaning in a neighborhood where 9/11 is always on your
mind.</TE>
<TE>   At Chanterelle that evening, the dining room is full. The crowd
seems like regulars who have been dining at the chic French
restaurant for the past decade or two. Lawyer and power broker Vernon
Jordan is at one table, engaged in quiet conversation. At another,
some Upper East Siders are entertaining guests. It's a good turnout
for a weeknight, and I hope the fact that the sommelier is not only
serving wine but also taking orders and clearing plates doesn't mean
the picture isn't as rosy as it looks that night.</TE>
<TE>   The food is indulgent, old-style French cuisine from an American
chef with a passion for everything French. The format is prix fixe,
$84 for the less expensive menu, $95 for the six-course full tasting
menu. Though the choices change frequently, signature dishes such as
the grilled seafood sausage are always a good bet. It's a superb,
remarkably tender sausage with chunks of lobster and scallop, served
in a lovely beurre blanc, which makes it ideal with a white Burgundy.
Also recommended: Maine sea scallops with earthy lentils and black
truffles, and a classic saute of sweetbreads with sherry vinegar, and
crepinette of guinea hen wrapped in lacy caul fat to keep the bird
moist. For dessert, the prune-Armagnac souffle is terrific. It turns
out that on weekdays Chanterelle, too, has a reasonable fixed-price
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday night at Nobu, L.A. chef Nobu Matsuhisa's eccentric
TriBeCa Japanese place, it's definitely a local crowd--maybe because
it's raining hard, making downtown more of a committed trek. Though
Nobu was able to reopen about two weeks after Sept. 11, the manager
explains, they've lost the after-work customers from businesses that
have fled the area, and residents who had to move out after the
attacks are only now coming back. But for those of us who don't have
the patience for endless redialing, it's now possible to make a
reservation at this perpetually popular spot.</TE>
<TE>   The menu is an edited-down version of Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills,
but you can also simply ask for omakase (chef's choice), choosing
your price level. We choose the mid-range $100-per-person omakase.
Some of the dishes are appealing, like Kumamoto oysters warmed
improbably with a blowtorch and set off by a paste of monkfish liver
with a squeeze of yuzu--a tangy Japanese citrus fruit--or the chef's
signature sashimi garnished with jalapeno and citrus. Seared halibut
in a black truffle crust is an easy pleaser. Bottom line, though:
It's more difficult to get top-grade fish in New York than in Los
Angeles, so the quality of the sushi here is sometimes less than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon we stopped in at Harry's on Hanover, a stockbrokers'
hangout on the ground floor of a historic Financial District building
that sits on what was once the edge of New York Harbor. I heard
waiters murmur "Good to see you again" over and over as the lunch
crowd left. At the bar, the TV was tuned to MSNBC's stock report.
Harry's is a congenial place. It's basically a chophouse, New York's
version of Musso &amp; Frank, but with better wines from a famously
well-stocked cellar.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs is a private club called India House, but after 3 p.m.
the bar opens to the public. And at night the dining room becomes
Bayard's, the restaurant where Eberhard Muller (who cooked at Opus in
L.A. in the early '90s, then at Lutece in New York) is now chef. A
regal mahogany staircase leads to the second-floor dining room,
decorated with chinoiserie and paintings of ships. With its fine wood
chairs, white linens and widely spaced tables, Bayard's is a
civilized haven in a town where tables are usually crammed so closely
together that it's impossible to have a private conversation. And
it's worth going a good deal out of your way in order to taste what
Muller is doing at Bayard's.</TE>
<TE>   His oxtail terrine studded with nuggets of foie gras makes my
evening. I love a pale green celery root soup swirled with walnut
pesto, and the smoked cod, cured like gravlax and paired with peppery
arugula. There's an amazing tuna tartare with all its purity of
flavor intact, delicious with the grit of fleur de sel sea salt. The
special that night is a chicken breast topped with foie gras, wrapped
in crinkly Savoy cabbage leaves, steamed and served in a splash of
hyper-rich broth, worth the entire dish. I'd recommend the
slow-roasted veal shank for two as well, and the gloriously fresh
Dover sole. I'm still trying to figure out how to re-create Muller's
beguiling pear souffle.</TE>
<TE>   Dining downtown I'm always aware, like a compass needle pointing
north, exactly where I am in relation to the phantom buildings of the
World Trade Center. But dinner in this wonderful old building that
has lived through nearly two centuries of the city's history brings
home the fact that New York will endure.</TE>
<TE>   Back in L.A., I stop by a friend's house for tea and notice a
photo of the World Trade Center on her refrigerator. I don't think
anything of it until she tells me she took it on Sept. 10. I look
again. Taken from a footpath along the water, it's blurred in one
corner, but there in the distance, shimmering in the light, are the
twin towers, so improbably tall they could well be a mirage.</TE>

<DH>Viewing-platform visitors are witnesses to history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>One of the first things you see when you approach the viewing
platform that overlooks ground zero, the site where the World Trade
Center once stood, are the thousands of messages written on flags,
bedsheets, planks, teddy bears, T-shirts, hats--anything that can
hold ink.</LD>
<LD>   Pray for the victims who endured this horrific tragedy.... We are
strong and we will survive.... God bless our fallen heroes in our
hearts. Love, Phil, Deborah and Ashley.... God Bless America....
North Dakota is praying for you.... RIP from England.... New
Hampshire remembers all those lost.... Great strength. Honor, duty,
true firemen, true cops. We salute you. The squad. Syracuse Police
Department.... Sleep well America. The Marines are on duty tonight.
Officer Shane Keeney. Northern Correctional Institute.... Thank you
to all our heroes. May God Bless America. Greg Packer. Huntington,
New York, USA.</LD>
<LD>   It is more than a swelling stream of sentiment. The messages, some
written by people from as far away as Japan, are an attempt to heal a
hole in America's heart.</LD>
<TE>   In the early months after the attack, police and the National
Guard cordoned off large sections of lower Manhattan to anyone who
didn't live or work there. But those who managed to get through
wandered around the grim, almost deserted downtown trying to glimpse
the rubble through fences and over barriers. Fires smoldered where
the towers once stood, the air was toxic, and twisted steel,
shattered windows and building skeletons looked like the ruins of a
bombed city.</TE>
<TE>   Six months after the attack, the picture has brightened somewhat.
Downtown restaurants and some businesses have reopened. A posh hotel,
the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park, debuted recently.</TE>
<TE>   At the ground zero site, city officials erected a viewing platform
in late December, amid some objections that the idea was ghoulish and
disrespectful. But the platform proved popular, and in January
officials began a ticket distribution system so visitors can pay
tribute in an orderly manner. Free, timed tickets are now necessary
to gain access to the simple platform. Each group is allowed to stay
10 minutes or longer (depending on the crowds), then make way for the
next.</TE>
<TE>   What they see is a huge cleanup project swarming with hard-hatted
workers, heavy machinery and firefighters searching for lost
comrades.</TE>
<TE>   In the rest of Manhattan, major attractions that were closed
because of fears of terrorism have reopened. Many, like the Empire
State Building, have tighter security. But only a few places popular
with tourists aren't completely up and running: The inside of the
Statue of Liberty continues to be off-limits, for example, and tours
of the New York Stock Exchange, just blocks from ground zero, have
not resumed since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting the World Trade Center site can be a profoundly moving
experience. Some people stand alone with their thoughts; others share
their feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so much bigger than I anticipated," Tom Bach, a firefighter
from Seattle, said a few days ago as he stood on the platform. "It's
still very fresh. It seems like it just happened."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Sumner, who works in sales in Memphis, Tenn., stood nearby.
"I don't think in my lifetime we'll ever forget," Sumner said. "I
spent three years in the Marine Corps, and I wish I had on the
uniform now."</TE>
<TE>   Marking six months after the attack, two huge columns of light
evoking the towers are being beamed to the sky from a vacant lot
adjacent to the former trade center complex. The temporary tribute
will continue until April 13, but the intensely bright lights go out
each night at 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sphere," a bronze sculpture by the artist Fritz Koenig that
once stood at the center of the WTC plaza, was damaged but is now on
display in nearby Battery Park.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to see ground zero from the viewing platform pick
up their tickets at the South Street Seaport Pier 16 ticket booth and
are assigned times to arrive at the entrance to the platform, at
Broadway and Fulton Street, about a 20-minute walk away. Vendors
along the route sell souvenirs: hats with the logos of the New York
City police and fire departments, T-shirts, pictures of the twin
towers before the terrorist attacks and photographs of rescue workers
responding to the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The platform is not the only way to see the site, however.
Visitors can wander around the perimeter of the area and even take
pictures, which for months was not allowed. A particularly good spot,
according to one man who works in the area, is the corner of Church
and Vesey streets on the north side.</TE>
<TE>   For many people, the trip to the trade center is a pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had to come. We just felt we had to see it, so we drove
out," said a woman from Buffalo Grove, Ill., as she fought back tears
while she and her husband walked up the ramp to the platform. Both
declined to give their names.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including many New Yorkers, are reluctant to visit the
site. "I don't want to bring back those memories," said Sharon
Russell from Darien, Conn., as she hesitantly obtained tickets for
herself and her mother, Joyce Hall, who was visiting from England.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to see it," Russell said. "She knows a couple of
British people who were killed."</TE>
<TE>   There are several ways to pass the time between getting tickets
and showing up at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   South Street Seaport has a museum and walking tours of the
waterfront. One of the most appropriate local attractions is Fraunces
Tavern, a well-known restaurant at 54 Pearl St., which closed briefly
after the attacks. The building is where George Washington bade
farewell to his officers on Dec. 4, 1783, at the end of the
Revolutionary War.</TE>
<TE>   Heightened security is the hallmark of New York's major
attractions. Circle Line boats, which carry tourists from downtown
Manhattan to the Statue of Liberty and the Ellis Island Immigration
Museum, require them to go through airport-style metal detectors and
X-ray machines. Large packages and backpacks aren't allowed on
Liberty Island, and though visitors can't yet enter the Statue of
Liberty, they can still gather at its base.</TE>
<TE>   Just across the Brooklyn Bridge, at 1 Water St., is the River
Cafe, which has extraordinary views from its site on a docked river
barge. "When you look at the skyline, there is so much to see from
our setting. There are still a lot of breathtaking buildings," said
manager Scott Stamford. "Some people are not quite sure where the
trade center was situated."</TE>
<TE>   The Empire State Building, which has replaced the twin towers as
New York's tallest skyscraper, has also reopened. The 102-story
building, on Fifth Avenue between 33rd and 34th streets, was
completed in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   Before ascending to the observation decks, people have to pass
through metal detectors and put their belongings through X-ray
scanners. But it's worth it. Clear-day views can take in Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey--as well as lower Manhattan, where the World
Trade Center once stood.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: At Ground Zero</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: American, United and Delta airlines fly nonstop
from LAX to New York's JFK airport; restricted round-trip fares begin
at $298. American, Continental and United fly nonstop to Newark,
N.J.; fares begin at $278. Northwest, American Trans Air (ATA) and
Spirit have direct flights (one stop, no change of plane) to La
Guardia airport; fares begin at $268 on ATA. Additional airlines that
have direct or connecting service from the L.A. area include America
West, National, US Airways, Vanguard, Midwest Express, Frontier and
JetBlue; they sometimes offer lower fares.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing platform: Free, timed tickets, required for admittance to
the viewing platform at the entrance of Broadway and Fulton Street,
are available at the Pier 16 ticket booth of the South Street Seaport
Museum, (212) 732- 7678, at the foot of Fulton Street, about a
20-minute walk from ground zero. The platform is open 9 a.m. to 8
p.m. daily. The ticket booth is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets (maximum two to a person) are first come, first served.
Those who arrive at the ticket booth in the morning usually get

<HD>Barcelona Honors Native Son With 'Year of Gaudi'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle; Michael Moffett</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Barcelona this year celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of
Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926), the architect behind many of the
unconventional designs in Spain's second-largest city. For visitors
the International Year of Gaudi, which has its formal inauguration
Wednesday, brings six months of special tours and exhibitions.</LD>
<LD>   Gaudi, the son of a copper maker, largely bucked the neoclassical
and romantic trends that dominated his architectural studies in
Barcelona. He forged a new conception of space, which he filled with
fanciful forms, materials and colors. His works have long brought
visitors to Barcelona.</LD>
<LD>   For the anniversary year, the city will offer rare openings of
private buildings designed by Gaudi, including the first floor of the
Casa Batllo (9 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily) and the interior garden of the
Casa Vicens (open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily and 4 to 6 p.m. weekdays).
Visitors also can drop in to the city's cultural center for
perspectives on Gaudi's times and their influence on the artist.</LD>
<TE>   On a smaller scale, from June 17 to Sept. 24, the exhibit "Gaudi:
Arts, Trades and Design" at the architect's La Pedrera building will
invite visitors to contemplate furnishings he designed.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona's regular tourist buses are modifying their routes to
become "Gaudi buses" that will take visitors to nearly two dozen
points of interest, where entry is first come, first served. From 9
a.m. to 9 p.m., riders can get on and off as often they like for
about $12 a day ($16 for two days) for adults and $7 for children.
The tickets also are good for discounts at some museums, theme parks
and food chains.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting hours and admission prices for some exhibits were not yet
available as of the Travel section's press time Tuesday. Organizers
said they planned to post additional information by Wednesday at
www.gaudi2002.bcn.es/english/flash/home/G0.htm. Another useful Web
site is www.gaudiclub.com/index.asp.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii, Mexico Are Tops in Emerging Destinations</HD>

<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Hawaii bumped Las Vegas out of the top spot as the U.S. destination
that travel agents expect to be "up and coming" this year, according
to a poll released last week by a committee of travel agent groups,
airlines and the Airlines Reporting Corp.</LD>
<LD>   In explaining the change from a poll taken in 2000, Kathleen
Argiropoulos, a vice president at ARC, said Hawaii "has all the
elements of a tropical vacation, but you don't need a passport to
go."</LD>
<LD>   Reluctance to travel far from home was also reflected in the
international favorites. Mexico topped the list, followed by the
Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and the Caribbean.</LD>
<TE>   Australia, Italy and Ireland, which were among the top
destinations in 2000, didn't make the cut this year.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ynez Valley for a Song</HD>
<DH>Champagne dreams on a beer-lover's budget in Santa
Barbara's wine country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SANTA YNEZ, Calif.</DL>
<LD>I had just finished the first bite of a smoky barbecue tri-tip on
crusty sourdough and taken a sip of a Rhone red when a flash of blue
caught my eye, and I saw a bird land on a nearby oak tree.</LD>
<LD>   "Look!" I said to my husband. "The bluebird of happiness." Given
our contentment at that moment, the bird seemed an apt symbol, even
though I knew it wasn't really a bluebird but a blue jay. This wasn't
about ornithology, though; it was about pleasure--and about a
challenge we had set for ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Terry and I wanted to spend a lovely weekend without spending a
fortune in the increasingly upscale Santa Ynez Valley, a cluster of
towns--Santa Ynez, Los Olivos, Solvang, Buellton and Ballard--about
half an hour north of Santa Barbara. The valley, with its bucolic
vineyards, horse ranches and old oaks, is one of our favorite getaway
spots. But room rates at the high-end lodgings, including the new
Santa Valley Inn, are in the $200-to-$400-a-night range.</LD>
<TE>   What about folks like us, who might have a taste for champagne and
caviar but a budget more suited for beer and pretzels? Is there any
hope?</TE>
<TE>   Usually when we visit the Santa Ynez Valley, we stay in less
costly Santa Maria or Lompoc, or we just make a day trip of it. Once
we stayed at an inexpensive motel in Solvang, the capital of Danish
kitsch, and hated the experience.</TE>
<TE>   But in January, with saving money foremost in our minds, we gave
the town another try. The Solvang Gardens Lodge caught my eye partly
because its Internet site showed off-season rates starting at $49 per
night. The lodge was built in 1950, modeled after a Danish farmhouse,
and recently had come under new ownership. The rooms were being
upgraded one at a time, and judging from the Web site's pictures,
they looked pretty.</TE>
<TE>   When I called to make a reservation, all the rooms overlooking the
lodge's back garden were taken. But the reservations clerk said one
of the big suites in front was available; it wasn't remodeled yet,
but at $89, it sounded worth a gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours after leaving our Los Angeles home, we pulled into the
circular drive of the lodge, which is a couple of blocks from the
main tourist area of Solvang--another plus in my book. I held my
breath as Terry unlocked the door to our room. It was a full suite,
exactly as described: a spacious living room, complete kitchen,
separate bedroom and big bathroom. And, also as described, it had not
been remodeled. The furniture was vintage '50s but homey.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the weekend we peeked into some of the renovated units.
With cheery fabrics and new marble bathrooms, they were inviting. The
flower garden in back was even larger and more pleasant than it
appeared on the Web. I could easily imagine sipping a glass of wine
out there on a summer evening.</TE>
<TE>   But this was winter. So before setting out for dinner at a Santa
Ynez steakhouse called the Red Barn, we wrapped ourselves in scarves,
hats and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Barn is an informal place with red-checked tablecloths,
steer horns over the fireplace, and waitresses and patrons in Western
garb. The hostess gave us a table right by the hearth.</TE>
<TE>   The relish plate--carrot sticks, olives and hot peppers--was
another flashback to the '50s, and the steaks that followed were
satisfying enough to please the most ravenous cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning started on a cost-conscious note: continental
breakfast, included in the hotel's nightly rate.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed by a short drive to the town of Santa Ynez,
which leans heavily on its Old West heritage. Some of the buildings
date back to the 1800s, so the place can feel like a John Wayne movie
set.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed among the tack and feed-and-grain stores are shops for home
furnishings, antiques and clothing. Sales were everywhere, and I
couldn't resist a cozy red fleece jacket at 25% off. (Yes, we were
trying to economize, but isn't buying on sale a sound financial
practice too?)</TE>
<TE>   Our walk took us right by the Santa Ynez Inn, built to resemble a
Victorian mansion, which opened in October. It is one of the most
expensive places in the valley; its 14 rooms start at $245 and climb
to $395 a night.</TE>
<TE>   We were curious to see what that kind of tariff might get, so we
stepped into the ornate lobby, rich with etched glass and gleaming
woodwork. We also peeked into the breakfast room and the elegant
parlor, where guests partake of wine and hors d'oeuvres in the
evening. But we couldn't see the guest rooms; they were booked.</TE>
<TE>   It was luxurious, that's for sure, but certainly not as homey as
our lodge, I told myself, firmly suppressing a twinge of envy. The
price seemed high, and I wasn't too taken with the Victorian frills
anyway, which seemed a little fussy for the rustic wine-country
setting.</TE>
<TE>   We moved on, soon reaching the Santa Ynez Historical Society
Museum, which turned out to be one of the highlights of our ramble.
At the museum's Parks-Janeway Carriage House, more than 35
horse-drawn vehicles were on display: stagecoaches, a hearse, even a
surrey with a fringe on top. It was a fun glimpse of life before the
automobile. The well-to-do had a vehicle for every occasion, from an
elegant upholstered phaeton for evenings on the town to a lady's
delicate meadow cart for springtime pleasure drives to a plain wicker
cart for conveying the governess and kids.</TE>
<TE>   We felt humdrum getting back into our all-purpose '96 Integra. But
our trusty Acura led us toward our favorite money-saving strategy:
the picnic.</TE>
<TE>   We fetched sandwiches at the Corner Store in Santa Ynez, then
drove to a sweet little duck pond at Beckman Winery, where we
sometimes picnic in summer. This time of year, we found the landscape
had a Van Gogh kind of beauty, with rows of gnarled, leafless
grapevines casting stark shadows in the intense sunlight. (Visitors
who aren't as familiar with the region's wineries can get a free map
from the Santa Barbara County Vintners' Assn.; see the budget box for
contact information.)</TE>
<TE>   How were we to cap off our first day on the beer-and-pretzel
budget? With beer and pretzels, of course.</TE>
<TE>   The day's final destination was a brewery in Buellton. Firestone
Walker Brewing prides itself on traditional European-style beers aged
in oak barrels. In its handsome wood-paneled tap room, we sampled a
lager, two ales and a porter ($5 per person). After a taste of sample
No. 3--the dark, richly flavored Double Barrel Ale--my husband
declared, "Now, that's one tasty beer!" We liked it so much we bought
a case, congratulating ourselves that the bulk purchase saved us 25%
off the regular retail cost--certainly another fiscally responsible
move.</TE>
<TE>   We had been so good at economizing all day that we splurged for
dinner at Cabernet Bistro, a Solvang restaurant whose inviting
interior resembles a mountain chalet and whose French-born chef has
won praise from critics. Though not cheap, the entrees are reasonably
priced (about $17 to $27). Everything was delectable: an appetizer of
plump Santa Barbara mussels in puff pastry; entrees of duckling in
peppercorn sauce and a special called "wedding of Neptune," layers of
salmon and orange roughy in a light cream-and-caper sauce, both
complemented with wine; and creme brulee for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   The weather the next day was nice enough to let us combine three
of our favorite pastimes: wine tasting, hiking and picnicking.
Visitors who pay for wine tasting at either Curtis or Firestone
winery receive a glass that serves as a ticket for both. A short
hiking trail connects these sister properties, with picnic spots at
each end.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped first at Solvang's El Rancho MarketPlace, where
tri-tips were sizzling on the outdoor oak barbecue. Provisions in
hand, we headed to Curtis Winery, where $7 buys each person a
generous sampling of wine and a goblet to tote to Firestone.</TE>
<TE>   We particularly liked Curtis' 1997 Heritage Cuvee, a blend of five
red Rhone varietals. Cases of this wine were on sale for 50% off, so
Terry whipped out the credit card. Another shrewd fiscal maneuver, or
at least that's what we told ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   We pressed one bottle into service for a picnic on the winery's
knoll with a sweeping view of vineyards. It was here I spotted the
blue-feathered bird. All seemed right--the food, the view, the wine.
Our hike and a tasting at Beckman Winery lay ahead, but already we
had put together a fine weekend. We had eaten well, replenished our
larder and added to my wardrobe without breaking the bank. I like to
think our financial advisor would have been proud.</TE>

<HD>Darn All Those Nickel and Dime Hotel Fees</HD>
<DH>Even as occupancy drops, some hoteliers continue to tack
extra charges onto guests' bills, often without any warning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By all accounts the U.S. lodging industry had a dismal year in 2001,
perhaps the worst in two decades, and this year isn't looking much
better. Average occupancy fell by 5.7% last year, and room rates
slipped 1.4%, according to Smith Travel Research, which tracks
industry trends. For the week ending March 2, both figures were down
about 5% from last year.</LD>
<LD>   You would think harried hoteliers would try to avoid annoying
their guests. But that's evidently not the case with some of them,
judging from a small avalanche of reader mail tumbling into the
Travel section's bins. The top complaint: fees tacked onto room
bills, often without warning.</LD>
<LD>   There are resort fees, energy surcharges, California tourism fees
and, I've learned, even a "reservation processing fee." (Yes, a fee
for taking your room reservation.) Together with local and state
taxes, they can increase the bill by 20% or more.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to tell whether extra fees are becoming more prevalent
or whether money-conscious consumers are just getting crankier about
them. Statistics on the amounts and occurrence of such fees are hard
to come by. But several experts I've consulted agree on the solution:
Dispute the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get stubborn at the front desk on checkout, you may find
[the fee] is pretty easily erased," says Robert Mandelbaum, director
of research for PKF Consulting, a hotel industry research firm. Many
of the fees were imposed in the late 1990s or 2000, a boom year, "but
as the market gets soft there's been a lot of consumer resentment,"
he says. "Hotels don't have the leverage they used to have" as a
result of diminished demand.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a checklist of some add-ons that may show up on your room
bill, starting with the one I found most egregious:</TE>
<TE>   * Reservation processing fee: I was skeptical when I read a letter
from Judy Huska of La Crescenta saying the Riviera Hotel and Casino
in Las Vegas charged her $4.91 just for making a reservation--and
that it didn't disclose the fee until she checked out.</TE>
<TE>   Silly me.</TE>
<TE>   When I called the Riviera's reservations desk on March 5, the
clerk offered me a $79-per-night weekend rate for a room in April.
With tax, it was $86.11, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are there any other charges?" I asked. Yes--a $3-per-night energy
surcharge and a $10.90 charge for canceling a reservation any time
after making it, I was told.</TE>
<TE>   I asked her again if there were any other charges, and she assured
me there were none.</TE>
<TE>   What about the reservation fee? I asked. Only then was I told
there was an "automatic charge on checkout" of $4.91. I asked to be
transferred to a supervisor (she declined to give her full name), who
confirmed that guests pay the fee at the front desk. "We don't have
anything to do with that," the supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Riviera manager Geoff Robinson says the fee covers credit-card
processing, postage on the letter confirming the reservation,
post-departure correspondence and archiving and microfilming of
records. He declined to say why the charge wasn't included in the
room rate or disclosed at the outset, referring me to the hotel's
public relations office, which did not return several telephone calls
seeking comment. "If [guests] object, we'll be glad to take it off
the bill," Robinson added.</TE>
<TE>   If they notice it, that is.</TE>
<TE>   * Resort fee: This fee has begun appearing in the last few years,
partly to address a consumer complaint. "People felt they were being
nickel-and-dimed to death" by charges for towels, gym access and
other services and facilities at resort hotels, Mandelbaum says. So
these were wrapped into one fee, charged to everybody. Problem is,
not everybody uses these facilities.</TE>
<TE>   I called the Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
earlier this month. The reservations clerk told me it charges a
$14-per-day resort service fee, on top of the room rate, to cover
in-room coffee and tea, daily delivery of the newspaper, valet
parking, 24-hour access to the fitness center and access to tennis
and basketball courts. I called back and asked: What if I don't plan
to use those services? Do I still have to pay the fee? "It's a
mandatory fee," the clerk replied.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue with the resort fee is how and whether the fee is
disclosed. That's the subject of a $100-million lawsuit filed last
month in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
Westchester, against industry giant Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
Worldwide Inc., which operates the Westin Mission Hills Resort and
more than 700 other hotels. The class-action suit contends that
Starwood misrepresents the resort fee as a government tax and
sometimes fails to disclose the fee when the reservation is made.</TE>
<TE>   Starwood declined comment, citing the litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "In our experience, they never tell you about the resort fee
unless you really push them," says Peter D. Morgenstern, a partner in
the New York law firm that filed the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The Rancho Mirage hotel clerk told me about the resort service fee
when I asked whether there were any extra charges. In the hotel's
listing on Starwood's Internet site, www.starwood.com, the sales tax
and resort fee were listed as "room tax information."</TE>
<TE>   * Energy surcharge: Many hotels, including the lodges at Yosemite
National Park, imposed this "temporary" surcharge last year, saying
they needed it to cover spiraling costs caused by the energy crisis.
Initially confined to California, Oregon and Washington, it soon
spread to other states, provoking a spate of negative publicity.
Starwood is among several major companies that have ended the
surcharge, typically about $2 to $4 per room per night, as the crisis
has eased; Yosemite ended it Dec. 31. But the charge is still around.</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas the MGM Grand, Treasure Island, Caesars Palace,
Bally's, the Flamingo Hilton, Harrah's and the Rio are among hotels
that have ended the surcharge, according to the Las Vegas Advisor
newsletter. But the Riviera still has it. The Comfort Suites in
Carpinteria adds a $1.93-per-night energy surcharge, I was told when
I called earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   * And some others: You may also see a "California tourism" fee,
commonly 10 or 15 cents per night. Under a 1997 law, California
hotels have agreed to contribute $450 per $1 million worth of annual
sales to a state fund that promotes tourism. It's up to the hotel
whether it wants to absorb the fee or charge it separately.</TE>
<TE>   I'm indebted to reader Tim Seeley of Joliet, Ill., for spotting
this one: The Comfort Inn in Powell, Tenn., near Knoxville, charges a
"safe warranty fee" of $1 per night plus 13 cents tax for the in-room
safe. The fee is "automatically posted through the computer" but can
be removed if you ask on checkout, hotel manager Richard Settlemyer
says.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I feel safer knowing that.</TE>

<DL>SALAMANCA, Spain</DL>
<LD>My wife and I were frog hunting at dawn. Not for just any frog--for
the frog.</LD>
<LD>   "There. There it is."</LD>
<LD>   "Where?"</LD>
<TE>   "Down there in the corner, I think. See its legs?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Me neither."</TE>
<TE>   Janice and I were not in a swamp but at Salamanca University, the
oldest university in Spain, dating to the early 13th century. If you
think Harvard, founded in 1636, is old, consider that Christopher
Columbus used to come to Salamanca to run his ideas past its faculty.
The university was founded in 1218 by Alfonso IX of Leon, who
combined several existing schools into one institution.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere up among the cherubs and two-headed eagles in the
intricate design of the 16th century facade is the image of a frog.
Legend says that those who can see it will be lucky in their exams
and married within a year.</TE>
<TE>   We came here to learn (although not in formal classes), but we
would have no exams. We've been married for 32 years, so marriage
wasn't a concern. And we were in Salamanca, so how much luckier could
we be?</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Salamanca is like that frog. It's not that Spain has
hidden Salamanca; it's just that the city often gets overlooked in
favor of more obvious destinations--Madrid (about 125 miles
southeast), Barcelona, Seville, Granada. That may be why the European
Union selected Salamanca, a city of 160,000, as the "Cultural Capital
of Europe" for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The city will host special programs, expositions and recitals
every week of "Salamanca 2002." A festival of ancient religious music
will feature concerts and recitals throughout the year, for example,
and Van Morrison is scheduled to perform in June.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, our adult son, Paul, and I came to Salamanca in early
January to get a look at the culture it will share with the world. It
was our Christmas present to Paul; his gift to us was his expertise
in traveling in Spain on a small budget.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I should have listened to Paul when he advised that
"two stars" often means "no heat in January."</TE>
<TE>   Our hotel, Hostal Orly, seemed as though it should have heat;
otherwise why did it always smell of fuel oil? Nevertheless, when
darkness fell, so did the room temperature, and we shivered in our
bunks. But at $51 a night--for two rooms just around the corner from
the main square--we decided we could deal with it.</TE>
<TE>   We also learned, to our delight, that Salamanca is a city for
walkers. Aside from trips between the train station and our hotel, we
never needed a cab or bus. The town is compact, the hills are few,
and many of the major streets are for pedestrians only.</TE>
<TE>   Salamanca has many of those things we Americans prize in European
travel: quirky museums, a cathedral you could park a 747 in, a 2nd
century Roman bridge that leads into town from the road to Madrid,
and architectural details on the greatest of cathedrals and the
smallest of churches. This richness is accompanied by small-town
accessibility and college-town freshness.</TE>
<TE>   Salamanca's principal attractions have been here for centuries.
Even before the Romans, there were settlements on the banks of the
Rio Tormes. After the Romans, Visigoths (who called the place
"Salmantica") and then Moors ruled the region. The Moors' regime gave
way to Christian control in the early 12th century, and shortly
afterward construction began on the Romanesque cathedral, which still
stands next to its younger, larger sister.</TE>
<TE>   We began our tour in the Plaza Mayor, the 18th century town square
that is one of the city's two focal points. Here is the seat of
Salamanca's government, with the Baroque town hall forming the north
side of the square. On the east side is a carved stone pavilion that
once held box seats for Spanish royalty who viewed the bullfights
that took place in the square well into the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   The plaza plays a role in modern life too. People shop at the
stores along its perimeter and in its connecting arcades; they sip
their cafe, cerveza (beer) or tinto (Spanish red wine) at its sunlit
tables; they use it as a meeting place, a dining place, a courting
place. We used it as our breakfast place, eating chocolate pastries
and sipping coffee so strong that it makes me wince just to think of
it.</TE>
<TE>   The other major focus is the New Cathedral. "New" is relative, of
course; it was completed in 1733 after two centuries. It overpowers
its surroundings like a battleship anchored in a yacht basin.</TE>
<TE>   The cathedral's Gothic stone construction is highlighted with
decoration in the richly detailed Plateresque style, a term that
takes its name and flair from silversmithing (platero). Plateresque
surfaces look as though they come from tableware for giants, crowded
with curlicues, filigrees and flourishes. In a modern counterpart to
the university's frog legend, during a recent repair of the New
Cathedral's doorjambs, a whimsical stonemason is said to have worked
an image of an astronaut into the design.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cathedral, like bumpkins in Manhattan, we were
fascinated by its high vaults and domes and a pipe organ the size of
an apartment house.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday we went to the only Mass of the day in the adjacent Old
Cathedral of Santa Maria, which was built during the 12th and 13th
centuries. Its altarpiece has 53 gold-outlined panels depicting
scenes from the life of Christ, and it resembles a huge sheet of
perforated postage stamps. Above that is a panoramic painting of
Judgment Day.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mass we attended, I counted 18 people in the congregation
and 15 priests officiating. The organist and lectors were priests.
The youngest "altar boy" was about 50 years old. I'm not sure whether
such low attendance is typical, but never has my soul had such
individual attention.</TE>
<TE>   Salamanca has lots of places devoted to soul maintenance: There is
barely a block that does not have a convent, a monastery, cloisters
or a parish church. Their decoration may be fantastically Baroque or
piously plain. The Convent of San Esteban is a Plateresque
extravaganza, for example, while the plain, round Church of San
Marcos required us to find spiritual inspiration within ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as common as churches are university buildings. If
Salamanca reminded us of an American university town, it was partly
because so many of the people there are American university students.
An Internet search for "Salamanca" produced several hits from
stateside schools' study-abroad programs. Its attraction is
understandable: Salamanca is small, safe and an easy trip from Madrid
and other popular destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Not having found the frog in the facade, we went inside the
university's main building to see the drafty, centuries-old lecture
halls, the carved stone banisters of the staircases and a richly
ornamented chapel built in 1472. The 1508 library is a sort of
reliquary, an elegant vault protecting historic volumes rather than
spare parts of saints, as do churches.</TE>
<TE>   The main building lies across a pleasant courtyard framed with
rows of column-supported arches and now serves as the university's
museum. Inside is a 500-year-old fragment of the original library
ceiling, destroyed by the same earthquake that leveled Lisbon in
1755. We could see the painted signs of the zodiac against a deep
blue background. In its original condition the ceiling must have been
a distraction from reading.</TE>
<TE>   The venerable buildings aside, Salamanca is in many ways like any
university town, with inexpensive Internet cafes, souvenir shops
(selling frog T-shirts, frog beer mugs), the occasional loud party.
And cheap eats.</TE>
<TE>   In this last respect, Salamanca surpasses its American
counterparts because of that marvelous Spanish institution, the tapas
bar, an entire dining culture based on grazing. Once inside Casa Paca
or El Patio Chico, we had to work our way through the crowd to the
bar and fight for the attention of a bartender.</TE>
<TE>   Then we made quick selections from the serving dishes--some oily
chorizo; chanfaina, a local paella-like dish; stuffed peppers and
fried calamari, the true test of a tapas bar. The good ones were
golden rings with crusty outsides but tender interiors; the bad ones
tasted like fish-flavored gaskets.</TE>
<TE>   When it was time to leave, we fought for the bartenders' attention
again, as they were fielding orders from the length of the bar,
drawing beers, uncorking tintos, dodging scurrying colleagues,
watching the soccer game. When we asked for the check, they would
enter a trancelike state, trying to remember all the things we had
eaten, because they hadn't written anything down. So how do they keep
track? The total, I think, is an approximation--maybe high, maybe
low. But the bill is so cheap you won't care. We three often ate for
$12 or $15, including wine.</TE>
<TE>   Cruising for tapas became our preferred method of dining. Some of
the best meals I had in Spain I ate standing up in Salamanca. We had
them every night, sometimes working our way from one bar to another,
sampling the specialties of each. Tapas are best shared among a
group, because you can share the finds and misses--without
overeating. Tapas portions are just big enough for three people to
sample before you have to flag down the bartender for another order.</TE>
<TE>   We had more leisurely, sit-down meals at lunch, the main meal of
the day. At Chez Victor, near the Plaza Mayor, we enjoyed duck breast
in pink peppercorn sauce and grilled turbot splashed with a bell
pepper vinaigrette. At Restaurante El Bardo, near the university, we
had lamb so tender that I forgot that I don't like lamb.</TE>
<TE>   The small museums of Salamanca gave us a cultural buffet as well.
The Castilla-Leon Regional Film Library, about five blocks east of
the Plaza Mayor, for example, has a series of exhibits showing how
people went to the movies before there were movies. Shadow puppetry,
the zoetrope (an early demonstration of the principle that puts the
"motion" in motion pictures) and traveling magic lantern shows were a
big deal in the pre-CinemaScope world.</TE>
<TE>   Los Sonidos del Ayer (The Sounds of Yesterday), a museum of radio
receivers, occupies the large mezzanine of a modern public market
just north of the city's historic district. Overlooking the fish and
meat stalls are examples ranging from home-built crystal sets to the
big floor models that once commanded the living room to '60s
transistor radios.</TE>
<TE>   La Medida del Tiempo is a clock and watch museum west of the Plaza
Mayor. It holds gilded mantel clocks, wall clocks with pendulums the
size of bass guitars and an old tower clock, showing its finely
crafted innards.</TE>
<TE>   On the south edge of town, overlooking the river, Casa Lis
displays a collection of Art Nouveau and Art Deco works. We saw
glasswork and porcelains by Lalique and Galle, enamels from Limoges,
Kewpie dolls with expressions so realistic that I suspect they wink
at one another when no one is looking, and tableware and etched glass
vases. Casa Lis is itself a work of art too--appearing like a big
stained glass and wrought-iron bonbon box at the edge of the
cathedral and university neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The best view of Casa Lis is from behind and below it, down near
the Rio Tormes.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of our stay, we walked down to the riverbank, near
the Roman bridge, and turned around for one of those oh-my-gosh views
of the town. That giant cathedral, the red tile roofs, the bell
towers poking up like shoots in a spring garden--Salamanca has so
much to see.</TE>
<TE>   Even if we couldn't see the frog.</TE>

<LD>By most accounts, international air travel remains down 15% to 20%,
and bargain vacations continue to be prevalent in almost every resort
area and overseas destination to which vacationing Americans fly.</LD>
<LD>   Here is a selection of best buys available after Easter week and
continuing into June that seem typical.</LD>
<LD>   These prices are per person, based on double occupancy.</LD>
<TE>   Belize: This English-speaking Central American nation is probably
the hottest ticket in the tropics, partly because of the low cost of
vacations there. From early April through June, for $884, you'll
receive round-trip midweek air fare from Los Angeles and seven nights
in a beachfront hotel in the town of San Pedro on Ambergris Cay
(where the reality TV show "Temptation Island" was filmed). Capricorn
Leisure, (800) 426-6544, www.capricornleisure.com, makes the
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Rio de Janeiro: The low exchange rate of Brazil's currency--which
some have blamed for the economic crisis in neighboring
Argentina--has brought a torrent of tourism to Rio.</TE>
<TE>   From April to June 17 you can buy an air-and-land package to Rio
de Janeiro from L.A. for $849 from South American Fiesta, (800)
334-3782, www.southamericanfiesta.com/latimes, which flies you round
trip and puts you up for seven nights (with breakfast) at a hotel on
Copacabana Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Peru: Analie Tours, (800) 811-6027, www.analietours.com, offers a
colorful vacation package to Lima, Cuzco and Machu Picchu. For $779
(from April until June 2) the packager will fly you round trip from
Miami to Lima, put you up for two nights in that capital city and
take you for four nights to the Andean city of Cuzco, where you'll
have a full-day excursion with lunch to Machu Picchu. The price also
includes air fare and train transportation within Peru. West Coast
travelers can arrange their own air fare to Miami or have Analie
Tours do it.</TE>
<TE>   London: We've written about those winter air-and-land packages to
London that sell for only $399 from the East Coast. That miracle rate
disappears at the end of March, but it's good to remember that from
April 1 until June 12, the same package--round-trip air to London and
six nights with continental breakfast daily at a modest hotel--will
start at $599 per person, which is still less than air fare alone to
London would cost at that time. The add-on from Los Angeles is $150.
The tour operator is an Internet service called Go-today .com,
www.go-today.com.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal: You can spend a week in Lisbon from April 1 through May
31 for as little as $599 per person, including round-trip air fare
from New York on TAP Portuguese Airlines and six nights at a fine
hotel with indoor heated pool and rooftop restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   That's for a Tuesday departure; leaving on a Monday or Wednesday
is $659, Thursday through Sunday $831. Additional nights run $40 per
person, the single supplement $200.</TE>
<TE>   For details or to book, call (800) 223-1580, www.abreu-tours.com.
Check with the tour operator for good deals on air fare to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong: After a shaky start under Chinese rule (touristically,
that is), the former crown colony is again awash in visitors, partly
because of well-priced air-and-land packages there. From April until
June 9, from Gate 1, (800) 682-3333, www.gate1travel.com, there's
round-trip air from Los Angeles and five nights at the 400-room Park
Hotel starting at $789 per person. Extra nights are available at good
prices.</TE>
<TE>   China: Frequently asked to recommend the top tour to China, I
always answer that it's the 10-day, six-city air-and-land package
operated by China Focus of San Francisco, (800) 868-7244,
www.chinafocustravel.com. In May and June, for $1,259 from Los
Angeles or $1,199 from San Francisco, the package includes all meals,
guides, lodging and air fare to Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou, Qufu,
Tai'an and Jinan.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing: In April and May the single least expensive quick trip to
China is an air-and-land package to Beijing operated by China Silk
Tours, (800) 945-7960, www.chinasilktour.com. For $735 per person
($795 in June or July), it will fly you there from Los Angeles, put
you up for five nights at a fine hotel and throw in airport
transfers, seven meals and two full-day tours to the must-see sights:
the Forbidden City, Imperial Palace, Great Wall and Ming Tombs.</TE>
<TE>   Extra sights are slightly more. A similar deal to Shanghai is $785
in April or May, $850 in June or July. The single room supplement is
$120 for Beijing, $110 for Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand: The Kiwi currency has plummeted, and one U.S. dollar
buys 21/2 New Zealand dollars. Result: low costs for almost
everything. My advice for exploring this wild yet civilized country
is a motor home.</TE>
<TE>   For $836 through April, Sunspots International, (800) 334-5623,
www.sunspotsintl.com, will fly you midweek from Los Angeles to New
Zealand on Air Tahiti Nui and provide you with a Spirit Two RV with
unlimited mileage for eight days, a discount pass to several
attractions and the right to extend your stay for just a little more.
For prices on trips after May, call Sunspots.</TE>

<HD>European Lines See More Mediterranean Bookings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While many U.S.-based cruise lines yanked some of their vessels out
of Europe and back to North America for the summer season, some
European lines are seeing a resurgence of bookings for the
Mediterranean this summer.</LD>
<LD>   "After Jan. 7 we saw everything change," said Makis Xanatas, chief
executive officer of First European Cruises in New York, the U.S.
marketing arm of European-owned Festival Cruises. "We started getting
very busy, with bookings at the level of last year."</LD>
<LD>   Xanatas acknowledged increased bookings may be partly because of
less competition in the region than usual, with many lines avoiding
the eastern Mediterranean this summer. He estimates North Americans
make up only 20% to 25% of the company's passengers; most are
Europeans, primarily French and Italians.</LD>
<TE>   Festival's European Vision made its Caribbean debut this winter,
but bookings were disappointing because "so many lines sold cheap
that we couldn't compete," he said. "[This summer] we're sailing the
European Vision out of Venice [Italy] to the Greek Islands, one of
the very few cruise lines doing that itinerary."</TE>
<TE>   The ship will sail every Sunday from May 12 to Nov. 17, calling in
Dubrovnik in Croatia, and Corfu, Santorini, Rhodes and Piraeus (the
port of Athens) in Greece.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,500-passenger European Vision is the second of three ships
built by Festival Cruises since 1999. It debuted last June after the
1,200-passenger Mistral, which was launched in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The European Stars, also carrying 1,500 passengers, is to make its
maiden voyage March 29 on a seven-day western Mediterranean itinerary
from Barcelona, Spain, that will continue throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   The line would appeal to sophisticated and well-traveled Americans
of all ages who are comfortable traveling with passengers who speak
different languages and live different lifestyles (including,
unfortunately, a tendency toward frequent smoking).</TE>
<TE>   But passengers accustomed to the latest from Carnival, Princess
and Royal Caribbean lines might be surprised to find similar
contemporary features and lavish decor aboard the new Festival ships.
European Vision, for instance, has a climbing wall, a 24-terminal
Internet facility, a German beer garden, an English pub, a disco that
sees a lot of late-night action, a production team of a dozen singers
and dancers, a teen club, a children's play center, a miniature golf
course, a golf simulator, an enormous health and beauty spa operated
by Steiners, a 24-hour deck buffet and an espresso cafe.</TE>
<TE>   The top-category cabins, 133 mini-suites with balconies, carry
extra privileges, from a separate check-in area at boarding to a
dining room called the Pergola. Passengers assigned to the bigger
dining room, the Marco Polo, may also book a table in the Pergola
when space is available by paying a surcharge of about $17, or 19
euros. (The euro is the official currency on all Festival ships.)</TE>
<TE>   The mini-suites are spacious and well organized, with a small
entryway flanked by two closets, a bathroom with a long, deep tub and
plenty of storage. Because dinner seatings on European ships are
later, the first sitting is at 6:45 p.m. and the second is at 9:15.
Fares on the European Vision's round-trip weeklong sailings from
Venice begin at $910 per person, double occupancy, in late October
and November and increase to $1,220 in August, the high season.
Bookings made 120 days ahead of departure get a 15% discount.</TE>
<TE>   Because many Europeans vacation in August and usually take the
family along on cruises, we recommend the spring or fall sailings for
American couples who want a quiet trip. On the other hand, the summer
cruises, when the ship is filled with Italian and French families,
would be good for American families who want their children to learn
a little bit of a foreign language while playing in the children's
program aboard. Kids ages 2 to 17 get a price break, paying $520 to
$780 apiece for the third and fourth bunks in a cabin with two
full-fare adults; the price depends on the sailing date.</TE>
<TE>   The 720-passenger Azur sails from Venice from May 18 to Nov. 16 on
a seven-day round-trip schedule calling in Korcula, Croatia; and Itea
and the Corinth Canal, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Piraeus in
Greece. Fares begin at $590 per person, double occupancy, for cruises
booked at least 120 days in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The 720-passenger Flamenco cruises Northern Europe from Kiel,
Germany, this summer from June 8 to Sept. 7, offering two basic
seven-day itineraries with fares priced from $670 per person, double
occupancy, when bookings are made 120 days in advance. The fiords
itinerary sails the west coast of Norway, while the Baltic itinerary
visits Sweden, Estonia, Russia and Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   The new European Stars is scheduled to sail every Friday from

<HD>Take in Views From Las Virgenes Trail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For good views of the Santa Monica Mountains, ascend Las Virgenes
View Trail. The path traverses the new Las Virgenes View Park, a
stone's throw east of popular Malibu Creek State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Dedicated less than a year ago, the trail is a successful
partnership among the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, Las
Virgenes Municipal Water District and the city of Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   No marker announces the beginning of the path, but a thicket of
other signs along the way has much to proclaim: "Calabasas,
population 27,165." (Wow. Hard to believe the town has grown so
much.)</LD>
<TE>   "Tree City, USA." (Good show.)</TE>
<TE>   "Environmental Enhancement Mitigation Program Site." (Say what?)</TE>
<TE>   "Watch for Future Trails Planning." (We will.)</TE>
<TE>   An interpretive display at the trail head describes the flora and
fauna. On a recent morning I observed a surprising number of animals:
a western fence lizard basking on a sunny rock, a red-tailed hawk
flying over grasslands, mule deer browsing the brush, an acorn
woodpecker rat-a-tat-tatting against a tree trunk, a coyote jogging
along a ridge. It seemed incongruous that this wildlife show plays
out within sight of U.S. 101.</TE>
<TE>   The interpretive display leaves out one animal: the cow. Cattle
graze Las Virgenes View Park and the surrounding private property.</TE>
<TE>   On my hike, one black-and-white bovine blocked a narrow part of
the path. We faced off, me waiting for it to climb into the brush so
I could continue along the trail, the steer waiting for me to do the
same. (The animal with the patience--and the horns--prevailed.)</TE>
<TE>   The new park preserves major plant communities common to the Santa
Monica Mountains, including chaparral, oak and a riparian zone
highlighted by sycamore, black cottonwood, willow and bay. A valley
grassland contains rare purple needle grass and blue-eye grass, two
native species that have survived two centuries of cattle grazing.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Calabasas, exit on
Las Virgenes Road and go south three miles to Mulholland Highway. Las
Virgenes View Trail begins at the intersection's northeast corner,
where parking is limited. A better place to park is the southwestern
corner, on the border of Malibu Creek State Park.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful at this intersection. Traffic moves at high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Las Virgenes View Trail ascends north, more or less
parallel to Las Virgenes Road. Contemplate the scenery from a
trailside bench a quarter of a mile into the hike. After
three-quarters of a mile from the starting point, an intriguing
section of trail wanders along a narrow ledge.</TE>
<TE>   As the path twists and turns, the cacophony of city life recedes,
though views of Calabasas and the freeway get clearer. The trail
reaches a ridge and bends south along a fence. Sights include Castro
Peak and Goat Buttes in Malibu Creek State Park and Saddle Peak to
the southeast. Follow the trail as it loops atop the ridge and return
the way you came.</TE>

<LD>Normally, I would say give me a deserted beach any day. But this time
I welcomed the scores of families--especially the 350 children and
teenagers--who were sailing on Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the
Seas. I needed all the help I could get on that European cruise last
summer because I was traveling solo with my 13-year-old nephew,
Michael--the trip was his bar mitzvah present--and my 10-year-old
daughter, Melanie.</LD>
<LD>   When the two cousins had their fill of foreign sights or when they
were sick of spending time together or with me, the ship had plenty
of diversions: new friends, two pools, TV and movies, access to the
Web, all the food they could eat and a well-organized kids' club
staffed by energetic young counselors.</LD>
<LD>   The cruise provided a relatively stress-free way for me to
introduce the kids to some of Europe's sights--Michelangelo's "Pieta"
in Rome, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the ruins of Pompeii, Gaudi's
soaring unfinished cathedral of La Sagrada Familia in
Barcelona--without packing and unpacking, navigating from city to
city, missing trains or searching for hotels and restaurants with
tired, whining kids begging for a burger and fries.</LD>
<TE>   The same convenience would also enhance a first-time family trip
to Alaska, Hawaii or the Caribbean, especially when the needs and
desires of different generations must be considered. Let the littlest
cruiser take part in organized kids' activities while you sightsee.
Send Grandma and Grandpa on a bus tour while you kayak or snorkel
with your teens. Everyone can trade stories about the day's
adventures over dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I've always been an adventurous traveler, seeking out undiscovered
restaurants or hotels, or even finding a field full of sunflowers in
Spain where I could spread out my sleeping bag. I've tried to show my
kids the fun of not knowing what's around the next corner. But kids
don't always appreciate spontaneity. They need familiarity and
routine to feel secure. And grandparents may not have the stamina to
keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Even adventurous parents can use an occasional breather. I
realized that I was usually glad to return to the comfort of the ship
(and to the hospitality of the friendly, English-speaking crew) when
I didn't have another adult along to help entertain the kids.</TE>
<TE>   Sightseeing in the heat of summer, especially in a foreign
country, can be hard work for parents and kids, and the ship offered
us a much-needed respite. I was glad not to have to think about what
we were spending for breakfast or where we would have dinner. When we
went on one of the ship's excursions, I could just sit back and enjoy
the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we didn't soak up as much local color traveling by ship as
we could have otherwise. We didn't linger at picturesque cafes,
museums or churches. But honestly, even if we hadn't needed to return
to the ship, the kids wouldn't have wanted a bigger dose of culture.</TE>
<TE>   In Pompeii they complained they were hot. In Barcelona they said
they were tired. Michael refused to eat anything in southern France
until we found a cafe that served pizza.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the ship was as much an educational experience as
anything we saw or did while in port. Melanie played with girls her
age from Egypt and India. Our tablemates at dinner were a family from
Belgium with three English-speaking teens who peppered us with
questions about politics, music and fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Many families remain skittish about traveling overseas or flying
in the wake of Sept. 11. But for families willing to venture across
the ocean, cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean are offering some
good deals starting at less than $800 per person--less for kids
traveling as third or fourth passengers. Carnival will offer its
first European cruises at the end of the summer, while Princess has
expanded its teens' and children's programs.</TE>
<TE>   Alaskan cruises, too, are plentiful and affordable. Norwegian has
rates as low as $699 for inside cabins, with third and fourth
passengers in the cabin priced at just $149. Princess is touting
deals for $599, and Holland America is offering deals for $649, says
Stewart Chiron of Leisure Link, a leading cruise discounter. World
Wide Cruises can also help you get a terrific deal. Call Leisure Link
at (800) 878-1262; call World Wide Cruises at (800) 882-9000 or visit
www.wwcruises.com.</TE>

the major North American cruise lines, visit the Cruise Lines
International Assn. Web site, www.cruising.org. Cruisemates,
www.cruisemates.com, offers a family cruise guide complete with a
list of what's new for 2002. The International Council of Cruise
Lines, www.iccl.org, provides the latest updates on security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best thing about a family cruise: No one has to cook,
do the dishes or argue over the dinner check.</TE>

<LD>I agree with Robin Harrington ("Give Us the Mideast," Letters, March
10). It seems as if you have decided that all your readers are now
afraid to travel and want to stay safe in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   I led a tour group to Egypt last November, and my group was warmly
welcomed. I took another group in January, and we received the same
warm welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Please give us more stories on foreign destinations, especially
some exotic ones (not just Europe), and fewer on the U.S. Let us
decide whether we want to go.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding Harrington's letter: Perhaps there are no articles about
the Middle East in the Travel section because there are not a lot of
writers who are eager to travel to that part of the world since Sept.
11. I do not think The Times is being selective or prejudicial in not
publishing such articles. Does the name Daniel Pearl ring a bell?

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marshall S. Berdan ("Eco-Escapes to Central America," March 3) saw
only a handful of birds during his unguided walk at the Monteverde
reserve in Costa Rica. I visited Monteverde a few years ago and took
a walk with one of the reserve's guides, whose experience made the
difference. I saw dozens of native birds, including a quetzal.</LD>
<LD>   Our guide's ability to translate elusive sounds into bird
sightings was amazing. I would urge anyone who visits Monteverde to
pay the extra fee for the guide (and to take binoculars). Monteverde
and the guided walk were a bit expensive by local standards but worth
every penny considering the cost and effort of getting there.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kudos to Irene Woodbury on her piece about London's department store
food halls ("A Veritable Feast in the British Aisles," Feb. 24). I
have traveled extensively to London on business, and even though my
company provided me with a generous meal allowance, once I discovered
the food halls I was hooked.</LD>
<LD>   The variety and quality of the food as well as the value were
unparalleled. Where else could you sample different world cuisines
under one roof? London's department store food halls are the city's
best-kept secret and a wonderful way to stretch your dollar while
enjoying a unique dining experience.</LD>

<LD>I don't buy the argument that Internet-only fares discriminate
against retired folk ("Travel Agents Cry Foul Over Internet Fare
Deals," Feb. 17). We are the ones who have the flexibility to take
advantage of some of the restricted fare offers.</LD>
<LD>   I volunteer at Thousand Oaks' Telecommunity Center, a nonprofit
organization that assists people who want to make better use of PCs
and the Internet. There are no age restrictions, but seniors make up
the majority of the people we help. From this perspective, I see
Internet fares as an incentive to seniors to get connected.</LD>
<LD>   Is there inequality of Internet access for seniors? My guess is
that it is exaggerated by travel agents who want to use the concept
of deprived seniors to bolster their own cause.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Christine Brown traveled thousands of miles to take
this photo. Is it Arizona? Mexico? No, the cactus garden at the Getty
Center in Los Angeles, shot last spring. For Brown, who lives in
Collingham, England, the visit was her first look at the Westside
museum and gardens but not at Southern California. In the late '80s
she and her husband, John, were part of a yearlong teacher
exchange--she at Solano Elementary in downtown L.A., he at Corona
High School in Riverside County. The couple fell in love with
Southern California. "Everyone is so positive and forward-thinking,"
Brown says. "It's like an injection of new life." Last year's trip
was their third visit since the teacher exchange--but not their last.
"We could never stay away," Brown says. "California is part of our
heart." What they miss most: the people.</CP>

<DH>Andy Richter, the former sidekick of Conan O'Brien,
launches his own series and admits it's a serious game now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Richter has no complaints. He's happily married, the father of a
15-month-old son, and his new TV series, "Andy Richter Controls the
Universe," premieres this week on Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Richter confesses, though, that being happy doesn't make for good
comedy. "A content guy who is well-adjusted is not funny," he says.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Richter--the former sidekick on NBC's "Late Night
With Conan O'Brien"--doesn't have much in common with his reel-life
persona.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel that in many of the episodes his prime motivator is envy,"
Richter says of his small-screen alter ego. "I am not in possession
of much envy. I am pretty happy with what I have, and before I had
what I have, I was figuring out how I could go and get what I have
rather than sitting and looking at someone else. [The character] is
sort of me at about 16."</TE>
<TE>   The new series casts Richter as an overweight, looking-for-love
single bored with life and his job as a technical writer at a
heartless corporation that makes everything from fast-food fryers to
bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Narrating each episode, Andy keeps trying to create his own
universe by imagining certain moments so that they play out the way
he would like them to happen. For example, when he greets Wendy
(Irene Molloy), the young receptionist he has a crush on, he
visualizes himself as Superman, transforming various objects into
diamonds for her.</TE>
<TE>   No subject seems to be taboo in this "Universe." In one episode,
Andy learns his boorish boss has cancer; in another, Andy ends up
dating a beautiful woman who turns out to be anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   Andy's friends include Byron (Jonathan Slavin), the company's
oddball new illustrator; Keith (James Patrick Stuart), a handsome guy
who breezes through life on his looks; and his supervisor Jessica
(Paget Brewster), a longtime friend who he once tried to date.</TE>
<TE>   Though he entered into a deal with Fox for a prime-time series
after leaving "Late Night" in 1999, Richter had a difficult time
finding the right concept. "I had some ideas of my own I was
interested in developing, and through one reason or another--a
combination of my prime-time inexperience and also most of my ideas
[being] expensive--they really didn't work out. Part and parcel of my
development process was interviewing TV writers and trying to sort of
pair up."</TE>
<TE>   Enter executive producer Victor Fresco, whose credits include
ABC's short-lived "The Trouble With Normal." "I was a fan of his,"
says Fresco. "I had this idea already, and I thought he would be a
good match for it. I pitched the idea to Fox and they liked it, and
then I went to meet Andy, and he liked it."</TE>
<TE>   "He came up with what I call 'the gimmick,' and I mean that in the
most respectful sense--the fantasy sequences and the subject
narrative," says Richter. "He and I in conversation sort of came up
with the concept, the workplace and kind of people who would be
there. Then he wrote the script. It was a collaborative process, but
he did the writing.... I was the back-seat driver."</TE>
<TE>   Richter says that while he has had a great time working on
"Universe," doing a prime-time series is vastly different than a
late-night talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more a kind of grown-up atmosphere," Richter says. "The
'Conan' show was really not that far removed from what I was doing
[early in my career] in Chicago, which was getting together five
goofy friends, putting on a show and hoping that people would come
see it. We were very much left to our own devices, and there was a
real kind of 'Our Gang' feeling to the show.</TE>
<TE>   "This was [produced] in a big movie studio. We had a lot of fun,
but it's not the same. I don't think I will have as happy a work
atmosphere as I did on the 'Conan' show."</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Richter Controls the Universe" can be seen Tuesdays at 8:30
p.m. on Fox. The network has rated the premiere TV-PG (may be
unsuitable for younger children).</TE>

<HD>A Fourth on the Waterfront</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's too bad Huntington Beach can't move its holiday fireworks back
to the waterfront where they were until the 1970s, now that
redevelopment is progressing and the unruliness of the mid-1990s
fades in memory. But with some patience, it may happen yet, and the
city should consider it for 2004, the 100th anniversary of city
celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to second-guess the city leadership for this season,
given the trouble the city has had with rowdy Fourths of July. The
City Council by a 4-1 vote recently decided against restoring the
downtown waterfront fireworks enjoyed during a simpler time in city
history.</LD>
<LD>   A succession of unruly holidays taxed the resources and patience
of law enforcement officials and gave the city a bad holiday
reputation. Outbreaks of violence forced police to increase their
presence on a day intended for enjoyment.</LD>
<TE>   To the city's credit, collaborative efforts in recent years by
police, City Council members, community groups and others resulted in
better times on the Fourth. Meanwhile, the face of the downtown has
changed, as redevelopment brightened the shabby face of the zone
around the pier and created a better environment for locals and
tourists. It's a far cry from the days when the city was sealing off
downtown and making hundreds of arrests for possession of alcohol in
public. The city understandably does not want to return to the
bad-old days of firecrackers used as missiles and attacks on cars.</TE>
<TE>   The city's concern that the community may not be ready for a
return to the waterfront Fourth celebration is supported also by the
challenge of handling a huge influx of people downtown for the
fireworks. When more of the redevelopment is complete, it may be
possible to handle such a crowd. Now, it is easier to contain things
at a football stadium, and there isn't the big cost of a special
downtown police presence.</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth of July Executive Board, which evaluated the changing
landscape, hoped this year to bring the fireworks back downtown. It
should be encouraged to try again, because it would be nice to
accommodate more people and do so along the waterfront. The time is
not right now, but that day may come yet.</TE>

<LD>A man was in extremely critical condition Saturday after being pinned
beneath an MTA Red Line train. The 43-year-old man, whose name has
not been released, had been staggering around the Vermont/Beverly
subway station, said Lt. Larry Swanson of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Central Traffic Division.</LD>
<LD>   Onlookers tried to help him, Swanson said, but were unable to
reach the man before he fell onto the tracks about 4:45 p.m. The
lieutenant said there is no indication that the man jumped into the
path of the train.</LD>
<LD>   It took rescuers nearly 15 minutes to extricate him from beneath
the subway car, which weighs about 80,000 pounds, said Brian Humphrey
of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   The victim was in extremely critical condition late Saturday with
severe head trauma at County-USC Medical Center. Hospital spokeswoman
Adelaida De La Cerda said his chances for recovery were "not very
good."</TE>

<LD>Police sealed off the Beverly Center on Saturday as they sought two

seriously injured an elderly couple.</LD>
<LD>   Police were unable to find the man and woman in the block-long

into custody, said Officer Don Cox of the Los Angeles Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Police tried to stop the car for an unknown reason about 2:30
p.m., but it took off. Police chased the vehicle to the entrance of
the mall at Beverly and La Cienega boulevards, where it hit several
parked cars and struck two pedestrians, Cox said.</LD>

<DH>Education: District is set to reclaim West Valley campuses
leased to private academies. Two may remain private.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As rumors wafted through the Hughes Adult Learning Center that its
Woodland Hills campus might be turned over to a charter school, the
panicked students looked a block away and started asking questions.</LD>
<LD>   Why was the once public Collins Street Elementary School, which
would neatly accommodate Hughes' English, computer and parenting
classes, now being leased to Kadima Hebrew Academy, a private school?
Shouldn't public education come first?</LD>
<LD>   At a second Woodland Hills private school renting from Los Angeles
Unified School District, parents and administrators had their own
questions. After all the money Castlemont School had put into a new
sports field and other improvements at the former Collier Street
Elementary, why was the district moving to reclaim a campus it
admitted it did not need?</LD>
<TE>   In a compromise that seems to appease the public and private
schools involved, the Los Angeles district's Board of Education is
leaning toward extending at least two of its private tenants' leases
and reopening seven other campuses that have not been used for public
school children since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The school board is scheduled Tuesday to seek proposals for the
future uses of all nine campuses in the western San Fernando Valley.
Because the area's schools are among the school district's least
crowded, seven of the campuses have been leased to private
schools--among them, a Christian school, two Jewish academies, a
French school and an arts academy that employs study methods
developed by the founder of Scientology. L.A. Unified has used the
other two campuses for administrative offices and programs for
adults, at the Hughes center.</TE>
<TE>   The school district alerted the private schools more than a year
ago that their leases would not be renewed. Some have found new
homes; others are still looking. Castlemont and Kadima will probably
be allowed to bid on new leases for their campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Because LAUSD does not project needing more elementary schools in
the West Valley, the district has considered selling at least some
campuses now used by private schools. Bob Collins, superintendent of
the mini-district overseeing two of those sites, cautioned against
that.</TE>
<TE>   ''To sell the properties would certainly ensure that we would not
have those seats available when and if we needed them in the
future,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans are vague, though, for the seven campuses that LAUSD is
reclaiming. One could become a charter school and teacher academy,
both devoted to special education. (Charter schools receive public
funds but operate independently from their public school district.)</TE>
<TE>   Three more campuses are being considered for either traditional or
charter high schools to ease overcrowding and prevent Woodland Hills'
highly regarded El Camino Real High School from becoming a year-round
campus. LAUSD staff has not developed plans for the three remaining
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the possibility that the Hughes Adult Learning Center will
have to leave its campus to make way for a high school, Hughes
students and teachers worry that their new site might be less
convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most of the district's adult schools, the center offers a
full schedule of day classes, enrolling about 4,000 adults each year.
Hughes' unusual schedule makes it difficult for the school to move to
a campus used by children, and several students said they cannot
switch to a night school.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm not allowed to go at night,'' said Ricardo Soto, a Mexican
immigrant who cleans office buildings at night and joins his wife,
Marta, for English classes at Hughes during the day. While they
study, their 4-year-old son plays at the school's free child-care
center.</TE>
<TE>   ''To be together in this school has given us the opportunity to
study as a family, together,'' Soto told school board members at a
meeting last Tuesday. Board member Marlene Canter, who represents the
West Valley and proposed the motion affecting the nine campuses, has
promised the Hughes adult center will not close or need to alter its
schedule. But it will almost certainly have to move--sometime.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a great program,'' Canter said. ''There was never any
intent to not have a home for them.''</TE>
<TE>   Canter also praised the two private schools that will be allowed
to bid on new leases. ''There are two well-functioning schools,
albeit private, right now that are providing education for kids [and]
have been doing it well for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Castlemont School's director, Martin Duberstein, said the school
would prefer to buy its campus of the last 10 years but will settle
for another lease. Kadima Hebrew Academy is expected to pursue a new
lease.</TE>

<HD>Firm Hopes to Build Homes in Canyon</HD>
<DH>Growth: Developer first needs to get a boundary measure on
the Santa Paula ballot. Voters rejected a similar plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after Santa Paula voters rejected a similar plan, a
developer is preparing to place a measure on the November ballot that
would extend the city's boundaries to accommodate a large housing
project.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of the proposed Ranch at Santa Paula notified city
officials last week that they will begin circulating a petition
necessary to qualify a ballot initiative. The developer must collect
1,073 signatures, representing 10% of the city's registered voters.</LD>
<LD>   If the measure is approved by the electorate, Arizona-based
Pinnacle Development Group would be allowed to build in Adams Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   The project calls for 1,980 single-family homes, 180 condominiums,
90 apartments, two schools, hotels and a retail shopping
complex--creating an upscale suburb northwest of the mostly Latino
and working-class city of 29,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time, the argument [against the ballot measure] was,
'You're going to get a bunch of rich white guys to come in here and
they're not going to do anything for you,'" said Pinnacle President
John E. Lang, whose firm was not involved in the debate two years
ago. "That's not what we're trying to accomplish. We want a win-win
for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the project would bring needed tax revenue, jobs
and amenities to a cash-strapped city that struggles to pay its
police officers, maintain its roads and keep its businesses alive.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to do something positive for this community," said City
Councilman Don Johnson, who owns the local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the City Council felt that way in 1998, when it
included Adams Canyon in the city's annexation plans. Then in 2000,
the state agency that guards against urban sprawl reversed its
position and blocked the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   But there are long-standing opponents of development in 5,413-acre
Adams Canyon. Slow-growth activists warn of environmental damage and
object to a doubling of the city's geographic size.</TE>
<TE>   A group of social activists also has argued for years that
development in the canyon would change the character of a city that
is now two-thirds Latino by importing upper-class white homeowners.
In the process, those activists say, the poorer parts of the city
would be abandoned and the increasing political power of Latinos
diluted.</TE>
<TE>   Those same activists helped prompt the U.S. Department of Justice
to file a lawsuit against the city in 2000, alleging that its
at-large voting system has perpetuated racial discrimination by
preventing Latino candidates from being elected to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The racially and politically charged case was resolved last year.
As part of the city's settlement with the federal government, voters
will decide this November whether to switch from the current system
to one that would divide the city into council districts.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 2000, voters approved a SOAR growth-control ordinance that
allowed the city to extend its boundaries into 2,173-acre Fagan
Canyon. But the ordinance requires voter approval for development of
Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   To win voter support for Pinnacle's development plan, Lang has
pledged to spend more than $1 million on a public relations campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Richard Francis, who crafted the SOAR ordinance, said
Pinnacle's effort is disingenuous. The developer has yet to complete
any environmental review or detailed planning that might give the
community enough information to decide whether the project is a good
one, he said.</TE>

<HD>Tragedy Leaves Troubling Questions</HD>
<DH>Marin County: Some neighbors noticed odd behavior by
'family' of 5 adults, 13 kids. Toddler's death makes many wonder if
anything could have been done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL</DL>
<LD>In the days after sheriff's deputies surrounded the neat tract house
at 35 Mt. Muir Court and arrested five people accused of starving and
otherwise abusing the 13 children who lived inside, someone
spray-painted the garage with the words, "It takes a village."</LD>
<LD>   To Malcolm Sullivan, the ruddy-faced retired engineer who lives
next door, the meaning was clear. He and other neighbors should have
noticed something was wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, said Sullivan, it was strange the way the children played in
complete silence in the backyard. And the way that whenever anyone
left the house, they would back a van with tinted windows into the
garage first so nobody could see who was getting in.</LD>
<TE>   But there was normalcy, too, he said while talking over his
kitchen counter recently. One of his new neighbors brought over a
bottle of ginseng one day. "I am the roommate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   How was he to know, Sullivan said, that she was one of four women
next door who had given birth to the children crowded in there? The
father was Winnfred Wright, a charismatic, dreadlocks-wearing former
social worker who, according to court records and interviews,
recruited women to serve him and have sex with him to work off the
bad karma of their white race.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me put it this way: It wasn't out of normal enough for us to
interfere in a politically correct world," Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody interfered until after Nov. 13, when the lifeless,
emaciated body of Ndigo Wright, 19 months old, was brought to a
hospital in Terra Linda. Court documents say the boy died of severe
malnutrition and neglect. He was "frighteningly small," according to
prosecutors. Investigators said he had rickets, caused by a severe
deficiency of vitamin D almost unknown in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The other 12 children, ranging from 8 months to 16 years old,
suffered varying degrees of malnutrition. Several were "obviously
deformed," according to prosecutors. They were taken from the home
and an investigation began that last month resulted in the arrests of
all five adults, on charges ranging from second-degree murder to
involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Four remain in jail, while the fifth and newest member of the
household, Kali Polk-Matthews, 20, is out on bail. None has entered a
plea yet; their lawyers say they are slogging their way through the
900-page grand jury transcript.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid tainting potential jurors in Marin County, a local judge
has sealed police reports and the grand jury transcript, and
forbidden attorneys, law enforcement officers and others in the case
to give interviews.</TE>
<TE>   However the case turns out, locals are wondering whether something
has gone sour in this famously off-center haven for ex-rock stars and
New Age gurus. Marin's proud celebration of the alternative and the
unusual had earlier come in for a public pounding with the capture of
John Walker Lindh, the American accused of fighting with the Taliban.
Former President Bush referred to him as "some misguided Marin County
hot-tubber," a remark for which he later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you live on a block with 13 children in a home and not
know it?" said Margaret Brodkin, executive director of a Bay Area
children's services agency. "What horrifies me is that something this
devastating was going on in our midst in a normal community. Of
course, what does normal mean anymore?"</TE>
<TE>   Judy Campbell, a producer at San Francisco public radio station
KQED, said the tale of the group that has come to be called the
Family "is a very Marin story: the white guilt thing, the New
Aginess. Also the fear of reporting it."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the defendants believe the public is getting a
wildly distorted picture of the group. In interviews before the judge
imposed his gag order, they described the group as peaceful and
caring, vegetarians who shunned modern medicine and believed in home
schooling. In court documents, Wright's attorney, Mary Stearns of San
Rafael, denounced media coverage of the case as "inaccurate, racist
and inflammatory."</TE>
<TE>   As for their secretiveness, one attorney said the group members
avoided contact with the outside world because they knew their
lifestyle would be frowned on. And as for charges of abuse, a
relative of one of the women told the daily Marin paper he never saw
anything wrong and in fact witnessed "a lot of happiness" in the
home.</TE>
<TE>   The group consisted of Wright, 45, Carol Bremner, 44, Deirdre
Wilson, 37, Mary Campbell, 37, and Polk-Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   The women came from mixed backgrounds. One was the granddaughter
of the founder of Xerox Corp., according to press accounts, and
another worked in a hotel. They appeared to have been highly educated
and idealistic. Bremner, an anti-apartheid activist in the '70s, was
known to friends as Carol the Saint, the Associated Press reported.
Polk-Matthews organized food and clothing drives for battered women.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of Strict Rules and Whippings</TE>
<TE>   The head of the household was Wright, a muscular black man just
under 6 feet. According to the search warrants reported by the Marin
paper before they were sealed, the children were forced to live by a
Book of Rules that sanctions ceremonial whippings for violations.</TE>
<TE>   Other punishments included taping the children's mouths shut and
force-feeding them jalapeno peppers. One girl said she was tied to a
playpen each night for two weeks as punishment for sneaking food.</TE>
<TE>   At the house on Mt. Muir recently, two pots of red peppers stood
on the front porch. The lawn was overgrown, but otherwise it looked
much like the rest of the houses on the block, set in a rural
subdivision adjacent to a creek.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities began hearing about Wright and his adherents more than
a decade ago, when Wright's 3-month-old daughter, named She, died in
San Francisco, where the group lived for a time.</TE>
<TE>   Decade-old police reports reviewed by the San Francisco Chronicle
said the infant had been dead three days and was kept at home in a
swinging hammock to give the baby's soul time to leave the body.</TE>
<TE>   There were no signs of malnutrition, and the coroner declared the
death of She W. to be "sudden death in infancy." San Francisco's
current coroner, Dr. Boyd Stephens, announced last month that he may
reopen the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cult expert Margaret Singer said she was called in by police in
1992 to interview the mother of the dead baby, who eventually fled
the group. "There were about five ladies living with him then," the
frightened woman told Singer.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a little kid with her, and she was really scared. She
said he threatened them with a gun," said Singer, 80, a professor
emeritus in psychology at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Singer said Wright had apparently preached no particular religion
but adopted some Rastafarian beliefs. In a motion opposing bail,
Marin County Dist. Atty. Paula Freschi Kamena suggested that the
group shared an apocalyptic vision: Wright ordered the women to take
target practice with squirt guns in the streets of San Francisco to
prepare for the "fall of Babylon."</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1992, Singer was told by the group member she interviewed
that Wright also focused on the need for white people to exculpate
past sins against blacks. "He was telling them they had bad karma and
needed to work it off," Singer said. "The way they could do it was
having sex with him and supporting him." The women living with Wright
were not without resources; they were middle class and educated. But,
Singer said, "Education and wealth are no vaccine against getting
tricked."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how the group supported itself, but at least two of
the women now jailed held jobs, one for a local painting contractor.
Bremner had been with him since the mid-'80s and was, the prosecution
maintains, the recruiter dispatched into the streets of San Francisco
to solicit new women members. In years past, she would invite them to
have their pictures taken for a woman-themed mural project, according
to police reports cited by the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the house and relaxed, the women might be asked to read
aloud from the Bible. One potential recruit said she smoked a
cigarette that made her pass out. When she woke up, according to the
reports, she was surrounded by women, who told her she was Eve and
Wright was Adam.</TE>
<TE>   She ran away after he tried to have sex with her, said the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the group settled into the home on Mt. Muir
Court. Malcolm Sullivan and his wife, Irene, welcomed them the way
they would any new neighbor. He offered to haul off some of the trash
left over from moving; she took over a plate of brownies.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to get close," said Irene Sullivan. "We didn't have any
success."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Says Children Were Oddly Silent</TE>
<TE>   People along Mt. Muir Court, a quiet street of $600,000 homes, now
concede that they noticed odd things. Sullivan recalled that when the
children played in the yard, the only sound was the plastic wheels of
their tricycles rolling around on the patio. He never heard the kids'
voices, or laughter.</TE>
<TE>   After the house was raided in connection with the death of Ndigo,
the Marin paper published reports that the child's diet of tea and
supplements left him thinner and thinner. The night he died, he was
having trouble breathing, so he was placed in front of the television
to stimulate his brain, the Marin paper said, citing the search
warrant affidavits.</TE>
<TE>   Surprised and saddened by the events alleged next door, Sullivan
is hurt by suggestions in the press and on radio talk shows that he
and the other neighbors failed to be vigilant enough. "If people are
trying to blame us, that bothers me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the case should be a wake-up call for Marin.</TE>
<TE>   "To be connected, you can't be politically correct," said Michael
Pritchard, a Marin social worker and filmmaker who works with
troubled youths. "You can't say, 'Oh my gosh, that's a big
Rastafarian. I can't say anything because someone might think I'm a
racist.' Children were starving."</TE>

<HD>Bread Bank Blessed by Multiplying of Loaves</HD>
<DH>Four years after its humble beginning, the pantry in
Whittier now hands out more than 6,000 loaves each week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jerry Barquera does more than preach the word of God. He
provides many with their daily bread.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a blessing to have someone like Father Jerry out here to
help the community," said Terry Nuno as she collected a few loaves of
fresh wheat bread from Barquera's Whittier bread bank. "Bread is
something essential. It's breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's great that
he does this."</LD>
<LD>   The Jehovah Jireh Bread Bank has operated quietly in a small
church in Whittier for almost four years, growing every day thanks to
what Barquera describes as a series of "blessings from God."</LD>
<TE>   "We have grown every day since we started this," said Barquera,
who speaks passionately about the Bible and the many loaves of bread
stored in the tiny church on the 11400 block of East Whittier
Boulevard, flanked by a vacant lot and a paint store. "Sometimes it
feels like we are going to explode with all this bread."</TE>
<TE>   The church, which operates under World Harvest Ministry, is easy
to overlook when driving down busy Whittier Boulevard, but close to
200 residents stop by on Fridays to pick up bread during the
first-come, first-served distribution. Some also help Barquera
throughout the week with his bread pickups and drop-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Ray Flasco, 56, discovered the church and bread bank
about three years ago and has helped ever since. Flasco, who owns a
carpet cleaning business about a block from the church, walked in one
day, and Barquera explained to him what all the bread was about.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fantastic what Jerry is doing," said Flasco, who
usually accepts a few loaves of bread in return for carpet cleaning
at the church. "He spends a lot of time here and he has helped make
this bread bank a success."</TE>
<TE>   The giveaway has expanded like a nice sourdough, making bread
storage much more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The church is not traditional. The building once held a business,
and there are no stained-glass windows, no large double doors. It has
enough pews to comfortably seat 100, and parishioners sometime share
the pews with loaves of white and wheat bread. Hundreds of loaves are
stacked in the back of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Barquera's congregation has grown accustomed to the mixed scents
of potato, sourdough and raisin bread during prayer services.</TE>
<TE>   Barquera and volunteers at his church hand out more than 6,000
loaves of bread each week to about 25 churches in the area, a few
senior homes, two Veterans of Foreign Wars posts and the Salvation
Army. Some of his regular customers are officials of a Tijuana
prison, good for 800 loaves every Monday.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tough job sometimes, says Barquera, but "the rewards are
worth it."</TE>
<TE>   From Monday through Saturday, Barquera and others will make about
four trips to bakeries in La Mirada, Montebello and Pico Rivera to
pick up bread. Lately, Barquera also collects boxes of Entenmann's
pastries from local bakeries. "The kids love them."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Joe Reyna from East Los Angeles has worked with Barquera
for about three years, helping him when things first began to pick
up. Reyna, known in the community as "Father Rock," does all he can
to make sure the bread gets to its destination, whether it calls for
arriving at a bakery at 6 a.m. or fixing the starter on the church's
station wagon to make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much bread that we have to pick up every day," said
Reyna. "Sometimes it looks like it is too much bread that we have,
but in the end, we give it all away."</TE>
<TE>   It was much slower in the beginning. In his first year, Barquera
had only 125 loaves guaranteed each week from a local bakery, and
they went primarily to parishioners of his church. The 60-year-old
pastor continued to ask bakeries and markets if they would help stock
his bread bank and some agreed, such as Bimbo Bakeries in La Mirada,
which donates about 3,000 loaves a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We were blessed that we were able to get the bread," said
Barquera. "Bimbo bakery has been great since the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Then more blessings. Local markets gave him orange and fruit
juices to pass out with the bread. Bags and bags of donated clothing
and shoes sit in Bible study rooms. Now Barquera is trying to save
enough money to rent a warehouse to store his bread.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Barquera has embarked on a side gig: repairing old,
discarded bicycles for children. He has about 50 rusting, BMX-style
bicycles behind the church just waiting for a new set of tires and a
fresh coat of paint.</TE>
<TE>   "These bikes may not look like much," Barquera said, "but they are
going to make a young child extremely happy. Plus, many of these
families just do not have the money to pay for a new bike."</TE>
<TE>   About 18 months ago, it was another blessing that saved the bread
bank from being toast. A closed-down glass and mirror shop next door
caught fire, and as the flames started to spread, Barquera and his
neighbors desperately grabbed garden hoses to protect their church.
Firefighters saved the day, arriving just as the fire started
singeing the church roof.</TE>
<TE>   A hand-painted "Bread Today" sign, put out Friday mornings,
advises the community that the doors of the Jehovah Jireh Bread Bank
are open. Lines of people then go through and pick out everything
from hamburger and hot dog buns to sandwich bread. Some of the bread
is valued at close to $4 a loaf at markets. Barquera accepts
donations, but they are not required.</TE>
<TE>   And although the bread bank is officially open on Fridays, if
people show up on another day, they are not turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone needs bread, we will not turn them down," Barquera
said. "The bread is for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jehovah Jireh Bread Bank is at 11428 E. Whittier Blvd. Bread
is distributed to the public on Fridays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Bills Aim to Make Students Healthier</HD>
<DH>Education: A package of proposals is the result of state
lawmakers' concerns that many children are struggling because they
are ill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Concerned that many California students are struggling in the
classroom because they are ill, state lawmakers this year are
advancing a package of legislation to improve the health of children
in public schools.</LD>
<LD>   Capping eight months of work and four hearings around the state,
the Select Committee on California Children's School Readiness and
Health has released a report that links poor classroom performance
with health problems.</LD>
<LD>   Though the report's findings are largely based on anecdotal
evidence, lawmakers concluded that more empirical studies are
needed--and so are measures that ensure California children are sound
of body and mind as they try to learn.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to consider school health in an academic framework," said
Assemblywoman Wilma Chan (D-Alameda), the lawmaker leading the push.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and 1960s, Chan said, school health programs were
largely limited to immunizing children against polio and other
contagious diseases. Though that has begun to change, she said,
government is still doing far too little to help poor parents make
sure children are ready to learn when they enter the classroom--even
as the state spends more money trying to improve academic
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the greatest and most hurtful challenges is watching a kid
who is ill, sitting in that seat, trying to learn," said Nancy Waltz,
a union representative at the San Juan Unified School District in
Sacramento County who spent 24 years as a teacher. Waltz spoke on
behalf of the California Teachers Assn., one of the state's most
powerful labor unions, which supports the package of bills.</TE>
<TE>   A number of the proposals, which have only recently been
introduced, seek to improve access to existing government efforts,
such as encouraging more schools to apply for school breakfast
programs. And some would force health maintenance organizations to
foot more bills by requiring HMOs that contract with the state to
cover the costs of prenatal exams, to name one example.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the measures seek to create new or greatly expanded
programs--including bolstering dental care for children without
health coverage, increasing funding for early treatment of mental
health problems and training preschool teachers to spot problems--and
would clearly cost money.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when California is facing a projected $17.5-billion
budget shortfall, Chan concedes that expanding social services will
almost certainly prove difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a similar effort to tackle problems in the state's
foster care system largely fizzled when money for the proposed
enhancements dried up.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps its most explosive recommendation, the school readiness
report makes a passing reference to a proposed tax on soft drinks
being promoted by state Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) as a
possible funding source for some of the school health improvements.</TE>
<TE>   But Chan, who has written legislation to study whether to tax junk
foods, believes the Ortiz measure is a longshot at this time. Though
there is little money now to combat the problem of sick children at
schools, Chan said lawmakers can begin to chip away at it this year
as part of a five-year plan. The Legislature's burgeoning Women's
Caucus has made children's health a top priority this session.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to enforce the importance of an issue," Chan said.
"Obviously in the long run, these things are going to cost."</TE>

<HD>Sleek Crew Boat to Carry Memory of a 9/11 Victim</HD>
<DH>Sports: Orange Coast College names new vessel after rower
Rob Jordan, killed in World Trade Center attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing at the helm of his launch in the middle of Newport Harbor on
a crisp, sunny morning, David Grant thought back to the hundreds of
students who had rowed for him.</LD>
<LD>   And one name stood out: Robert Thomas Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   "Physically, he could do anything," said Grant, coach of the
Orange Coast College men's varsity crew team for 38 years. "Mentally,
he was prepared to do whatever it took. Rob was special."</LD>
<TE>   Today, during an 11 a.m. ceremony at the school's waterfront crew
center, a new eight-oar shell will be christened in Jordan's memory.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 34, was killed Sept. 11 at the World Trade Center, where
he was a bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald LP, which had several
floors of offices high in the north tower.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was a crew captain for Grant's team, rowing for the Orange
Coast Pirates in 1988 and '89. He and Grant remained close. Grant
once joined him for dinner at the World Trade Center and the two had
dinner in Newport Beach just a week before the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember leaving that dinner thinking that here was a young man
as close to Superman as anyone I'd ever known," Grant said. "He had
it all."</TE>
<TE>   The new 60-foot shell, made of Kevlar and carbon fiber, was
donated to the college by a memorial fund founded by Jordan's family.
"Rob Jordan," in black letters, decorates the bow. The vessel cost
$25,000; the eight oars an additional $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best boat we've ever had," Grant said. "It's what they
use in the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's wife and mother are expected to attend today's ceremony
at Orange Coast's Sailing Center, 1801 W. Coast Highway. The event
also will start the annual Alumni Regatta, where crew teams from 10,
20, and 30 years ago return to row again.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Coast is the only community college in the nation with a
rowing team, which means the school competes against universities.
The school has participated in regattas in Britain a dozen times
since Grant has been coach.</TE>
<TE>   For Grant, today's dedication and the regattas ahead mark a final
voyage. Grant, who had served as the college's president until 1995,
will step down as coach at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to Orange Coast in 1964 as a history teacher; the
president said the crew team was a mess and he needed someone to
straighten it out."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Grant's teams have won numerous regattas, and in 1984
Grant was one of three coaches for the U.S. Olympic crew team.</TE>
<TE>   "No other sport has such symmetry," Grant said. "When it's
perfect, it is oh-so perfect. There's enormous satisfaction in
working together, perfectly together."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Moore, Grant's assistant and a Pirate crew member in the
late '60s, credits Grant with making the program grow.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was here as a student, we had a Quonset hut and a few
boats. Now we have this great boathouse, all these boats, and it's
all because of Dave," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said Grant's teaching goes well beyond crewing.</TE>
<TE>   "What Dave teaches is that you can do more than you thought you
could. And that carries over to your academics. But also, he makes it
fun, and that carries over to the rest of your life."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's family asked Grant to speak at a memorial service in
Weston, Conn., on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   During the memorial, Grant recalled meeting Jordan at the
boathouse after Jordan returned from what was supposed to have been a
short trip in the harbor in a solo scull.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was gone three hours and later sheepishly explained, "I
knew I was lost when I got to the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   But Grant recognized Jordan's talent and likability. He said he
remembered thinking about him that season: "This is a guy on whose
side I want to be."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Stewart said her son saw Grant as a mentor. She said she wants
today's ceremony to be upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll say a little blessing, but we don't want this to be a sad
memorial," she said. "My son would have loved seeing this boat."</TE>

<HD>Latest Escape Uncovers Concerns at Juvenile Hall</HD>
<DH>Sylmar: Workers blame equipment failures and policy for
problems at facility, which has had eight flight attempts in three
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sensored razor wires are tripped so often that workers dismiss them
as they would annoying car alarms. Improperly installed door locks
are jimmied by juvenile detainees. Emergency phones and
walkie-talkies are constantly on the fritz.</LD>
<LD>   These are just some of the problems, say workers and union
officials, that have led to escapes--two in the last two months--from
Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   "Our job is to maintain a safe and secure environment," said Lee
Wax, a union leader with Local 685, which represents about two-thirds
of the 800 probation officers and staff members at the northeast San
Fernando Valley complex. "But that environment is being threatened on
a daily basis and no one in management seems to care."</LD>
<TE>   Pointing to the tall, red brick redoubts and razor wire ringing
the juvenile complex, Wax said working conditions had been
deteriorating long before the early morning hours of March 10, when
inmate Kevin Ruben Gilliam, 17, used a computer mouse to break his
dorm window and climb over a wall to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam of Los Angeles was facing a possible life sentence two
days later on three counts each of attempted murder and assault with
a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to equipment failures, workers complain that youths
who physically assault probation officers are not brought up on
additional criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Under the constraints of a zero-tolerance policy, a worker who
puts his hands on a young offender can expect a disciplinary hearing
and suspension, even when it is a case of self-defense, said Ralph
Miller, president of Local 685. Workers usually are fired for the
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of proof is on us, not these kids, including the
gangbangers and most violent criminals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say this partly explains why workers tried to coax
Gilliam down from the wall instead of grabbing him. Gilliam ignored
the pleas and jumped down to a waiting car.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Burkert, the Probation Department's detention chief,
acknowledged problems with equipment at the complex but said the
department was working to resolve those issues.</TE>
<TE>   As for physical violence against staff members, Burkert said the
department investigates every incident and brings charges against
juveniles when warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when a staff member may be injured inadvertently during a
use-of-force situation, it may not be enough for the district
attorney to file a case," he said. "One aspect that is lost on people
is the fact that probation advocates for children."</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1965, the juvenile hall in Sylmar is one of three
complexes in Los Angeles County that serve as detention centers for
minors. The others are Central and Los Padrinos juvenile halls.</TE>
<TE>   The Sylmar center was damaged in the 1971 Sylmar and 1994
Northridge earthquakes and has undergone millions of dollars of
renovation. It currently holds more than 500 youths, many with
serious criminal backgrounds, Burkert said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, rehabilitation remains a key goal of probation officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to balance our programs with our security," he
said. "We have to protect the community and serve the court. But
these kids are someone's sons or daughters. They are not animals."</TE>
<TE>   Wax said he has no problem with turning around good kids, but it
does not excuse indifference and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   There have been eight escape attempts from Sylmar in the last
three years, according to the Probation Department, but employees say
the total is double that number.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Gilliam was the second juvenile in two months to
break out of detention dorms in the northwest corner of the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gilliam could have been held in newer, more-secure dorms,
probation officers decided not to place him there because the doors
to those rooms were being jimmied by detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile hall workers also said that debris blown by high winds
often gets caught in the razor wire and trips sensitive alarm systems
to the point that they sometimes ignore the warnings. Emergency
phones and walkie-talkies often do not work, the workers said.
Probation officers could have apprehended Gilliam, Wax said, had they
been able to operate a back gate next to where Gilliam was crouching
on the wall. Instead, they had to run halfway around the exterior of
the compound.</TE>
<TE>   "They had an opportunity to run this kid down," Wax said. "But
they had to go out the front, and by the time they got there, he was
long gone."</TE>

<HD>Evacuations at LAX Are on the Wane</HD>
<DH>Security: Officials are working to limit disruptions, but
several factors make the airport susceptible to alerts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a recent spate of highly publicized evacuations at Los
Angeles International Airport, a survey of the events over the last
six months shows that the incidents are actually dwindling, even as
more passengers are returning to the skies.</LD>
<LD>   Officials cleared out portions of the world's third-busiest
airport 41 times from September to Feb. 28, due to the discovery of
suspicious items or security snafus, according to statistics compiled
by the city agency that operates LAX. The pace of the evacuations has
generally slowed over time--with none in January and five in
February.</LD>
<LD>   A spate of six evacuations the week of Feb. 25 to March 4 showed,
however, that the potential for volatility at LAX's concourses and
roadways is still high. Although LAX administrators called that week
an aberration, they concede that the airport is unlikely to ever
return to the days when it had several evacuations a year.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent incidents--prompted by increased vigilance by
passengers and officials and new security regulations installed after
the Sept. 11 skyjackings--can be expected from the nation's evolving
aviation security system, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX officials say they face unique conditions that make the
airport more susceptible to security alerts, including the handling
of a large share of "originating" flights and, thus, a
disproportionate responsibility for screening baggage, the use of
more explosives-detection machines than any other airport in the
country, and heightened attentiveness at LAX since the facility was
identified as a target in a late-1999 bombing plot.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal in security for any public transportation system is to
first ensure people's safety, and second, to reduce disruptions,"
said Brian Jenkins, a senior advisor to the president of the Rand
Corp. and a former member of the White House Commission on Aviation
Security. "In countries where they've had to deal with continuing
terrorist threats, they've worked very hard not only to increase
security measures but to develop response procedures to help them
deal with bomb threats and suspicious packages very quickly, with a
minimum amount of disruption."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to compare LAX's evacuation record with that of
other large airports. When queried for this story, officials at many
of the nation's busiest airports said they haven't tracked how many
times they've cleared facilities since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the incidents at LAX--including abandoned boxes on
Christmas Day that turned out to contain cookies--aren't serious
enough to be categorized as "security breaches" by federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   These incidents occur when people are in areas where they should
not be or when one or more passengers pass through a security
checkpoint without being properly screened. Security breaches led the
federal government to evacuate 59 terminals or concourses from Oct.
30 to March 7, according to Federal Aviation Administration
statistics. These incidents led to 1,820 flight delays and 539 flight
cancellations, the agency found.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for More Bomb-Sniffing Dogs</TE>
<TE>   LAX charted just two of those incidents. The most disruptive
occurred March 4, when officials shut down the entire south side of
the airport for several hours after security employees discovered
that a metal detector in Terminal No. 4 had been unplugged for at
least an hour. The incident required the evacuation of 10,000
passengers and delayed 400 flights.</TE>
<TE>   LAX wasn't the only airport plagued by nonworking security
equipment. Unplugged metal detectors also forced evacuations at
airports in Chicago, Boston, Birmingham, Ala., and Buffalo, N.Y., in
the last month. These snafus prompted federal officials to create a
program to retrofit security equipment plugs to make sure they stay
put.</TE>
<TE>   LAX will spend $10,000--$200 a plug--to put metal brackets over
the plugs to secure them in their sockets.</TE>
<TE>   The airport also expects to deploy more bomb-sniffing dogs,
increasing the number from 10 to 20 this spring. Authorities hope
that the presence of more dogs will help them more quickly "clear"
unattended bags and prevent security shutdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But even with improvements, LAX officials say the 40-year-old
facility has many unique characteristics that make it more
susceptible to evacuations, including:</TE>
<TE>   * LAX handles a disproportionately large share of "originating"
bags--those that are first entering the system. On average, 160,000
bags are checked a day at the airport, providing more opportunities
for unattended bag calls.</TE>
<TE>   * The airport has 13 explosives-detection machines, more than any
other facility in the country. This can lead to more evacuations
prompted by false alarms--such as one earlier this month, when
officials evacuated part of Terminal No. 3 after a coffee grinder set
off an alarm on one of the van-sized detectors.</TE>
<TE>   * A foiled terrorist attack on LAX is also an ever-present
reminder of the facility's high profile. Algerian Ahmed Ressam was
captured at the Canadian border in December 1999 with a load of
explosives intended to blow up a terminal at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Connected Terminals Hinder Security</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, many terminals at LAX are connected, making it more
difficult for officials to isolate security breaches and sometimes
forcing evacuations in multiple terminals when one has been
"contaminated" by a suspect passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, officials say they will work with the new Transportation
Security Administration, which took over screening contracts at the
nation's airports last month, to limit airport evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is devising a protocol that will help achieve some
consistency in the way officials respond to the events across the
country, said Rebecca Trexler, a TSA spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't come up with the solutions yet," Trexler said. "Right
now we have consultants out there gathering data and looking at
unique airports and seeing how they do it."</TE>

<HD>Leisure World Pet Edict Unleashes Rebels</HD>
<DH>Seniors: The Seal Beach retirement community's dog-walking
rule, other edicts stir insurrection among 8,400 residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loretta Owens and her 10-pound poodle, Taffy, are unlikely symbols of
the discord sweeping the Leisure World retirement community in Seal
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Owens, 78, got Taffy a few months ago at the urging of her doctor,
who thought a pet would be therapeutic for her. Dogs are allowed
inside Leisure World condominiums but are banned from its more than
500 acres of common ground.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Owens must leave Leisure World if she wants to take
Taffy for a walk. Residents have been ticketed by security guards for
walking their dogs inside Leisure World's walls.</LD>
<TE>   "The humiliation," said Owens, who like other residents doesn't
have a private yard next to her condo. "Like I was committing some
kind of crime walking my animal. I feel more like a tenant than an
owner."</TE>
<TE>   To Owens and other residents, the pet policy exemplifies what is
wrong with Leisure World. They contend that the administration cares
more about imposing rules and asserting its control than meeting the
needs of the 8,400 people who live there.</TE>
<TE>   Galvanized by the pet issue and other hot-button topics,
rebellious residents have joined together, publishing underground
newsletters with names such as the Communicator, circulating
petitions and creating insurgent Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   On the pet front, several dog owners have filed complaints with
the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, alleging that
the policy is discriminatory. Those cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Another target of the critics is the administration's plan to
build a $1.6-million clubhouse. Officials said there is a demand for
more clubhouse space for an exercise room, sports events and
activities. But detractors said the plan is a waste of money, noting
that the four existing clubhouses are not fully used.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are also worried that the administration will continue to
charge a $50 monthly mortgage fee that was supposed to be phased out
over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   A recent meeting of the dissidents drew about 130 people--many of
them fired up.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me 30 people!" shouted Hal Ehrlich. "We'll have a sit-down
strike in front of the administration building. Police will have to
cart us away. I say let's picket."</TE>
<TE>   Harbir "Bill" Narang, administrator at Leisure World for nearly 20
years, said dissenters represent a small minority of the 8,400
residents and that most people are content with the way things are.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always going to be some disagreement," Narang said. "It
happens in every city, every household. Here it is no different."</TE>
<TE>   The pet issue is a good example, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 137 pets--40 dogs and 97 cats--are registered at Leisure
World. Most of the residents don't want pets in the community, Narang
said. Animals can be noisy, and if a dog gets away from an owner on
the common grounds, people are at risk of being bitten or knocked
down, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure World's common grounds are governed by the Golden Rain
Foundation Board of Directors, whose 18 members are elected by
residents. The directors have so far backed the administration on the
dog policy.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say they've tried to work within the system but have been
thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey McCarthy, 72, said he organized about 20 volunteers and
gathered more than 1,000 signatures on two petitions, one calling for
all major projects to be put on the in-house ballot, and the other
calling for a vote on the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The first petition was declared invalid, said McCarthy, and the
other is being evaluated by Leisure World attorneys. But in the
meantime, the Golden Rain board approved the clubhouse project.</TE>
<TE>   Building the clubhouse would mean a $3-a-month increase in
residents' fees. Some people said they can't afford it.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Gocke said that after he and his wife, Theresa, buy food,
pay their car insurance, association fees and utility bills, they
have little left. .</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're going to build this stupid building which they need
like a hole in the head," and raise his monthly fees, Gocke said.</TE>
<TE>   Narang said the new clubhouse enjoys wide support in the
community. "The board [has] come to the conclusion that we do need
more facilities because of the demand of our residents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Simons, 73, who heads the table tennis club that would
have more space in the new facility, said the club now has to turn
people away.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had more tables and time, we could have more beginners and
returning players," Simons said.</TE>
<TE>   The infighting seems out of place in a community of immaculately
kept lawns and tranquillity, where residents get around in vintage
golf carts and oversized tricycles.Starting this year, the
condominium owners will begin to pay off the 40-year loans that the
developer received to build the units. Each unit pays about $50 a
month toward those loans.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents worry that the administration might increase
their monthly fees by about the same amount when the loans are paid
off.</TE>
<TE>   Narang said the Golden Rain board has been discussing what to do
when the mortgages are paid off. "Our community is 40 years old.
Appliances are fairly old, the sewer system is in need of repairs,"
and roads and sidewalks need to be maintained, he said. "The question
has been what do we need to do to set proper reserves for the future,
and we are in the process of doing those studies."</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't sit well with Dave Lyon, 57, who wears a nametag
saying the Golden Rain Foundation "labels me a DISSENTER, but you can
call me DAVE."</TE>
<TE>   "I was naive enough to think that all you had to do was speak to
[the administration] about things they might not have considered, but
I learned that they are remote from the average shareholder," he
said. "It's like they're an elite club instead of representatives of
the people who elected them."</TE>

<TE>   Only 137 pets--40 dogs and 97 cats--are registered at Leisure
World. Most of the residents don't want pets in the community, Narang
said. Animals can be noisy, and if a dog gets away from an owner on
the common grounds, people are at risk of being bitten or knocked
down, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure World's common grounds are governed by the Golden Rain
Foundation Board of Directors, whose 18 members are elected by
residents. The directors have so far backed the administration on the
dog policy.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say they've tried to work within the system but have been
thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey McCarthy, 72, said he organized about 20 volunteers and
gathered more than 1,000 signatures on two petitions, one calling for
all major projects to be put on the in-house ballot, and the other
calling for a vote on the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The first petition was declared invalid, said McCarthy, and the
other is being evaluated by Leisure World attorneys. But in the
meantime, the Golden Rain board approved the clubhouse project.</TE>
<TE>   Building the clubhouse would mean a $3-a-month increase in
residents' fees. Some people said they can't afford it.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Gocke said that after he and his wife, Theresa, buy food,
pay their car insurance, association fees and utility bills, they
have little left.</TE>
<TE>   They rarely have the luxury of eating out, Gocke said. He earns a
little extra cash by redeeming bottles he collects around town. He
depends on a monthly donation from the Orange County Food Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're going to build this stupid building which they need
like a hole in the head," and raise his monthly fees, Gocke said.</TE>
<TE>   Narang said the new clubhouse enjoys wide support in the community
and that a few malcontents are stirring up trouble. "The board [has]
come to the conclusion that we do need more facilities because of the
demand of our residents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Simons, 73, who heads the table tennis club that would
have more space in the new facility, said the club now has to turn
people away.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had more tables and time, we could have more beginners and
returning players," Simons said.</TE>
<TE>   The infighting seems out of place in a community of immaculately
kept lawns and tranquillity, where residents get around in vintage
golf carts and oversized tricycles.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this year, the condominium owners will begin to pay off
the 40-year loans that the developer received to build the units.
Each unit pays about $50 a month toward those loans.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents worry that the administration might increase
their monthly fees by about the same amount when the loans are paid
off.</TE>
<TE>   Narang said the Golden Rain board has been discussing what to do
when the mortgages are paid off. "There have been discussions in
informal settings because our community is 40 years old. Appliances
are fairly old, the sewer system is in need of repairs," and roads
and sidewalks need to be maintained, he said. "The question has been
what do we need to do to set proper reserves for the future, and we
are in the process of doing those studies."</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't sit well with Dave Lyon, 57, who proudly wears a
nametag saying the Golden Rain Foundation "labels me a DISSENTER, but
you can call me DAVE."</TE>
<TE>   "I was naive enough to think that all you had to do was speak to
[the administration] about things they might not have considered, but
I learned that they are remote from the average shareholder," he
said. "It's like they're an elite club instead of representatives of
the people who elected them."</TE>

<HD>Lavish, Futuristic Library Opens</HD>
<DH>Cerritos: It has titanium exterior, a shark-filled
aquarium, replica T. rex skeleton, 200 computers --and 300,000 books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a celebration marked by patriotic music and colorful balloons,
about 8,000 people gathered Saturday in downtown Cerritos for the
grand reopening of a library described as the next wave in learning
experiences.</LD>
<LD>   Among the first to step inside the $35-million futuristic building
clad in titanium and hard-wired for interaction were engineer
Mancefield Moore, his wife, Rhonda, and their children, Ryan, 10, and
Melissa, 12.</LD>
<LD>   "We came to see for ourselves if it's all that city officials
promised it would be," Moore said. "I never had anything like it when
I was growing up."</LD>
<TE>   That was an understatement.</TE>
<TE>   Inside are 200 computer terminals, 12,000 laptop portals, a
15,000-gallon saltwater aquarium with 7-inch-thick glass and five
sharks, a full-scale replica of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, a
performance theater and a circulation desk built to resemble a time
machine.</TE>
<TE>   The 88,000-square-foot library, paid for with sales tax revenues
generated by the city's successful auto mall and regional malls, also
contains 300,000 books.</TE>
<TE>   Nonresidents Can Get Library Card for $100</TE>
<TE>   The library is free to residents, city employees and students
attending Cerritos schools. Nonresidents are welcome, city officials
said, but they will have to pay $100 for a library card to enjoy its
services and check out books.</TE>
<TE>   But the primary products of the library on Bloomfield Avenue at
183rd Street--about 10 miles north of Long Beach and just west of
Buena Park--are not literary works; they are patrons with a yen to
learn something.</TE>
<TE>   The very architecture of the place aims to stimulate with
themes--"Main Street," "Saving the Planet" and "Traveling Through
Time" --designed to focus interest on community life, environmental
awareness, history and the future.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the doors opened, Mayor Paul W. Bowlen and city
Librarian Waynn Pearson planted themselves in the lobby to greet
newcomers and invite them to explore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to build a beautiful structure like this one,"
Pearson said. "But it's quite another to see it filled with so many
happy faces."</TE>
<TE>   The urban birthplace of auto malls and freeway buffer walls built
its first library on a strawberry patch in 1973. It was remodeled and
expanded in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   But a rapidly growing population and a library cardholder base
nearly three times the national average wore that rectangular edifice
out within two decades.</TE>
<TE>   With the third make-over, the ethnically diverse city with a
population of 53,000 mostly avid readers broke the mold.</TE>
<TE>   As Cerritos City Councilwoman Gloria A. Kappe put it, "We don't
build big Kleenex boxes."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find a vertical or horizontal line anywhere in the
library, which is a block from Cerritos High School and across the
street from the Center for the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Jim Nardini of the Glendale architectural firm Charles
Walton and Associates, even the library's titanium exterior is
intended to reflect change.</TE>
<TE>   "We've built 35 libraries, but none like this one; it's unique,"
said Steve Finney, the architectural firm's president. "Being able to
make a special statement to children--that learning is fun--was a
labor of love."</TE>
<TE>   80,000 Books in Children's Section</TE>
<TE>   Six-year-old Kaila King and her 8-year-old sister, Nicole, were
perfect candidates for the 80,000-volume children's section, the
entrance of which is a cheery jumble of brightly colored giant books.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond them is 40-foot-long Stanley the T-rex, a mock rain
forest and the aquarium containing five sharks that locals have
affectionately dubbed the "Cerritos City Council."</TE>
<TE>   Ogling Stanley's 6-inch-long teeth with eyes as big as saucers,
Nicole said, "Pretty cool place! I've never seen anything so amazing
before."</TE>
<TE>   "Terrific!" her sister said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the lobby, in the collegiate Gothic atmosphere of the Old
World Reading Room, patrons admired the long mahogany shelves, custom
chairs and a holographic fire seeming to flicker in a warm hearth.</TE>
<TE>   "The detail work is remarkable everywhere you look," said artist
Lita Albuquerque. "The pattern on the carpet matches the patterns on
the roof--even the lawns are mowed in artistic designs."</TE>
<TE>   Leaning against a railing overlooking the 21st century section,
which emulates the Art Deco architecture of the former Pan Pacific
Auditorium, construction worker Tony Garcia, 44, could not help
reflecting on the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a marvelous feeling being here today," he said. "When I came
to Cerritos in 1964, it was all dairy farms. Just look at it now."</TE>

<HD>Confession: Raised a Catholic, Trained to Raise Questions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time for a confession, and what better day of the week.</LD>
<LD>   I was not entirely honest in my Friday column, when I wrote about
Catholics who have encouraged me to keep banging on the church door
and asking for answers.</LD>
<LD>   It's no lie the mailbag is full, with many readers relating
personal tales of abuse, if not demanding an end to the church's
decades of silence on the matter. Silence that unjustly taints so
many good priests.</LD>
<TE>   But other Catholic readers are less thrilled with my work, which
they find unforgivably biased, and it doesn't seem fair to ignore
them.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the mood of the writer, I am a knave, a rat or a
turncoat--how dare I question the church? I am alternately being
prayed for, cursed or condemned--an army of God's soldiers is
prepared to deliver me to the tortures of the damned.</TE>
<TE>   One unsigned letter began:</TE>
<TE>   I resent having to use this paper, envelope &amp; stamp but would like
to tell you what a repulsive creep you are.</TE>
<TE>   I turned the other cheek, then went on.</TE>
<TE>   What do you think you are, an attorney, delving into things? ...
Well all I have to say is you will get yours. Saw your picture in the
paper &amp; you are ugly too.</TE>
<TE>   Not very Christian if you ask me.</TE>
<TE>   Now here's another typical missive from a reader named Donn:</TE>
<TE>   Clearly you are an ex-Catholic with an ax to grind. Why don't you
take some of your own ranting advice and come clean with your hate
for the church and what caused it.</TE>
<TE>   OK, Donn, here we go:</TE>
<TE>   I don't really care whether it's a church, a temple, the White
House or the next-door neighbor. I write about users and abusers
wherever I find them. But yes, I was Catholic once, and I suppose I
still am. Here's the story:</TE>
<TE>   I grew up in the St. Peter Martyr parish in the Bay Area town of
Pittsburg. My parents were married and I was baptized at St. Peter,
and I wore a uniform of gray cords and a purple sweater to school.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sister Roberta once smacked me in the head with a
spelling book in front of my sixth-grade class, I probably deserved
it. Other than that, I don't recall any traumatic episodes except for
when our class had to sing "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (did
I spell it right?) at the grand opening of the new police station.</TE>
<TE>   When I was old enough to drive, I told my parents I was going to
church every Sunday, but I lied. I actually drove my little brother
to Sears in Antioch, where we watched NFL games in the television
department.</TE>
<TE>   So I probably never was a hall of fame Catholic. But nothing drove
me away. I was never abused, nor did I ever hear of anyone who was.
As an adult, when I did consciously drift away, it was because I
found the church's attitudes about contraception out of touch and its
anti-gay preaching repugnant. But to tell you the truth, I later
regretted walking away from what was good about the church just
because of the things that bothered me.</TE>
<TE>   In every city I've lived in, the Catholic Church does more good
than any other institution. In Philadelphia, my short list of heroes
included two nuns and a priest who tirelessly served forgotten
communities, and I wrote about them often.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Boyle, the actor who plays the cranky old dad on "Everybody
Loves Raymond," has also had an on-again, off-again relationship with
the church, and we've talked about it. Boyle, who once was a
Christian brother, left the church for some of the same reasons I
did, but went back in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Ritual is comforting, he told me. The standing, the kneeling, the
casting about for heavenly meaning. Despite his political differences
with the church, he's home when he smells the candles burning and
hears the footfalls echoing off the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   I respect that, even though I'm the kind of guy who--to borrow a
well-worn line--finds more religion in a summer rainfall than in a
year of Sunday sermons. I respect anyone's faith, whether it's
motivated by true belief or fear of death, so long as it isn't used
to justify hatred and genocide. So long as it isn't entirely blind.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of people have told me, over the years, about abuse by
clergy. Almost all of them, when they can rise up from their torment
and self-hatred, talk about two shattering betrayals.</TE>
<TE>   The first is when a priest uses church authority to have his way
with a child. The second is when the church calls the victim a liar.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the church has merely transferred known molesters to
other parishes, or sent them to drive-thru therapy, and then recycled
them back into the care of future victims.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have words adequate to the task of describing that
violation of trust and failure of basic human consideration. And the
failure goes to the very top ranks of an institution that every
Sunday preaches Christian morality.</TE>
<TE>   So in the end, yes, I'm completely biased against, and intolerant
of, hypocrisy. And without apology, I fully intend to keep banging on
the door.</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on the nuns. They said you should always ask yourself:
What would Jesus do?</TE>

<HD>A Community Mourns Loss of San Diego's 'Little Angel'</HD>
<DH>Service: Residents who came together in the agonizing
search for Danielle van Dam join once more in a public farewell to
the slain girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As white doves and pink and purple balloons floated into the air,
7-year-old Danielle van Dam was remembered Saturday as "the little
girl who inspired an army of kindness."</LD>
<LD>   At a memorial service near one of her favorite beaches, family
friends and the family minister marveled at how Danielle's
disappearance and death riveted much of the public and brought an
outpouring of support for her parents and brothers.</LD>
<LD>   "For a while the world stopped and prayed and hoped for her safe
return," said family friend Veronica Valencia. "Now we mourn....
Although she is no longer with us, she will always remain San Diego's
little angel."</LD>
<TE>   The tearful service came just two days after a judge ordered
neighbor David Westerfield to stand trial for the kidnapping and
murder of a sprightly, gaptoothed child remembered as "daddy's little
girl and mommy's best friend."</TE>
<TE>   "Why is there such an interest in this one little girl?" asked the
Rev. Joseph Acton, pastor of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church.</TE>
<TE>   "For some mysterious reason we all feel like Danielle was our own
child," Acton said. "I feel Danielle has inspired us to fight against
the darkness that creeps into our neighborhoods and homes."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 people attended the memorial at a park in the La
Jolla Shores neighborhood. Others listened to radio or watched a live
broadcast on local television.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Brenda and Damon van Dam's realization on Feb.2
that Danielle was missing from her bedroom at the family's home in
the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood, the story of her
disappearance and the hunt for her killer dominated local news.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of neighbors and a local public relations
firm--working for free--the van Dams encouraged local and national
media coverage in hopes that it would lead to Danielle being found.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of volunteers, including off-duty Marines from Camp
Pendleton, scoured the desert and rural areas. More than 900 tips
were received by police.</TE>
<TE>   "Danielle became more than just one little girl, she became a
movement," said attorney Bill Nimmo, who has served as a legal
commentator on the case for the CBS affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   When Danielle's body was found in a wooded area on Feb. 27, the
local NBC station devoted four hours of continuous coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Six local TV stations provided gavel-to-gavel coverage of
Westerfield's three-day preliminary hearing, unprecedented for a San
Diego criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Longoria, news director at KUSI-TV, an independent
station, which did two one-hour specials on the case last week, along
with broadcasting the preliminary hearing, said he felt the timing of
Danielle's disappearance contributed to the public's horrified
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the second of the specials was the most-watched
program in San Diego during that hour.</TE>
<TE>   "First you have Sept. 11, where the world seems to have gone mad,
and then in San Diego, you have something happen that suggests that
our little chunk of the world has gone mad too," Longoria said. "It
struck a deep chord with a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to Danielle's abduction, the county Board of Supervisors
endorsed moves designed to protect children by putting information
about missing children on the Internet more quickly and making
information about child molesters more readily available.</TE>
<TE>   A private service for Danielle was held last week, but her parents
also wanted a public service to show gratitude to the volunteers who
searched for her, to the public in general and to San Diego police.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda and Damon van Dam, each wearing a button with Danielle's
picture, embraced their sons, Dylan, 5, and Derrick, 9, as all four
wept during much of the hourlong service.</TE>
<TE>   A parent read aloud a letter to Danielle written by one of her
second-grade classmates, Sara Call, 7: "I know you're happy in heaven
now. Please say hello to my grandmother."</TE>
<TE>   While the dominant mood was sorrow, there was also anger.</TE>
<TE>   "I am deeply saddened by the sin, evil and wickedness that is
present on this Earth," said Danielle's aunt, Tina van Dam, as she
broke down in sobs.</TE>

<DH>Religion: King Fahd Mosque in Culver City struggles to
unite a diverse group of people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No place in Southern California symbolizes the tension over Saudi
Arabia's influence in the world like the King Fahd Mosque in Culver
City.</LD>
<LD>   This marble mosque on Washington Boulevard, built entirely with
Saudi funds, tests many of the stereotypes that have surfaced about
the oil kingdom since Sept.11.</LD>
<LD>   The mosque's leaders admire Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, an 18th
century evangelist. Al-Wahhab inspired the so-called Wahhabi
movement, which is prominent in Saudi Arabia but criticized by
detractors for oppressing women, shunning non-Muslims and inspiring
Osama bin Laden's jihad.</LD>
<TE>   The chairman of the mosque's foundation, a former Saudi Embassy
official, has helped funnel millions of dollars in Saudi funds to
Southland Muslims. Critics suggest this aid comes with a price:
suppressing a more flexible brand of Islam in favor of the oil
kingdom's puritanical creed.</TE>
<TE>   A close look at the 4-year-old mosque and the faithful who nurture
it, however, reveals a more complex picture than the caricatures that
have shaped public perceptions of Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the mosque community, there are those who are sympathetic
to jihad and suicide bombings and those who are not. Some object to
non-Muslims visiting their sacred space; others warmly embrace them.
Some women veil their entire bodies; others throw off such practices
as outdated.</TE>
<TE>   The King Fahd Mosque's struggles to unite a people drawn from a
broad range of ideologies, culture and race seem familiar and
quintessentially American. The diversity belies the notion of an
insular people in ideological lock-step, beholden to a distant desert
sheikdom.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to be seen as a Saudi outfit," says the mosque's
imam, Tajuddin Shuaib, a Ghana native who studied Islam for a decade
in Saudi Arabia and was sent to the U.S. a quarter-century ago. "We
are like the United Nations ... no one nationality dominates."</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion of Saudi Arabia Surges</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, American suspicion of Saudi Arabia has surged,
particularly because most of the suspected hijackers were Saudi-born,
as was Bin Laden himself. Other critics charge the Saudis with
encouraging the jihad movement by financing religious schools that
preach extremist hate. Saudi officials have vehemently denied the
charges, noting that they stripped Bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship
and that they had long been condemned by him for their alliance with
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Culver City, Shuaib acknowledges problems with extremism in his
mosque--but says those problems have nothing to do with Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Wahhabism," he says. "This is a political agenda
cloaked in religion."</TE>
<TE>   On the Friday after the terrorist attacks, the imam says, he gave
a sermon condemning suicide bombings and was shouted down by some men
who leaped to their feet and accused him of "changing the Koran."
Patriotic banners supporting President Bush and the families of
terrorist victims were torn down from the mosque and stolen, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The same hotheads, Shuaib says, have also tried to foment hatred
against Israel for its actions against Palestinians and the United
States for its bombing campaign against Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these people want to turn this masjid [mosque] into a
vehicle for extremism," Shuaib says. "I tell people that we don't
have the right to deny another human being the God-given right to
live, but today, when Muslims are suffering all over the world, this
is very difficult to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Shuaib says he kicked out four members of the mosque in October in
part because they were fomenting dissent and extremism.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Abdo Ghanem, 39, a Yemeni native who joined the
mosque community 13 years ago when it was still housed in a rented
storefront on Venice Boulevard, half a mile from the King Fahd
Mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Ghanem, a designer-clothes salesman, seems like an unlikely
militant. He has an open manner and wears Versace suits and Gucci
shoes. He is married to a Catholic and says he has not pressured her
to convert. He praises America's political freedoms even as he
castigates its moral decadence. And he confesses to an imperfect
observance of Islam's do's and don'ts--forsaking a beard, for
instance, because he says his wife thinks he's cuter without one.</TE>
<TE>   But Ghanem volunteers that he chauffeured Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman
around the Southland in 1993, two years before the blind imam was
convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks and imprisoned
for life.</TE>
<TE>   Ghanem says he agreed with Abdel Rahman's call to assassinate
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the grounds that he was killing
fellow Muslims with a repressive and torturous regime.</TE>
<TE>   Ghanem also says he supports jihad against Saudi Arabia and
Israel, but stops short of calling for war against America, saying
only that U.S. foreign policies against Muslim nations should be
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see injustice to my people, I will stand up and speak,"
Ghanem says. "I live in a free country."</TE>
<TE>   Ghanem says Shuaib's charge that he was kicked out for extremism
is a ploy to mask problems of financial accountability within the
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Ghanem and others say that Khalil Al-Khalil, head of the
foundation that owns King Fahd, has not publicly detailed why the
mosque's initial budget of $3.8 million ballooned to $8.1 million,
why $200,000 is still owed in construction costs despite Saudi
Arabia's hefty gift and what happened to the $250,000 Ghanem says the
community donated for a still unlaunched school.</TE>
<TE>   "We say: Open the books to an independent accounting firm," Ghanem
says. "If we are wrong, we will make a public apology and close the
subject forever. If we are right, they resign."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Khalil was in Saudi Arabia and unavailable for an interview.
Shuaib said the charges of financial impropriety are bogus and called
the claims of missing donations "a bald lie." He said the mosque's
construction costs spiraled because officials decided to build it
with marble instead of stucco.</TE>
<TE>   Shuaib, 49, is a genial man who was sent here in 1977 by Saudi
Arabia's state-run University of Medina, initially to work with
Muslim students. In 1980, Shuaib helped found the Islamic Foundation
of Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah in Culver City and was working as imam at two
of its mosques when he was tapped to lead the King Fahd Mosque when
it opened. He says his salary is paid by the Saudi state university
through the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The imam considers himself a follower of the teachings of
Al-Wahhab--but sharply disputes charges that they promote extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Wahhab, he says, was merely an Arabian reformer who advocated a
strict, back-to-basics approach to cleanse Islam of polytheistic
corruptions and keep it as pure as the day it was revealed to the
Prophet Muhammad 1,400 years ago. Those inspired by Al-Wahhab promote
literalist readings of scripture, advocate strict gender roles and
perpetually guard against innovations, whether new interpretations of
the faith or other expressions of Islam, such as mystical Sufism or
the Shiite branch of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The movement's fortunes have waxed and waned, but became dominant
on the Arabian Peninsula in 1932 with the creation of Saudi Arabia.
In the 1970s, the movement rapidly raised its global profile when the
boom in oil prices allowed the Saudis to export the creed, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi bashing is in vogue," says Shuaib, "and you get it from all
sides. But I believe if you attack someone, you'd better know
everything about them first."</TE>
<TE>   One frequent charge against the Saudis is that they use their
petrodollars as leverage to spread their puritanical creed. The Saudi
Embassy reports the kingdom has helped finance more than 1,700
Islamic centers and mosques, distributed more than 114 million Korans
and established several academic chairs around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Shuaib says that Saudis have supported
virtually every mosque in the region, with gifts ranging from
millions of dollars for construction to free copies of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the support comes with strings attached is disputed.</TE>
<TE>   One Southland imam, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
says he stopped taking Saudi money because the kingdom's emissaries
here wanted to choose his board members.</TE>
<TE>   Sabreen Abdul Rahmaan, a woman who said she attended Masjid al
Salam when Shuaib assumed leadership of it, said the imam banished
the Sufi practice of chanting God's name, known as dhikr.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud Abdel-Baset of the Islamic Center of Southern California
says the Saudi government has never attached strings to the free
Korans it sends them, usually around the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan every year. The center is one of the most liberal in the
region, promoting views that most puritans condemn, such as the
optional wearing of the hijab (head covering), gender mixing and
female leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Shuaib says the oil kingdom has never tried to control the Islam
he preaches. "My khutbahs [sermons] are not written in Riyadh or
Jeddah."</TE>
<TE>   Dispute Over Outsiders Being Allowed In</TE>
<TE>   Wahhabism is also accused of promoting hostility to non-Muslims.
Some puritanical Muslims interpret Koranic passages not to make
allies of Christians or Jews as a literal command to shun them.
Shuaib acknowledges that some mosque-goers have complained about
outsiders being allowed into the mosque--but says the critics "have
problems in their understanding of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   During one wedding he performed, Shuaib says he was criticized for
allowing non-Muslim women to attend without wearing proper covering.
After news broke that the Jewish Defense League allegedly planned to
bomb the mosque last year, Shuaib accepted flowers from a Jewish
neighbor--and was condemned for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "Brother, are you out of your mind?" Shuaib says he told the
critic. "Do you want a bomb or flowers?</TE>
<TE>   "People with extremist views want you to come down very, very hard
on non-Muslims," the imam says.</TE>
<TE>   But even if it wanted to, the King Fahd Mosque would be
hard-pressed to keep its neighbors out. The mosque was destined for
the public limelight ever since King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud
announced his $4-million donation for mosque construction in 1995,
followed by a $1-million gift for the land from his son, His Royal
Highness Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd.</TE>
<TE>   The mosque, which opened in 1998, is the first the Saudis have
fully funded in North America and is one of a handful in Southern
California built from the ground up with full Islamic architecture.
The structure's twin domes, 69-foot-high minaret and Turkish tile
present a distinctive cultural landmark on a thoroughfare better
known for nondescript convenience stores and fast-food restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Mosque community liaison Usman Mahda has given more tours than he
can remember to curious schoolchildren, retired communities,
Christian and Jewish congregations, and visitors from Japan and
Europe. He regularly participates in interfaith events with a nearby
Jewish temple and Catholic church.</TE>
<TE>   During his presentations, the red-haired Myanmar native invariably
presents Islam not as a harsh faith of intolerant rules but a
universal creed of monotheism and peace.</TE>
<TE>   During one recent tour with six members of the Unification Church,
Mahda pointed out the mosque's Koranic calligraphy condemning killing
and praising Abraham as "neither Jew nor Christian" but a believer in
one God.</TE>
<TE>   "Abraham is the link of all of us," Mahda told the group.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yes," nodded Unification Church member Pasquale Santoro, "he
is our father."</TE>
<TE>   "Come again. Do not be afraid," Mahda said, escorting them to the
door.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot be afraid of brothers," a beaming Santoro replied.</TE>
<TE>   Congregation Holds a Variety of Views</TE>
<TE>   Many of the mosque-goers look startled when asked if they believe
in shunning non-Muslims. Jamila Taniwal, an Afghanistan native, says
she travels to Boston twice a year to see her Jewish best friend.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care if this person is Christian and another is Jewish,"
says Taniwal, 37. "God made all people."</TE>
<TE>   The congregation also seems to hold a variety of views on women's
issues. The mosque itself bears the earmarks of puritanical Islam,
enforcing a full physical segregation of women, who enter through a
separate entrance and pray out of sight of men on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   Here you will encounter women such as Samira Ellahi, a Pakistani
native who veils even her mouth in the presence of men and
home-schools her children to protect them from the drugs, alcohol and
premarital sex that lure so many American youth.</TE>
<TE>   Her 13-year-old daughter, Sehar, embraces her mother's strict
teachings, concealing herself in black even though she says
non-Muslim kids taunt her as a "Halloween witch."</TE>
<TE>   Sehar says she doesn't care. "The more people tease you, the more
reward you get because you're obeying God," Sehar says cheerfully,
hugging her mother. "If a man looks at you, God takes all of his
blessings from you."</TE>
<TE>   The congregation also includes free-thinkers such as Sonia
Arcangeli, 31. The Marina del Rey resident paints her nails red,
views gender segregation as unequal and, to the horror of other
women, dissents from the majority view that menstruating women must
not touch the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   "God created my body that way and wanted me with my period," says
Arcangeli, a Tunisian native educated in Italy who immigrated here in
1998. "I think it's between you and God."</TE>
<TE>   Such views are quickly hunted down for correction, however. News
that a Muslim sister prays during her period flies through the
mosque. The imam's wife is called in to track her down, but Arcangeli
is nowhere to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Shuaib explains the rules: Islam forbids handling the Koran
during times of impurity, such as menstruation. You can read the
scripture on a computer. You can read it wearing gloves. You can flip
the pages with a pencil. You cannot, however, directly touch the
sacred words.</TE>
<TE>   These rules, Shuaib explains, are a test of the true Muslim:
Whether you follow the one God's call to submission. This, he says,
is the message of Al-Wahhab and the one true Islam the Saudis aim to
promote.</TE>
<TE>   "Either you go with what the Koran says or you don't," the imam
says, waving a green and gold-edged sacred tome. "You don't tell
Allah to bend the rules for you."</TE>

<HD>Mass Evictions Leave Residents Down--and Out</HD>
<DH>Real estate: As scores of tenants pack up in Northern
California, some advocates say it's time to increase protections for
renters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY and JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The eviction notices hit out of the blue. Whole subdivisions full of
renters--570 single-family houses in the capital's suburbs and to the
west in Santa Rosa--were given 30 days to pack up furnishings, pull
kids from school, uproot settled lives.</LD>
<LD>   What followed was hardly the typical eviction process in
California.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of grimacing and taking it, the outraged residents fought
back en masse against Genshiro Kawamoto, a wealthy Japanese investor
who was putting their rental homes on the sales block. Ultimately,
Kawamoto buckled, giving tenants extra time. But the damage, in many
cases, had already been done.</LD>
<TE>   Scores of tenants have already moved, crowding into a fist-tight
rental market, paying more for lesser homes. A few hope that Kawamoto
will sell them the houses they have occupied, in some cases, for a
decade. Others say they are too embittered and will move.</TE>
<TE>   There is talk in some circles of making a concerted push around
the state for rent control and "just-cause" eviction laws. State
lawmakers may make a run at doubling the 30-day notice required for
eviction, allowing tenants more time to relocate.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords don't like the sound of any of it.</TE>
<TE>   They say eviction restrictions may give renters more time to look,
but do nothing to increase the supply of available rentals--which
they say is the real problem. Moreover, delays and restrictions make
it difficult to evict tenants who are bad apples. For landlords,
eviction limits can act to poison business opportunities, further
eroding the push to build more housing.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lofgren, executive director of the Rental Housing Assn. of
Sacramento Valley, said landlords are upset with Kawamoto, whose
effort at mass eviction--though "an aberration"--could cause
legislative changes that Lofgren believes will hurt more than help.</TE>
<TE>   "His single act has generated such outrage that it may cause
unnecessary changes to the law that will seriously affect the
industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did happens about as often as the appearance of Halley's
comet, and I hope legislators realize that."</TE>
<TE>   What befell Kawamoto's tenants, however, isn't all that unusual,
renter advocates say. The hot real estate market in California and
other regions of the country, they say, is causing landlords to
regularly push tenants into the streets so they can raise rents or
sell for substantial profit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst affordability crisis we've ever seen," said
Christine Minnehan, housing advocate for the Western Center on Law
and Poverty. "What happened in Sacramento and Santa Rosa was
front-page news, but the poor of this state put up with it daily."</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto's tenants got so much attention partly because of the
audacious scale of the evictions.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had done this 50 at a time," said Rod Fields of the Los
Angeles Housing Law Project, "nobody would have known about it except
the local legal aid office."</TE>
<TE>   The socioeconomics of the subdivisions also came into the
equation. Solidly middle class, they are filled with young
professionals and families who proved savvy in the twin realms of
media and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Calls were made in equal numbers to local TV outlets and
lawmakers. Signs were posted on street corners. One resident of a
subdivision in the Sacramento area city of Citrus Heights, a
carpenter named Eric Goesch, jetted off to Washington to make the
rounds with lawmakers. Politicians from Gov. Gray Davis to U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein complained to the Japanese Embassy. Legal services
firms went to court for the tenants, winning a preliminary round.</TE>
<TE>   It paid off, convincing Kawamoto to give tenants the 90-day grace
period they sought and drawing help from the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   The local apartment association passed out a booklet of available
rentals. Mortgage brokers offered free services for any who sought to
buy a home. Sacramento-based Nehemiah Corp. of California, a
nonprofit organization, offered to buy one whole subdivision to rent
back to tenants, then give them the opportunity to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Such housing is hard to come by all over the state. In Los
Angeles, the vacancy rate hovers around 3%. In some parts of the Bay
Area, it's less than 1%. Sacramento is better, with some Realtors
saying the rate may be rising toward 4% or 5%, but what is available
is mostly apartments, not houses.</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda Warner is finding the pickings thin.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Villa Creekside, a Citrus Heights neighborhood owned
by the Japanese investor, Warner's family isn't bothering to stick
around. She has been looking hard, but is finding only houses that
rent for double what she now pays and landlords that balk over her
family pets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting tonight to see if we get a house," she said one
evening out on her lawn. "The trouble is, everyone else is fighting
for it too."</TE>
<TE>   Goesch, another Villa Creekside resident, knows one couple who
sold their dog to move into a new place that didn't take pets.
Another neighbor was forced out in the middle of cancer chemotherapy.
Still another just had heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   By Goesch's reckoning, upward of 2,500 people are affected in the
half a dozen subdivisions owned by Kawamoto.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got bleeding heart stories all over," he said. "But they're
all true."</TE>
<TE>   In the Stony Point-Villa Royale neighborhoods of southwest Santa
Rosa, many residents have already cleared out.</TE>
<TE>   The post office has received 40 change-of-address forms. The local
U-Haul office said it's having trouble keeping trucks in stock. So
many people moving at once has strained the local housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Those left behind feel like they're living on an empty movie
set--the props are in place, but people are lacking.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Wagner, 55, said she's thinking of locking her garage door
for the first time since she moved in. "It's kind of scary," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most people who do find housing are discovering that they must pay
more for less. "Here we pay $1,190 rent. Our new place is smaller but
we're paying $300 more," said Christine Chisholm, 25, who is living
with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is talk that arrangements might be made for residents
to rent longer or even buy, many are so upset by the turmoil that
they have no interest in staying.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we angry? Yes," said Wagner. "Do we want to see karma happen?
Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Some have fallen ill. "The eviction flu," Wagner calls it.</TE>
<TE>   And though she and others displaced by Kawamoto don't dispute his
right to sell, they resent the way it was done.</TE>
<TE>   "To come into a community like this and turn our lives upside
down," Wagner said, "it's like a disaster."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of people celebrated St. Patrick's Day a wee bit early
Saturday by cheering toe-tapping Irish dancers, a giant inflatable
pig and dancing slices of pepperoni pizza during Ventura's holiday
parade.</LD>
<LD>   The 14th annual County Ventura St. Patrick's Day Parade combined
the Irish holiday with good old American flag-waving under the theme
"United We Stand--A Salute to Patriotism."</LD>
<LD>   "It's definitely something to see," said 36-year-old Alfred
Ramirez of Ventura, who came with his wife and two children.</LD>
<TE>   Among this year's 76 entries were food that boogied, a red-headed
Statue of Liberty standing on the back of a flatbed truck and a
green-horned dinosaur on wheels pedaled by two people.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to see a friend's kid sit on one of the floats," said a
smiling Rex Wilcox, 47, of Santa Barbara. "This is actually pretty
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Mike Tracy and Fire Chief Dennis Downs were grand
marshals of the homespun parade, which began at Mission Park and
continued down Main Street to Laurel Street.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular entrants were the toe-tapping girls from
Ventura's Claddagh School of Irish Dance and high school marching
bands from Ventura, Oxnard and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   A group of women dressed as bulging bags of money pranced behind a
Mid-State Bank sign mounted on a truck. A dozen members of the
county's Model A Ford Club in shiny vintage cars followed close
behind.</TE>
<TE>   There were clear skies and sunshine for the colorful event, but
tree-bending winds forced float riders to grip their hats and
miniature American flags.</TE>
<TE>   Green streamers adorning several floats flapped wildly, and parade
watchers bundled up in sweaters and long pants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of silly but I always like coming to this because I'm
Irish," said Carrie Murphy, 19, of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   New and restored firetrucks dotted the lineup, along with event
regulars such as Miss Ventura County, well-groomed Arabian show
horses and miniature cars driven by full-size Shriners decked out in
fezzes.</TE>
<TE>   Patriotism was reflected on many floats, which were decorated in
red, white and blue--and green.</TE>
<TE>   Personnel from all branches of the military attended, including
active-duty soldiers in uniform, war veterans, mounted Army
reservists and a color guard.</TE>
<TE>   "United We Stand and our flag is still here," read one float
banner.</TE>

<LD>Isn't it rather obvious who's behind the now-public rift between
President Nixon's daughters, Trish and Julie? (I know they have
grown-up names, but to baby-boomers they'll always be Trish and
Julie.)</LD>
<LD>   The first news accounts last week suggested this was a power
struggle between the people running the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in
Yorba Linda and a smaller group of Nixon supporters, including Trish.</LD>
<LD>   Don't believe it.</LD>
<TE>   I'm betting this whole thing has been orchestrated by Fox, the TV
network that brought us "Celebrity Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   Did you catch the premiere?</TE>
<TE>   It aired Wednesday and featured the long-awaited bout between a
former member of TV's "Partridge Family" and a former member of "The
Brady Bunch." In the main event, disgraced Olympic figure skater
Tonya Harding took on--and eventually took out--Paula Jones, who
certainly knows a thing or two about legal disputes involving
presidents.</TE>
<TE>   It was a curious fight, marred by Jones's tendency in its later
stages to turn her back and retreat to the ropes after she got hit.
She paid a price, though--a TKO victory for Harding, who put on quite
a clinic for boxing fans.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the audience for a Trish-Julie fight.</TE>
<TE>   Such a thing would have been unthinkable until news accounts
surfaced last week that the sisters have squared off over how to
spend nearly $20 million left in the will of the late Bebe Rebozo,
the former president's close friend.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Julie's camp wants the foundation that runs the Nixon
Library to decide how to spend the money. Trish's camp argues that
Rebozo specified that only Julie, Trish and Nixon friend Robert
Abplanalp should handle his bequest.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost axiomatic that any issue involving Richard Nixon would
polarize people. This was, after all, a man who antagonized everyone
from liberals to John Birchers. As recent reports from his tapes
reveal, he even got the Rev. Billy Graham to get down and dirty with
remarks about Jews in America.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Nixon could summon the worst from anybody.</TE>
<TE>   But Julie and Trish?</TE>
<TE>   If anyone ever emerged unscathed from contact with Nixon, it was
his daughters. Even those among us who can always make time to dump
on Nixon have a soft spot for the girls, who always appeared
dignified in the wake of their father's ugliness.</TE>
<TE>   But now, we learn they've been at odds in recent years over the
best way to perpetuate the Nixon legacy. My very strong advice would
be, "don't bother," but the sisters have gone to court in Florida and
California over the Rebozo gift.</TE>
<TE>   This is like Bambi and Lassie duking it out.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I figure Fox is calling the shots. The network has
given us "Temptation Island," in which young unmarried couples are
matched up with seductive tempters and temptresses to test their
fidelity.</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of that comes "Celebrity Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   You think Fox wouldn't love for Americans to hear, "Fighting out
of the red corner, with her father's dark hair, you know her as one
of daddy's little girls ... "</TE>
<TE>   I'll hazard a guess that America doesn't want the Nixon daughters
fighting--in or out of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Both have said they don't really want to fight each other. Julie
said it "pains me" to bicker with her sister.</TE>
<TE>   Please, ladies. Your father's legacy already is set in stone.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, think about your own.</TE>

<HD>Two Quakes Felt in the Southland</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two small earthquakes rattled the Southland on Saturday, one centered
in the ocean and the other in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The 4.6-magnitude earthquake off Southern California was widely
felt along the coast from Santa Barbara to Long Beach and across the
entire Los Angeles Basin.</LD>
<LD>   The offshore temblor occurred at 1:33 p.m., centered 44 miles
south of Ventura in open water due west of Long Beach, according to a
preliminary report from Caltech.</LD>
<TE>   "Fortunately, the shaking wasn't too bad," Susan Hough, a U.S.
Geological Survey seismologist, said of the quake, technically
classified as light or small.</TE>
<TE>   The second earthquake, estimated at 3.2 magnitude, occurred about
9:50 p.m. and was centered two miles southwest of Yorba Linda,
according to Caltech seismologists.</TE>
<TE>   A Brea police dispatcher said that she felt a jolt but that there
were no reports of any damage. The quake was estimated to have been
centered about two miles below the Earth's surface, Caltech said.</TE>

<HD>Southland Solution for Third World's Thirst?</HD>
<DH>Science: An immigrant engineer says his radar device can
find water 600 feet below ground. Some are skeptical, but he's got
powerful supporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, there are refugees in
desperate need of water. On the 10th fairway of the Simi Hills Golf
Course, there is Khosrow Bakhtar and his amazing contraption, which
he believes is the answer to their prayers. At first glance, it does
not inspire confidence. Bakhtar's "Earth Radar" device looks like a
tractor pulling a very crude plow. Golfers stare at it uncertainly,
the way they might greet a Chevy Nova abandoned on the back nine.</LD>
<LD>   But Bakhtar and his sponsors on this late-winter morning see only
a thing of beauty.</LD>
<LD>   The inventor had just demonstrated how his machine can locate and
map underground water sources--a topic of great interest to the
operators of the golf course but of even greater consequence to
people in arid parts of the Third World, for whom a dry well can
spell death.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's very, very important," said Jones Kyazze, the
director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), who was among about two dozen people attending
the demonstration, held recently at the golf course in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar, an Iranian-born mining engineer educated in Britain and
the United States, developed the machine while under contract to the
Air Force to locate underground munitions. More recently, he has been
working with a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization, Operation
U.S.A., to use the technology for humanitarian purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "The site conditions here today," Bakhtar was saying, "are sunny
and windy."</TE>
<TE>   "And hazardous," observed one man in the small audience of
engineers, hydrologists and humanitarian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Thwack!</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar scrambled for cover. A ball landed a few yards away with
an ominous plock!</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of this odd moment was the meeting, several years ago,
of Bakhtar and Richard Walden, president and chief executive of
Operation U.S.A. At the time, Walden was campaigning for increased
technology transfers from the military to humanitarian organizations.
His main interest was in technology that would help locate and remove
land mines, a focus of his 23-year-old organization.</TE>
<TE>   Mines, often made largely of plastic and buried just beneath the
ground, are notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. Bakhtar
thought his device--capable, he said, of peering 600 feet beneath the
Earth's surface and creating three-dimensional images of even plastic
objects--might help.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the course of a PowerPoint demonstration at Bakhtar's
office in Newport Beach that Walden noticed a broad blue band in one
of the underground radar images.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Water," Bakhtar said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know that's more important than finding land mines?"
Walden asked.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Bakhtar has retooled the device for civilian use,
making it so easy, he said, that almost anyone could be quickly
trained to use it. Only two questions remain:</TE>
<TE>   Will someone pay to give it a field test, ideally in an Afghan
refugee camp where U.N. officials are paying a fortune to truck in
water?</TE>
<TE>   And does the thing actually work?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to the first is maybe. The answer to the second: a
conditional yes.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department has said it would consider bankrolling
an Earth Radar mission to Pakistan. Joseph Bracken, an official with
the department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, said
his office is waiting for a formal proposal from UNICEF in
conjunction with Operation U.S.A.</TE>
<TE>   As for whether it works, the device appeared to pass its test in
Simi Valley with flying colors, and Bakhtar has a loyal core of
believers. However--here is the conditional part--there also are
people with expertise in the field who say his claims sound
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new about the idea of ground-penetrating radar.
Geologists, oil companies and the military have used the technology
for years. But hydrologists and geophysicists say it is best used at
relatively shallow depths, making it of limited use for finding
water, especially in difficult-to-penetrate soil such as clay. In
such conditions, said Temple University geophysicist Jonathan
Nyquist, someone using ground radar might be lucky to see images 30
feet below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Six hundred feet? "I just don't buy it," Nyquist said.</TE>
<TE>   William Clement, a hydrologist at the Center for Geophysical
Investigation of the Shallow Subsurface at Boise State University,
said state-of-the-art ground radar can generally penetrate about 65
feet. In ideal conditions--the Sahara Desert, for instance--it might
go as deep as 100 feet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Six hundred feet? Not a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar acknowledged with a chuckle that his technology "basically
defies the laws of physics" by rethinking the way in which radar
waves can be focused. By using "forced resonance," which tailors the
radar wavelength to the environment, he said, he can penetrate any
material. And yes, he said, it will go as deep as 600 feet if it is
outfitted with a larger antenna.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Fijany, a computer scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, said JPL scientists have been sufficiently
impressed by Bakhtar's Earth Radar to propose using it to find water
on Mars. NASA is considering the idea, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Jacobs, a civilian program manager at Eglin Air Force Base
in Florida, said Earth Radar had proved effective in finding deeply
buried projectiles at bombing ranges, although the depth of the
munitions was classified. "They went deep, but I can't tell you how
deep," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he wouldn't reveal how much the government paid for Earth
Radar, Jacobs said the device probably had paid for itself the first
time it was employed at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico,
because it saved the military from using far more laborious methods
to find unexploded ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been of considerable use to the government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Walden, Bakhtar's technology has also been used to
search for tunnels along the North Korea-South Korea and U.S.-Mexico
borders. Jacobs said he could not confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Earth Radar cannot be used to hunt for land mines
because they would explode if it were dragged over them. Bakhtar and
Walden are talking about trying to use it from an airborne platform,
such as a hovercraft, but said they have technical hurdles to clear
first.</TE>
<TE>   In operation, Earth Radar resembles nothing so much as a tractor
mower. In his golf course demonstration, Bakhtar drove it about 10
yards, turned around and drove back on a parallel course, then back
again and so on until he had covered a patch of ground about 10 yards
long and 10 yards wide. A computer attached to the tractor recorded
the radar readings, which could then be plotted onto graph-like maps.
On the golf course, he said, the readings reached down about 100 feet
and showed a water table beginning about 63 feet beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Existing hydrological data indicate a water table within about
five feet of that, according to Jim Evensen, a hydrogeologist who
wrote his master's thesis on the water basin on which the Simi Hills
course is perched. Evensen, who attended the Earth Radar
demonstration, said he was impressed by Bakhtar's invention,
especially because it is relatively portable.</TE>
<TE>   "There are technologies that do similar things," he said, "but
they're really not portable and they're not easy to get out to job
sites." Those technologies rely on seismic, rather than radar, waves,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Ted Kuepper, an environmental engineer who does
volunteer work for Global Water, a humanitarian organization that
helps people in Third World countries develop water resources, said
he hasn't seen any high-tech equipment used to find water in poor
places.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous disconnect in bringing state-of-the-art
technology to developing countries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is little dispute about the need. According to the United
Nations, 1.1 billion people worldwide lack adequate drinking water.
Hundreds of thousands die each year of diseases related to a lack of
pure water.</TE>
<TE>   Kyazze, the UNESCO official, said he hopes that Bakhtar will soon
be piloting his tractor--or, perhaps, an SUV with an Earth Radar
attachment--across the site of an Afghan refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, he said, three words have described the technology used
to find water resources in the developing world: "trial and error."</TE>

<HD>Southland Solution for Thirsty World?</HD>
<DH>Science: An immigrant engineer says his radar device can
find water 600 feet below ground. Some are skeptical, but he has
powerful supporters.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, there are refugees in
desperate need of water. On the 10th fairway of the Simi Hills Golf
Course, there is Khosrow Bakhtar and his amazing contraption, which
he believes is the answer to their prayers. At first glance, it does
not inspire confidence. Bakhtar's Earth Radar device looks like a
tractor pulling a very crude plow. Golfers stare at it uncertainly,
the way they might greet a Chevy Nova abandoned on the back nine.</LD>
<LD>   But Bakhtar and his sponsors on this late-winter morning see only
a thing of beauty.</LD>
<LD>   The inventor had just demonstrated how his machine can locate and
map underground water sources--a topic of great interest to the
operators of the golf course but of even greater consequence to
people in arid parts of the Third World, for whom a dry well can
spell death.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's very, very important," said Jones Kyazze, the
director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), who was among about two dozen people attending
the demonstration, held recently at the golf course in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar, an Iranian-born mining engineer educated in Britain and
the United States, developed the machine while under contract to the
Air Force to locate underground munitions. More recently, he has been
working with a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization, Operation
U.S.A., to use the technology for humanitarian purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "The site conditions here today," Bakhtar was saying, "are sunny
and windy."</TE>
<TE>   "And hazardous," observed one man in the small audience of
engineers, hydrologists and humanitarian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Thwack!</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar scrambled for cover. A ball landed a few yards away with
an ominous plock!</TE>
<TE>   This genesis of this odd moment was the meeting, several years
ago, of Bakhtar and Richard Walden, president and chief executive of
Operation U.S.A. At the time, Walden was campaigning for increased
technology transfers from the military to humanitarian organizations.
His main interest was in technology that would help locate and remove
land mines, a focus of his 23-year-old organization.</TE>
<TE>   Mines, often made largely of plastic and buried just beneath the
ground, are notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. Bakhtar
thought his device--capable, he said, of peering 600 feet beneath the
earth's surface and creating three-dimensional images of even plastic
objects--might help.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the course of a PowerPoint demonstration at Bakhtar's
office in Newport Beach that Walden noticed a broad blue band in one
of the underground radar images.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Water," Bakhtar said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know that's more important than finding land mines?"
Walden asked.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Bakhtar has retooled the device for civilian use,
making it so easy, he said, that almost anyone could be quickly
trained to use it. Only two questions remain:</TE>
<TE>   Will someone pay to give it a field test, ideally in an Afghan
refugee camp where U.N. officials are paying a fortune to truck in
water?</TE>
<TE>   And does the thing actually work?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to the first is maybe. The answer to the second: a
conditional yes.</TE>
<TE>   Government May Finance Project</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department has said it would consider bankrolling
an Earth Radar mission to Pakistan. Joseph Bracken, an official with
the department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, said
his office is waiting for a formal proposal from UNICEF in
conjunction with Operation U.S.A.</TE>
<TE>   As for whether it works, the device appeared to pass its test in
Simi Valley with flying colors, and Bakhtar has a loyal core of
believers. However--here is the conditional part--there also are
people with expertise in the field who say his claims sound
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new about the idea of ground-penetrating radar.
Geologists, oil companies and the military have used the technology
for years. But hydrologists and geophysicists say it is best used at
relatively shallow depths, making it of limited use for finding
water, especially in difficult-to-penetrate soil such as clay. In
such conditions, said Temple University geophysicist Jonathan
Nyquist, someone using ground radar might be lucky to see images 30
feet below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Six hundred feet? "I just don't buy it," Nyquist said.</TE>
<TE>   William Clement, a hydrologist at the Center for Geophysical
Investigation of the Shallow Subsurface at Boise State University,
said state-of-the-art ground radar can generally penetrate about 65
feet. In ideal conditions--the Sahara Desert, for instance--it might
go as deep as 100 feet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Six hundred feet? Not a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtar acknowledged with a chuckle that his technology "basically
defies the laws of physics" by rethinking the way in which radar
waves can be focused. By using "forced resonance," which tailors the
radar wavelength to the environment, he said, he can penetrate any
material. And yes, he said, it will go as deep as 600 feet if it is
outfitted with a larger antenna.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Fijany, a computer scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, said JPL scientists have been sufficiently
impressed by Bakhtar's Earth Radar to propose using it to find water
on Mars. NASA is considering the idea, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Jacobs, a civilian program manager at Eglin Air Force Base
in Florida, said Earth Radar had proved effective in finding deeply
buried projectiles at bombing ranges, although the depth of the
munitions was classified. "They went deep, but I can't tell you how
deep," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he wouldn't reveal how much the government paid for Earth
Radar, Jacobs said the device probably had paid for itself the first
time it was employed at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico,
because it saved the military from using far more laborious methods
to find unexploded ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been of considerable use to the government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Walden, Bakhtar's technology has also been used to
search for tunnels along the North Korea-South Korea and U.S.-Mexico
borders. Jacobs said he could not confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Earth Radar cannot be used to hunt for land mines
because they would explode if it were dragged over them. Bakhtar and
Walden are talking about trying to use it from an airborne platform,
such as a hovercraft, but said they have technical hurdles to clear
first.</TE>
<TE>   In operation, Earth Radar resembles nothing so much as a tractor
mower. In his golf course demonstration, Bakhtar drove it about 10
yards, turned around and drove back on a parallel course, then back
again and so on until he had covered a patch of ground about 10 yards
long and 10 yards wide. A computer attached to the tractor recorded
the radar readings, which could then be plotted onto graph-like maps.
On the golf course, he said, the readings reached down about 100 feet
and showed a water table beginning about 63 feet beneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Portability Seen as Advantage</TE>
<TE>   Existing hydrological data indicate a water table within about
five feet of that, according to Jim Evensen, a hydrogeologist who
wrote his master's thesis on the water basin on which the Simi Hills
course is perched. Evensen, who attended the Earth Radar
demonstration, said he was impressed by Bakhtar's invention,
especially because it is relatively portable.</TE>
<TE>   "There are technologies that do similar things," he said, "but
they're really not portable and they're not easy to get out to job
sites." Those technologies rely on seismic, rather than radar, waves,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Ted Kuepper, an environmental engineer who does
volunteer work for Global Water, a humanitarian organization that
helps people in Third World countries develop water resources, said
he hasn't seen any high-tech equipment used to find water in poor
places. "There's a tremendous disconnect in bringing state-of-the-art
technology to developing countries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is little dispute about the need. The United Nations says
1.1 billion people lack adequate drinking water. Hundreds of
thousands die each year of diseases related to a lack of pure water.</TE>
<TE>   Kyazze, the UNESCO official, said he hopes that Bakhtar will soon
be piloting his tractor--or, perhaps, a sport utility vehicle with an
Earth Radar attachment--across the site of an Afghan refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, he said, three words have described the technology used
to find water resources in the developing world: "trial and error."</TE>

<HD>Parents Take an Outside Shot at Prized School's Openings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Close to 400 parents braved cold, gusty winds overnight on a school
playground in Santa Ana to register their children at one of the most
coveted campuses in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Their feelings Saturday morning about the experience at Raymond A.
Villa Fundamental Intermediate School depended on where they stood in
line.</LD>
<LD>   "I was here at 9 a.m. [Friday]," complained Erika Cedeno, 28. "You
know what number I got? Two-hundred-ninety-two."</LD>
<TE>   Hilario Velazquez, 38, arrived six hours after Cedeno to register
his daughter Karin at the prized school, which has openings for 260
students next year.</TE>
<TE>   After district employees and police officers allowed the official
line to form at 5 p.m. Friday, Velazquez ended up third.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was fair," he said, clutching his daughter's
registration packet. The district officials, Velazquez said, "brought
order. The parents were running back and forth. We were running like
horses."</TE>
<TE>   Demand for spaces in Santa Ana Unified School District's six
fundamental schools, which boast a back-to-basics curriculum, is so
great that parents have camped out for days or hired people to stand
in line for them during registration periods.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said that was unfair and unsafe. This year they
set a starting time for lining up: 5 p.m. the day before
registration. They also moved the process from the campuses to
district headquarters on Chestnut Avenue, except for Villa
Fundamental, which is next to the district office.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday afternoon, the number of parents waiting to enter the
district grounds was nearly double the number of spots available at
Villa. When the registration process began promptly at 5 p.m.,
parents rushed through the district complex. One woman fell and
injured her ankle, according to witnesses, and was taken to a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Employing a system similar to that used at rock concerts, district
employees and volunteers distributed sequentially marked ticket
stubs, then randomly drew a number that designated the first in line.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else lined up in increasing order behind that person
until the highest number was reached. Then the lowest number lined up
after that and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The system is designed to take away the advantage of early
arrivers, but some parents felt cheated.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't fair," said Rosa Guerrero, 34, waiting to register her
son Rolando in Villa's sixth grade. "I was here at 2 p.m. yesterday.
We were organized. One of the parents made a list of everyone who was
there and I was number 88."</TE>
<TE>   The list was for naught. After receiving her ticket and the draw,
Guerrero's standing fell to 180.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she was one of the lucky ones able to secure one of the 260
spots. Many of the parents discouraged by their high draw left Friday
night. Those who remained huddled under blankets and watched portable
televisions, played cards or just chatted in Villa's chain-fenced
playground.</TE>
<TE>   "I wore three sweaters," a bleary-eyed Velazquez said. "And I have
sweatpants under my jeans. You have to do what you can for your
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Those who stayed in line but could not get a spot Saturday will be
put on a waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they want a more equitable arrangement.
The district is waiting for word from the state attorney general's
office on whether the first-come, first-served system is illegal
because it gives parents with more time an advantage. The district is
also considering a lottery system.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Attempting to Settle False-Arrest Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is attempting to settle a
federal false-arrest lawsuit brought by a Westlake Village
businessman who was arrested and briefly jailed as the suspect in a
1999 beating that left his ex-wife in a coma.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the Sheriff's Department declined to give specifics on
the proposed settlement with Lee R. Mannheimer until it is approved
by the Board of Supervisors, which is expected to consider the matter
behind closed doors Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm reluctant to talk about the terms until the board hears it
first," Oxnard attorney Alan Wisotsky said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Mannheimer's lawyer, John Burton, also refused to release a dollar
figure. But Burton called the amount a "true compromise" reached
after a daylong session with a federal magistrate overseeing the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The case had been scheduled to go to trial this spring in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "[The county] is agreeing to pay something but nothing near what a
jury would pay if it found 100% for Mr. Mannheimer," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena lawyer added that most of the settlement would go to
Mannheimer's 11-year-old son, Maxx, who is also named as a plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer intends to place the money in a trust account to cover
his son's college costs, his attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer, 59, filed the lawsuit after he was arrested on
suspicion of attempted murder in October 1999 in connection with the
near-fatal beating of his former wife, Linda Lou Morrisset. He was
jailed for four days but released after prosecutors declined to file
charges, citing a lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Although an investigation is still open, no charges have been
filed in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer alleged in his suit that sheriff's detectives violated
his civil rights by arresting him even though he had an "airtight
alibi" the night Morrisset was savagely beaten over the head in her
home near Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
family housekeeper but survived.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer also alleged that detectives maliciously launched a
child-welfare investigation that resulted in his son being removed
from his custody for three months.</TE>
<TE>   He and his son suffered emotional trauma, Mannheimer alleged, and
his reputation was tarnished by news accounts of the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's attorney was unavailable for comment. In court
documents filed in a civil case involving her ex-husband, Morrisset,
50, said she suffered severe brain injuries and is now confined to a
wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer's attorney acknowledged that his client's former wife
is so disabled that she is often unable to exercise her shared
custody rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing she lived," Burton said. "If my client were on the
phone, he would say he is sorry for what happened to her. But he
obviously had nothing to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Other litigation concerning the assault is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer brought a defamation suit against Morrisset, saying she
continues to publicly accuse him of the crime even though no criminal
charges have been filed. Also, Morrisset and her husband, Richard
Morrisset, filed their own action alleging Mannheimer should be found
civilly responsible for the attack and forced to pay an unspecified
amount for his former wife's medical bills, nursing care and
emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   A similar lawsuit was used to win a $33.5-million civil verdict
against O.J. Simpson after he was acquitted of killing his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   The Mannheimer and Morrisset cases have been consolidated and
court records show they are set for a jury trial in Ventura County on
May 20.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was investigated in an alleged murder-for-hire scheme
against Morrisset in 1993, when she was married to him. Northern
California authorities looked into claims that Mannheimer was trying
to hire two men to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   But the case was never filed. Mannheimer denied any involvement in
such a scheme, and the investigation of all three men was later
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, the couple went through a bitter divorce
marked by frequent battles over custody and support issues, court
records show.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer still lives in Westlake Village and holds an executive
position with a Chatsworth lighting company, his attorney said.
Burton described him as a doting father to his son.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Got Help Unfairly, Critics Charge</HD>
<DH>Politics: They say 'hit slate' tactic skirted law, may have
cost supervisor her job. But winner's campaign is defended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final days before the March 5 election, north Orange County
voters received a coordinated series of mailers attacking Supervisor
Cynthia P. Coad and lauding her opponent, Chris Norby.</LD>
<LD>   But Norby, who became the first challenger to unseat an incumbent
supervisor in 22 years, didn't send those mailers--which in smaller
print on the back also urged voters to cast ballots for various other
candidates and measures.</LD>
<LD>   They were from the Voter Education Project, a slate mailer
operation run by veteran political consultants Arnold Forde and Stu
Mollrich of Newport Beach. The two were the consultants behind
Measure W, whose passage defeated the county's plans for an airport
at the former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<TE>   Norby paid an initial $17,500 to be featured on some Voter
Education Project mailers and still owes the consultants about
$140,000, according to his campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the Norby-Coad slate mailers from Voter Education
Project cost $420,000 to $700,000. The difference, they say, is
tantamount to an unreported campaign donation for Norby--one that
circumvents Orange County's landmark political contribution limits,
which don't apply to slate mailers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a local county ordinance that has been completely
scuttled," said Bruce Nestande, chairman of a pro-airport group that
opposed Measure W. "It's like it didn't exist.... In terms of
political reform, it's the most significant thing that happened in
California this election."</TE>
<TE>   Coad said the Voter Education Project mailers--one a day two weeks
before the election--forced her to run against two campaigns, Norby's
and the anti-airport slates backed by pro-Measure W forces. "It's
really a big loophole," she said of the slate mailers.</TE>
<TE>   But Norby campaign manager John Lewis bristled at the suggestion
that Norby owes his win to the slates. If that were so, he said,
Measure W also would have won in north Orange County, when in fact it
lost in every city in Coad's district. "It took a superb candidate
and a superb campaign to beat an incumbent supervisor," said Lewis,
who denied that Norby's campaign will pay less than his share of the
slate mailer costs.</TE>
<TE>   Coad campaign manager Dave Gilliard contends that candidates must
pay fair-market value for being listed on slates, which historically
have been campaign pieces that promote four or more candidates and
ballot measures. Anything less makes the value a contribution, he
said. But the difference for the more elaborate mailers sent by Voter
Education Project is "where it becomes murky."</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocate Shirley Grindle, who helped write the county's
campaign laws, called the slate mail "dirty politics"--but legal.
Attempts to control contributions to slate mailers at the state level
have been unsuccessful, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know a way around this other than it's certainly an
argument for total public financing, which this county is not ready
for," Grindle said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the tactic is limited to Orange County because other
counties don't impose such restrictive contribution limits on
candidates. But political experts, including Gilliard, said they plan
to copy the "hit slate" strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County voters first passed campaign contribution limits in
1978 to control undue political influence by capping
contributions--and in turn controlling the amount spent by campaigns.
Supporters called it TINCUP--for Time Is Now, Clean Up Politics.</TE>
<TE>   The current law, approved in 1992 and dubbed TINCUP II, bars
candidates from collecting more than $1,000 from each donor for each
race. There are no restrictions on how much candidates can give to
their own campaigns or on donations for slate mailers. Throughout
California, 75 cities and nine counties restrict campaign
contributions, including a dozen cities in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, who backed Measure W, raised money for his campaign from
anti-airport forces, mostly in south Orange County. They rallied
behind his bid to unseat Coad, a key member of the Board of
Supervisors' three-vote, pro-airport majority.</TE>
<TE>   On his own, he faced a daunting task: raising enough money to
tackle not just an incumbent, but a wealthy one who had spent nearly
$700,000 of her own money to get elected four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Voter Education Project stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   In the two weeks before the election, Voter Education Project
flooded the north Orange County 4th Supervisorial District with 14
pieces of anti-Coad or pro-Norby mail, according to a review of the
mailers and interviews with officials at both campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The mailers included eight "hit pieces" slamming the incumbent
with headlines such as "Arrogance," "Coad Betrayed Public Health,"
"Breaking Faith," and "Why Does She Lie?"--a large fold-out that
faulted Coad for saying Norby hadn't signed a "Fair Campaign
Practices" pledge--which he had.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the mailers carried pro-Norby messages. Two were centered
on Measure W but included plugs for Norby. A list of 12 candidates
and issues--which qualified the mailer as a slate--was crowded onto
the mailers' back pages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wolf in sheep's clothing," political consultant Scott Hart
said of the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   On election night at the "Yes on W" party in Laguna Hills,
Mollrich said the mailers were legal and appropriate. Although they
focused nearly exclusively on Coad or Norby, all of them contained
messages promoting Measure W and support for other candidates for
various posts who paid to have their names listed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Voter Education Project received $440,000 from the
Yes on Measure W committee, according to campaign finance reports
filed with the county. Norby paid them $17,500. Other payments
included $22,546 from Yes on Prop. 40, a $2.6-billion state park-bond
measure; $15,000 from Republican state controller candidate Tom
McClintock; and $15,000 from Yes on Prop. 42, a state measure
requiring gas taxes to be spent on transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Two political consultants unaffiliated with the race who viewed
the 4th District mailers estimated that they cost $30,000 to $50,000
each to produce and send, depending on how many homes received the
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Forde and Mollrich, who were on vacation and did not return
telephone calls, are known for honing the art of direct political
mail over the last 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   The pair ran the pro-El Toro airport campaigns in 1994 and 1996.
Then the city of Irvine hired them in 1999 for an anti-airport
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The city has paid them at least $1.2 million in the last two years
to develop a park plan for El Toro, according to city contracts and
invoices.</TE>
<TE>   However, the money spent by Voter Education Project mailers came
from individual and company donors, not city funding. It is difficult
to determine how much was spent in the Coad-Norby race.</TE>

<HD>Mailers Gave Norby Break, Critics Charge</HD>
<DH>Politics: 'Hit slate' tactic skirted county law and may
have cost Coad her supervisor's seat, they say. Norby backers defend
his campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final days before the March 5 election, north Orange County
voters received a coordinated series of mailers attacking Supervisor
Cynthia P. Coad and lauding her opponent, Chris Norby.</LD>
<LD>   But Norby, who became the first challenger to unseat an incumbent
supervisor in 22 years, didn't send those mailers--which in smaller
print on the back also urged voters to cast ballots for various other
candidates and measures.</LD>
<LD>   They were from the Voter Education Project, a slate mailer
operation run by veteran political consultants Arnold Forde and Stu
Mollrich of Newport Beach. The two were the consultants behind
Measure W, whose passage defeated the county's plans for an airport
at the former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<TE>   Norby paid an initial $17,500 to be featured on some Voter
Education Project mailers, and still owes the consultants about
$140,000, according to his campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the Norby-Coad slate mailers from Voter Education
Project cost $420,000 to $700,000. The difference, they say, is
tantamount to an unreported campaign donation for Norby--one that
circumvents Orange County's landmark political contribution limits,
which don't apply to slate mailers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a local county ordinance that has been completely
scuttled," said Bruce Nestande, chairman of a pro-airport group that
opposed Measure W. "It's like it didn't exist.... In terms of
political reform, it's the most significant thing that happened in
California this election."</TE>
<TE>   Coad said the Voter Education Project mailers--one a day two weeks
before the election--forced her to run against two campaigns, Norby's
and the anti-airport slates backed by pro-Measure W forces. "It's
really a big loophole," she said of the slate mailers. "It makes it
very hard for a candidate."</TE>
<TE>   But Norby campaign manager John Lewis bristled at the suggestion
that Norby owes his win to the slates. If that were so, he said,
Measure W also would have won in north Orange County, when in fact it
lost in every city in Coad's district. "It took a superb candidate
and a superb campaign to beat an incumbent supervisor," said Lewis,
who denied that Norby's campaign will pay less than his share of the
slate mailer costs.</TE>
<TE>   Coad campaign manager Dave Gilliard contends that candidates must
pay fair-market value for being listed on slates, which historically
have been campaign pieces that promote four or more candidates and
ballot measures. Anything less makes the value a contribution, he
said. But the difference for the more elaborate mailers sent by Voter
Education Project is "where it becomes murky" because of Orange
County's contribution limit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocate Shirley Grindle, who helped write the county's
campaign laws, called the slate mail "dirty politics"--but legal.
Attempts to control contributions to slate mailers at the state level
have been unsuccessful, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know a way around this other than it's certainly an
argument for total public financing, which this county is not ready
for," Grindle said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the tactic is limited to Orange County because other
counties don't impose such restrictive contribution limits on
candidates. But political experts, including Coad consultant
Gilliard, said they plan to copy the "hit slate" strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County voters first passed campaign contribution limits in
1978 to control undue political influence by capping
contributions--and in turn controlling the amount spent by campaigns.
Supporters called it TINCUP--for Time Is Now, Clean Up Politics.</TE>
<TE>   The current law, approved in 1992 and dubbed TINCUP II, bars
candidates from collecting more than $1,000 from each donor for each
race. There are no restrictions on how much candidates can give to
their own campaigns, or on donations for slate mailers. Throughout

<TE>   Norby, who backed Measure W, raised money for his campaign from
anti-airport forces, mostly in south Orange County. They rallied
behind his bid to unseat Coad, a key member of the Board of
Supervisors' three-vote, pro-airport majority.</TE>
<TE>   On his own, he faced a daunting task: raising enough money to
tackle not just an incumbent, but a wealthy one who had spent nearly
$700,000 of her own money to get elected four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Voter Education Project stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   In the two weeks before the election, Voter Education Project
flooded the north Orange County 4th Supervisorial District with 14
pieces of anti-Coad or pro-Norby mail, according to a review of the
mailers and interviews with officials at both campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The mailers included eight "hit pieces" slamming the incumbent,
with headlines such as "Arrogance," "Coad Betrayed Public Health,"
"Breaking Faith," and "Why Does She Lie?"--a large fold-out that
faulted Coad for saying Norby hadn't signed a "Fair Campaign
Practices" pledge--which he had.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the mailers carried pro-Norby messages. Two were centered
on Measure W, but included plugs for Norby. A list of 12 candidates
and issues--which qualified the mailer as a slate--was crowded onto
the mailers' back pages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wolf in sheep's clothing," political consultant Scott Hart
said of the mailers, which he said smacked of classic campaign
attacks. Hart distributes a more traditional slate mailer.</TE>
<TE>   On election night at the "Yes on W" party in Laguna Hills,
Mollrich said the mailers were legal and appropriate. Although they
focused nearly exclusively on Coad or Norby, all of them contained
messages promoting Measure W and support for other candidates for
various posts who paid to have their names listed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Voter Education Project received $440,000 from the
Yes on Measure W committee, according to campaign finance reports
filed with the county. Norby paid them $17,500. Other payments
included $22,546 from Yes on Prop. 40, a $2.6-billion state park-bond
measure; $15,000 from Republican state controller candidate Tom
McClintock; and $15,000 from Yes on Prop. 42, a state measure
requiring gas taxes to be spent on transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Two political consultants unaffiliated with the race who viewed
the 4th District mailers estimated that they cost $30,000 to $50,000
each to produce and send, depending on how many homes received the
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Forde and Mollrich, who were on vacation and did not return
telephone calls, are known for honing the art of direct political
mail over the last 30 years. They formed Voter Education Project in
1989, then called Senior Citizens Voter Education Project.</TE>
<TE>   The pair ran the pro-El Toro airport campaigns in 1994 and 1996,
then the city of Irvine hired them in 1999 for an anti-airport
campaign. The city has paid them at least $1.2 million in the last
two years to develop a park plan for El Toro, according to city
contracts and invoices.</TE>
<TE>   However, the money spent by Voter Education Project mailers came
from individual and company donors, not city funding. It is difficult
to determine how much was spent in the Coad-Norby race, though,
because final campaign reports for the March 5 election won't be
available until July.</TE>
<TE>   A review of preliminary finance reports showed that Norby had
raised $106,000 by Feb. 16 and had given $17,500 to Voter Education
Project. The report showed that he owed them another $17,500. But
Norby campaign manager Lewis, a former state legislator turned
consultant, said the actual amount is $140,000 for the slate mail
sent in the final weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Final spending figures for the campaign will show about $260,000
spent, Lewis said, with $195,000 in outstanding debt. The campaign
sent out 10 of its own mailers, eight highlighting Norby's
accomplishments and two critical of Coad.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said the campaign was "very aware" of the Voter Education
Project slates, knew how many pieces were being sent and what they
said. "We knew what the program was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lewis denied that South County money subsidized the slate
mailers for Norby. "We paid for what we got," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By Feb. 16, Coad had lent herself $340,000, adding another
$200,000 two weeks before the election. Her campaign sent 15 pieces
of mail, most of them centering on her record, said Gilliard.</TE>
<TE>   After the first Voter Education Project slate mailers
materialized, Coad's campaign sent a mailer calling Norby a "lap dog"
for south Orange County donors--showing his head on a cartoon of a
dog.</TE>
<TE>   The timing and type of mail sent by Voter Education Project also
indicated that it was coordinated with the Norby campaign, Gilliard
said. The slate mailers allowed Norby to hit the high road with
positive pieces on his accomplishments, while the mud-slinging came
from outside his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Political activists expect the same strategy to be used in the
future, particularly in countywide races and in the four Orange
County cities with local contribution limits: Anaheim, Irvine, Orange
and Santa Ana. However, they doubt the amount of money generated by
the anti-airport movement will be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always that passion and money by somebody out there,"
Nestande said. "It could be a business group, a labor group, anyone
interested in a contested race. The vehicle is now there to do an
end-run around any local ordinance."</TE>

<LD>The meeting took place in Little Tokyo, at a Chinese joint called the
Far East Cafe.</LD>
<LD>   Private eye Philip Marlowe--this time played by Robert Mitchum, in
the 1975 film version of Raymond Chandler's "Farewell, My
Lovely"--was having lunch when, as Marlowe recalled, "a dark shadow
fell over my chop suey," a hulking ex-con with a bone to pick, the
character Moose Malloy, played by Jack O'Halloran.</LD>
<LD>   Although Mitchum and O'Halloran played their parts well, only the
Far East Cafe brought absolute authenticity to its role.</LD>
<TE>   Opened in 1937 in a building erected in the 1890s, the Far East
Cafe is one of the oldest and most beloved of the city's venerable
eateries. Closed after the 1994 Northridge earthquake wrought havoc
on the building, the restaurant on the north side of 1st Street
between San Pedro Street and Central Avenue is scheduled to stage a
blockbuster comeback as its old self: a dim Depression-era chop suey
joint, full of low-rent intrigue and proud of every bit of it.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the building has been closed for nearly 10 years, out
in front the original two-story vertical neon sign still declared
"CHOP SUEY," with an arrow pointing to the door. Although the
restored eatery won't have Depression-era prices, the ambience will
be unchanged, with the original high wood-paneled booths and naked
fluorescent light tubes. The ancient electric ceiling fan will still
circulate the smells from the kitchen, but the remodeling will
include real air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of Parker Center, the Far East was a gritty little
stage-set for most of its six decades--not only in movies but
probably in back-room deals of political intrigue and bureaucratic
revelry.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, Look Mar Jung, a native of Canton, was 22. He, a brother
and several cousins opened the Far East Cafe in a former hardware
store, located on the bottom floor of a three-story building.</TE>
<TE>   A Chinese restaurant in Little Tokyo struck no one as odd. The
Jung family opened for business in the part of town where, it is
said, the fortune cookie was invented. Nearby, three other Chinese
restaurants were already clustered: San Kwo Low, Lem's and Nikko Low.
Family and friends of the Jungs thought the eatery would fold, but it
quickly became a downtown institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese people like Chinese food," Jung once said from behind
the cash register. "That's why the Far East is in Little Tokyo, not
Chinatown."</TE>
<TE>   The upper floors of the building were given over to a hotel, first
called the Queen and later the Nihon, a 24-room residential hotel.
Over the years, the rooms housed Japanese immigrants: bachelors,
dentists, workers in the bustling furniture and hardware industry,
and even students of a chick-sexing school. (Determining the sex of
young chickens was a tricky craft in days past and required intensive
training.)</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday nights were social gatherings at the Far East," said
Jack Kunitomi, a retired teacher who grew up in the area. "We'd play
a game of baseball, head for the bathhouse around the corner at
Jackson and San Pedro streets, and then go to the Far East, stand in
line freshly bathed, hoping to meet girls."</TE>
<TE>   They would be joined by students from the chick-sexing
school--also located in the hotel--who would graduate and be paid
handsomely for being able to discern in a few seconds between
tomorrow's hens and roosters. Former students rolling in the dough
would always return to the Far East, "driving a brand-new car," said
Kunitomi. "They made so much money that they only had to work for a
few months each year."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, tight-lipped waiters dished up an Americanized cuisine of
egg flower soup, chop suey, chow mein, fried shrimp, fried rice,
almond or sweet and sour pork, and egg foo young.</TE>
<TE>   As the Japanese were hustled out of Little Tokyo and into
internment camps at the start of World War II, the Far East stayed
open, but business was not good. It catered mostly to women, students
and professional chick-sexers--whose work was so crucial to the U.S.
wartime economy that they weren't sent to internment camps, as most
Japanese American professionals were, including physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Good times returned after the war when Japanese families did,
often renting the restaurant's mezzanine for wedding receptions and
wakes. For those who came back from the camps penniless, the Jung
family made living space in the basement and gave them food on
credit, allowing them to pay when they found jobs. Then the Civic
Center expanded, adding more hungry bureaucrats to the daytime
population.</TE>
<TE>   The world changed, Los Angeles changed, but the Far East was set
in its ways.</TE>
<TE>   It never even considered dropping the term "chop suey," an
Americanization that many Chinese regard with contempt. When other
Chinese restaurants began taking down their varnished-wood partitions
to make room for more seating, the high, wood-paneled booths stayed
at the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes small changes were forced upon the Jungs. Curtains were
hung around the booths as privacy for local lawmakers, reporters and
police officers who packed .38s on their hips. The Far East soon
developed a well-deserved reputation as a place where political deals
were cut behind the curtains. But the fire marshal ordered them taken
down in the late 1950s. The curtain rods remain to this day.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, after decades of renting the restaurant
premises, the extended Jung family bought the entire three-story
building. The two upper floors, badly water-damaged, had decayed into
a tomb for pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   The Jungs always thought of themselves as purveyors of chop suey,
not caretakers of history. But beginning in the 1970s, Hollywood and
history buffs discovered the Far East--and the rest of the block, for
that matter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, "Chinatown," starring Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson,
was the Far East's first cinematic role, followed by "Farewell, My
Lovely" the next year. Since then it has been used in location shots
in other movies; a 7-Up commercial; a Lionel Richie video; and in an
episode of the 1987 television drama "A Year in the Life." Jung
himself appeared in two productions, but both times ended up on the
cutting-room floor. The restaurant's most recent role came in 1993,
the year before it closed, in "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Far East and 12 other edifices along 1st
Street--where Chinese and Japanese history can be found underfoot, in
brass-lettered inscriptions embedded in the sidewalk--were designated
a National Historic Landmark, making the properties eligible for
restoration grants and loans.</TE>
<TE>   Like the restaurant beneath it, the upstairs former hotel is
humble but retains graceful hallmark features, among them a grand
staircase with Victorian gingerbread banisters, sculpted wooden door
frames, wainscoting and a gable skylight.</TE>
<TE>   The Jung family recently donated the building to the Little Tokyo
Service Center's Community Development Corp., a nonprofit
organization specializing in affordable housing and economic
development. The Jungs will lease back the restaurant space and
reopen the Far East when the $2.8-million restoration is completed at
the beginning of next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have all the recipes," said Andrew Chong, a grandson of
one of the founders and the principal Jung family spokesman, who was
a busboy and waiter at the Far East and is now a La Puente
optometrist.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps for the reopening, the fortune cookie--said to have been
invented in 1916 just a few doors away from the Far East--will bear a
prediction of good fortune for an L.A. landmark.</TE>

<HD>Calendar Can Leave Students Out in Cold</HD>
<DH>Education: Track system puts some youngsters on vacation at
unusual times of year, often with little to keep them busy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a two-month vacation, North Hollywood High School freshman Ryan
Hitchcock had to return to school last week. A few hours into his
first day back, his eyes were a little glassy and he dragged his feet
around campus. He was unaccustomed to the fast pace. Without much to
do during his break on the A-track schedule at the year-round school,
he had spent weeks "sitting at home, practicing on my guitar."</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, senior Marta Garcia began a B-track vacation
that would keep her away from school until May 1.</LD>
<LD>   "The last break I didn't do anything," she said. "I just stayed
home." Now Garcia is planning to work part time during her break so
she doesn't just get bored and sleep late, as she said she did during
her September-October vacation.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout Los Angeles, about 350,000 students like Hitchcock and
Garcia are out of school during what would be considered unusual
times of year in less crowded school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Students on a traditional calendar can take advantage of many
camps, recreation programs, internships and jobs during their summer
breaks. But those are not so plentiful during schedules that also put
youngsters out of school for long stretches of time in the fall,
winter and spring. In fact, there is a painful shortage of programs
to keep schoolchildren busy during non-summer vacations, parents and
teachers complain.</TE>
<TE>   Such programs have been slow in coming since the track system
began as a response to bulging enrollments in the late 1970s. And
although some students find productive ways to spend their time, many
don't do much more than watch TV, which can leave them bored and
parents uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of the Los Angeles Unified School District's schools
operate on multitrack, year-round calendars, and more will switch to
the schedule later this year. Usually, those campuses distribute
students among three tracks, A, B or C, with rotating vacations in
two chunks of time, about two months each. Some schools have a more
complicated, four-track system.</TE>
<TE>   'There's Nothing Around Here'</TE>
<TE>   Leshan Bradley has four children in Figueroa Street Elementary
School in South-Central and wishes there were more for them to do
during their vacations, which fall in November, December, May and
June. "There's nothing around here. It's a no man's land," said
Bradley, who complained that there isn't a YMCA or Boys &amp; Girls Club
within walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't have a car and doesn't like for the kids to play
outside because of the violence in her community. So, she said they
"just stay at home" with her.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the frustration is that some families have children on
different tracks. That makes it hard to coordinate vacation and
child-care plans, especially for single-parent families or households
in which both parents work full time.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Hentschke, who has worked to provide activities for students
with non-summer vacations, said the need is growing as more schools
adopt the multitrack calendar. "A lot of organizations will do
programs in the summer," she said, "but we really need to be doing
year-round programs."</TE>
<TE>   That's why in 1990 she founded a series of three-week science- and
math-based enrichment programs offered for free to off-track
elementary school students. But the Intersession Enrichment Program
run by the Education Consortium of Central Los Angeles was recently
squeezed out of three schools because of a space crunch. Now it
operates only in two schools.</TE>
<TE>   John Liechty, assistant superintendent of extended day programs
for L.A. Unified, said he worries that the shortage of activities
during non-summer months could lead bored youths, especially
impressionable 10- to 15-year-olds, to negative influences like gangs
or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find activities," he said. "We're looking at
recreation and parks, churches. We're looking at almost anything to
give them."</TE>
<TE>   Liechty runs Beyond the Bell, a program that oversees all before-
and after-school programs in the district's elementary and middle
schools. While off-track youngsters can take advantage of those early
morning and late afternoon sessions, daytime activities are harder to
find.</TE>
<TE>   At North Hollywood High, overcrowding threatens the only program
specifically for off-track students--six weeks of remedial
intersession classes, which last four hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   After this summer, the school may have to replace those with night
or weekend classes, said Karen Waligun, intersession coordinator at
North Hollywood High.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to start thinking out of the box, because there's just
no room on this campus," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Students Visit Family or Find Jobs</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many students have found their own ways to occupy their
time.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Garcia visits family during his winter break. "Usually, I
go to my grandparents' house in Mexico," said the North Hollywood
High senior. Returning to school is difficult because during
vacation, Garcia said, "you don't think about education, you just
think about having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Di Raimondo, a 16-year-old junior, complained that he can't
even go on family vacations anymore because of his year-round
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents used to get their off time during the summer," he
said, which worked when he went to a traditional school.</TE>
<TE>   But now that he has his breaks in March, April, September and
October, while his younger sister is off in the summer, the family
can't coordinate a group trip. Instead, he attends intersession
classes and works at Anchor Blue, a clothing store in the Media City
Center in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Elnora Banks has three children at Figueroa Street Elementary, two
on B track and one on A track. When they are out of school, she said,
she has to "switch them among relatives" who act as baby-sitters.
Then after regular school hours, she takes them to LA's BEST (Better
Educated Students for Tomorrow), an enrichment and recreation
program, at the school.</TE>
<TE>   System Makes It Harder to Identify Truants</TE>
<TE>   The multitrack calendar has also made it harder to deal with
truants, said Lt. Brad Walker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department. With youngsters legitimately out of school throughout the
year, he said truants are not so easy to identify at hangouts such as
Universal CityWalk, where he has worked for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's 10 a.m. and you see six 12-year-olds walking around,
there's a good chance that one of them is truant," Walker said. The
procedure is to question all youngsters about their track, then call
the schools to confirm.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said
he has also seen resulting problems with truancy. "It's kind of
difficult to enforce staying in school and curfews because of the
kids' schedule and the schools' schedule," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The year-round track system seems very strange to people such as
Becky Pantoja, who has two children in North Hollywood area schools
and works full time at a medical office. "We lived in Texas before we
lived here, and they didn't have anything like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Pantoja's 7-year-old son has his A-track vacations, she said,
"He has to stay with the baby-sitter all day. He doesn't like that
too much, because she has a son the same age, but they're on
different tracks."</TE>
<TE>   And her 17-year-old daughter, Ashley Ramos, is taking intersession
classes during the B-track vacation. She wanted to work at Universal
CityWalk, Ashley said, to save money for a car. But her mother
decided it was more important to make up her classes.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood High career advisor Joseph Lane said he has no
problem placing juniors and seniors in jobs during their various
breaks. "Companies don't have a need for employees only during the
summer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lane also said he helps students sign up for classes at community
colleges or adult schools during their breaks. "There are students
who are going to take every opportunity to stay busy, and there are
students who won't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Up With Sports or Other Activities</TE>
<TE>   In another oddity of the system, some off-track students struggle
to keep up with ongoing sports, Advanced Placement classes and other
special activities. They feel as if they are never truly off.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Jackson, a 15-year-old B-track freshman at North Hollywood
High, is one who stays busy. He's off from school now but he's on the
football, basketball, and track and field teams, which have practices
and seasons that don't fully coincide with his academic calendar.</TE>
<TE>   So, Jackson said with a sigh, "I still have to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Wade, a 16-year-old sophomore who is on the A track, was
at North Hollywood High during his vacation too. Because he had six
periods a day of Advanced Placement review for six weeks, Wade said
his vacation was "almost like the break that wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Lissete Varo, a 10-year-old fifth-grader at Figueroa Street
Elementary, said she continues to go to the campus by choice when she
is on vacation. To keep herself busy she volunteers to serve food in
the cafeteria and helps with the LA's BEST program after school
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks two years ago
began offering free off-track enrichment programs to 5- to
18-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which includes academic exercises and sports,
operates at 34 recreation centers in Los Angeles. In the past year,
the program has served almost 140,000 youths, said Alfred Tutungi,
senior director of the Off Track Enrichment Program.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that's not enough but said it's better than what most
youths do now.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of kids who are staying home, watching TV, playing
Nintendo and just hanging out," Tutungi said.</TE>

<LD>   If more people knew CPR, perhaps more children like Mia would be
alive today.</LD>
<LD>   As it is, nationwide, drowning is one of the leading causes of
death for children 5 and under. It has for years also been listed as
a leading cause of death for children 14 and under in California.
Last year in Orange County, nine children 5 and under drowned, the
most since 1996. There were also 30 near-drownings, incidents in
which children survive but often suffer severe brain damage. Over the
past 10 years the county has averaged eight child drownings a year.</LD>
<TE>   What makes these drownings and injuries especially tragic is that
they are preventable. The best approaches are constant adult
vigilance of youngsters anywhere near water, in any kind of setting,
and fencing, barriers and secure gates around backyard swimming
pools. That includes older pools built before such fencing was
required.</TE>
<TE>   Parents should also teach youngsters never to be in a pool alone.
And adults must be ever alert to the dangerous mix of children and
water. Pools aren't the only deadly danger. Toddlers have also
drowned in just inches of water--in bathtubs, buckets and toilets.</TE>
<TE>   What's also vital, especially in homes that have swimming pools,
is being sure that adults and older children are trained in CPR.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, a campaign on the need to learn CPR was
launched by the Orange County Drowning Prevention Network, the YMCA
and Children's Hospital of Orange County, a major facility for
treating the near-drowning victims. The campaign opened with a series
of classes to teach CPR to residents.</TE>
<TE>   We urge residents to learn CPR. It's the least a community should
do that loses an average of eight children a year to drownings.</TE>

<HD>Lowing Tolls Might Create Gridlock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "How About Lowering Tolls for a Change?," Letters, March 10:</LD>
<LD>   A question often asked is, if the toll agency lowered tolls,
wouldn't that produce more traffic and therefore more revenue? Our
riders understand the need to repay the bond debt but want to
understand why lowering the tolls is not a solution to debt
repayment.</LD>
<LD>   First, traffic would probably increase, but so would congestion.
The most important reason to take the toll roads is their speed and
convenience. Second, although traffic would increase if the tolls
were lower, revenue would not. In fact, lower tolls would not only
result in congestion, but a net loss in revenue. The San Joaquin
processes about 80,500 transactions per weekday at an average toll
rate of $2.32. Cut that in half, and traffic would have to increase
significantly to net the same amount of revenue we earn today,
revenue that goes toward paying the bonds.</LD>
<TE>   A 150% increase in traffic would cause gridlock during peak travel
times, and no one wants to pay money to sit in traffic. Our goal is
to retire the long-term bond debt while keeping the roads as
congestion-free as possible. Every dollar collected on the
not-for-profit toll roads is used to repay the debt and cover
operating costs of the toll road system. While there will be periodic
toll rate increases (the next one for the main San Joaquin toll plaza
is scheduled for 2004), the long-range debt repayment plan will
include other structured financial options besides raising tolls.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's public toll roads were built at a time when the
state had no money to build local highways. In the 1980s, elected
leaders knew that if the state could not afford to build roads,
Orange County's growing population would face a future of gridlock.
The choice was not whether to build a freeway or toll road, but
whether to build a toll road or no road. Ultimately, the toll roads'
financing plan enabled 51 miles of roads to be built without new
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   More than 220,000 drivers choose to take the toll road system
every weekday. That's 220,000 fewer drivers clogging our freeways and
arterial roads, making it easier for everyone to get to work and
better yet, to get home.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Crystal Cove Funding Likely," March 8:</LD>
<LD>   Numerous citizens were persuaded to vote for "clean water" after
being inundated with TV commercials promoting Proposition 40 that
featured, among other sylvan scenes, a little girl at a drinking
fountain.</LD>
<LD>   Very few must have taken the time to read the fine print, but The
Times story of March 8 gives us a clue as to where the $2.6 billion
actually will be spent. The subheadline reads, "Prop. 40's passage is
expected to provide money to renovate the 1920s-era cottages and open
them for overnight stays." Maybe they will put a drinking fountain
somewhere on the premises, but 40 does not guarantee the water will
be clean. No wonder a story on the same page has the headline
"Election Turnout Hit a New Low."</LD>

<HD>Veils of Secrecy Over Pedophile Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Ouster of Priest Marks a Change in O.C. Diocese," March 5:</LD>
<LD>   Once again, and perhaps never in a more glaring way, does the
hypocrisy of organized religion confound and mystify. The outrage
expressed by some members of the congregation over Michael
Pecharich's forced departure because he "transgressed the personal
boundaries of an adolescent," and their contention that it should
have been handled privately, only perpetuate the Roman Catholic veil
of secrecy on sexual abuse by priests.</LD>
<LD>   If an admitted pedophile were to move next door, would these same
parishioners insist on such reticence? Maybe it isn't always just the
wolf in shepherd's clothing that ravages the flock.</LD>
<TE>   Craig Morrow</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich was my pastor for several years, and I knew him fairly
well. He was a friend and helped me through a painful time. He is an
intelligent, insightful and sensitive person and an open-minded
priest. And I think he must now be in deep pain.</TE>
<TE>   But I was appalled by the comments by some of the parishioners,
such as putting his name on a parish building. It seems that people
are more concerned about the priest than about the young boy whose
innocence was forever taken from him and whose pain and memories will
endure for the rest of his life. Why wasn't Father Michael fired in
1996? What if this has happened again? Whom did the church protect?</TE>
<TE>   In this time of Catholic outrage (not to mention the money spent)
over outlawing abortion, why hasn't there been the same outpouring of
money, energy and rage in the hierarchy over the terrible human
suffering and damage done by trusted priests to the babies already
born? What a hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Bishop Brown, for exposing what needs to be exposed. I
hope the cardinal is watching and will follow your example.</TE>

<HD>Why Voter Turnout This Month Was So Low</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Election Turnout Hit a New Low," March 8:</LD>
<LD>   The extremely low turnout in this year's primary reflects our
nation's lack of concern for our ailing democracy. From low voter
turnout to the botched 2000 presidential election, the problem is
obvious: It is the lack of respect that the candidates and media give
the youth of this nation.</LD>
<LD>   The media assume their apathy. The candidates debate questions
that come from an older demographic group and pander to the concerns
of the youth as being naive. There is little encouragement for the
youth of this nation to care about politics. What we need is a debate
between the candidates for governor to engage the youth.</LD>
<TE>   The more the concerns of the youth are brushed aside, the weaker
and less democratic our society will be in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Thaddeus Stankowski</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To the effects of the primary's timing and ballot complexity, I
would add that "the Greatest Generation" is passing from the stage. I
would guess that an analysis by precinct would indicate that voter
turnout is directly linked to age.</TE>
<TE>   In the precinct I supervised, the percentage of registered voters
who turned out was 42%, not the 31% reported for the state. Voters
made the effort to come to the poll using wheelchairs, walkers and
canes. Several indicated that they had voted in every election for
more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Further, I believe voter turnout can be viewed as a thermometer
gauging the underlying patriotism of the populace. If so, our leaders
should be concerned about our subnormal temperature.</TE>

Real progressives question prevailing institutions such as marriage,
the role of men, women, children and the family.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, I find Smith's remarks that she isn't a politician
are very disingenuous. Anyone who can traverse the political spectrum
from Barry Goldwater to Eldridge Cleaver is not only a politician but
is someone with no real ethical center, and has decided, in the end,
to become the ultimate politician, that is, a political broker.</LD>

<LD>Re "Judge Overturns 'Critical Habitat' of 2 Species," Feb. 26:</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the Rancho Mission Viejo developers and the toll
road agencies are suing to overturn critical habitat for endangered
species because of financial concerns raises many questions.</LD>
<LD>   Why isn't the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service doing its job to
protect the species for which it fought so hard to protect with a
critical habitat?</LD>
<TE>   How naive is it to think that the 14,000 houses, a toll road and
the malls and gas stations that will follow won't affect the habitat
of endangered species? Why is President Bush's administration so hot
to remove critical habitat for nearly 100 endangered species? How can
we be expected to stand by and allow big business and misguided
politicians to make decisions that will affect the future of many
species, but also the way of life for those of us who value open
spaces, clean water and clean air?</TE>

<LD>Re "Fire Directors OK With Retooling Volunteers," Feb. 7:</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Fire Authority has presented a lot of statistics
that show the volunteer/reserve firefighters are not needed and not
relied upon as front-line units. Here in Seal Beach, this is simply
not true.</LD>
<LD>   For political reasons, Villa Park, Sunset Beach and the canyon
stations get to keep their engines. The program admittedly has
problems in other parts of the county, but it works here and has
since 1928.</LD>
<TE>   They tell you the reserves are undertrained, yet they have put on
only a handful of weekend training classes over the past three years
and not allowed them to hire new volunteers. The authority is ending
the service of 18 emergency units altogether, and six units in this
part of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach volunteer firefighters spend three hours a week
training and make it to about 90% of the calls they are dispatched
to.</TE>
<TE>   Don't fall for the statistical manipulation. In some cases they
will show that they never made it on-scene, but this is because they
either get canceled due to no emergency or a pager malfunction. Very
rarely do they not have enough manpower to get our emergency units
out.</TE>
<TE>   Almost any time a large incident has occurred throughout the
county, most likely a Seal Beach volunteer firefighter was there to
help.</TE>

of what she spent on her campaign. Some voters thought he could never
win, inasmuch as Coad secured all the "heavyweight" Republican
endorsements. It just confirmed that voters were more concerned about
the issues Norby presented and less impressed with Coad's endless
list of meaningless endorsements of elected officials who live
outside District 4.</TE>

<HD>Measure W Is Settled, but Not the Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "El Toro's Future," March 9:</LD>
<LD>   The passage of Measure W was a great victory, not only for those
who live in South County, but for future generations of Orange County
residents.</LD>
<LD>   The news, however, that the Navy is planning to sell the El Toro
property to the highest bidder is alarming. Those of us who voted for
Measure W did so not only to prevent an airport from being built at
El Toro, but also to create the dream of a great park, along the
lines of Griffith Park in Los Angeles and Balboa Park in San Diego.
That, indeed, was the promise of Measure W.</LD>
<TE>   But, according to news reports, already greedy developers can't
wait to get their grubby mitts on El Toro. If El Toro is to become
just another 21st century mega-development, complete with Wal-Marts,
Costcos, strip malls and cookie-cutter housing developments, then the
supporters of Measure W have been betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   The vision of Measure W was a park consisting of open space,
cultural and historic areas, natural habitats and the like for the
enjoyment of all Orange County residents and visitors. We must assure
that this vision is kept alive and not sacrificed for the sake of
greed.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Rose</TE>
<TE>   Former councilman</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Lichman of the Airport Working Group and pro-airport
supervisor Chuck Smith need to face the music. Not only have Orange
County voters killed the county's airport plans, but the Navy has
confirmed that it is disposing of the base for nonaviation use. Smith
will try to convince the FAA that they should build an airport. And
Lichman is trying to defuse a measure that even a judge suggested was
the viable means to ending the airport plan. These people need a
wake-up call to reality, and fast.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Baron</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Can the majority of voters on Measure W feel anything but
deceived? Where is the "park" in the Great Park Initiative? Remember
Irvine's "Plan for America's Greatest Park" with all the promotional
pictures of families at play?</TE>
<TE>   As the final votes were being counted, the true agenda for this
measure was put on the table. Where is the benefit to Orange County
by the sale of El Toro to private developers? Where is the traffic
going to go for the tens of thousands of homes in the heart of Orange
County? Is this legal?</TE>
<TE>   What were we really voting for? Who were the people who knew about
this hidden agenda, and either supported Measure W or maintained
their silence with the intent of defrauding us all? What do we have
now? No park, no airport and tens of thousands of new homes in the
near future to crush the already burdened freeway system.</TE>
<TE>   It was true. There is no "Great Park" in the Great Park
Initiative. There is no way this can be legal.</TE>
<TE>   Robby Conn</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is reassuring that we as Americans have such a forum in our
country to express our views and participate in the process. What I
find infuriating is the continual subversion of the few to the will
of the many in our electoral process.</TE>
<TE>   We live in a democracy, which means in our elections, the majority
wins. Our system of democracy does not mean elections are valid only
when moneyed elite agree with the results. In spite of our many
faults as a culture, we often see that the citizens truly understand
the issues at stake in an election.</TE>
<TE>   How many times do we have to vote on El Toro? Why are the
pro-airport supervisors so surprised at Chris Norby's victory over
Cynthia P. Coad? And on what moral or political grounds can each and
every anti-airport initiative be overturned and challenged by a few
individuals who at the very least are wasting money that is sorely
needed for infrastructure, education, police and health care?</TE>
<TE>   I want to sue them for violating my right to have my vote count. I
want to sue them for wasting my tax dollars on elections and
marketing schemes for something we continually say we do not want and
denying my community's children, elderly and poor the support they
need. I want to sue them for denying me the police, education and
county services, for which I pay dearly, to fund projects that have
been voted down at least three times.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy is tedious and seems to thwart the powerful. This is why
campaign finance has become the fiasco it is. In the end our
government is truly by the people and for the people. The masses
really do count. Those who find that the will and rights of the
people thwart their agenda have to resort to buying influence. In a
strange way, it shows how powerful our system is, and when full
participation happens in America, we will have the utopia we all
believe in as her citizens.</TE>

<TE>   So South County turned out in full force and dealt a crippling
blow to an airport at El Toro. The only North County city supporting
Measure W was Tustin. Now it looks as if there will be a developer
feeding frenzy on the buffer zone and 4,700-acre base, adding
thousands of residents and cars to the congested roads. The traffic
will be far worse than what an airport would have brought. As a
result, the Saddleback Valley may have smog alerts rivaling the
Inland Empire. But if that is what South County really wants, so be
it.</TE>
<TE>   However, this is to put South County on notice not to get any
bright ideas of shoving your air cargo and transport burdens onto
either Los Alamitos or Long Beach airports. In fact, two out of the
five Irvine council members (Mike Ward and Greg Smith) have said that
Los Alamitos would be a good alternative to El Toro. The cities near
those airports soundly rejected Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   There may have been some token support up here for a "Great Park,"
which obviously will never happen. This is due to the lack of private
funds that could ever be raised to buy the land from the Navy and
then pay for building it.</TE>
<TE>   Since Palmdale and Victorville airports are among the very few
that have community support, feel free to drive out there. Just be
sure to leave plenty early to catch your flight on time.</TE>

<TE>   Re "In Jolt to O.C., Navy to Sell Off El Toro Land," March 7:</TE>
<TE>   "For Sale: 4700 acres of land, zoned exclusively for park-related
purposes; known areas of heavy industrial pollution, but no completed
site pollution survey and no plan for cleanup by owner. Owner willing
to subdivide."</TE>
<TE>   Will such land sell on the open market for $1 million an acre? To
whom, and for what use? The Navy must follow base closure law in
disposing of El Toro land. Deed restrictions on each parcel must
recognize the property's current zoning restrictions (park-compatible
only), even if the city of Irvine gains control of the property. The
article failed to mention this.</TE>
<TE>   And any buyer would become immediately responsible for cleanup
costs should additional pollution be found on their parcel of land.
Can you imagine a commercial land developer willing to take on these
pollution cleanup risks without a thorough site inspection report?
Any land rush at El Toro will have to await a lengthy escrow, I'm
afraid. The article missed this point as well.</TE>
<TE>   But given these problems, I wish the Navy well if it does decide
to sell off the land in parcels, and I wish the buyers well as they
develop their park-compatible land. (Thank God for Measure W.) This
is a far better way to reuse this land than building an unneeded,
financially dangerous and environmentally disastrous airport at El
Toro.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The passage of Measure W means that Orange County, a dynamic,
multiethnic powerhouse on the world economic stage, will be stuck
with dinky little John Wayne Airport as its only commercial airport.
Those responsible for this situation, especially those who think that
John Wayne's level of scheduled air carrier service can be easily
expanded to meet the county's growing air transportation needs,
should ponder the following the next time they book a flight out of
John Wayne:</TE>
<TE>   Its annual number of landings and takeoffs is more than twice as
many as the airport should be handling. The airport's 5,700-foot main
runway does not meet the design standards for the airliners using the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   In November a Delta Airlines MD90 jet blew a tire while trying to
stop after landing. This resulted in an emergency closure of the
airport for four hours, disrupting flight schedules from Seattle to
Atlanta. Finally, and this is the clincher: In February, at Burbank
Airport, a Southwest Airlines pilot was unable to stop his Boeing 737
after landing on that airport's 6,886-foot runway and wound up
partially in a gas station. If that had happened at John Wayne, the
aircraft could have wound up in a fireball on the Corona del Mar
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   All this while seven miles away sits the former El Toro base, with
grass growing through the cracks in its 10,000-foot runways. It's
probably going to take a catastrophic accident at John Wayne to wake
the people of Orange County up to what they missed when they approved
Measure W. By then, of course, it will be too late.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro's Future," March 9:</TE>
<TE>   It's refreshing to see Rep. Christopher Cox continuing to promote
the sale of the former El Toro Marine base. Most free-market
proponents in Congress are more than willing to bend their ideology
by pushing pork-barrel projects to bring jobs and money to their
congressional districts. But not Cox; he'd prefer to see billions of
dollars flow out of Orange County to support the Pentagon. But would
he be so enthusiastic if the money instead went to expand Head Start
or fund Social Security and increase environmental protections?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The March 5 election, with its apparent finality to the contentious
El Toro airport battle, provides both a challenge and an opportunity
for the Board of Supervisors to make a fresh start. The board will be
saddled for the remainder of this year with a lame-duck governing 3-2
majority, but it has a rare window now, and again early next year, to
alter in a fundamental way its troubled relationship with many county
constituencies, and to bring the regional governance of Orange County
into the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   This is a county that for a long time was run as if it were a club
where key insiders with influence handpicked political leaders and
then told them what they wanted done. Local campaign finance reforms
did begin bringing the county into the modern era, while high-tech
businesses delivered a middle class with high expectations to the new
cities and unincorporated areas of the county.</LD>
<LD>   But the 1994 bankruptcy revealed many lingering defects in how the
county still was run, and the long El Toro debate left hard feelings
about the quality of county leadership.</LD>
<TE>   Now that the airport part of El Toro reuse appears resolved,
attention can be turned elsewhere. Decisions on major public policy
matters need to be made differently in the future. They should be
arrived at much more openly and inclusively.</TE>
<TE>   The county has many sophisticated groups of citizens and community
leaders who ought to have a place at the policy table. Some
supervisors have been responsive to these changes, but for too long
as a group the board majority has taken too many cues only from
special interests.</TE>
<TE>   There must be a higher caliber of leadership and initiative from
the board to address the specific regional problems of jails, land
use, water quality, housing and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a new county landscape on which these decisions will
play out. The diversity of Orange County's population in a new
century was evident in the recent census, in older cities like Santa
Ana and new ones like Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   In the newer suburbs, residents with concerns about quality of
life have mobilized and created a new kind of e-mail-based democratic
activism centering on the environment and growth. Meanwhile, older
neighborhoods have lagged behind in the computer age, threatening to
leave the county with its own version of the so-called digital
divide.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of change, the county's political leadership has
plodded along. While the county has bickered over El Toro, it
necessarily has had to give secondary treatment to important areas of
concern, covering the need for low-income housing, better
transportation, approaches to redevelopment and environmental
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   We know for certain that the old governing coalition that was the
hallmark of the late 1990s of Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, Chuck Smith
and Jim Silva will be broken by the defeat of Coad and the arrival of
Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby. In recent years, this voting
bloc has bucked the tide of county sentiment and common sense on the
allocation of tobacco settlement money to address county health care
needs, and has proved inflexible on substantive modification of the
now-defunct El Toro airport plan.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro highlighted the important central question of what kind of
place Orange County would be. But as residents and city councils took
up these questions in earnest, there was never a corresponding sense
that the county's leadership at the Board of Supervisors level as a
group was up to the task of steering the county through the changing
times.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat of an El Toro airport and the formation of a new board
now make possible a climate in which the county really does have an
opportunity to start anew.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors in the post-Measure W world no doubt are trying to
get their bearings. The defeat of the El Toro airport in two
consecutive ballot initiatives is a crushing setback for the
governing majority. It is now up to them in the remainder of the year
to recognize that the electorate has spoken for change.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms in county management practices that took place during
the bankruptcy recovery period were significant, but the sense of a
new day in Orange County never was possible as long as the civil war
over El Toro raged on. The board majority, instead of being chastened
by the big disaster of the mid-1990s, allowed El Toro to become a
lasting source of contention in the community.</TE>
<TE>   The board now has the opportunity as well as the power to shape
the county's approach to its future. That's the important big picture
to think about now.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Political System Called 'Out of Whack' After Mailers</HD>
<DH>Elections Voter guide in 2000 election thought by some to
have led to the defeat of councilman. Complaints filed with state
oversight panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hybrid campaign mailer that helped to defeat Supervisor Cynthia
P. Coad in the March 5 election debuted in the Irvine city elections
of 2000, when a traditional slate roster first was grafted onto a
hard-hitting issue brochure.</LD>
<LD>   A slate-mailer organization was formed that year by Ed Dornan, an
ally of then-mayoral candidate Larry Agran, who had been elected to
his second stint on the council in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine limits campaign contributions to $320 per donor, but has no
limits for slate mailers--mass mailings that list four or more
candidates and ballot measures.</LD>
<TE>   Dornan called his slate the Hometown Voter Guide. He took payments
of $7,000 to $10,000 from council candidates Chris Mears, Beth Krom
and Anthony Dragun--challengers hoping to fill the seats of
incumbents Dave Christensen and Mike Ward, plus Agran's council seat
after his unopposed bid for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, Hometown Voter Guide distributed 13 mailers
in Irvine, including five pieces blasting Christensen, Ward and
candidate Ken Hanson, an ally of Ward's.</TE>
<TE>   Three other mailers were promotions for Agran, Mears, Krom and
Dragun.</TE>
<TE>   Another five mailers backed Agran's slate and three candidates for
Irvine school board.</TE>
<TE>   Ward won reelection but Christensen was defeated. Mears and Krom
won seats on the council. School candidate Carolyn McInerney also
won.</TE>
<TE>   Dornan defended the slate mailers, saying they were "perfectly
allowed" within local and state laws. The negative mailers--one of
which featured a photo of a scowling Christensen--were "absolutely
based on facts," he said. "It's a question of how you handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Agran, his candidates and Hometown Voter Guide spent more than
$400,000 on city races, about half of it outside the reach of the
city's contribution limit, Councilman Greg Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It threw Irvine's local political system completely out of
whack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the mailers was further muddled, Smith said, by a
$45,000 contribution from the Safe and Healthy Communities Fund, a
nonprofit group formed to fight the county's efforts to build an
airport at the closed El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   The group is a foundation and not required to list its
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, John Oetken, Orange County coordinator for
Common Cause, a good-government group, complained to the Irvine City
Council about the slates.</TE>
<TE>   He said the mailers too closely resembled campaign pieces and
their source couldn't be easily identified.</TE>
<TE>   Several complaints about the Irvine election were filed with the
state Fair Political Practices Commission, alleging the slate mailers
were designed to skirt the laws.</TE>
<TE>   The commission hasn't announced any action as a result of the
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Dornan said recently that he can't take credit--or blame--for the
hard-hitting mailers, which evolved out of a desire to do more than
just list a person's name. He said he doesn't believe they led to the
defeat of Christensen, who trailed top vote-getter Mears by more than
6,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish it were that simple," he said.</TE>

<HD>Henry Woods, 83; U.S. Judge Was Removed From a Whitewater
Case</HD>

<LD>Henry Woods, 83, a federal judge who was removed from a Whitewater
case because he was a friend of President Clinton, died of
undisclosed causes Thursday in Little Rock, Ark.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Abbeville, Miss., Woods earned his law degree at the
University of Arkansas. He was an FBI agent and honored trial lawyer
before President Carter appointed him a U.S. District Court judge for
eastern Arkansas in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, an appeals court panel removed Woods from a Whitewater
case against Arkansas' then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. Woods had dismissed
an indictment against Tucker, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated it and said Woods should let another judge handle
the case. Tucker later pleaded guilty in the case after it was
assigned to another judge.</LD>
<TE>   Woods also was involved in the Little Rock School District's 1982
lawsuit against the state and neighboring districts over
desegregation of the Little Rock district. The 8th Circuit Court
reversed an order in which Woods required the predominantly black
Little Rock district to merge with two nearby, predominantly white
districts.</TE>

<HD>'Mel' Stewart, 72; TV, Movie Actor, Acting Teacher and Jazz
Saxophonist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton "Mel" Stewart, an actor whose work was familiar from
television shows such as "All in the Family" and "Scarecrow and Mrs.
King," died of Alzheimer's disease Feb. 24 at a nursing home in
Pacifica, Calif. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime Bay Area resident also was an acting teacher whose
students included Danny Glover, and was an accomplished saxophonist
as well. He had a black belt in aikido and ran a martial arts school
for inner-city youths in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart started acting as a teenager with a neighborhood theater
in Cleveland, where he was born. He later moved to New York, where he
won roles in several Broadway productions, including Langston Hughes'
"Simply Heavenly." He played saxophone with such jazz legends as John
Coltrane and Charlie Parker.</LD>
<TE>   He moved to Northern California in the 1960s and joined the
improvisation group called the Committee, which brought him to
Hollywood's attention. Television and film brought a steady stream of
roles in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   He was a semi-regular from 1971 to 1973 on "All in the Family,"
the groundbreaking CBS series that starred Carroll O'Connor as the
bombastic, blue-collar Archie Bunker. Stewart portrayed the outspoken
Henry Jefferson, a member of the black family next door to the
Bunkers who was, as TV historians Tim Brooks and</TE>
<TE>   Earle Marsh once wrote, "as opinionated from the black point of
view as Archie was from the white."</TE>
<TE>   Often cast as an authority figure because of his stern
countenance, Stewart also appeared in such movies as "Steelyard
Blues" in 1973 and "Newman's Law" in 1974. He retired from acting
after making "Made in America" with Whoopi Goldberg in 1993, telling
his wife, Annie Dong-Stewart, that there were "too many black bald
actors in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   When not performing, Stewart taught acting in workshops at San
Francisco State University and through a theater group he founded
called BANTU (Black Actors Now Through Unity). He also taught and
directed plays at the Center for African and African American Art and
Culture in San Francisco and the Black Repertory Group Theatre in
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Although acting paid the bills, Stewart's "first true love" was
music, Dong-Stewart said. A self-taught musician, he played the flute
and the piano in addition to the tenor sax, and frequently performed
in Bay Area clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 25 years, he leaves a daughter, Alia
Dong-Stewart, also of Pacifica; and a brother, Morris, of Cleveland.</TE>

<HD>Great Park's Time Has Come</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY AGRAN</AU>
<BD>Larry Agran is mayor of Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On March 5, the people of Orange County made history. By a convincing
58% majority, voters approved Measure W, the "Great Park" initiative,
thereby enacting a brand-new law that will change our county forever.</LD>
<LD>   The importance of what happened was confirmed by the Department of
the Navy on the morning of March 6, just hours after the election
results were known. Navy spokesmen said three things.</LD>
<LD>   First, they said Measure W, by its terms and as a matter of law,
did indeed kill the El Toro airport plan.</LD>
<TE>   Second, they said that in pursuing the complex process of
restoring the 4,700 acres at El Toro to civilian use, the federal
government will honor the terms of Measure W. This means that the
Great Park we envision at El Toro--right in the center of our
county--should become a reality in the years ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Third, Navy spokesmen have indicated that they are impatient with
Orange County's marathon struggle over El Toro. They expect us to
work out a plan for the earliest possible transfer of the land in a
way that benefits the public. That means we all have a lot of work to
do in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Our top priority now must be to enlist the cooperation of Orange
County cities and county officials in order to bring about the
long-anticipated annexation of El Toro by Irvine. Annexation would
bring the former base under Irvine's land-use jurisdiction, just as
our own General Plan has contemplated for nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Once all parties agree that El Toro is subject to Irvine's
land-use planning, the city then will be in a position to begin
planning and creating the magnificent park that was envisioned by
Measure W--an Orange County Great Park twice the size and every bit
as beautiful as San Diego's Balboa Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the heat of the campaign, opponents of Measure W claimed that
the initiative was simply a clever ploy. They said that we never had
any intention of creating one of the great metropolitan parks of the
world. Well, they're wrong. Just watch us!</TE>
<TE>   Once Irvine annexes the land, the first phases of the Great Park
can start to emerge within the next few years--and at very little
cost. On the western edge of the old base, Cal State Fullerton's
satellite campus will open this fall. It can expand quickly and
become a premier educational institution that beckons other public
and private colleges and universities to locate at the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   On the eastern edge of the base, simple hiking, biking, and riding
trails can be constructed, linking thousands of Orange County
residents to a series of nature centers and staging areas that
provide easy entry into the 1,100-acre wildlife and nature preserve
already set aside as part of the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   Also along the eastern edge, where there already is a public golf
course, we should construct dozens of amateur athletic
fields--especially soccer and softball fields for Orange County
youth.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the base, we should reclaim quickly and reuse--on an
interim basis-- the 1,200 abandoned homes and more than 3,000
apartment and dormitory-style housing units.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing people back to El Toro will help create a sense of
community that will be key to the Great Park's planning, growth and
success.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not forget agriculture. More than 1,000 acres at El Toro can
be made available to area farmers. In exchange for interim farming
rights, public-spirited farmers would be eager to create a model farm
and even a museum to agriculture--to put us all back in touch with
Orange County's agricultural heritage while also helping us create
the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   These are all things that can happen on the ground at El Toro
within the next few years. But during this time we also will be
enlisting the world's leading landscape architects, and we'll be
reaching out to citizens from every corner of Orange County to
develop a master plan for the Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on availability of state park-bond funds and
philanthropic funds, other wonderful amenities will begin to emerge:
botanical gardens; art, history and science museums; performing arts
venues; and a veterans memorial and cemetery to honor those who have
served our country.</TE>
<TE>   While some elements can materialize much sooner than many people
think, the fully evolved Orange County Great Park will be decades in
the making. But the important thing is to begin--and to begin with a
plan.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 30 years of master-planned community development to
our credit, we in Irvine have learned that good planning inevitably
adds value. It creates personal and community wealth. It enables us
to preserve and even enhance the quality of life that we all cherish.</TE>

<HD>Wild Spring Breaks Aren't for Everyone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAISY YU</AU>
<BD>Daisy Yu of Huntington Beach is in her second year at
Boston University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fliers usually begin to appear on campus bulletin boards and
elevators in early December. With their bright blue lettering and
palm-tree designs, these brochures are hard to ignore, even if spring
break is three months away.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy to become wrapped up in the glitz and glamour of the
commercialized spring break, especially when it seems that everyone
around you is planning an exotic vacation. Of course, no student
wants to admit that his or her spring break will be uneventful and
boring. But for many students, the week can be a chance to shy away
from the typically wild college behavior. In fact, it can be a
weeklong opportunity for students to further their education and
begin exploring future careers.</LD>
<LD>   Many student travel organizations offer free vacation packages to
students who spread the word and recruit others to sign up for a trip
to the Bahamas. The companies' promise of free alcoholic drinks,
nonstop after-hours parties, and beautiful beaches for only $500 is
enticing to stressed-out undergraduates. For many students attending
school on the East Coast, these midyear getaways offer a relief from
the bitter winter weather and the opportunity to trade their snow
boots for flip-flops.</LD>
<TE>   Even the youth-driven cable network, MTV, promotes spring break.
Every year, the network chooses a coastal location and then teams up
with national travel agencies to advertise MTV-sponsored rock
concerts and game shows. Unfortunately, spring break usually occurs a
week before or after the dreaded college midterms. Although the break
is a week of relaxation and fun, it also marks the middle of the
semester.</TE>
<TE>   Some college students prefer to relax in a different way, using
the week to catch up on homework. Many professors require that term
papers and group projects be turned in the week before the break,
because it allows them the opportunity to grade homework without the
pressure of an immediate deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Because many of the larger dorms lock up during spring break,
college program directors take advantage of the fact that some
students have no place to go. In conjunction with volunteer
organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, colleges are now offering
students a chance to participate in outreach programs over spring
break.</TE>
<TE>   Local groups also organize events that benefit the surrounding
community. Moreover, language students are given the opportunity to
visit other countries to further their cultural experiences. It is a
less costly alternative to summers or even semesters abroad.</TE>
<TE>   For those who commute to college, many students work full time to
earn extra money. With a week free from scheduled classes, students
are given the liberty to spend their time however they choose. Many
college students use spring break to let loose by illegally drinking
and doing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   It is a time when people forget their responsibilities and engage
in inappropriate behavior without thinking of the consequences that
might affect them later. While surrounded by good friends on a
beautiful beach, students oftentimes use spring break as an excuse to
act recklessly. Even video production companies are aware of the
openness of students on spring break, as evidenced by the tasteless
videos of drunk college girls sold on late-night television.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, many young people do not realize that education and
respectability cannot be put off for a week, nor can they be
instantly taken up again when classes reconvene. Learning is an
ongoing process that occurs whether or not we are given a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible for students to have a
good time on their spring break while also gaining something more
valuable than the perfect tan. For my week of vacation, I stayed in
New York City and spent the time visiting the site of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the Statue of Liberty. I also checked out the
offices of some prospective design companies where I might like to
work someday.</TE>
<TE>   In the mornings, I read my English textbook and finished up
William Faulkner's "Light in August." I had fun experiencing New York
while also considering a possible career in the fashion industry.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is tempting to use this vacation as an excuse to let
go of all sensibilities, young people must remember to take on spring
break with moderation. It is not a week to forget the value of good
judgment. Rather, spring break should be a time for students to enjoy
the benefits of their education while exploring possible
opportunities for the future.</TE>

<LD>I spent almost a month in Tahiti, on Moorea, last July. It's a
great place to take a family trip. The ocean is as blue and clean as it
gets, and the beaches are pristine. There's a lot of traditional native
culture in Tahiti. The men are fishermen. Every day you're on the beach
having fruit for breakfast, and you see everyone piling by on their
Tahitian canoes. The women are very much into their native French
Polynesian dances. The food is pretty good. For fine dining, Te Honu Iti
Chez Roger in Cook's Bay is a good spot. And Le Cocotier, which serves
French and local Tahitian cuisine, is a find for lunch. Discovery: Taimie
beach is a really cool white sand beach, super safe, with no waves. The
Sofitel built its hotel there but it's really public property.</LD>

<LD>The new Lodge at Torrey Pines in La Jolla may be the ultimate
California bungalow. The 175-room luxury resort is modeled on Pasadena's
Gamble and Blacker houses, Arts and Crafts masterpieces from the early
20th century by architects Charles and Henry Greene. The Craftsman
movement emphasized simplicity of design, indoor-outdoor living and
materials harmonizing with the natural environment--a fitting aesthetic
for a resort situated among pine trees on the bluffs overlooking the
Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel, scheduled to open April 4, is the brainchild of San Diego
native Bill Evans, whose Evans Hotels owns the area's Catamaran and Bahia
hotels, and who is on a mission to showcase "pre-Frankie and Annette"
California culture. A historian vetted all architectural details in the
near-total renovation of an old hotel on the site, from the post-and-beam
structure to the lighting fixtures to the William Morris-inspired
textiles. Only a few modern conveniences, such as T1 lines, are
anachronistic. Guest rooms feature Stickley-style furniture,
granite-topped bars and leather chaise longues. All rooms overlook the
18th green of the municipal Torrey Pines Golf Course or the gardens in
the central courtyard.</LD>
<TE>   The hotel's gourmet restaurant, A.R. Valentien, is named for the
turn-of-the-century San Diego Impressionist and displays a substantial
collection of his works. Chef Jeff Jackson, formerly of Shutters on the
Beach in Santa Monica, will preside over a menu of California cuisine and
a list of California wines.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,750-acre Torrey Pines State Reserve nearby is home to 17 types
of sage. Guests not rejuvenated by the natural environment can always
retreat to the lodge's 9,500-square-foot spa for a Coastal Sage Scrub.</TE>
<TE>   The Lodge at Torrey Pines, 11480 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla; (858)
453-4420, www.lodgetorreypines.com. Rates: $350 to $900, double
occupancy.  Hotel guests get guaranteed tee times; golf packages are
available.</TE>

<LD>Sharing a Champagne toast in a secluded scenic spot sounds great,
but those delicate crystal glasses don't travel well--ask any honeymooner
who has wrapped a pair in a dish towel and stuffed them into a backpack.
GSI Outdoors addresses the problem with its Travel Champagne Flutes. Made
of a lightweight, indestructible resin, the 4-ounce flutes come in their
own mesh carrying case, and the two-piece design (the stems unscrew from
the bowl) makes for easy storage. Best of all, they look significantly
more elegant than plastic cups. Travel Champagne Flutes, $19.85 from
Magellan's, (800) 962-4943, fax (800) 962-4940, www.magellans.com.</LD>

<LD>Say "museum," and many see hushed galleries of paintings. But the
term is being redefined by a crop of niche museums ranging from silly to
sublime. Joining the ranks in the coming months are contenders that even
kids will enjoy.</LD>
<LD>   Charles M. Schulz Museum, opening Aug. 17-19. The "Peanuts" comic
strip will soon be a cultural institution in more ways than one.
Treasures on view at the $8-million, 27,000-square-foot facility in Santa
Rosa, Calif., will include a recently salvaged mural that Schulz painted
on the wall of his infant daughter's bedroom in 1951, with early versions
of Charlie Brown and Snoopy (who walked on all fours in those days). For
the museum's main hall, Japanese artist Yoshiteru Otani has created a
tile mural commemorating Charlie Brown's futile attempts to kick the
football held by the sadistic Lucy Van Pelt, and a 7,000-pound morphing
Snoopy sculpture showing the irrepressible beagle's evolving look during
the strip's 50-year run. Across the street, fans can visit Snoopy's
Gallery &amp; Gift Shop and the Redwood Empire Ice Arena, which is also home
to the Warm Puppy coffee shop.</LD>
<LD>   Charles M. Schulz Museum, One Snoopy Place (corner of West Steele and
Hardies lanes), Santa Rosa; (707) 579-4452, www.charlesmschulzmuseum.org.
Hours and admission prices were not available at press time.</LD>
<TE>   International Spy Museum, opening in June. Billed as the largest
collection of spy paraphernalia ever put on public display. 800 F St. NW,
Washington, D.C.; (202) EYESPYU (393-7798), www.spymuseum.org. Open daily
10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission ranges from free to $10.</TE>
<TE>   Museum of Glass: International Center for Contemporary Art, opening
July 6: The Tacoma, Wash., center features a stainless-steel cone wrapped
in stairs to a rooftop plaza; a walkway by art-glass master Dale Chihuly;
13,000 square feet of gallery space and a hot glass studio. 1801 Dock
St., Tacoma, Wash.; (253) 396-1768, www.museumofglass.org. Open Tuesdays
through Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m, Thursdays to 9 p.m., Sundays noon to
5 p.m. Closed Mondays. Admission, free to $8.</TE>
<TE>   SPAM Museum, grand opening June 15-16. Hormel Foods' shrine to its
storied luncheon meat opened in Austin, Minn., last fall, but festivities
were postponed after Sept. 11. Highlights include a wall of 3,390 SPAM
cans and a 5-foot SPAMburger. 1101 N. Main St., Austin, Minn.; (507)
437-5100, www.SPAM.com. Open Mondays through Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sundays noon to 4 p.m. Free.</TE>

<LD>National Geographic's new Directions series makes quirky inroads in
the well-trod terrain of travel memoirs. The books are written by
distinguished literary lights recalling places that inspire them, with
debut offerings that augur richly idiosyncratic rewards.</LD>
<LD>   The first volume, travel author Jan Morris' "A Writer's House in
Wales" ($20), appeared in January. This whimsical essay addresses local
history and legend, Morris' writer's sanctuary in an 18th century stable
overlooking Cardigan Bay, and the staunch Welsh character of her friends
and neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Oliver Sacks wrote "Oaxaca Journal" ($20), due this month. As it
happens, the neurologist author of "Awakenings" and the recent memoir
"Uncle Tungsten" is a card-carrying member of the American Fern Society.
"Journal" recounts a weeklong foray into southern Mexico with an oddball
group of fellow enthusiasts, with insights into the people, history and
chocolate of the region.</LD>
<TE>   Six to 10 titles are planned per year, by candidates such as Joyce
Carol Oates, Jamaica Kincaid, W.S. Merwin, David Mamet and Robert Hughes.
Judging from the initial installments, the series promises a window on
the nature of writerly eccentricity as well as the nature of place.</TE>

<LD>My boyfriend took me to Kauai over New Year's. We stayed on the
south shore, in Poipu, in some condos. It was so nice not to have a plan.
Kauai is incredible. There are these great mountains. We'd drive to one
end of the island and hang out there. The next day we'd drive to the
other end of the island. The north shore is really tropical, with tons of
plants, really green. The west shore is all dunes, really dry. We had
only one rule: We had to get in the ocean every day. Even the day we
left, we woke up really early and threw ourselves in the ocean before we
got on the plane.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: The radio in Kauai is great. It's totally local, like
really old-style DJs. We heard a fantastic country and western show
that's on the first Sunday of every month at 1 p.m.</LD>

<LD>Every year, more than 200,000 American families gather for
reunions, from small nuclear-family affairs to huge roundups of distant
relatives. Designated planners should know there is help out there, even
if they're not getting it from their relatives. Below, a list of
resources to help ensure that the gang's all there.</LD>
<LD>   Cast a Wide Net: Family-Reunion.com (www.family-reunion.com), billed
as "the Web's most popular family reunion planning site," offers articles
on each phase of planning, if you don't mind taking advice from someone
named Mr. Spiffy. The site posts reunion announcements and provides an
archive of reunion locations and a free newsletter. It also has planning
software, priced at $29.95.</LD>
<LD>   For tracking down relatives or researching your ancestry, Cindi's List
of Genealogy Sites (www.Cyndi'sList.com) cross-references more than
115,000 links. Genealogy.com (www.genealogy.com) allows users to create a
family  tree, search for missing branches of the family and share
information with  other relatives. Some resources are subscription-based.
MyFamily.com (www.myfamily.com) enables reunion coordinators to create a
private family  site where the clan can access reunion information. Some
resources are  subscription-based.</LD>
<TE>   Read the Fine Print: Reunions Magazine is a quarterly publication
devoted to helping people organize all types of get-togethers (family,
class and military). The magazine's Web site, www.reunionsmag.com, also
offers advice and information. Subscriptions are $22 per year. Reunions
Magazine, P.O. Box 11727, Milwaukee, Wis. 53211-0727; (800) 373-7933 or
fax (414) 263-6331.</TE>
<TE>   Reunions Magazine editor Edith Wagner has compiled "The Family Reunion
Sourcebook" (Lowell House, $16.95), offering planning advice for
everything from small family gatherings to major events.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ninkovich, a self-described "reunion anthropologist," interviewed
3,000 reunion planners for "The Family Reunion Handbook: A Complete Guide
for Reunion Planners" (Reunion Research, $14.95). The first three
chapters are available free on www.reuniontips.com, which also features
tips and links.</TE>
<TE>   A Family Favorite: Can't decide on your location? You might consider
one of America's most popular reunion destinations: the YMCA of the
Rockies in Colorado. Reunions are such a big part of its business that it
provides planning workbooks for coordinators. It hosts about 800 family
gatherings a year at two facilities--the 5,100-acre Snow Mountain Ranch
and the 860-acre Estes Park Center. Accommodations include campsites,
cabins with kitchen facilities or hotel-style rooms in the main lodges.
The centers are open year-round with such diversions as arts and crafts,
rock climbing, fishing, river rafting, horseback riding, line dancing,
even special ice-breaking activities to get things off on the right foot.</TE>

<LD>The City Council in L.A. is a full-time job. Other than holidays we
get one break, the last two weeks in August. I decided to go to St.
George in southwestern Utah to do the outdoors thing, get some rest and
clear the head a bit. If I wasn't going on a hike, I was rock climbing. I
would spend the balance of the day relaxing. It was absolutely beautiful.
One hike was 6.5 miles, from the low desert to the high desert. In the
highest elevation, there were pines and aspens. One thing that caught me
by surprise was I forgot Utah has different rules when it comes to
alcohol. I remember my first night looking forward to a nice glass of
wine and being quickly educated.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: The Coyote Inn is somewhat minimalist but comfortable. I
wasn't looking for high-speed Internet connection in the room.</LD>

<LD>Never mind the diamonds. A little gold ring is a girl's best
friend, particularly if it looks enough like  a wedding band to
discourage those pesky Lotharios who can make single women travelers feel
as if they're running  the gantlet at a Tailhook convention. Ergo, the
Faux Wedding Band, a new offering in the catalog of Santa  Barbara travel
outfitter Magellan's. "Men around the world know a ring means you're
married. The faux band  stops them from being so enthusiastic," says
Gloria McManus, who co-founded Magellan's with her husband,  John, 12
years ago. She leaves the wedding ring he gave her at home and wears a
fake band when traveling in  places where petty crime is common. Faux
Wedding Band, $9.85. from Magellan's, (800) 962-4943, fax  (800)
962-4940, www.magellans.com.</LD>

<LD>Cuba is so close to us, yet not [overrun] by Americanism and
American commerce. Actually, legally, we're not allowed to travel there.
I flew through Mexico. I went with my sister. She came from New York and
flew through Jamaica. We stayed in Havana. We spent our days walking the
streets, checking out galleries. There's some great art there. I'm
particularly interested in anything to do with paper, so I went to a few
etching presses and letterpress studios. People there have so much spirit
and vivaciousness, despite the fact that wages are very low and living
conditions aren't tremendous. The government doesn't welcome Americans,
but the people do.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: There's a business going on where people's homes are made
available to tourists. It's not state legalized. But a lot of it goes on.</LD>

<HD>The Best Beach in the World?</HD>
<DH>She Says It's a Seashore Found in This Indian Ocean Archipelago</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Directions to the best beach in the world:</LD>
<LD>   Fly from Paris or London or Frankfurt to Seychelles' Mahe Island.</LD>
<LD>   Change planes for Praslin Island.</LD>
<TE>   Catch the ferry there to La Passe village on La Digue Island.</TE>
<TE>   Rent a bike and ride south two miles.</TE>
<TE>   Keep going past Big Rock. You'll know the beach when you see it.</TE>
<TE>   How could you not? Anse Source d'Argent (French for "silver spring
cove") is a miraculous meeting of sea and land, with all the necessary
ingredients in perfect measure and arrangement. Huge pink granite
boulders, smooth enough to climb barefoot and sunbathe on, separate the
beach into a string of secret scalloped coves. Forty-foot palms defy
gravity, arching over water so transparent you don't need a snorkel mask
to see the fish and coral, and the sand is as fine as flour. Across the
channel, Praslin looks as though it could have been created by Disney.
Once you get here, you will also know why you came halfway around the
world when there are so many other inviting beaches closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   The Seychelles is a milky way of an archipelago made up of 115 islands
in the Indian Ocean about 1,000 miles east of Kenya. Mountainous Mahe,
home of the international airport, diminutive Praslin and minuscule La
Digue are the main islands. Others are coral flyspecks populated only by
giant tortoises and sooty terns. The sounds and smells are Caribbean, all
exotic bird song and tropical spices.</TE>
<TE>   Colonized first by the English and then the French, this country of
80,000 has become a copacetic puree of Indians, Africans, Chinese and
Europeans who do not identify one another by race or skin color. The
language is Creole, but children learn English and French in school to
prepare for jobs in the tourism industry, which annually yields a quarter
of the country's gross national product.</TE>
<TE>   French, German, English and Italian vacationers fleeing the crowded,
increasingly middle-class Mediterranean set the tone. But only 150,000
visitors are admitted each year, part of a less-is-more approach to an
industry that seeks to attract only the most affluent visitors. This
country, where few buildings are taller than two stories, feels more like
a village. The treasury of flora and fauna has room to perpetuate itself;
42% of the islands' land mass is given over to ecological preserves--and
a deserted beach almost as idyllic as Anse Source d'Argent is never far
away.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest islands in the chain, such as Mahe, are granite, thought
by some to be the remains of the lost "super continent" of Gondwanaland,
submerged beneath the Indian Ocean millions of years ago when the African
and Indian tectonic plates separated. Granite mountains, cliffs and
boulders give the Seychelles a sense of substance and visual singularity.
In some ways, they are more reminiscent of islands in the Gulf of Maine
than volcanic sputterings such as Maui or Bora-Bora.</TE>
<TE>   But comparisons soon fall apart, because the lost, lovely Seychelles
are too off-the-charts to be like anyplace else. If Noah's ark had landed
on an islet in the Indian Ocean instead of on Mt. Ararat, it would have
come to rest in these islands. With flawless weather, jungles and seas
full of strange animals and plants, an educated, thriving populace and no
neighbors to bring strife, the Seychelles seems like a place where a
world washed clean could get a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   The virtually pristine natural environment of the Seychelles and its
opportunities for fantasy vacations on nearly deserted tropical islets
have long been fodder for glossy American travel magazines. Presumably,
visitors want and can afford the luxury castaway experience, a sort of
"Gilligan's Island" with haute cuisine and hot running water. The islets
of Silhouette and Frigate have just one lodge, with room rates of $500 to
$1,500 a night. Felicite, a 680-acre private island near La Digue, with
accommodations for 16, a tennis court, swimming pool, yacht and full
staff, rents for $15,000 a night.</TE>
<TE>   By visiting Mahe, Praslin and La Digue, the country's three most
developed islands, staying in relatively modest places and walking or
riding a bike when I could, I saw a different Seychelles, and, I think, a
more real one.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't plan the trip myself or travel independently, as I prefer.
The Seychelles is not that kind of place. Two or three Seychelles tourist
agencies apparently have a lock on visitor business; their vans are the
most common vehicles on the roads. A small American tour company,
Florida-based New Adventures, which works with one of these, booked my
air, sea and transportation, transfers and accommodations for two nights
on each of the large islands. When I arrived at the airport on Mahe, I
found myself in the capable hands of Travel Services Seychelles, whose
agents suggested organized tour options and ushered me around as if I
were a VIP.</TE>
<TE>   I flew last spring from Paris to Mahe, leaving Charles de Gaulle
Airport at night, arriving as the sun burnished the granite cliffs above
the town of Victoria the next morning. In the arrivals area of the
airport, where an old woman was industriously sweeping the floor with a
palm frond, I heard the patter of Creole.</TE>
<TE>   Most visitors to Mahe stay at Beau Vallon beach, with its long strand
and small, sleepy resorts, on the northwest coast, across the mountainous
interior from the airport. But I had reservations at Valmer Resort, in
the hinterlands near the island's rugged southern tip. A Travel Services
Seychelles van took me to the little resort--a contemporary villa with a
breakfast terrace, swimming pool and four comfortable rooms--close to
stunning horseshoe-shaped Lazare Bay but little else.</TE>
<TE>   Mahe has 90 miles of surfaced roads (unlike other islands in the
chain, some of which have none at all), and my hotel was isolated from
the sights I wanted to see, such as Victoria town, the mountains and Beau
Vallon beach. So I had rented a jeep, which was waiting for me at the
resort. It rode like a cement mixer, had a sticky clutch and turned my
travels on Mahe's treacherously cracked and winding one-lane roads into
wild, wonderful adventures.</TE>
<TE>   After a time, I didn't mind the isolation. Artists' studios, sleepy
villages and smashing beaches were hidden like scavenger-hunt prizes all
along the island's precipitous southwest coast. I favored those that are
hardest to get to, like Anse Intendance (anse is French for "cove"),
about five miles south of my hotel, reached by the kind of road that
persistently makes you think you should turn back.</TE>
<TE>   Anse Intendance is a deceptive beauty: deserted, quiet, pristine. But
watch the waves. They'll seduce you into the surf, then smash you up and
leave you like flotsam on the beach. I pulled a hamstring muscle
bodysurfing there, which made driving all the more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   I toured the island the next day, driving up the west coast as far as
Ternay Bay, where the narrow road clings to the cliffs and the driver of
a van I met head-on waved me past, saying, "You've earned your pilot's
license."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the road is a dilapidated military youth camp, a remnant
of the country's experiment with socialism from 1977 to 1991, before
pressure from the international community and the Catholic church made
President France Albert Rene introduce a limited form of democratic
pluralism.</TE>
<TE>   From there, I crossed the island's mountainous spine, stopping to
taste the brews at the Tea Tavern and tour the plantation and factory,
where the fermenting and sifting machines look like something out of
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." Farther up the road, the ruins of a
19th century Anglican mission school for freed African slave children
reminded me that slavery was abolished here more than 25 years before it
was outlawed in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was on to Victoria, a rollicking town, part Victorian tea
cozy, part exotic melting pot. It has a Hindu temple, London's Big Ben
clock tower in miniature, an old British colonial statehouse and busy
market. I went to the Beau Vallon tourist area, mostly to see the
Northolme Hotel, an old Noel Coward haunt on a  pretty sliver of beach. I
could picture Coward there, though the Northolme is somewhat seedy now.</TE>
<TE>   Chez Plume in Anse Boileau  was on the way back, so I had dinner:
divine eggplant fritters, grilled shrimp and a South African white wine,
followed by a steaming pot of lemon tea from Charlie's chocolate factory.</TE>
<TE>   praslin is about 65 miles northeast of Mahe and about one-fourth the
size, with surfaced roads around the south part of the island and across
its hilly center. A few settlements are almost big enough to be called
villages, including Grand Anse near the airport and St. Anne Bay, the
port for the ferry to La Digue. Cars are not as rare as they once were,
though tourist vans, public buses with uncertain schedules and the
occasional taxi still seem to have the run of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Without a rental car now, I cast my fate to the wind whenever I went
sightseeing or beach-hopping. If I got stuck, I knew I could always call
a cab.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed in a roomy, pleasantly decorated condo that is part of Les
Villas D'Or, a discreet new development on Anse Volbert, where most--that
 is, perhaps a dozen--of the island's hotels are.</TE>
<TE>   It looks east to Curieuse island and is narrow but a full two miles
long, fringing a shallow bay with gentle waves and a cushiony sand bottom
that's perfect  for swimming.</TE>
<TE>   I was on the deck of the condo when my neighbors, Patrizia and Marzio
Barutti from Modena, Italy, stopped by. Later they found me again in the
Laurier restaurant in Anse Volbert, where I had come for the Creole
buffet. When the place filled up and the maitre d' tried to move me to a
table full of strangers to free my spot for other diners, the Baruttis
picked up their plates and joined me.</TE>
<TE>   Marzio, who grows wine grapes, had come to the Seychelles to scuba
dive and had seen all sorts of sea creatures, including barracudas.
Patrizia, meanwhile, had sat in the boat reading. They spoke no English,
and I don't know Italian. So we conversed in a kind of French that would
have made a Parisian livid but suited us fine. After dinner we walked a
half-mile along the beach to Les Villas D'Or under a star-studded navy
blue sky.</TE>
<TE>   I spent the next day touring Praslin by foot, cab, public bus and
tourist van, stopping first at Vallee de Mai National Park in the uplands
to walk through an enchanted coco de mer forest. These exotic palms,
found nowhere else in the world except on a few of the Seychelles
islands, reach 100 feet and have prized coconuts that look like a woman's
behind. The nuts must be registered before they can be sold, going for as
much as $2,000 each. Initials were carved into the stout trunks and were
done in such a way that their scribes  must have been children,
suggesting that kids are the same everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Later I trudged two miles up a hill outside the village of St. Anne
Bay, while a tour guide in a passing van pointed and laughed at my sweaty
travail. My reward was a salad Nioise at Chateau de Feuilles, a Relais et
Chateaux inn perched on a cliff above Praslin's south coast, where the
manager let me use the swimming pool when I finished lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, I caught a cab to Anse Lazio, a beach on the north coast
considered the island's best. It was a little like Anse Source d'Argent,
but more crowded, and my sunbathing was marred because I was concerned
about how I would get back to Les Villas D'Or.</TE>
<TE>   The sun started to sink and the tourists were packing up when I
noticed the guide who had made fun of me on the way to Chateau de
Feuilles, leaning nonchalantly by his van while his tour clients got in.
He smiled when he recognized me and offered me a lift.</TE>
<TE>   If I'd seen only Mahe and Praslin --beautiful though they are--I would
have left the Seychelles doubtful that they supersede some of the other
islands I love, like St. Bart's in the Caribbean and Huahine in French
Polynesia. But then I visited La Digue, an utterly beguiling miniature
golf course of an island a few miles southeast of Praslin. It is about
six square miles and has a population of 3,000 and about 10 miles of
paved road.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after it was discovered in 1744, French colonists arrived to
start coconut, vanilla and spice plantations. President Rene has a
classic old thatched and verandaed planter's house on a beachfront tract
with a colonial cemetery known as L'Union Estate. Guests there have
included British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the  cast and crew of
"Goodbye, Emmanuelle," a 1977 art porn film shot in Rene's house.</TE>
<TE>   The ferry from Praslin, a frisky yacht called the Silhouette, lands in
La Passe, La Digue's only village. It's on the west coast and is marked
by an outcropping of bizarre granite boulders that don't look quite real.
When I reached it--with a load of passengers that included a woman in a
sari, a young nun in a white habit and a French girl with a
painful-looking sunburn--I was disappointed to be met by a van from La
Digue Island Lodge instead of the traditional oxcart. The driver told me
there are about 50 cars on the island, though you still see the
occasional wooden wagon drawn by a team of lumbering oxen, taking
tourists from place to place. Most people walk or ride bikes, no small
part of La Digue's slow-lane charm. La Digue Island Lodge, where I stayed
for two nights, is on the beach about a mile south of La Passe. It has 60
rooms, a pool, two restaurants and a dive shop. The manager sat me down
in the airy lobby when I arrived, gave me a juice drink with a paper
umbrella, signed me up for a free half-day snorkeling trip on my last
morning, told me where to rent a bike and showed me to my room in an
A-frame on the lawn nearby. With a king bed and two lofts, it could have
slept a family. Red hibiscus blossoms had been scattered on the bedspread
and furniture like tropical snow.</TE>
<TE>   I went straight to the cafe by the pool, where a yellow-beaked Indian
myna pecked at my rolls while I ate a fresh, crunchy heart of palm salad
in coconut milk. I took a dip among people wearing skimpy bathing suits
and speaking only French. Soon it started to rain, lightly at first, then
in torrents that made the palm trees writhe, so I retreated to my room
and went to sleep, awakening to clear skies just in time for cocktail
hour.</TE>
<TE>   In the lobby bar, I ordered a planter's punch and met with a
representative of Travel Services Seychelles. She was a young German
woman named Simone who had come to the islands on vacation, married a
Seychellois and stayed. I liked her immediately, chiefly because she
treated me as tenderly as would a nanny, helping me plan a bike tour of
La Digue for the next day. Then it was time for dinner in the
sand-floored restaurant, where I could see the lights of Praslin
twinkling across the channel. I ordered a seafood crepe, chicken soup,
pan-fried white fish and creme caramel, all of which was good, if not
exactly distinguished.</TE>
<TE>   I had only a day to explore La Digue, beginning the next morning with
a walk through La Veuve Reserve, around the corner from the hotel. There,
a naturalist pointed out a rare female paradise flycatcher sitting on a
nest in a giant badamier tree. Biking south from the reserve, I passed
the island's yellow Catholic church and a gallery called Green Gecko Art
before entering L' Union Estate. There I saw lackadaisical displays on
copra and spice production, the president's plantation house and a stone
pen containing about 20 giant tortoises, brought to La Digue for the
tourists. These stinky, soulful-eyed behemoths were killed off by
Europeans for their meat and today crawl free only in the isolated
Aldabra Atoll, a far-flung part of the Seychelles.  Finding the way on
dirt roads from the tortoises to Anse Source d'Argent is a challenge.
Nothing about the rutted path, lined by jungle and vegetable patches,
prefigures what is to come. Then you round a boulder and see the first
cove with its rocky arms embracing a baby finger of the Indian Ocean. You
think about spreading out your mat, but go on, finding another, even
prettier, cove, followed by another and another. On the rocks above, kids
played in a scene right out of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure
Island."</TE>
<TE>   I saw La Digue's other beauty spots: Belle Vue and La Citadelle, the
two peaks that crown the island; wild, choppy Grand Anse, Petit Anse and
Anse Coco on the east coast and the pretty countryside north of La Passe.
And I took the snorkeling trip to tiny Cocos Island, a green hat of land
with a fringe of white boulders 30 minutes north of La Passe harbor.
There I learned that tomato groupers, clown triggerfish and Meyer's
butterfly fish grow big in the Seychelles. Passing snorkelers can't evade
the stare of their bulging eyes.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing eclipsed my ultimate destination, Anse Source d'Argent.
Lying on a big saucer-shaped rock there, surrounded by water, gazing up
at a cloudless blue sky, I knew why I had come so far to get here. Some
beach-lovers are compelled to look for the Mt. Everest of beaches. We
know it when we find it, even if it's half a world away.</TE>
<TE>GUIDEBOOK: The Beach-Lovers' Seychelles</TE>
<TE>   Telephone numbers and prices: The country code for the Seychelles is
248, followed by the local number. All prices are approximate and
computed at a rate of 5.5 rupees to one U.S. dollar. Room rates are for a
double for one night, unless otherwise noted. Meal prices are for one,
food only, unless otherwise noted.</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: There are myriad ways to get to the Seychelles, many of
them involving numerous changes of plane. From Los Angeles International
Airport, the easiest route is British Airways nonstop to London,
connecting to the Seychelles. Other carriers--including American, United,
British Airways, Virgin and Air New Zealand--fly nonstop to London from
LAX and land at Heathrow, requiring a change of airports to connect with
Air Seychelles out of Gatwick. Air France flies nonstop to Paris from LAX
and connects with Air Seychelles. Another option is Lufthansa to
Frankfurt, connecting with Condor airlines to the Seychelles. Not all
airlines fly these routes daily.</TE>
<TE>   There's ferry service between Mahe, Praslin and La Digue. Cars can be
rented only on Mahe and Praslin.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: La Digue Island Lodge, Anse Reunion, La Digue, 234-232,
fax 234-100, www.ladigue.sc, has 60 rooms. Rates: $265 to $380, with
breakfast and dinner. On La Digue, I also liked Patatran Village,
234-333, fax 234-344, www.the-seychelles.com/patratan/index.html. Rates:
$160 to $190, includes breakfast and dinner. H0tel l'Ocean, 234-180, fax
234-308. Rate: $200, with breakfast and dinner. Both are on Anse Patate,
a small but pretty beach on the north side of the island.</TE>
<TE>   Les Villas D'Or, Cote D'Or, Praslin, 232-777, fax 232-505,
www.seychelles.net/villador, has 10 units. Rate: $205 for studio doubles.
Another Praslin choice: Le Colibri, Relais des Iles, St. Anne Bay,
telephone and fax 232-302, www.chez.com/jmc/seychelles, tucked into a
mountainside north of the jetty, with magnificent views and 13 rooms.
Rates: $120 to $154, includes breakfast and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Valmer Resort, P.O. Box 72, Victoria, Mahe, 361-313, fax 361-159, has
14 units. Rates: $95 to $245 for one-bedroom apartments. Near Valmer,  I
also liked Lazare Picault Hotel,  P.O. Box 135, Victoria, Mahe, 361-111,
fax 361-177. Eleven rooms, overlooking beautiful Lazare Bay. Rates: $101
to $216.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: La Digue Island Lodge (see above) has the nicest
restaurant on the island. Lunches about $15, dinners about $45, with an
excellent Creole  barbecue on Saturday nights. Loutier Coco on Grande
Anse is good for a snack or drink.</TE>
<TE>   On Praslin, Chateau de Feuilles, 233-316, is a lovely place to dine; a
salad, drink and coffee at lunch cost about $25. Dinner runs about $50.
Laurier, 232-241, and La Goulue, 232-223, in Anse Volbert village are
more casual and less expensive. I loved the fresh seafood at Chez Plume,
355-050, on Mahe's Anse Boileau; dinner, with wine and dessert, about
$45.</TE>

<HD>Disappearing Into Todos Santos</HD>
<DH>They May Seem Invisible at First, but This Artsy Town at the Bottom
of Baja Is Where Some Expats Are Living the Good Life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE CUMMINGS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I first heard about Todos Santos more than a decade ago from my
friend Rebecca. She had a gypsy soul and made her living peddling words
to glossy travel magazines, a perfect mating of vocation and avocation.
She once spent nine months driving the coastlines of Mexico in a beat-up
Toyota Celica, a trip that yielded hundreds of pages of inspired writing
about the "hidden" places she discovered. Rebecca mentioned Todos Santos
to me only in passing as a place she might flee to when she was ready to
write her novel. Her affection for Mexico, especially Baja, was obvious,
but I wasn't immediately tempted to copy her dash across the border.</LD>
<LD>   Instead I remained enthralled with my first love, Southeast Asia, and
my part-time home in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Hence, when a California
publisher called in 1991 to ask whether I'd be interested in writing a
Baja guidebook, I demurred. I suggested Rebecca, of course, but as it
turned out, she was too busy. This time around, though, she made sure I
got her message, bombarding my wine-addled brain one evening with glowing
tales of deserted moonlighted beaches, halibut tacos and burro trips to
prehistoric painted caves. I took the job, and not long after I found
myself hurtling down the 1,000-mile-long peninsula south of San Diego for
the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Tijuana and Ensenada alternately depressed and disappointed me. The
Pacific coast below these towns showed promise, but I knew I wasn't in
the "real Baja" until I took on the no-nonsense middle reaches of Mexico
1, the famous Carretera Transpeninsular (Transpeninsular Highway). Once
past the hilly fishing-and-farming town of El Rosario, the classic Baja
scenery kicked in, splashing a montage of cactus greens, arroyo reds and
rocky grays across the windshield. I passed relatively few cars and saw
almost no signs of animate life along the highway, a state of affairs
that began to produce an eerie mental solitude. The sensation bordered on
a fear of the unknown I know many Americans instinctively feel the first
time they drive in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 miles from the U.S. border, something changed. It sounds
like a travel cliche, but by the time the last rays of sunlight flickered
over the tops of the Sierra de la Giganta near Loreto, my unease had
faded, and I knew I'd entered a special space. Noting each loncher'a
(Mexican diner), Pemex gas station and Spanish mission ruins along the
way, I fell into a soft rhythm bordering on meditation.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I'd crossed the Tropic of Cancer and come face to face
with the wood-shuttered, pastel-colored houses ringing the quiet Bay of
La Paz, I began to understand the attachment, if not the fanaticism, many
Californians have for Baja. I felt peacefully far from the United States
yet similarly distant from Mexico, as if I'd discovered a parallel
universe that was neither one nor the other. People spoke Spanish but
often knew English, and swirled the two languages together to produce
words like yonque, for "junk."</TE>
<TE>   Near La Paz I made an excursion to Puerto Balandra, a large, clean,
shallow bay hemmed in on three sides by steep desert cliffs, where I
encountered a Mexican family of five and an American. When one lone
countryman encounters another on a near-deserted beach in Mexico, a
conversation is almost unavoidable. I don't remember who spoke first, but
I passed a pleasant half-hour taking in the warmth and experience of a
man named John O'Neil, an artist who had spent the better part of two
decades living in La Paz. He knew the best, and cheapest, places to eat
and stay in Baja California Sur's state capital, often cited as the most
Mexican city in Baja because of its tighter cultural connection with the
Mexican mainland (in part because ferries transport people back and forth
across the Gulf of California daily).</TE>
<TE>   When I told O'Neil my next stop was Todos Santos, his face lit up. It
was a look I'd seen on Rebecca's face when she'd talked of the town.
O'Neil said it was one of his favorite places to paint, that the
light--the angle or the quality? I can't remember now--made him see in a
different way. One or two expatriate artists lived in Todos Santos full
time, he said, having bought historic buildings for a pittance. Then he
said something I've since repeated to others who have asked about Todos
Santos: It's a world of the invisible, a place some people disappear to
yet others don't see. That two-lane highway takes visitors in at one end
of town and spits them out at the other without revealing too much.</TE>
<TE>   The flat, barren plains of la paz along the first third of the
one-hour drive on Mexico 1 between La Paz and Todos Santos suggested a
monotony that I decided might easily be mistaken for invisibility. After
I made the turnoff onto Mexico 19, traffic thinned to a trickle, and the
flats gave way to rolling hills and deep vados, or stream beds, that are
dry most of the year. In the distance to my left, I could make out the
dark, undulating outline of the Sierra de la Laguna, Baja's most solitary
mountain range. As Mexico 19 swooped southwest, the highway came closer
to the sierra, and the desert along the highway erupted into a thick
green curtain of mesquite, paloverde and tall columns of cardon and
pitahaya cactus. This heavy foliage--technically not desert but rather
"thorn forest," as I later found out--flourishes on the abundant runoff
from the mountains. Incongruous-looking ball moss, nourished by moist
Pacific trade winds buffeting the Baja peninsula's narrowest section,
hangs from tall cacti here.</TE>
<TE>   The curves in the road intensified as I approached Todos Santos. Off
to my right I caught a glimpse of a roofless adobe ranch house and
adjacent windmill, a landmark that has since become my favorite "welcome
home" signal.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward my rental car descended a final hill, and I caught a
first glance of thousands of fan palms filling a mile-wide arroyo to one
side of the highway, cliffs and hills on the other. And in the distance,
behind this desert oasis, an iridescent Pacific. O'Neil was right. No
sooner had I entered the town than it seemed to fade away through my rear
windshield, like a mirage. Was that really Todos Santos? My instant
recall played back only dust and faded storefronts.</TE>
<TE>   If I hadn't had a writing assignment, I would have kept on driving,
straight south to finisterra, "land's end," the much-photographed spot
where the Sierra de la Laguna tumbles into the sea and Cabo San Lucas
serves up coastal Mexico on a platter to planeloads of pasty-faced
tourists. I knew how to deal with "gringolandia," as expatriate North
Americans like to call tourist resorts in Mexico. A ghost town was
another matter. Once I'd parked the car and began moving around the tiny
town on foot, however, I quickly found another Todos Santos.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings along Avenida Juarez and Avenida Colegio Militar, the
two parallel asphalt thoroughfares in town, had been plain boxes of
modern cinder-block construction. Yet one block off Juarez, along cobbled
streets near the simple town plaza, I came upon an Andalusian-inspired
neighborhood of brick and adobe. One- and two-story affairs, they were
built of hand-made Mexican brick laid in double or sometimes triple
courses, or layers, and topped by flat parapet roofs, surrounding hidden
courtyards. Tall windows and doors bounded by pilasters and molded
lintels evoked the classic provincial Spanish style, reminding me of
colonial neighborhoods I'd seen in Sonora or Sinaloa on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's National Institute of History and Anthropology recently
declared this area of Todos Santos a national monument, enforcing
restoration guidelines to preserve the lingering air of antiquity. But
when I first arrived in 1991 the only inhabitants who seemed interested
in the stately buildings were relatively new arrivals such as Ezio and
Paula Colombo. Ezio, a burly, mustachioed Italian artist, and Paula, a
lithe ex-New York model, had bought a cavernous 150-year-old adobe casona
(mansion) just off the plaza and turned it into a restaurant. His flair
for matching Mediterranean cooking with fresh seafood, locally grown
produce and herbs from their garden, along with Paula's tasteful interior
design, gradually drew the attention of discerning palates in the
surrounding cape region, from La Paz to Cabo San Lucas. Word spread
internationally, and by the mid-1990s their Cafe Santa Fe had become a
social pilgrimage point for anyone touching down in Todos Santos,
particularly among the steadily increasing number of celebrity visitors.</TE>
<TE>   But on my first visit the town was more bleak than chic. In the newer
eastern half of Todos Santos I came upon a more typical architectural
trend: small cottages of adobe brick or mud plastered over woven palo de
arco (trumpetbush), often roofed with palm fronds. The plain cement walls
of newer homes linked the historically grand to the recently humble. A
survey of local market shelves turned up a few wrinkled tomatoes, moldy
stalks of green onion and stale rolls. No wonder the Cafe Santa Fe was so
popular with out-of-town visitors, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   I took a room at the simple, two-story Hotel California on Avenida
Juarez. I'd heard nothing of the legend that said the hotel inspired The
Eagles' 1976 album of the same name, but it wasn't long before another
guest, an American backpacking his way to Guatemala, filled me in. When I
asked the Mexican manager about the story, he solemnly nodded his
corroboration, and I filed the intriguing local myth away for later
examination.</TE>
<TE>   Todos Santos (not to be confused with the surfers' island off the
coast of Ensenada) scribbled itself onto several pages in my notebook as
I explored more of the area than necessary for my Baja assignment. The
history fascinated me. Attracted by the two substantial pozas (natural
springs) fed by underground rivers that originated in the Sierra de la
Laguna, Jesuit padres had established a farm community and chapel called
Todos Santos ("All Saints") here in 1724 to supply the mission community
at La Paz with fruits, vegetables, wine and sugar cane. By 1731, Todos
Santos was producing 200 burro-loads of panocha--raw brown
sugar--annually, along with figs, pomegranates, citrus and grapes.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Father Sigismundo Taraval founded Misi-n Santa Rosa
de las Palmas at the upper end of the arroyo a bit more than a mile
inland from the Pacific. By the mid-1700s, Todos Santos had outgrown La
Paz. The town, renamed Nuestra Se-ora del Pilar de Todos Santos in 1749,
remained an important mission settlement until secularization in 1840.
Anglo whalers visiting Todos Santos in 1849 praised the town as "an
oasis" with "friendly and intelligent people." In the post-mission era,
Todos Santos thrived as Baja's sugar cane capital, supporting eight sugar
mills by the late 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar prices dropped precipitously after World War II, and all but one
mill closed when the most abundant freshwater spring dried up in 1950.
The remaining mill closed in 1965, though smaller household operations
continued into the early 1970s. The town faded into near obscurity.
Around 1981 the spring mysteriously came back to life, and the arroyo
once again began producing a large variety and quantity of fruits and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists began arriving when the road between San Pedro and Cabo San
Lucas was paved in the mid-1980s. The road also brought an influx of
artists, starting with Charles Stewart. Stewart had run his own gallery
in Taos, N.M., since 1949, but as the city became too "boutique-ized" for
him and his wife, Mary Lou, they sought a new place to live and paint.
They moved into an old French-built terrace home in the middle of Todos
Santos in 1986, and for several years Charles was the only resident
artist in town.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I arrived in Todos Santos, Stewart's abandonment of Taos
had begun attracting the notice of various other artists. A sufficient
quantity of them now work here either full or part time. I last counted a
half-dozen art galleries in town, most of them showcasing the work of the
owner and no one else.</TE>
<TE>   But the most successful art house, the Galer'a de Todos Santos,
specializes in the work of several Baja-resident artists, along with
world-class works by artists hailing from New York and Mexico City.
Operated by Michael and Pat Cope, refugees of Los Angeles' speedy
art-and-fashion scene, the gallery occupies a corner of the historic
Todos Santos Inn. Michael's own brightly painted oils of local
todosante-os are heavily favored by monied collectors in nearby Cabo San
Lucas, where art as decor is much in demand.</TE>
<TE>   Not content with maintaining the most winning art stewardship in town,
the Copes frequently host large, self-catered dinner parties for the
socially mobile. To receive an invitation to the Cope house, a simple
palm-frond-roofed adobe perched atop a desert ridge undistinguished save
for a sweeping ocean view, is to earn a chair at Todos Santos' unmovable
feast.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the creators and purveyors of the more traditional fine
arts came representatives of what is America's most globally favored
modern art: the movies. Film editor Eva Gardos, whose "An American
Rhapsody" marked her directorial debut in 2001, chipped in with a few
screenwriter friends to purchase one of the old sugar-mill offices. An
imposing two-story brick edifice displaying rows of Gothic windows, the
oft-shuttered house has been dubbed Casa Dracula by local children who
believe it to be haunted.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing up my book research in Cabo, I explored Todos Santos
more thoroughly. I was smitten by the long beaches nearby, deserted but
for the occasional fisherman castings handlines into the surf. There
wasn't a single oceanfront hotel or condo to be found, an amazing
condition given the town's proximity to two international airports. With
my peripatetic lifestyle, those airports added further enticement to the
fantasy already forming in my head. After long discussions about giving
up California residence, my wife, Lynne, and I decided to sell our Walnut
Creek home and put down roots in Baja.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time we purchased a piece of land located five minutes
by foot from the beach, special-effects makeup artist Pat Gerhardt and
her hairdresser-to-the-stars husband Dennis Glass bought a chunk of
acreage a stone's throw away. At first part-time residents, Pat and
Dennis eventually built a couple of guest cottages in back of their home
and became among the first expatriate residents in Todos Santos to
develop a small vacation rental business. During the past eight years
they've been spending considerably more time in Todos Santos managing Las
Bougainvillas, and less time doing films.</TE>
<TE>   I've noticed a similar pattern among local expats--perhaps 300 of them
living here full or part time--several of whom have made this town of
3,500 an escape hatch from high-stress film and media jobs in the U.S.,
Canada and Europe. Robert Fleming, retired from the San Francisco
Examiner, where he was foreign editor, had originally moved to Mulege, a
town on the Gulf of California. A few years later, he and his wife,
Barbara, found Todos Santos more to their tastes, and they commissioned
an architect-designed house next door to the patch of land that
eventually became my own home.</TE>
<TE>   Todos Santos' artists, writers and Hollywood exiles are quirky and
engaging. Yet I was just as drawn to a cast of other expats in town.
Holding fast among them are a handful of building contractors who have
left behind the permit-and-lawsuit-ridden world of California
construction. Each boasts his own style, his own repertoire of materials
and techniques and his own rapport with local artisans. When Lynne and I
decided to take the plunge and build a house across the arroyo from town,
our first and perhaps most crucial task was choosing a local contractor.</TE>
<TE>   We chose Bruce Kramer, who grew up in San Diego in the beach house of
his father, a city lifeguard and longtime Baja-naut. The envy of all his
friends, Bruce had first crack at the San Diego surf every day of the
year and was an avid surfer by the time he was 15. When he got fed up
working days as a mason and surfing the crowded beaches of San Diego on
weekends, he began packing his board south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   In Todos Santos he found what he'd only dreamed about--surf breaks in
practically every seasonal swell, with plenty of room to carve. He also
found the love of a Mexican woman and, while still in his 20s, became
part of her extended local family. Just as he'd enjoyed the inside surf
track in San Diego as a boy, Kramer got to know the local construction
scene at its most basic level--from the alba-iles, the local skilled
workers. Kramer quickly learned  to speak fluent Spanish--not just the
standard Mexican tongue but the local patois--and formed his own building
company.</TE>
<TE>   I initially contracted Kramer to build a simple two-room cottage
roofed in palm leaves, not wanting to get in too deep until we could see
what he could do. When he finished that project on time and under
budget--a feat we'd never seen in San Francisco--my wife and I invited
him to build a garage, a patio and finally a 2,000-square-foot house of
our own design. The latter came with a three-story whale-watching tower
we penciled into the plan so that in winter we could see the spouting
gray whales over the tall palms between us and the beach.</TE>
<TE>   As with the earlier building projects, he earned our continued
admiration by completing the house on time and under budget. (This isn't
typical. Friends using other contractors around town complain about
extended budgets and schedules, constant worker turnover and the
seemingly endless red tape involved in getting building permits and
hooking up to sewer, water and electricity. Most high-standard
construction projects go for between $50 to $80 per square foot,
depending on complexity.)</TE>
<TE>   While he was building the second house, I was frankly puzzling over
our good fortune. "What's the secret," I asked the 30-something Kramer
one day over a cold Pac'fico, "of getting through the Mexican
bureaucracy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Family," he answered. "My family and the official's family. After
talking familia, we deal with the problem. If you talk only about the
problem, then that's all you have--a problem. You can't force it. You
deal out of humor and respect. If they know you're losing patience,
they'll make you wait longer." He smiled, as if the game pleased him as
much as completing a fine work of masonry.</TE>
<TE>   Take Kramer's story, turn it inside out, and you have Cuco Mayr-n.
Born in La Paz, Mayr-n worked his way north to the United States to
further his studies and earn dollars when he was just out of high school.
There he crashed head-first into the American hippie movement, which
among other things taught him to value the traditional Bajacaliforniano
ways. Mayr-n eventually returned to Baja and began a new life on a
thorn-forested hillside south of Todos Santos, within five minutes' walk
of a long, deserted beach. Turning his back on the North American urban
dream, he set about learning everything he could about the cape region's
little-known interior. At 200-year-old ranchos scattered thinly among the
mountains, he found fifth- and sixth-generation Bajacalifornianos who
grow avocadoes, papayas and mangos using Spanish-built acequias (small
irrigation canals) and who raise cattle and goats to produce cheese and
machaca (shredded dried beef). This ranch culture encompasses an earlier
Spanish lifestyle that has all but disappeared elsewhere in Mexico. From
his fellow mountaineers he learned to make rustic furniture, hand-crafted
sandals and shoes and simple dung-fired ceramics. Today Mayr-n divides
his time between producing ranch crafts for local markets, introducing
visitors to sierra life via mountain tours and hosting local ceramics
workshops.</TE>
<TE>   With its government-protected architecture and its artists, Todos
Santos can easily pass itself off as an extension of the old Baja
California. This is what attracted many of us to what is little more than
a farming and fishing community. The town seems protected from the kind
of mass tourism seen in Cabo San Lucas or Cancn by the fortunate fact
that the nearest beach is two miles away and the surf there is too strong
for swimming most of the year. There are about a dozen places to stay,
but all of them are small (with fewer than 15 rooms). It's the perfect
anti-resort town--so far.</TE>
<TE>   But there is another side to Todos Santos that tugs against our
intended dream state, a huckster quality that persistently markets the
town to real estate developers and tour bus operators. The real estate
agencies--at last count there were at least four operating full
time--make easy targets for such criticism. While  most local real estate
people share a vision of slow growth and cultural preservation, there are
also those who seek   large profits through such practices as building
illegal access roads to the beach. One local developer went so far as to
build a road right through the federally protected dunes to the north of
Todos Santos.</TE>
<TE>   The tour buses from Cabo San Lucas sell another Todos Santos, one
based on its two star attractions: the "artists colony" and the Hotel
California. One wonders how many package tourists leave town disappointed
because they didn't see any artists at work. The artists, for their part,
receive nothing from the bus invasion. Most visitors who have paid $10
for their day tour of Todos Santos have no intention of plunking down
$6,000 for an oil painting by such talents as New York's Derek Buckner.
So they make do with lining up in front of the Hotel California with
their point-and-shoot cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Here, their Mexican tour leaders faithfully intone, the Eagles once
took up residence to write songs for their No. 1 hit album, "Hotel
California." The fact that the hotel has been boarded up for nearly four
years means there's no one inside who can refute the myth. But a myth it
remains, as drummer Don Henley sternly reminded me when I faxed him in
1997. According to Henley, no Eagle has ever visited the Hotel
California.</TE>
<TE>   I'm back with my first love, Southeast Asia, sitting in a hotel room
in smoggy, sweltering Bangkok as I write this. In my mind I imagine
myself standing on the topmost floor of our whale-watching tower in Todos
Santos. A slightly saline Pacific breeze, mango-perfumed by the hundreds
of fruit trees dotting the landscape between our house and the beach,
brushes past me.</TE>
<TE>GUIDEBOOK: Kicking Back in Todos Santos</TE>
<TE>   Telephone numbers and prices: The country code for Mexico is 52. The
area code for Todos Santos is 612. All prices are approximate and
computed at 9.1 pesos to the dollar. Room rates for accommodations in
Todos Santos are usually quoted in dollars. Restaurant menus are priced
in pesos, but dollars are usually accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Getting there:  The most convenient way to get to Todos Santos is to

omommag@aol.</TE>
<TE>   com, rents two semi-luxurious guesthouses with kitchenettes and
private patios inside a large walled compound. One of the cottages
encloses a sleeping loft overlooking a sitting room and kitchenette and
affords a beach view, while the second casita features a round floor plan
with a high roof. Guests have use of a good-size swimming pool and
barbecue grill. Rate: $135.</TE>
<TE>   The new Swiss-owned Posada La Poza, 145-0400, fax 145-0475,
www.lapoza.com, is perched at the edge of a freshwater lagoon near Playa
la Cachora, but only the restaurant and four suites are open; a pool and
three more suites are under construction. Rates: $120 to $440. Las
Casitas, Calle Rangel between Obreg-n and Hidalgo, telephone and fax
145-0255, www.mexonline.com/las casitas.htm, e-mail WendyFaith@pocket

$65. Room rates include a full breakfast for one person or continental
breakfasts for two.  Where to eat: The Cafe Santa Fe, No. 4 on Calle
Centenario off Calle Marquez de Le-n facing the plaza, 145-0340, offers a
mostly Italian menu emphasizing fresh, local ingredients: wood-fired
pizza, lobster ravioli, pasta primavera, seafood, octopus salad; $26,
dinner for two, food only. Open Tuesdays through Sundays noon  to 9 p.m.
The restaurant closes each September and October during the town fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   The Posada La Poza's elegant El Gusto!, 145-0400, specializes in
Mexican and European gourmet cuisine with a Swiss touch, plus vegetarian
dishes. Indoor and outdoor seating, with views of the lagoon and ocean.
The bar terrace and whale-watching deck are good spots for a sunset
cocktail. On Sundays, a large brunch is served; Entrees, $11 to $20.</TE>

Colegio Militar serves inexpensive, delicious Mexican breakfasts and
lunches. Open Mondays through Saturdays 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   What to see: Playa la Cachora is a broad swath of sand backed by
verbena-trimmed dunes, a good spot for strolling and sunset-watching. If
you walk south along Playa la Cachora, you'll come to Las Pocitas, also
known as La Poza de Lobos. Along the back edge of the beach is a
freshwater lagoon, La Poza, and toward the south end a rocky ridge heads
inland. La Cachora and Las Pocitas beaches are often marred by undertow
and heavy shore break, dangerous for swimming, except during the summer,
when there are occasional long periods of relative calm.</TE>
<TE>   When to go : Todos Santos is typically 10 to 20 degrees cooler than
Cabo San Lucas or La Paz in the summer and is warmer in winter, meaning
temperatures are in the 80s during the day and 60s to 70s at night all
year. The rainy season is July through September.</TE>

<LD>Rain finally arrived on our last day on Oregon's Rogue River. Its
telltale sound began to pepper the fly of my tent around dawn, inspiring
me to burrow deeper within my sleeping bag. But when I heard the strains
of a violin, I peeked outside and saw a tarp over the cooking area
suspended by ropes and oars. Grudgingly, I pulled on my rain suit and
ventured out.</LD>
<LD>   I'd never have guessed that a rain-soaked gathering could seem so
sunny. Guides and guests were talking, laughing and drinking coffee as
Shira Kammen, Danny Carnahan and Jim Oakden played Handel's "Water
Music," followed by the Beatles' "Rain." Jimmy Katz, the loquacious
proprietor of James Henry River Journeys, which offers trips for wine and
classical music enthusiasts, regaled the group with stories while he
toasted English muffins on a skillet. Spread on a table under the tarp
were leftovers from the day before: grilled lamb, curried tuna, pasta
salad and tomatoes rinsed in runoff from the tarp. The only things
missing from the previous night's menu were the wines that we had had
with dinner, though coffee did seem more appropriate under the
circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually we packed our gear and shoved off into the river. The gray
light served to compress scenes onshore into miniature tableaux: a
bonsai-style oak on top of a boulder, a Dr. Seuss pine describing a "U"
between its roots and crown. Fed by the rain, one waterfall after another
emerged from the forest, cascading over moss-covered rocks into the deep
green river. A family of brown-headed merganser ducks swam past as
swallows darted above the surface of the water.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we reached the takeout at Foster Bar, we passed the
privately owned Illahe Lodge, in whose dining room the proposal was
drafted for what became the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Shuttle
drivers were waiting to take us back over the mountain to our cars; as
the crew disassembled the rafts, I took a seat in the van by Joel
Peterson, the winemaker at Ravenswood Winery. "Better in rain than
underwater," I offered, referring to an unnerving experience I'd
undergone a couple of days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   I've known Joel since I worked at his Sonoma winery during the 1984
harvest. Back then he labored full time in a hospital laboratory while
making 5,000 cases of wine a year in his spare time. Today he produces
more than 100 times that amount, including one of every six bottles of
Zinfandel sold in the United States. Nevertheless, here he was, floating
the Rogue River during the day and pouring wine in the evening as he has
every summer since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   For me this trip bore the character of a reunion--not only with Joel
but with Jimmy Katz, whom I've known even longer. I met him in 1978, when
we were both publicizing the endangerment of the Tuolumne River by a
proposed dam in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Like the Rogue, the Tuolumne
has since been preserved as a National Wild and Scenic River. It
introduced me to rafting in general and James Henry River Journeys in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   James Henry is among the most eclectic and aesthetic of all the
companies that run rivers in North America. It began operating 30 years
ago, and in today's world of outdoor mega-outfitters it remains a
stubborn one-man enterprise reflecting the idiosyncratic orientations of
its owner. (Katz, now 54, chose to christen it with his middle name
because, "On the river I couldn't offer steamed pastrami and Nova Scotia
lox like all the Katz Delis back in Detroit.") In addition to special
themes such as wine tasting and classical music, most James Henry trips
are accompanied by naturalists who explain the local flora and fauna. And
Katz, who is also a first-rate landscape photographer, is generous with
advice. Over the years, I've enjoyed his company on California's Klamath,
Idaho's Salmon and Alaska's Tatshenshini-Alsek and Noatak rivers. But I'd
never gone on any of Jimmy's wine-tasting trips with Joel.</TE>
<TE>   This one was a five-day, 40-mile jaunt through the fir-covered
wilderness of the Siskiyou Mountains. It began in typical summer weather.
At our meeting place, the Galice Resort west of Grants Pass, the sky was
blue and the temperature in the 90s--common conditions for southwestern
Oregon in June. Our group of 30 boaters (including eight crew members,
three musicians and one winemaker) was composed of people from as far
away as Boston and Texas, wearing T-shirts and baseball caps that
advertised places such as Utah and Alaska and wineries such as Lava Cap,
Frog's Leap and Rex Hill. Our mission required eight rafts, nine plastic
coolers, 10 metal equipment boxes, six inflatable kayaks, six musical
instruments, eight cases of wine and 50 stemmed glasses--not to mention a
tent, a sleeping bag and two rubberized equipment duffels for every
participant.</TE>
<TE>   Under such circumstances, it can be hard to tell the difference
between an epicurean extravaganza and a military maneuver. The sheer
weight of our flotilla was cause for concern, given that the river level
was uncharacteristically low last summer. The Rogue was running at only
1,000 cubic feet per second, compared with normal early-summer runoffs
that were 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 times higher.</TE>
<TE>   As we floated downstream past Grave Creek (named for a pioneer burial
site), we inspected the customary high-water mark in an ancient lava flow
onshore: a horizontal line etched into the rocks four feet above the
current surface of the river. Jimmy called ours the "most intriguing"
level he'd seen in years, serving to expose more rocks and narrow the
channels between them. This would alter the hydraulics of rapids and
allow less clearance for boats, which meant, among other things, that the
guides would have their work cut out for them.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, it hardly registered. As soon as we pushed off
into the current, I remembered why I consider the Rogue the "funnest"
river in the West. Winding through the Cascade, Siskiyou and Coast ranges
to the Pacific Ocean, it's amply blessed by placid stretches that are
hospitable to both basking and bathing, but it's also punctuated by
bracing rapids--certified by its status as a location for the Meryl
Streep movie "The River Wild." Sitting in the bow of the boat, feeling
the wind pick up around me as each rapid approached, watching the stony
bottom race past before the deceptively glassy surface suddenly exploded
in spray, I was exhilarated to reestablish contact with serious white
water.</TE>
<TE>   I was in a paddle boat, which heightened the pleasure. As opposed to
an oar boat, in which you simply sit back while a guide rows you and the
group's gear, a paddle boat transports nothing but people, with each
individual equally responsible for propelling the raft downstream; it is
directed by one bona fide crew member who issues commands. Katz was the
captain in mine, which rendered the experience that much more amusing.
Nobody is more entertaining on a river than Jimmy, a consummate Yiddish
tale spinner who has a harrowing or hilarious anecdote for every inch of
every river. He can even wax rhapsodic on the technical side of
rafting--the sweep strokes, draw strokes and J-strokes with which one
addresses rapids and their components.</TE>
<TE>   "Look for the smooth 'V' at the top of a rapid," Jimmy instructed as
we floated. "That's called the tongue--the sensual invitation to the
rapid below, parting the way between two obstacles, usually boulders.
Pillow rocks can sneak up on you--they lie just below the surface, and
when water pours over a submerged rock and reverses direction, it forms a
hole with a whirlpool effect. You can punch through a small one if you
have enough force, but a big hole can flip your boat--or worse, trap you
in its backspin indefinitely. That's what we call a keeper."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Rogue is a Class III (intermediate) white-water river,
suitable for inexperienced boaters led by professional guides. It
contains one difficult Class IV rapid, Blossom Bar, as well as the "very
difficult to unrunnable" Class V-VI Rainie Falls, where the river is
forced through a narrow chute and over a vertical drop. We weren't
allowed to run Rainie on a commercial outing, but as we neared the spot
Katz recalled a time when he had shot it on a trip with professional
guides.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in a paddle boat," he recalled. "I was in the stern. We were
perfectly aligned going over the top, but when we hit the hole at the
bottom of the falls, the rear of the boat got sucked underwater.
Everybody in front was looking downriver and paddling like mad, so nobody
even knew I was missing. About 50 yards downstream, the rear of the boat
popped back up, bringing me to the surface with my paddle over my head,
like Neptune and his trident. After that I never ran Rainie Falls again."</TE>
<TE>   "What were the conditions like that year?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Young and immortal," Katz said, referring to his own condition. "And
very high water." Since our conditions were the opposite in every way, we
passengers stood on the bank as the crew guided the boats through the
rapid. Most of the river, which didn't look very low to me, was pouring
over a 15-foot drop, creating a caldron of foam at the bottom that
resembled a billion well-shaken bottles of beer. Here and there, salmon
could be seen flinging themselves about in the foam, trying to make their
way upstream.</TE>
<TE>   "What did the salmon say when he ran into a wall?" Peterson asked.</TE>
<TE>   "What, Joel?"</TE>
<TE>   "Dam!"</TE>
<TE>   After that the Rogue calmed down, ushering in a kind of relaxation
obtainable only on a river in summer. The cold water was a perfect
antidote to the sun, so I put down my paddle and dove into the river,
crawling and backstroking my way downstream on pace with the drifting
boats. We passed a great blue heron in the shallows, standing so still
that it looked like a statue. Then an osprey came gliding along, suddenly
soaring to the top of a ridge with a cry. Here and there the Rogue River
backpacking trail appeared along the banks, paralleling the river as it
does for 41 miles between Grave Creek and Illahe. In late afternoon, we
tied up and made camp at Whisky Creek, site of a miner's cabin built in
1880. Although in summer the Bureau of Land Management allows 120 people
(a mix of private and professionally guided groups) to embark on the wild
section of the Rogue every day, they generally strive to stay out of one
another's way. Occasionally we came into contact with other parties on
the river, but we were alone at this campsite, which was complete with an
outhouse and sleeping terraces. From the elevated place where I put my
tent, I had a view of multiple ridgelines receding downstream, back-lit
by the setting sun. While the musicians set up and the guides made
dinner, I wandered aimlessly along the bank. Motorboats are banned from
the Rogue between Grave Creek and Blossom Bar, so the only sounds were
those of the river and the limbs of trees tossed by a breeze wafting up
the canyon, tempering the heat. The atmosphere was so calming that it
could almost be called narcotic--and that was before I'd had any wine.</TE>
<TE>   On the evenings that followed, Joel would pour Chardonnay and
Gewurztraminer as well as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It was fitting,
though, that on our first night he broke out the Zinfandel. The
ubiquitousness of Ravenwood's label can be largely attributed to its
"Vintners Blend," a low-priced, lip-smacking table wine. But Ravenswood
is also sought out by cork-sniffing connoisseurs, courtesy of its
high-end, single-vineyard Zins--intense and meticulously crafted from old
and prestigious vineyards such as Napa Valley's Dickerson, Sonoma
Valley's Barricia, Dry Creek Valley's Teldeschi and Louis Martini's Monte
Rosso in the Mayacamas Mountains between Sonoma and Napa.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, those were precisely the wines that Peterson was
pouring, accompanied by a sundown discourse on the origins of his wines
and his interest in winemaking. Having grown up with a wine collector for
a father, Joel started sitting in on professional tastings when he was 9.
As an adult, he apprenticed with the late Joseph Swan, who made legendary
Zinfandel at his home near the Russian River. To establish his own niche,
Joel decided to focus on Zin, "because it was the only grape in
California that had the same characteristics as old vines in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   As cases in point, he guided us through his wines as artfully as Jimmy
had handled the rapids. For my money, they all married sublimely with the
salmon and mango-papaya salsa that we ate for dinner. After Joel's talk,
the musicians made their way through a repertoire of Bach and Vivaldi,
interspersed with Yiddish numbers, Celtic jigs and even a few original
tunes.</TE>
<TE>   As a shining crescent moon descended, "Moon River" was the inevitable
accompaniment. The Rogue surged past, murmuring and disappearing
downstream.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing," someone mused. "The river never stops." He may not
have been sober, but he wasn't wrong. I had planned to retire to my tent
and read, but as the evening wore on, I found it impossible to tear
myself away. Invigorating outdoor activity during the day, near-naked
lounging on the beach at night, savoring wine while listening to lyrical
tunes: This, I thought for the umpteenth time on a river-rafting trip,
was the life.</TE>
<TE>   The next day i had a chance to examine the other side of the equation.
I elected to spend the morning in an inflatable kayak, where I'd have
only myself to rely on. After several trips, I knew this was the most
exciting way to experience the river. If you get dumped in a rapid, you
just hang onto your paddle and keep your feet pointed downstream--sooner
or later the current slows and somebody reunites you with your boat. Duly
outfitted in life vests and helmets, six of us intrepid soloists set off
downstream.</TE>
<TE>   The first rapid, Tyee (Chinook for "chief"), was shaped like a
question mark with a rock ledge on the right. It was an easy warmup--not
too technical but enough to quicken the flow of blood. The second rapid,
Wildcat, could be run either right or left, but was said to be more fun
in the latter direction, which featured a negotiable series of rocks and
forgiving waves.</TE>
<TE>   As warned, however, low runoff had altered the situation. Now the left
channel was a narrow drop that--thanks to a submerged rock that was
nearer to the surface than normal--had turned into a mini-waterfall with
a big hole at the bottom. We discovered this only after we'd entered the
rapid. In other words, too late.</TE>
<TE>   As I went over the drop, the hole opened directly below me and sucked
me into its maw, ripping the paddle from my grip and the boat from my
body. Immediately upon going underwater, my face hit a rock. The life
vest buoyed me upward, but as I neared the surface, I encountered an
immovable object: my kayak, held stubbornly motionless above my head by
the swirling current. I tried to shove it out of the way, but my strength
was no match for the force of the river. I'd already been underwater
longer than ever before in a rapid, and the air in my lungs was waning.
Maybe this is what Jimmy meant when he called the water level
"intriguing"?</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to say that next I noticed a radiant white light--and, as a
matter of fact, I did. It was sunlight shining through the white water,
illuminating every bubble and stream in the churning rapid. Suddenly my
face broke the surface of the water and I was spit downstream.</TE>
<TE>   "You were under for a long time," someone observed as I grabbed the
side of a raft, gasping. As it turned out, four of the six kayakers had
flipped in the hole. An oar boat got stuck on a gravel bar above it,
requiring a crew member to swim the shallows and attach a line so that
others onshore could pull the raft free. In the process, Danny Carnahan's
cello--built in 1790 and enclosed in a soft case on top of the
gear--sustained cracks in its soundboard.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started playing the cello, I sure as hell never expected to
pitch it down a river through a rapid like that," Carnahan said that
night as he replaced the broken strings and popped the wood into place.
"If the river gods demand my cello as a sacrifice, though, so be it. I
need time in the wilderness to flush out the nonsense that's always
running around inside my brain at home."</TE>
<TE>   That night Joel poured wines from 1994--a Wood Road zinfandel from the
Russian River district, a Pickberry Meritage from Sonoma Mountain, a
Sangiacomo Merlot from the Carneros region and a Rh0ne-style blend
containing Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre from Sonoma Valley. With grilled
lamb and chutney, cucumber salad and garlic mashed potatoes, the wines
almost erased my memory of being trapped underwater.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things about scary, harrowing experiences that buoy you up
in life after you've survived," Joel said. He was speaking from
experience. Several years ago, after capsizing at the entrance to a
rapid, he had gone over three small waterfalls, gotten trapped inside a
hole and bumped into several more boulders before he made it to safety.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're tumbling around in a rapid, there comes a moment when you
realize, 'I could lose it all here,' " he said. "After an experience like
that, it's nice to be able to reaffirm your connection to the earth and
humanity with a good wine. You find yourself thinking, 'That wasn't so
bad. What was I worried about?"'</TE>
<TE>   Joel's close call had occurred in 1994--the same year he made the
wines we were now tasting. Seven years on, they had all acquired the
complexity that comes with age. In place of exuberant fruit (youth and
immortality), they exuded the burnished wood, roses-and-violets character
that comes with full maturity. Moreover, Joel observed, '94 had been a
cool year with a long growing season, resulting in "rounded, succulent,
well-formed products" that are aging well. "Every wine is a time
capsule," he said. "It captures a moment in history."</TE>
<TE>   A moment that continues to evolve. As dusk descended after dinner, the
musicians played an Irish ballad called "The Grey Funnel Line": "But the
hardest time in a sailor's day/Is to watch the sun as it fades away."
Listening to the slow, sentimental song while sipping capsules of history
with old friends and new acquaintances, all brought together by the power
of the Rogue, I couldn't help noticing anew that the river never stops.</TE>

<DH>It's Easy to Indulge an Addiction in the Asian Capital of Street
Food</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KANDELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I started visiting Southeast Asia more than three decades ago,
it was still a notorious destination for Westerners in search of cheap
narcotics. Novels and films depicted degenerate Europeans and Americans
holed up in dingy hotel rooms in an opium stupor.</LD>
<LD>   Today there is a new wave of Western addicts in this part of the
world. They wander down hidden alleys and through open-air markets in
search of the maximum food experience at the minimum price: irresistibly
delicious Chinese soups, Malay noodles and Indian curries served at
street stands for just a few dollars. Back in Los Angeles, New York,
London and Paris, these people seem perfectly normal. But here in
Singapore, the Asian capital of "street food," they lie to friends and
relatives, break away from tour groups and secretly search out food
counters and tiny restaurants where they can feed with little fear of
encountering familiar faces. I know these new addicts well because I am
one of them. I don't fit the classic profile of a promiscuous eater. I am
by no means obese. I exercise regularly at a gym, and I politely refuse
second portions at dinner parties. But in Singapore, I am like the old
German professor in the movie "The Blue Angel" who loses his dignity
because of his obsession with the seductive Marlene Dietrich.</LD>
<TE>   Singapore certainly doesn't have a reputation as a city of sin. This
tropical island-state is far better known for an intolerant government
whose main concerns are that citizens obey authority, make money and live
in a metropolis where everything functions perfectly. (Late last year the
government successfully targeted a terrorist network that was closely
linked to Al Qaeda and had planned to attack U.S. military and business
targets there.) In keeping with the city's squeaky clean image, most
"street food" has been herded into vast indoor courts regularly patrolled
by public health officials.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly isn't an environment that encourages sex: The birthrate
has fallen so low that the state runs programs to introduce men and women
in hopes they will marry, and then offers them cash bounties to produce
children. But passion must find an outlet, and in Singapore, food has
become the ultimate object of desire. On my most recent sojourn last
December, I stayed at a luxury hotel, the Oriental, because it caters to
respectable tourists and businesspeople and is near many of the "hawker
centers"--clusters of food stands--that I love. The evening before I had
been invited to a new chic restaurant offering a pleasant but ultimately
unsatisfying Asian fusion dinner of the sort I could have had back in New
York. By noon the following day, I was ready for a heartier repast,
served in a more vulgar, authentic ambience.</TE>
<TE>   So I headed to Chinatown, seemingly a misnomer since about 75% of
Singapore's 4 million inhabitants are Chinese, with Malays and Indians
accounting for most of the rest. But Chinatown got its name because it is
on the spit of land where the first junk-load of Chinese immigrants
settled shortly after a swashbuckling British merchant, Sir Stamford
Raffles, founded Singapore as a trading post in 1819.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, a love affair with modernity induced Singaporeans
to turn their backs on Chinatown and instead revel in the Western-style
shopping malls and restaurants of Orchard Road. But now the city's
cultural and culinary center of gravity is moving back toward Chinatown
and the old waterfront where Singapore began. The former General Post
Office, a colonial behemoth with Doric columns, cornices and coffered
ceilings, has been transformed into the Fullerton, a luxury hotel.
Nearby, in a less fortunate architectural style, the Esplanade is
assuming its ultimate armadillo shape in time for a scheduled opening
late this year as Singapore's main center for the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   Walking past these new projects and beyond the postmodern high-rises
of the business district, I meandered down narrow streets of herbal
medicine shops and antiquarians until I reached the Chinatown Complex.
It's a huge concrete block with all the charm of a multilevel parking
garage. But nobody comes here for the decor. On its second floor, there
are about 200 food stands with cuisine from every corner of Asia.
Working-class men and women in T-shirts, shorts and floppy sandals
slurped their soup and talked so loudly that if I closed my eyes, I could
imagine myself in a sports arena. Soon I was surrounded by waiters
offering to guide me to the best food stands.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped first at Joe Pork and Fish Porridge, food stand 02-069
(fortunately, the stands are numbered consecutively, making them easier
to locate on return visits), where I was served a soothing bowl of congee
with the texture of cream and flavored with fish, green onions and
sesame. Next, I ate at Jolly Yummy (food stand 02-137), where I accepted
a plate of Hainanese chicken rice: strips of satin-smooth chicken with
rice balls and three dipping sauces of varying spiciness. For the grand
finale, I sat down at Zhao Ji (food stand 02-054) to relish an exquisite
rice dish: scallions, bitter Chinese spinach, mushrooms and slices of
duck and bacon--all cooked in a clay pot and served on top of rice fried
in a sweet, brown sauce. The owner was surly, even rude, knowing  full
well that a culinary libertine like myself wouldn't dare complain because
the food was so good.</TE>
<TE>   I returned to the Oriental for a long, restorative nap. When I awoke,
I swam for an hour in the pool, washing away sinful calories and working
up an appetite for more gluttony. At nightfall, I headed for the Little
India neighborhood. Settled in the second half of the 19th century by
immigrants from Calcutta and Madras, Little India is a teeming
conglomeration of shops selling spices, bolts of silk and satin, and
finely spun gold jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   On this visit, I was meeting two friends at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal
Temple, one of the city's oldest and most important Hindu centers. The
occasion was a holiday at which teenage girls, clad in colorful saris,
danced barefoot to the sound of cymbals, drums and horns to advertise
their availability for marriage. The ceremony was all the more appealing
because two participants were nieces of my friends, but all I could think
about was the nearby Lavender Food Square, one of my favorite food
emporiums.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid I have a headache and must get back to my hotel," I lied.
My friends looked grief-stricken because family duties obliged them to
remain at the temple instead of accompanying me. Safely out of their
view, I doubled back to Lavender Food Square, a covered arcade where even
a Westerner can lose himself in the crowds. I gorged on nasi padang--an
Indonesian-style dish of rice, peanuts, fish, egg, tofu and a sauce so
spicy that I broke into a sweat. I cooled down with a large glass of
foamy sugar-cane juice, and then ended the surreptitious meal with
popiah--stewed turnips with garlic, fried bean curd, chiles and sweet
flour sauce wrapped into an egg roll.</TE>
<TE>   Back at my hotel, there were worried messages from my Indian friends.
But I sank into my king-size bed with a sense of utter satiety that only
a true Asian street-food addict can appreciate. Who says the guilty
cannot sleep?</TE>
<TE>   The following morning i was in a horticultural mood--it's hard not to
be on this verdant island. The terminals at Changi International Airport
are greenhouses for ornamental plants, and arriving visitors can admire
exotic species as they wait at the baggage carousels. The expressway into
the city is festooned with white-flowered frangipani and purple
bougainvillea. While I don't like to toss bouquets at former Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew (he's still very much the cranky strongman behind
the semi-authoritarian government and gets enough credit as architect of
Singapore's remarkable prosperity), he is largely responsible for a
30-year-old state program to transform Singapore into a garden city even
as new skyscrapers rise.</TE>
<TE>   Today Singapore has 10,000 acres of parklands, almost six times as
much as it had in 1965, when it became an independent nation. The most
famous expanse of green is the Botanic Gardens, where I arrived for a 10
a.m. appointment with a knowledgeable guide, Abdul Hamid bin Hassan, who
promised to point out the highlights among the tree groves and flower
beds bordering limpid ponds and rolling lawns.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd favorite is the cannonball tree whose large, heavy seed pods
hit the ground with a thud and smell like skunk cabbage. I preferred an
enormous rain tree, majestic as an oak and covered with epiphytes, some
the size of small palm trees.</TE>
<TE>   But the best moments of the tour were in the 12-acre Orchid Garden.
Here were the Dancing Lady, an orchid so small that its yellow blossoms
must be viewed with a magnifying glass; the mammoth Tiger Orchid, which
weighs as much  as 2 tons and has brown-spotted creme flowers the size of
an outstretched hand; the Vanda Mimi Palmer, the only scented orchid I
have ever encountered,  with a pungent vanilla aroma emanating from its
mottled mauve blossoms. Pride of place went to the VIP hybrid orchids,
named after famous visitors. The "Margaret Thatcher" was hardy, with
spiky dark blossoms that flowered  year-round, while the "Princess Di"
was a more delicate, short-lived white orchid. I confess that my visit to
the Botanic Gardens was not entirely devoid of gastronomic impulses.
Rumor had it that the adjoining Taman Serasi Food Center, a collection of
stalls famous for roti john (crisp egg, onion and minced lamb omelets
with chile sauce), would soon be closed to make way for an expansion of
the gardens. When I broached the subject with Abdul, my guide, he eyed me
suspiciously: Was I one of those food fanatics who valued a roti john
more than an orchid?</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten a lot of complaints about the end of those stands," he
said guardedly.</TE>
<TE>   I assured him that I was asking out of idle curiosity--though
apparently I wasn't convincing enough because he dropped me off at the
gate closest to the food stands and offered a word of advice: "Try the
soursop juice--it's the best thing to drink with roti john." And he was
right. (Alas, Taman Serasi has since closed.)</TE>
<TE>   For all its vices, my street-food addiction had the great merit of
drawing me into Singapore's most picturesque neighborhoods--hidden nooks
and crannies that I assumed had been obliterated long ago by steel and
glass towers. It had been years since I had thought about Arab Street and
its adjoining lanes. Settled by Middle Eastern traders more than a
century ago, the neighborhood still retains an Islamic flavor, with
two-storied "shophouses" selling silks, beads and condiments on their
ground-floor level.</TE>
<TE>   I followed Singapore's foremost food maven, Violet Oon, there one
night. She is the author of a best-selling book on the island's cuisine
and an entrepreneur with her own boutique line of sauces, spices and
sweets. It was still the month of Ramadan, and the faithful streamed out
of the gold-domed Sultan Mosque famished after a day of fasting.</TE>
<TE>   On Kandahar Street, a name of sudden notoriety because of the war in
Afghanistan, people lined up in front of dozens of stands where women in
head scarves sold fresh home-made dumplings, stuffed bean curd, shish
kebab, chicken tikka, lamb curry, Sumatran rice, Malay noodles and a
rainbow assortment of sweets. At Oon's insistence, I didn't break my own
fast (five hours since lunch) until we reached a restaurant aptly named
Sabar Menanti, Malay for "wait patiently." Thirty minutes later, our
sidewalk table was a checkerboard of delicacies: dried beef in coriander
and cumin, stewed sweet potato leaves, oxtail soup, sardines in tomato
and curry sauce.</TE>
<TE>   To balance this Muslim fare, Violet suggested we go around the corner
to Seow Choon Hua, a southern Chinese restaurant. We shared a Foo Chow
fish ball soup, its main ingredient as fluffy as the finest matzo ball,
and then a red wine chicken mee, its meat and noodles marinating in a
subtly alcoholic broth.</TE>
<TE>   Between this cascade of courses, Oon offered some observations on why
tiny Singapore has emerged as a food capital comparable to Hong Kong, New
York and Paris. Perhaps the key reason is the single-mindedness with
which many people here approach a restaurant meal. They care not a whit
for fine furnishings, rarely engage in conversation and avoid any other
distractions from the task at hand: savoring the food.</TE>
<TE>   "And another thing, we are stingy," Oon said. "In other cities, the
affluent are willing to pay for fine food. Here, we are outraged if a
street stand raises its prices 50 cents." Which explains why even the
most memorable meals at food stands cost only $4 to $5.</TE>
<TE>   As a much-needed respite from all this eating, I headed one evening to
the Night Safari adjoining the zoo. Here, on 100 acres of seemingly open
spaces, more than 1,200 animals of more than 110 species roam, feed and
dawdle in full view of visitors. The reasoning behind the Night Safari is
that the majority of wild animals are most active after sunset--although,
in fact, they are kept under low-wattage lighting that resembles a
permanent dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can either follow footpaths or, as I did, take a leisurely,
hourlong tram ride through a changing terrain that re-creates Himalayan
foothills, African savannas and Malay Peninsula rain forests, among other
settings. The rubber-wheeled tram, which looks like a segmented
caterpillar, was quiet enough. But a chirpy guide, constantly reading
from a feel-good, hug-a-tree manifesto designed for elementary school
kids, made me regret that I had chosen not to walk.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even she could not entirely subvert the sense of wonder at the
armor plating on the greater one-horned rhino, the unexpected dignity of
a bearded pig and the sensual terror of a Gir lion. As we passed in close
proximity to flocks of cranes, herds of water buffalo and packs of
jackals, I marveled at the invisible trenches, electronic fences and
other barriers that created an illusion of freedom for the animals and
titillating danger for humans.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, I headed over to Lau Pa Sat, a cavernous, cast-iron
former train station transformed into a congenial hawker center
overlooking a marina. Here, at a table set up on the street just outside
the main entrance, I devoured a heaping plate of satays--chicken wings
and strips of beef and lamb impaled on sticks, marinated in a secret
concoction of herbs, grilled over charcoal and served with a spicy peanut
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Then I was faced with a quandary. This was my last evening in
Singapore. There was only room for one more dish. I wandered the stalls,
leering at the fried oyster omelets, the black pepper crab meat over
glass noodles, the Penang laksa noodles in a sour and spicy fish broth.
In the end, I chose what many consider Singapore's national dish, Hokkien
mee: fried noodles with shrimp, chopped squid, garlic, lemon juice and a
pungent fish paste. Draped limply over a chair in a postprandial daze, I
briefly considered a small portion of kaya, an egg-and-custard jam
dessert. But whom was I kidding? I no longer had the stamina of ribald
youth.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of my final day was a visit to the Rasa Sentosa Resort
on the island of Sentosa, just over the causeway from downtown Singapore.
It is a popular family destination for Singaporeans who don't mind
lolling on a beach in full view of one of the world's largest commercial
fleets. But I was there because my plane was leaving late in the evening
and I much preferred spending $100 on a three-hour spa treatment at
Sentosa than paying twice that for an extra day at my luxury hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, nothing better prepares a passenger for a 20-plus-hour flight
than a long bout of muscle pampering. A young woman named Yvonne got me
started with a body polish, scrubbing away my outermost skin layer with a
grainy lotion. Next came the Swedish body massage and, finally, a seaweed
body wrap that left me feeling like a California roll. I slept for an
hour to the recorded sounds of surf and New Age music.</TE>
<TE>   And then Yvonne sent me away with a few words of wisdom: "Better not
eat for a few more hours."</TE>
<TE>   I would heed such advice when heading to any other airport in the
world. But this was Singapore. The food court in the departure terminal
offered dishes I had neglected back in town: squid fried with Chinese
parsley and drunken prawns marinated in rice wine and garlic. I almost
felt sorry for the business and first-class passengers closeted with
canapes in the luxury lounge.</TE>

<DH>For Years, Summering Europeans Have Flocked to the Island of
Corsica. What Do They Know That Americans Don't?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it takes years of dreaming before a trip becomes a
reality. I first saw Corsica from the Italian island of Sardinia more
than a dozen years ago. Sitting 112 miles from the coast of France in the
western Mediterranean, the island the Greeks called Kalliste, or "most
beautiful," appeared as a blurred watercolor of blues and smoky grays. I
knew it was French. I'd heard the landscape was wilder and more
mountainous than that of Sardinia. And brin d'amour, the Corsican sheep's
milk cheese with a shaggy coating of herbs, had been a favorite of mine
since I first discovered it years ago at a cheese shop in Paris. They've
got wines, too. All those attributes, and the lure of the island's
incomparable turquoise and cobalt sea, increased my longing to see
Corsica.</LD>
<TE>   A decade passed before I finally had the chance to satisfy my
curiosity about the enigmatic island. It all came together when I was
able to rent a family friend's summer house on Corsica for two weeks last
October. After a stopover in Paris, three of us took the hour or so
flight to Bastia airport on the northern side of the island. It was a
clear, glorious morning, and from the plane we could see mountain peaks
swathed in cloud, emerald patches of forest, and the blue, blue sea. At
the small, efficient airport, my husband, my friend Mary and I picked up
a rental car, bought Michelin map #90: Corse and set off by a somewhat
circuitous route for the house on the southern tip of the island.</TE>
<TE>   The third-largest island in the western Mediterranean, Corsica lies in
the Tyrrhenian Sea and is roughly 115 miles long and 52 miles across. It
has about 600 miles of gorgeous rocky coastline, much of it undeveloped
and stoutly protected by the Conservertoire du Littoral. That's not
saying much until you understand the unique topography of the island,
which sometimes is called the mountain in the sea. I'm not talking baby
peaks, but something akin to the Alps, with a number of peaks higher than
6,500 feet and the highest, Monte Cinto, soaring to 8,800 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1870, painter and limerick writer Edward Lear published a series of
etchings of Corsica in which the landscape looks as forbidding and
fantastical as that of Afghanistan. Much of the interior is still
accessible only by foot, which is why Corsica is such a paradise for
hikers. It's crisscrossed with more than 600 miles of marked trails, the
most arduous of which is the famous 125-mile-long GR20, a hike of 12 days
or more that crosses the island diagonally from the northwest to
southeast, or the extraordinary Mare e Monti, a 10-day itinerary dotted,
like the GR20, with refuge and shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the topography, navigating Corsica is deceptive. Drives can
take far longer than it would appear by looking at the map; you have to
learn to think in terms of time, not miles. Except for a straight stretch
along the east coast, roads are narrow and full of dizzying hairpin turns
liberally bordered in green on the Michelin map to indicate that they are
picturesque.</TE>
<TE>   Before I left I went over the map of Corsica with my friend Michael
(whose mother's house we would be renting) and he pointed out beautiful
drives.</TE>
<TE>   "How far from Bonifacio to Ajaccio," I asked, pointing at the
southwest corner of the island.</TE>
<TE>   "Six-and-half hours," he said, without hesitating.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that he's a fearless driver, I added an hour or two onto the
figure. The roads were better than I imagined, though, well-maintained
and well-marked, a pleasure to drive as long as you're cautious going
around blind curves. (That 6 1/2-hour drive turned out to be only four,
since the roads--and cars--were much improved since Michael last drove
them.) It turned out that despite the occasional hair-raising
near-collision with kamikaze drivers, I loved driving in Corsica. But
those looking for a different experience might consider the small-gauge
train called the Trinighellu that makes a spectacular journey over the
mountains from Corte down to Ajaccio on the west coast of the island.</TE>
<TE>   My constant companion throughout the trip was "Granite Island: A
Portrait of Corsica" (Penguin, 1984), a book by British historian and
social anthropologist Dorothy Carrington. Out of print in this country,
I'd finally found it online through a British retailer. (It's also
available at bookstores in Corsica.) Marvelously written, insightful and
moving, it's indispensable to understanding Corsica's insular culture,
complicated history and mysterious prehistory. From the first paragraph,
I fell in love with the island through Carrington's eyes as she
discovered it in the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   If Americans have heard of Corsica at all, it's probably in news
reports over the years of kidnappings and bombings in the long Corsican
separatists' struggle against French authorities. That said, Corsica is a
safe place to visit. Thousands of European sun-seekers flock to the
island in the summer, swelling its population from 250,000 to more than 2
million, and in recent years it has become trendy with the French as
well. Violence is usually directed at someone or something specific
rather than foreigners or tourists in public places. But you will see
signs with bullet holes through the French words and graffiti calling for
independence.</TE>
<TE>   We spent our first night in a 19th century inn in the middle of the
Vizzavona forest, in the very heart of the island, an easy drive from
Bastia via Corte, the home of Corsican nationalism, where Pascal Paoli
formed the island's first democratic government in the 18th century. The
modest Hotel Monte d'Oro is run by a welcoming Corsican mother and
daughter, and the guests, at least last October, were mostly Austrians,
Italians and Germans in sturdy hiking boots. For hiking wimps like us,
there's a lovely 1 1/2-hour walk down to a waterfall, La Cascade des
Anglais, so named because it was a popular spot with Victorian-era
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The modest inn was a great place to get over jet lag. We slept with
the windows open to let in the mountain air. Dinner served in the inn's
dining room was rustic Corsican fare: soupe Corse laced with vegetables
and beans, a plate of artisanal charcuterie, and tender local veal with
olives or rabbit braised with wild mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we left for the house we were renting on the southern tip
of the island, looking across toward Sardinia, the reverse of the view
I'd had 12 years before. It was part of a small complex of vacation
houses just outside Bonifacio that had been inspired by Sea Ranch on the
Sonoma Coast. Built 30 years before, the weathered wooden house sat on a
bluff looking onto the Mediterranean.</TE>
<TE>   A steep footpath led to a small swimming cove, where the water was an
indescribable turquoise with deeper cobalt patches, crystal clear, and
warm enough for swimming even in early October. I bobbed around in the
water in the late afternoon, watching the light change on the limestone
and granite rocks and the uninhabited Ile Lavezzi between Corsica and
Sardinia. Sometimes we'd clamber over the rocks and along a path to a
larger sandy beach that was almost empty that time of year.</TE>
<TE>   The maquis--the scrubby undergrowth of oak, myrtle, wild bay and
rosemary that covers the hillsides--has an intoxicating scent. It's so
dense that Corsicans on the run can reputedly disappear into the maquis
for years without anyone finding them. Maquis was, in fact, a code name
for the French Resistance during World War II. Suddenly I realized why
the heady scent of the maquis' wild herbs seemed so familiar: It's the
shaggy coating on the outside of the cheese brin d'amour.</TE>
<TE>   At the house, the days unfurled one after another, slow and lazy.
Sometimes we'd walk from the nearby lighthouse into the old Genoese town
of Bonifacio along white limestone cliffs carved  by the wind. The town
itself is high on a promontory, and the cobblestone streets are closely
packed with tall, narrow houses with stairs cut as steeply as ladders.
Some scholars believe Bonifacio could have been the town where Odysseus
encountered the barbaric Laestrygonians. The views from the haute ville
(upper town) are worth the hike, but the town itself doesn't have much to
offer visitors other than the odd ice cream or coffee and a handful of
tourist shops.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny, picturesque harbor below--lined with cafes and
restaurants--has more life. Our favorite stop was the Kissing Pigs, a
year-old wine bar run by an English/Corsican couple, where visitors can
taste all the best Corsican wines along with superb homemade charcuterie
or a pretty omelette made with mint and brocciu, fresh sheep's milk
cheese. We went into town almost every day for lunch at a table at the
edge of the water and watched the boats go in and out of the minuscule
harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the time we cooked. For me, that was the vacation, since
as a restaurant critic I normally eat out five or six nights a week. This
late in the season, though, just one outdoor vegetable stand was still
open near our rented house. The quickest route to the stand was down a
daunting lane bordered by eight-foot-high walls, a marvel of dry
stonework but nervous-making if you met a car coming in the other
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Porto-Vecchio, a larger, more sophisticated town about a half-hour
north, offers better shopping, including a couple of good bakeries for
crusty bread and artichoke or olive focaccia cooked in a wood-burning
oven, and a great fishmonger near the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the Kissing Pigs wine bar, we never went to restaurants. It
was great fun to pick up a whole dorade and roast it under heaps of sea
salt, or saute some fresh calamari with cherry tomatoes. We found a shop
in Porto-Vecchio with a good selection of charcuterie, cheeses, local
jams and honeys and other artisanal food products. We were all captivated
by canestrelli, which are hard cookies similar to biscotti and laced with
anise seeds.</TE>
<TE>   We also picked up some hard-to-find bottles from the island's top wine
producers. The whites from the Cap Corse area to the north are especially
good. The aperitif hour was a daily pleasure, spent sipping yet another
Corsican Vermentino with wonderful local olives and taking in the
spectacular sunsets. We'd planned things to do near Bonifacio--visit the
prehistoric sites at Filitosa, have lunch at a rustic restaurant deep in
the countryside, visit wine producers, hike through the fragrant F0ret de
L'Osepedale, a pine forest near Porto-Vecchio--but we never got around to
any of it. We never wanted to stray far from the house and the sea.</TE>
<TE>   A day or so after we arrived I called Alice Waters--not at her
renowned Berkeley restaurant, Chez Panisse, but at a manor house that she
was renting in Corsica, coincidentally during the same period we were
there. Her doctor had told her she needed three months on an island. Her
friend, wine importer Kermit Lynch, suggested Corsica.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed--it's French, it's the Mediterranean, voila!--but would go
only if she found a wonderful house. She had something Napoleonic in
mind. (Bonaparte was born on the island at Ajaccio in 1769, the year the
French took over Corsica from the Genoese.) Waters found her house, Le
Manoir, through a friend of a friend. It belongs to several Corsican
artists who now live in the States and use it in the summer for painting
workshops. It was at least a five-hour drive from us, in Bastelica, a
town famous for its charcuterie.</TE>
<TE>   When I first called her and asked how she was finding the
accommodations, she said, "We're out here pruning, working on the
garden." Her voice was cautious, a little flat. I think I know why:
Corsica wasn't turning out to be as rich a culinary destination as either
of us expected. There aren't many restaurants, and most serve either a
generic Continental cuisine, which doesn't interest either of us, or a
very small repertoire of Corsican dishes. I suspect, like most places
that aren't restaurant cultures, you find the best food in people's
homes.</TE>
<TE>   When I checked in a week later, her voice was buoyant. She'd settled
in. She'd been taking long walks. Friends were constantly coming and
going. She had at least six bedrooms, after all. If we wanted to head
that way at the end of our stay, she offered us "a room with a broom."</TE>
<TE>   None of us wanted to leave our little haven, but we did want to see
more of Corsica. So we locked up the house and set off in our rented
Peugeot for Ajaccio, the capital city and seat of the regional
government.</TE>
<TE>   The west side of the island features miles of incredibly beautiful,
undeveloped coastline. An expatriate told me part of this is because of
the way land is inherited in Corsica. The men always got the usable land,
the women the "useless" pieces along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The road to Ajaccio is a good one, if a bit slow because of the
curves. In the city we came across a farmer's market under the trees in
the central square. It was just about to close. Racing around, we tried
some wonderful little savory pies filled with cheese and some beguiling
honey cookies, and just stared at all the sausages and hams, vegetables
and fruit, wishing we could stay.</TE>
<TE>   But Bastelica beckoned. Set on the slopes of Mt. Renoso, surrounded by
mountains and dense forests, it's the birthplace of Sampiero Corso, a
16th century freedom fighter called "the most Corsican of Corsicans." My
guidebook described Bastelica as "a stark and unusually unprepossessing
spot with a few rows of granite houses and an ugly modern church." I was
thinking about this as we dodged loose pigs and cows during the winding
45-minute drive east. The town wouldn't number among the prettier
villages of France, but Waters' house was a romantic's dream.</TE>
<TE>   We explored the house from top to bottom, unpacking in one of the
antiques-furnished bedrooms with a view of the hillsides, then set off on
a walk. Seven or eight of us were strung out along the road in various
groupings, talking and stuffing our pockets with chestnuts. At one point
Waters said, "See that mountain up there? I hiked up it one afternoon. I
was practically crawling at the end, but I made it!"</TE>
<TE>   On our way back we passed two elderly ladies chatting on a bench in
front of the church. When they saw Waters carrying some chestnuts,
curiosity got the better of them. "How are you going to cook them?" they
inquired of the town's new American resident. Waters' idea of boiling
them in milk was new to them, and you could see the two women storing the
idea away--like squirrels with a chestnut.</TE>
<TE>   The entire town seemed interested in what was going on at Le Manoir.
The garden's caretaker, a bachelor in his 70s, was thrilled with all the
young women coming and going. He proposed  mushroom hunting--by night--to
every new arrival.</TE>
<TE>   That night we all pitched in to make dinner, peeling chestnuts, paring
carrots, washing greens in the big country kitchen. One of Waters' house
guests had cleaned out and fired up the bread oven in back, which was
once used to bake for the entire town. A magnificent pork roast stuck
with bay leaves and herbs went into it. Meanwhile Waters grilled some of
Bastelica's renowned charcuterie over the fire. We tried several kinds of
figatellu, or pork-liver sausages. Some were more like blood sausages,
and delicious. We drank Vermentino from Conte Peraldi, one of Kermit
Lynch's Corsican producers.</TE>
<TE>   Waters also fried up some tiny rouget, or red mullet, filets and
served them on bruschetta. Someone else was sauteeing wild mushrooms the
caretaker had brought. We made a salad with lettuces from the garden and
tried an array of local cheeses. It was a wonderful, festive meal that
came together easily.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we drove Waters to the Ajaccio airport for a short
trip to London, and then we were off to explore the rest of Corsica. We
took a couple of days to make a circuit up the west coast to Calvi and
L'Ile Rousse and then across the mountains to Corte. Final destination:
Bastia airport, and a flight for Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of those days was the red granite Calanche de Piana
(from the Corsican word for creek or inlet) on the Gulf of Porto, a
mesmirizing landscape of sheer cliffs, some 1,000 feet tall, and
fantastically contorted rock formations in every shade of rose, orange
and vermilion. It's so remarkable that the landscape is classified as a
UNESCO World Heritage site.</TE>
<TE>   The narrow road between Piana and Porto was barely wide enough for two
cars  to pass, but had occasional spaces where you could pull off the
road for a minute to admire the dizzying view with the sea beyond. If you
stay nearby, there are some lovely paths through this sur- real
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   After the season ends Oct. 1, hotel prices drop precipitously. So the
1910 hotel Les Roches Rouges, in Piana at the southern end of the
spectacular red cliffs, was just $50 a night. Its frescoed restaurant,
which has the same dramatic view, sadly, is well-intentioned, but not
very good. Next time I'll eat elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The road north was spectacular, too. We wanted to linger, but we also
wanted to get to L'Ile Rousse in the northwest before dark. Its main
square, Place Paoli, is lined with plane trees and palms. With cafe
tables set out under their shade, L'Ile Rousse reminded me of Cannes and
other towns along the French Riviera. We had a date to meet a Monsieur
Mimi, the owner of the historic Cafe des Platanes, which takes up most of

told us, but it was hard to imagine because it seemed so sleepy then. But
from the number of Web sites I've found extolling the virtues of Corsica,

<HD>Jordan's King Sees Pitfalls in a Strike on Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Jordan's King Abdullah II is urging the Bush administration to
abandon ideas of taking on the regime of Saddam Hussein, predicting that
any U.S. military action against Iraq could produce an "Armageddon" in
the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone interview as he arrived in California for a visit that
began this weekend, Abdullah warned that a U.S.-led operation could too
easily go "completely awry" and even backfire, producing a civil war in
Iraq that could involve neighboring countries--and even have a ripple
effect in the United States and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the potential Armageddon of Iraq that worries all of us, and
that's where common sense would say, 'Look, this is a tremendously
dangerous road to go down,' " Abdullah said in his first interview since
Vice President Dick Cheney visited him last week to discuss Iraq and the
Israeli-Palestinian crisis. "If our aim is to win against terrorism, we
can't afford more instability in the area."</LD>
<TE>   The king's words were blunter than a Jordanian government statement
after the Cheney meeting. And coming from one of the closest U.S. allies
in the Arab world, his warnings are particularly ominous as the Bush
administration begins sorting through the options in its pledge to
confront Hussein as part of the next stage in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, 40, the symbol of the region's new generation of leaders, is
a pragmatist who has sought to bridge cultures and push for political
reform in the region. But on Iraq, he sees no room for compromise,
reflecting the now clear-cut position of the majority of Arab leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "A strike against Iraq, the potential fragmentation of Iraq, the
potential nightmare of a civil war as a result of an American strike, is
something that I don't think the region can handle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Cheney is finding on his continuing tour of the region, the
potential aftermath of a change at the top in Iraq--after a U.S.
departure--is what most worries Arab regimes, a fear based in part on the
long history of coups and counter-coups in Baghdad before Hussein came to
power. Iraq's neighbors are particularly worried about a new period of
massive instability, Abdullah says.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you go down the road of violence, it is very, very difficult to
control it," he said. "If the region explodes, Europe and the West are
going to have to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   The king disputed comments from some U.S. officials that Arab leaders,
while resisting U.S. proposals to act against Iraq in public, were
acquiescing in private discussions.</TE>
<TE>   On CNN on Saturday, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz said
that Mideast leaders have a long history of saying one thing in public
but doing another.</TE>
<TE>   But Abdullah said that on the Iraq issue, the majority of leaders had
been "transparent and honest" about their deep concern over what could be
the consequences of a U.S. strike against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wouldn't make that assumption that there are different
policies behind closed doors--it's unfair to say that," he said. "Most of
us strongly believe that dialogue is the way to go to try to solve the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Abdullah and other Arab leaders have been pressing Iraq
in recent days to comply with the United Nations and allow inspectors
into the country to resume their mission of searching for and destroying
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The king met last Sunday with Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's
ruling Revolutionary Command Council, to press Baghdad to end its
stonewalling on the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders, as well as European, Russian and Chinese officials, had
been "very blunt, very straightforward" in delivering this message, he
added. After his meeting with Ibrahim, he said, he believed that the
Iraqi leadership is "beginning to get the message."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah also said the United States would be making a mistake to
think that its military success in Afghanistan could be a blueprint for
action against Iraq. The vastness of Iraq, its strategic location and oil
wealth, its mix of ethnic and religious groups and, in particular, the
regional dynamics presented far more complex challenges than those in
Afghanistan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the rule of his father, King Hussein, Jordan sat out the 1991
war with Iraq to liberate Kuwait, in large part because of pressure from
its own population. But in the mid-1990s, King Hussein lashed out at
Baghdad and allowed Iraqi dissidents to be based in the Jordanian
capital, Amman.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is now home to about 250,000 Iraqi refugees, Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, which is trying to open up both politically and economically
to provide a new model for the region, remains dependent on Iraq for
discounted oil. Being cut off would cost Amman about $500 million a year,
according to Jordan's foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   In his wide-ranging comments, Abdullah struck a more optimistic note
on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Based on intense behind-the-scenes
discussions, he predicted that an Arab League summit next week would give
across-the-board support to the Saudi Arabian proposal to offer Israel
full recognition from the 22-member bloc in exchange for withdrawal from
territories it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. The king said
Ibrahim told him that even Iraq would not oppose the Saudi effort.</TE>
<TE>   But Abdullah said that any attempt by Israel to prevent Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat from going to the summit in Beirut
would make it difficult for the Arab world "to do what's positive and
possible."</TE>
<TE>   "There could be nothing worse for us moderates but that [Arafat] is
still held hostage in the West Bank when the moderates are really trying
to say that peace with Israel is in our strategic future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Islamic extremism, Abdullah warned that the struggle to contain the
threat would take at least the next two decades. The Sept. 11 attacks on
the United States were a wake-up call in the Islamic world about the
scope of the problem, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The major dangers ahead, he predicted, would come not from the Arab
world but from Asia, where Osama bin Laden has been promoting radical and
erroneous interpretations of Islam among people who do not speak the
language of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Middle East, the battle will be easier won because Arabic is
the first language. Where it will be much harder to do this is in Asia,
where the majority of Muslims don't speak Arabic as a first language and
the Osama bin Ladens have had a head start on us. That's where the heart
of the battle is," he said.</TE>

<HD>Europe Takes War on Al Qaeda to Courtrooms</HD>
<DH>Justice: Cells 'jurisdiction-shopped' and took advantage of weak
laws, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy
</DL>
<LD>Staring from a cage surrounded by police, a sullen Tunisian with
close-cropped hair went on trial recently in one of the first cases to
open a courtroom door onto the global law enforcement war against Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso laid out charges that Mehdi Kammoun, 34,
was a leader of a Milan terrorist cell. After bugging the phones and
apartments of accused terrorists, Italian police listened for months as
the men allegedly sought to become martyrs for Osama bin Laden, conspired
with top suspects around Europe and carried out a "punitive expedition,"
using martial arts weapons to beat up a Tunisian consulate employee who
they thought was a spy.</LD>
<LD>   "Attacks have to be well planned," Kammoun said in a conversation
about chemical weapons, according to wiretap transcripts. "It's a good
thing they don't see the gas, because if they see the gas that's really
dangerous. There's a difference between a cylinder of gas and a can of
gasoline. . . . These are really delicate things."</LD>
<TE>   Outside Afghanistan, the shadow war against Al Qaeda has mostly been
waged so far by police slouched in cars during stakeouts and kicking in
doors during raids. Now the courts are taking over in Western Europe,
where thousands of extremists were radicalized and dozens allegedly
plotted crimes, including the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Cases opened in Europe and Southeast Asia, another important front,
show that authorities have foiled attacks, captured significant suspects
and gained a better understanding of the anarchic workings of Al Qaeda.
But the legal battlefield, especially in Europe, seems as much of a
labyrinth as the caves of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Though the suspected terrorists are often brazen and visible, it is
difficult to make major charges stick. If they are convicted, many of the
approximately 100 accused Al Qaeda members arrested in Europe since Sept.
11 could receive prison terms of less than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's soldiers "jurisdiction-shopped," as a U.S. official puts
it, selectively deploying themselves to take advantage of a continent
that has opened borders to commerce and travel but not to police and
laws.</TE>
<TE>   European sleuths have learned a lot since Sept. 11 because they
already knew a lot. At the moment the first hijacked plane slammed into a
tower in Manhattan, Islamic extremists in Europe were already under
surveillance. The strategy in France, Italy and other countries has been
to watch suspects as long as possible; after Sept. 11, the police rolled
in their nets.</TE>
<TE>   "We prefer to wait and gather the maximum evidence," said Dambruoso,
40, a lanky and animated veteran of the Sicilian mafia wars who is
protected by a carload of bodyguards because of suspected terrorist
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, he said, "everybody thought the problem was for the
Americans and the Israelis. We didn't have strong laws against
international terrorism in Italy, in Belgium, Germany and other countries
until Sept. 11. The terrorists knew that."</TE>
<TE>   As the Kammoun trial began last month, Dambruoso won the conviction of
four other defendants including the ringleader of the Milan cell, Essid
Sami ben Khemais, on charges of criminal association. In a procedure
similar to a plea bargain, Ben Khemais and another man received five
years in prison. Two accomplices received four years.</TE>
<TE>   Although investigators consider them dangerous and U.S. authorities
have identified their mosque as a European logistical base for Al Qaeda,
the law makes it hard to win stiffer sentences unless extremists are
caught in the act.</TE>
<TE>   "Information from intelligence services in Europe, the United States
or Israel is not always judicial evidence," Dambruoso said. Kammoun and
his fellow suspects face potential sentences of five to six years in
prison on charges including conspiracy, document fraud and involvement in
illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Italy is among several countries that have quickly toughened their
anti-terrorism laws. Germany, the headquarters of the Sept. 11 hijackers,
Belgium and Britain were particularly good clandestine bases for Al Qaeda
cells because of liberal policies on immigration, political asylum and
civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   France, in contrast, permits suspected terrorists to be held for up to
four years pending trial. Suspects arrested after Sept. 11 for allegedly
plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris face a maximum of 10 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "In Europe, you have a great difficulty," said Judge Jean-Louis
Bruguiere, a top French anti-terrorist official. "You have many
independent states with different systems and mentalities. You have
common law versus civil law traditions. You have federal and centralized
systems."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have worked hard to improve cooperation. Sharing
information has led them to realize that despite Al Qaeda's seeming
omnipresence, its world is quite small. Cells are more connected to each
other than seems likely or logical, either for strategic reasons, or
simply because suspects are friends from their days in London mosques or
wind-swept Afghan training camps, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to change mentality and understand the connections without a
preestablished analytical system," Bruguiere said. "We have recognized
the erratic, illogical aspects of this movement. That has allowed us to
build our approach to our work."</TE>
<TE>   It was not unusual that the Milan terrorists spent hours immersed in
incriminating conversations even as they constantly changed cell phones
and worried about being discovered, Dambruoso said. "The life of a
terrorist is totally about this," he said. "It's a kind of status; it
gives meaning to their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Other European investigators also had listened to suspected terrorists
for a long time. Members of an alleged Madrid cell had been under
surveillance since 1996. And months before his capture, Belgian police
shadowing Nizar Trabelsi, a Tunisian fresh from the Afghan camps, picked
up indications that he "was going to do something big and foolish,"
according to an investigator.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 13, Trabelsi was arrested on charges that he planned to be
the suicide bomber in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "There is hardly anyone in the world who has been arrested about whom
we did not have information," Bruguiere said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, investigators do not always realize what they are seeing.</TE>
<TE>   German police did not get wind of the Sept. 11 plot, which was carried
out by a terrorist cell based in Hamburg, even though they had put one of
the future hijackers' key associates under surveillance in late 1999 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Even the capture of alleged terrorist chieftains does not necessarily
mean that they will spend decades behind bars. A case in point is Tarek
Maaroufi, 36, a Tunisian-born Islamic activist in Brussels, who
investigators have concluded was a pivotal figure in Europe.</TE>
<TE>3-Year Sentence for Terror Involvement</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a Belgian court sentenced Maaroufi to three years in prison
for involvement in Algerian terrorist groups that were gradually absorbed
by Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said he also co-founded a dangerous network known as the
Tunisian Islamic Fighting Group with Seifallah ben Hassine, a former
London extremist thought to be on the run in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Maaroufi allegedly aided fellow Tunisian Dahmane Abd Sattar and
another assassin who killed anti-Taliban leader Ahmed Shah Masoud in
Afghanistan on Sept. 9. A U.S. official says Abd Sattar is believed to
have had contacts with several Sept. 11 hijackers in Europe in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Maaroufi allegedly has links to cells in Belgium, France
and the Netherlands involved in the plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in
Paris, and to suspects in Spain who funneled money to the Hamburg
hijackers, according to Spanish law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   And investigators found links tying the embassy plotters to Frenchman
Zacarias Moussaoui, who is the accused "20th hijacker" jailed in the
United States, and Richard C. Reid, who allegedly tried to blow up a
Paris-to-Miami flight with explosives planted in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   But Maaroufi has been charged only with recruiting mercenaries and
document fraud, for allegedly providing stolen Belgian passports and
fraudulent Pakistani visas for the Masoud assassination. If found guilty,
he faces between three and eight years in prison, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Maaroufi knew that Belgium's anti-terrorism laws were weak and that
his Belgian citizenship shielded him, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just a question of tougher laws, however. The Masoud
assassination displayed Al Qaeda's technique of breaking crimes down into
"minimally prosecutable incidents," the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   "They might have training in one country, money in another, equipment
and documents in a third," the official said. "They worked it
beautifully. It's trade-craft."</TE>
<TE>   In the Masoud case, the Brussels-based assassins obtained fake
documents, money, plane tickets and a letter of recommendation from
accomplices in Belgium, France and Britain, according to investigators.
The killers presumably acquired explosives after flying to Pakistan and
crossing into Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   British prosecutors charged an Egyptian bookseller in London with
conspiracy to commit murder. But other European prosecutors are less
likely to file homicide-related charges against alleged accomplices in a
slaying that took place thousands of miles away, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   It is even less certain what is happening to another top target in
Europe, London-based Omar Mahmoud Othman, a Palestinian-born cleric
better known as Abu Qatada. London has been the Al Qaeda nerve center in
Europe, and investigators allege that Abu Qatada is the dominant
ideologue.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators on the European mainland said British authorities
indicated privately after a police sweep in December that Abu Qatada had
been arrested under a new anti-terrorism law. But there has been no
official comment from British authorities since then.</TE>
<TE>   Coordinating action against suspected terrorists is even more
difficult in Southeast Asia. A cleric accused of being the Indonesian
equivalent of Abu Qatada has not been arrested because Indonesian police
say they don't have enough evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Bakar Bashir has been identified as the ideological leader of
Jemaah Islamiah, the main organization allied to Al Qaeda in Southeast
Asia. The founder of an Islamic school in Indonesia, Bashir lived for
many years in neighboring Malaysia. He denies terrorist activity but
praises Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police have interviewed Bashir twice but say they need more
proof than the statements given by suspects held in Singapore and
Malaysia. Indonesia also does not have the legal weapons of Malaysia and
Singapore, both of which used internal security acts for recent
crackdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen suspects arrested in a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy and
other targets in Singapore were ordered detained for at least two years
under regulations allowing those deemed a security threat to be held
indefinitely without trial. The act requires closed-door hearings to
review detentions.</TE>
<TE>   The most wanted Islamic extremist in Southeast Asia is Riduan
Isamuddin, better known as Hambali, who allegedly is the operational
leader of Jemaah Islamiah and Al Qaeda's point man for the region.
Malaysian officials believe that he had prior knowledge of the Sept. 11
attack and hosted two of the hijackers in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of authorities to catch and convict Hambali and others
suspected of playing supporting roles in the Sept. 11 attacks will be a
barometer of the campaign against Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>Cases May Illuminate the Sept. 11 Plot</TE>
<TE>   Three prosecutions that also could shed light on preparations for the
attacks are the Moussaoui case in Virginia federal court, German charges
against a Moroccan immigrant and the case of the Madrid cell.</TE>
<TE>   German police arrested the Moroccan, Mounir Motassadeq, on Nov. 28 and
accused him of "supporting a terrorist association." A friend of Mohamed
Atta, the Egyptian who allegedly led the Hamburg terrorist cell,
Motassadeq is the only suspect arrested in Germany in the Sept. 11 case.
Authorities also indicted three fugitives and issued arrest warrants for
them as key accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he was merely a fellow student of Atta at Hamburg's
Technical University. However, he was one of two witnesses to Atta's 1996
will. Police have 18 months in which to hold and investigate him.</TE>
<TE>   In the Madrid case, Spanish prosecutors have the advantage of strong
laws passed to combat the threat from Basque terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Alleged ringleader Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas and seven others face
charges of belonging to a terrorist group, an offense carrying a
potential sentence of 15 to 20 years in prison, officials say. Barakat is
a major catch, according to Spanish, U.S. and French officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like they have a big piece of the puzzle," a U.S. official
said. "If he's not at the level of Abu Qatada [in London], he's very
close."</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon charged Barakat and his fellow
defendants in connection with the Sept. 11 case, accusations based
largely on Barakat's apparent contact with Atta and on intercepted
telephone conversations suggesting prior knowledge of the World Trade
Center plot.</TE>
<TE>   Barakat's travels to meet with alleged Al Qaeda leaders around the
world included trips to Indonesia and Malaysia, where important planning
for the U.S. hijackings took place, according to U.S. and Spanish
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish investigators hope to connect Barakat's group to the movements
of Atta and others in Spain shortly before Sept. 11, particularly a visit
by Atta in July. Investigators think that Atta came to Spain for
logistical or planning activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Madrid cell and a North African-dominated Al Qaeda group in
Granada financed cells elsewhere, including the Hamburg group, Spanish
officials said. Over several years, suspects in Spain used wire transfers
and couriers to send hundreds of thousands of dollars to Belgium and
Germany, according to Spanish law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, money was sent from Spain connecting our suspects to the
cells who went to the United States to carry out the attacks," a Spanish
law enforcement official said. "There was money sent directly to the
Hamburg group."</TE>
<TE>   But investigators are still trying to reconstruct Atta's visit to
Spain. Police recently found witnesses who said they saw Atta change
currency at the Port Aventura theme park near the northeastern coastal
town of Salou.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's presence in the park bolsters the theory that he was in Spain
for clandestine meetings, perhaps with confederates based in other
European countries plotting their own attacks, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Atta was seen alone," the law enforcement official said. "But we
think he was at the park to meet someone--it would be an ideal cover."</TE>
<TE>   Another lead is a trip to Madrid by Ramzi Binalshibh of the Hamburg
cell. Binalshibh, a citizen of Yemen, is wanted for allegedly aiding the
hijackers; he intended to participate in the attacks, authorities said,
but could not get a U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, Binalshibh flew from Germany to Madrid and spent two days
at a private residence there, according to investigators. During his
stay, someone called the hijackers in the United States from a pay phone
at a bar about a block from a downtown mosque, where accused members of
the Madrid cell were active, according to the Spanish law enforcement
official. Instead of using the return portion of his ticket to Germany,
Binalshibh left Spain for another country, probably Pakistan, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence in the Sept. 11 plot and other parts of Al Qaeda's puzzle
will be tested in court systems whose safeguards and liberties have
been--and will continue to be--exploited by extremists bent on destroying
Western democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating because now everyone has realized how dangerous this
activity is," Dambruoso said. "Now there's a general will to create a
common European judicial space so our work against terrorism is easier
and more unified. We are working towards those goals, but it will take
years to reach them."</TE>

<DL>SANTO DOMINGO, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Death came to Santo Domingo as its people celebrated life.</LD>
<LD>   Villagers were gathering for a street fair that bright December
morning, but a battle had broken out between the Colombian army and
leftist rebels in the nearby jungle.</LD>
<LD>   The villagers heard a military helicopter roar overhead. Seconds
later, an explosion ripped through this collection of wood huts on the
edge of Colombia's northeastern plain.</LD>
<TE>   Two children were cut down as their grandmother made them breakfast. A
father was eviscerated as his sons watched. A nursing mother was nearly
decapitated, her 3-month-old baby still in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 11 adults and seven children died in Santo Domingo on Dec. 13,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the attack seems to be another bit of homemade carnage
in Colombia's long, bloody guerrilla war, notable, perhaps, only for the
number of children who died.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Colombian military court records, the U.S. government
helped initiate military operations around Santo Domingo that day, and
two private American companies helped plan and support them.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that the U.S. government or American companies
knew that their aid might lead to the destruction of a village. But more
than three years later, no one has been held accountable for the deaths.
Civilian prosecutors accuse a Colombian air force helicopter crew of
dropping a U.S.-made cluster bomb while supporting the troops engaged in
battle. The military claims that guerrillas accidentally detonated a car
bomb in the town.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is bogged down in jurisdictional disputes. U.S.
pledges to help have languished.</TE>
<TE>   An examination of the incident by the Los Angeles Times reveals an
alarming picture of the Colombian conflict just as the U.S. prepares to
become more deeply involved.</TE>
<TE>   According to a videotape admitted as evidence in a closed military
tribunal, Colombian court documents and interviews with more than three
dozen military officers, witnesses and experts:</TE>
<TE>   * The events leading to the battle outside Santo Domingo and the
explosion began when a U.S. government surveillance plane detected an
aircraft allegedly carrying weapons for the guerrillas. In doing so, the
plane may have violated rules that restrict American activities in
Colombia to counter-narcotic operations.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum, which runs an oil complex 30
miles north of Santo Domingo, provided crucial assistance to the
operation. It supplied, directly or through contractors, troop
transportation, planning facilities and fuel to Colombian military
aircraft, including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   * AirScan Inc., a private U.S. company owned by former Air Force
commandos, helped plan and provided surveillance for the attack around
Santo Domingo using a high-tech monitoring plane. The U.S. Coast Guard is
investigating whether the plane was flown by a U.S. military pilot on
active duty. Company employees even suggested targets to the Colombian
helicopter crew that dropped the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   * In a violation of U.S. guidelines, the U.S. military later provided
training to the pilot accused of dropping the bomb, even after a
Colombian prosecutor had charged him with aggravated homicide and causing
personal injury in the Santo Domingo operation.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan officials deny involvement in the incident, saying their plane
was used only to survey Occidental's oil pipeline, and the company is not
accused of any illegal activity. Occidental officials say they routinely
supply nonlethal equipment for military operations in northeastern
Colombia but they could neither confirm nor deny their role on the day of
the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the incident touches on many of the issues that make
Colombia's war so problematic for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, U.S. involvement was supposed to be black and white: The
U.S. government provided military training and aid to wipe out the vast
fields of coca plants and poppy flowers that produce the majority of
illegal drugs on America's streets.</TE>
<TE>   But leftist rebels have increasingly financed their war with drug
profits, meaning that operations against guerrillas and against narcotics
often blend seamlessly. And since the breakdown of Colombia's peace
process in February, rebels have unleashed a campaign against the
country's infrastructure, including the pipeline that moves Occidental's
oil, bringing private industry ever closer to the war.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military brigade that oversaw the operations around
Santo Domingo is in line to receive enhanced training and equipment as
part of the Bush administration's $98-million proposal to help protect
oil facilities in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Events in Santo Domingo also reveal a contradiction in U.S. attitudes.
Even as Washington insists that Colombia vigorously pursue human rights
abuses, it has shown little interest in investigating the possible role
of American citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) sponsored amendments to the last two U.S
aid packages to Colombia that require suspension of aid to any military
unit suspected of human rights violations, unless the government is
actively pursuing a case against the accused.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years have passed, and we have yet to see anyone prosecuted for
the needless deaths of 18 people or the flagrant attempts by Colombian
military officers to cover up the crime," said Leahy, now the chairman of
the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   This is perhaps what is most important to the people of Santo Domingo.
While the war raged around them for years, the town's 200 people mostly
avoided the violence, until Dec. 13, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are surrounded by it. Early this year, a resident who had
been a key witness against the Colombian military in the case was
assassinated by suspected right-wing paramilitary fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can fix what happened," said Margarita Tilano, a 44-year-old
grandmother whose daughter and two grandchildren died in the 1998 attack.
"We want justice, nothing else."</TE>
<TE>The United States</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 7, 1998, according to military court records obtained by The
Times, Colombian army intelligence intercepted a scratchy radio
conversation between two commanders of the country's largest rebel army,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian army officers have said that they interpreted the coded
conversation to mean that the FARC high command was sending a small plane
loaded with weapons to land near Santo Domingo. In return for the
weapons, the local rebel commander would hand over 2,200 pounds of
cocaine that his men had recently seized from drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   What made the rebel operation particularly important to the Colombian
military was that German Briceno, a top local FARC commander, was
suspected of overseeing it.</TE>
<TE>   Briceno, better known as Grannobles, is the brother of the FARC's
military commander and a vicious, if not adept, leader. Two months after
the Santo Domingo incident, he is believed to have ordered the kidnapping
and killing of three Americans who were working to protect the rights of
indigenous people.</TE>
<TE>   The reported involvement of drugs allowed the Colombian military to
call for help from U.S. Customs P-3 Orion surveillance planes that
normally track clandestine drug flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, at 2:45 p.m., according to court records, a P-3 packed
with high-tech monitoring equipment detected a Cessna 206 heading toward
Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna landed north of the village. Men in civilian clothes
swarmed the plane and began unloading boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Within five minutes, the plane was airborne again. The Colombian
military pounced. A company of soldiers from the 18th Brigade was sent to
pursue Grannobles on the ground, while the air force intercepted the
Cessna and forced it to land.</TE>
<TE>   No drugs were found on the plane--not even after prosecutors performed
tests able to detect microscopic traces of cocaine. An internal Colombian
air force control tower log recorded the mission as an attempt to block
an "arms delivery"--there was no mention of narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it is unclear whether drugs were ever part of the rebels'
operation, current and former U.S. Embassy officials said the United
States was right to aid the mission despite the restrictions limiting
U.S. aid to counter-narcotics operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna was flying from a known drug zone, they said, and they
believe that no drugs were loaded onto the Cessna because the pilot
realized he was being watched.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Grannobles on the ground fared even worse. Helicopters
transporting the 70 soldiers of Dragon Company took heavy fire as they
landed. Then, as the troops fought to cross a bridge about 700 yards
north of Santo Domingo, one soldier was killed and four were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard [the commander] on the radio. He was desperate. He said,
'They're killing us,' " Lt. Guillermo Olaya, the air force liaison with
the army, said in military court testimony. "Hour after hour, the combat
grew more intense."</TE>
<TE>Oxy and AirScan</TE>
<TE>   At 9 a.m. the next day, worried air force and army commanders gathered
in a tiny room to plan an operation to rescue Dragon Company, according
to military court testimony and interviews with pilots involved in the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The location of the meeting was Occidental Petroleum's Cano Limon oil
complex about 30 miles north of Santo Domingo. Occidental has long been
active in Colombia. In 1983, it discovered a billion-barrel oil field. To
develop the site, Occidental and a Spanish oil company with a minority
interest entered into a 50-50 partnership with Colombia's state oil
company, Ecopetrol.</TE>
<TE>   But in discovering oil, Oxy walked into the middle of Colombia's
decades-old internal conflict with two guerrilla armies, the FARC and a
smaller group called the National Liberation Army.</TE>
<TE>   Both made Oxy, its workers and the oil pipeline a target. There have
been more than 900 attacks against the pipeline since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   To stop the attacks, Oxy decided to undertake the unusual mission of
bolstering a foreign military force by strengthening the under-equipped
and underfunded local army unit, the 18th Brigade, current and former Oxy
officials said. In effect, Oxy became the unit's quartermaster.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy or its contractors provided troop transport helicopters, fuel,
uniforms, cars and motorcycles. It even paid for leave tickets and better
rations to improve morale, according to the Oxy officials and local
military commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The company also provided cash to the military, about $150,000 a year,
according to one rough estimate by a top Oxy official. Both the in-kind
and cash aid, a total of about $750,000 a year, was strictly limited to
logistical support. Oxy insisted that its help not be used for arms.</TE>
<TE>   But as a result, the army had more money available to combat the
leftist guerrillas throughout Arauca state, where Santo Domingo is
located, as well as improve security along the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th Brigade has been accused of abuses, including cooperation
with violent paramilitary groups in the kidnapping and murder of
suspected guerrilla sympathizers. The recent killing of Angel Riveros,
who was a key witness for the prosecutors in the Santo Domingo attacks,
is a case in point. Local human rights groups say the killers passed
through a military roadblock maintained by the 18th Brigade before the
Jan. 24 shooting. Brigade officials deny responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had serious problems with the military in Arauca in terms of
human rights and in the way the military deals with paramilitaries," said
Robin Kirk, a Colombia expert for Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy has given classes to military officers on human rights and
required its workers to sign contracts promising to respect international
norms. But it hasn't implemented other steps, such as insisting on an
independent review of the human rights record of the military units they
are supporting.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy officials say they have little control over such matters. They say
relying on the military is better than having their own armed security
service.</TE>
<TE>   "We have military protection because we must have it, because we have
no alternative," said Guimer Dominguez, the president of Oxy's Colombia
operations. "Unfortunately the armed forces are short in some areas, and
in this sense, we give them nonlethal support."</TE>
<TE>   Part of this support, according to interviews and court testimony, was
"Room G" at Oxy's Cano Limon complex, where the military commanders
gathered on the morning of Dec. 13, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked in a corner of the complex, the room was surrounded by sandbags
and equipped with TV monitors and computers. Room G, according to those
present, served as the planning center for the operation in Santo
Domingo, thanks, in part, to a second U.S. company, an obscure and
low-profile firm called AirScan.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Rockledge, Fla., AirScan came to Colombia in 1997 as a
contractor for Oxy, according to Oxy officials. One of the Colombian
army's deficiencies was that it simply couldn't find the highly mobile
guerrillas. AirScan owned a fleet of small planes equipped with high-tech
monitoring devices, such as infrared cameras, that could track guerrilla
activity along the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The company had a handful of contracts for aerial surveillance and
monitoring, some of them with U.S. Air Force bases such as Vandenberg and
Cape Canaveral.</TE>
<TE>   The founders of AirScan, Walter Holloway and John W. Mansur, both have
backgrounds as air commandos, the Air Force version of Special Forces.
Mansur, 61, the company's chief executive, retired from the Air Force in
1987 as a highly decorated colonel, having served as a military assistant
to the secretary of the Air Force and as the commander of the Air Force's
Eastern Space and Missile Center at Patrick Air Force Base, near
AirScan's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Mansur impressed Oxy officials.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan pilots "were not gung-ho jocks. They were very
professional," said a former Oxy official. "They were not mercenaries in
the classic sense."</TE>
<TE>The Switch-Over</TE>
<TE>   The reconnaissance flights didn't stop the guerrillas, who recognized
that being spotted by AirScan didn't mean the army was on its way. They
actually began waving at the AirScan pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials began pressuring Oxy to use AirScan to
conduct intelligence patrols far away from the pipeline, according to
former Oxy and State Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the middle of 1997, about six months after Oxy's contract with
AirScan began, one top Oxy official approached the U.S. Embassy to ask
what sort of limits should be put on providing intelligence to the
Colombian military. The response was simple: Stick to the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, you're getting into a dirty area, it's very
dangerous,' " one former State Department official recalled. " 'If you do
flights like mercenaries, then you'll be responsible.' "</TE>
<TE>   To avoid trouble, Oxy officials say, they ended their direct
involvement with AirScan by transferring its contract. Instead of
Occidental, AirScan ended up having a contract with the Colombian air
force that was paid for by Ecopetrol, Oxy's Colombian partner in the
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, AirScan said it patrolled only the pipeline during the
time of the bombing in Santo Domingo, 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of AirScan activity was simply pipeline surveillance,"
Mansur wrote in a brief statement to The Times. "This was the only
activity in which AirScan crews or aircraft were engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots involved in operations around Santo Domingo disputed that
account, testifying that AirScan played a far larger role that day.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, pilots also said that AirScan flew missions all over
Arauca, which at 9,000 square miles is about the size of New Hampshire.
It frequently provided intelligence on guerrilla patrols and helped pick
out targets, they said, and even celebrated kills when an air force pilot
successfully blew up a guerrilla squad.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say, 'Good job, you got him,' " said one of the Colombian
military helicopter's crew members who is accused in the Santo Domingo
bombing. In an interview, he said he was on dozens of missions with
American pilots working for AirScan, including one who identified himself
as a Navy SEAL.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan's role became so vital that military forces insisted on a
patrol before almost every battle, according to the crew member. Once, a
low-flying AirScan pilot took ground fire and had to have his fuel tank
replaced when he returned to base.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were confrontations between the army and guerrillas, they
were always there," the crew member said, referring to AirScan. "They
were our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "They frequently strayed from their missions to help us in operations
against the guerrillas," said another of the accused crew members. "The
plane would go and check and verify [guerrilla] patrols and say, 'Hey,
there are people here.' "</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly what two AirScan crew members did during the Santo
Domingo operation, according to Colombian pilots involved in the
exercise.</TE>
<TE>The Briefing</TE>
<TE>   The briefing at Oxy's Cano Limon oil complex on the morning of Dec.
13, 1998, was convened so that Colombian military officials from the 18th
Brigade and the air force could figure out how to save Dragon Company,
which had been pinned down since the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the information supplied at the briefing came from AirScan
employees Joe Orta and Charlie Denny, who had been flying since 6:33 a.m.
with Colombian air force Capt. Cesar Gomez, according to testimony and
interviews with those present, as well as a flight log obtained by The
Times from military court files.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez was on the AirScan plane to guarantee a Colombian military
presence on a mission flown by Americans. He was also the military's
designated liaison with Oxy, Gomez testified in court.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was supposed to be in control, he testified that he only
sat in the back of the plane and watched the developing operation on a
small monitor.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan plane, which was flying with Colombian air force markings,
"provided day and night aerial surveillance of [Santo Domingo] and
adjacent villages in support of the counter-guerrilla forces," Orta wrote
in his summary of the Dec. 13 flight.</TE>
<TE>   Orta and Denny used video of the area around Santo Domingo that they
had made earlier in the morning to show nests of guerrilla soldiers to
the Colombian military officers present, according to those who attended
the briefing.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed out guerrillas who they said could be seen in the town,
mingling with civilians, according to one of the accused crew members
present at the briefing.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan crew never indicated that guerrillas had taken up
positions in the town, but they did suggest attacking a concentration of
guerrillas in a stand of jungle a few hundred meters away, according to
military court testimony and interviews with several pilots present.</TE>
<TE>   After the briefing, Gen. Luis Barbosa, the local army commander,
decided to request air support for a company of troops to land and
reinforce Dragon Company.</TE>
<TE>   "The [AirScan pilots] helped us throughout the operation, taking a
quantity of videos where you could see the town, the movement of the
guerrillas and the movements of the troops," said Olaya, the airforce
liaison with the army.</TE>
<TE>   Orta's identity is something of a puzzle. Colombian Foreign Ministry
records show that a man named Barbaro Jose Orta was given a six-month
temporary visa to work in Colombia for AirScan beginning in February
1998. There is no indication that his visa was renewed before December
1998.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military files also show that in 1998, a man named Barbaro Jose
Orta was an active-duty member of the U.S. Coast Guard's Search and
Rescue team in Miami, assigned to coordinate rescue missions.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph of Orta in those files was picked out of a stack of
photographs by two Colombian military pilots involved in the operation as
the man who called himself "Joe" Orta. And one of Barbaro Jose Orta's
family members, who spoke briefly with The Times, confirmed that Barbaro
Orta usually goes by the name "Joe."</TE>
<TE>   The military records also show that Barbaro Orta was on authorized
leave between Dec. 9 and Dec. 19, 1998. But there is no indication that
he sought permission to work a second job or that he asked permission to
go abroad, both of which were required at the time for active-duty
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Though Barbaro Orta left the service in November 2000, Coast Guard
officials have opened an inquiry into whether Orta was the AirScan pilot,
after being contacted by The Times. Barbaro Orta, still in U.S. military
service as a member of the Puerto Rican Air National Guard, did not
respond to numerous attempts to contact him through his military postings
or through his family.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Barbaro Orta] was on board the aircraft, it was without the
knowledge or authorization of the U.S. Mission in Colombia," said an
embassy official in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   As for the other American AirScan crewman, neither the Foreign
Ministry nor the Colombian customs agency has a record of anyone named
Charlie Denny entering Colombia.</TE>
<TE>The Pilot</TE>
<TE>   Once Colombian military commanders gave the go-ahead, Lt. Cesar Romero
and his crew began preparing their Huey helicopter for combat.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Romero, co-pilot Johan Jimenez and technician Hector
Hernandez flew transport routes, moving food and troops between battles.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, their Huey was mounted with a World War II-era AN-M41
cluster bomb, given to the Colombian military by the United States in the
1980s, according to Colombian air force officials. Romero, who has no
blemishes on his service record, had twice before dropped such devices.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, comprising six bomblets, is mounted on a metal rack. Each
bomblet weighs 20 pounds and is packed with 2.7 pounds of explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The rack attaches to the side of the helicopter. When the target is in
sight, a wire is pulled and the bomb falls out. The individual bomblets
separate, hit the ground, and bounce about an inch and a half high. Then
they explode, sending chunks of metal at 2,800 feet per second in all
directions from a steel coil wrapped around the charge.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, last used by the U.S. in Vietnam, has an effective diameter
of about 30 yards, meaning anybody within 15 yards of it is likely to be
killed.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:30 a.m., Romero's Huey and four other helicopters, including a
Russian-made MI-17 that military officials say was provided by Oxy
through a contractor--took off for Santo Domingo from Cano Limon. They
carried relief troops, the cluster bomb, Brazilian-made Skyfire rockets
and heavy machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   According to pilots present at the scene and military court records,
they were joined on site by the AirScan plane, which also took off from
Oxy's oil complex and was filming the entire operation. Colombian
military pilots said in court testimony that throughout the day, the
plane and helicopters returned to Cano Limon to refuel and review new
mission plans in Room G.</TE>
<TE>   There is a dispute over the targeting of the cluster bomb. Some say
Romero was supposed to consult with ground troops before dropping it. But
Romero said he talked only with the AirScan pilots and the pilot of an
armed H500 Hughes helicopter also at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "The coordinates were made directly with the armed helicopters that
were in the area and the Skymaster plane that was crewed by American
pilots," Romero told a military judge last year. "The troops were
communicating directly with the armed helicopters and the Skymaster."</TE>
<TE>   A Colombian UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter was also airborne. It had been
donated by the U.S. primarily for use in anti-drug missions. It began
firing rockets into the jungle. The Huey pilots have testified that they
heard the AirScan pilots warn the Black Hawk pilot, "Careful, you're
shooting at civilians!"</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Romero said he focused on his target: a thick stand of
jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters north of Santo Domingo, 200 meters west of
the road where the Cessna had landed the afternoon before.</TE>
<TE>   The Huey circled the area twice to be sure of the target, then Romero
started the countdown: "Three, two, one, now!" he shouted. Hernandez
pulled a steel cable and the bomb fell away.</TE>
<TE>The Bomb</TE>
<TE>   Neither Romero nor his co-pilot can recall seeing the bomb hit. The
pilots have been consistent with this account for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem: There is no stand of jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters
north of Santo Domingo, and 200 meters west of the road where the Cessna
landed. There is only open field.</TE>
<TE>   Santo Domingo is a nothing place, some three dozen wooden shacks hard
against a curve in a two-lane highway. There is no electricity. No
phones. No running water. Just big sky, open savanna and thick jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people raise cattle or grow corn. Others have small
stores. The Colombian government has no permanent presence, so FARC
guerrillas move openly through town. Unlike other parts of Colombia,
drugs are not a big part of the economy, though coca is grown and cocaine
is produced in the region. The road where the Cessna touched down is one
of the primary clandestine landing strips.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, in December, when the crops are harvested and Christmas
is coming, the town holds a two-day street fair to raise money for civic
projects. In 1998, the aim was to put a concrete floor in the two-room
schoolhouse and add doors.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, family and friends from hamlets throughout the region
began arriving to play in a soccer tournament, watch a beauty contest and
eat barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   But in the afternoon, they began to hear gunfire, then explosions,
coming nearer. Aircraft flew overhead throughout the night, shooting into
the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Some people decided to stay, fearful they would be caught in the
cross-fire. Others left. Still others tried to leave but turned back
because of their own fear, or because soldiers stopped them, warning that
it was too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Dec. 13, the town's community leader and bus driver,
Wilson Garcia, then 44, decided to go to the nearest town that had a
phone, about 15 miles away, to call the Red Cross for help. Before he
left, he told townspeople to wave white rags to show the aircraft above
that they were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stay calm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So people remained. There was Nancy Castillo, who'd given birth to a
baby girl just three months before. Salomon Neite, 58, a farmer who was
about to retire and hand over his land to his two sons. Luis Martinez,
25, a soccer fanatic with a wife and child. Edilma Pacheco, 27, was
working at the local store as a clerk. Giovanny Hernandez, 16, had come
from a nearby town for the fair.</TE>
<TE>   When the aircraft appeared about 9:30 a.m., people followed Garcia's
advice. They began waving white rags above their heads. Some even lay
down on the pavement, hoping to better demonstrate their neutrality.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 a.m., Garcia's daughter Alba, then 16, and many of her
friends were in the street near a broken-down red truck, a 1955 Chevrolet
parked across from the town's drugstore.</TE>
<TE>   They watched as a helicopter came into view, then turned to pass over
Santo Domingo from south to north. As it drew overhead, Alba looked up
and saw about four dark objects falling.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," she said to a friend. "They're throwing rolls of paper at us."</TE>
<TE>   Then, darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Santo Domingo had just been bombed.</TE>
<TE>   A tape of the operation viewed by The Times--identified by those
involved as a tape made by AirScan--does not capture this moment. The
camera is focused on a field less than half a mile away where relief
troops were landing. But the survivors have vivid, slow-motion memories
of what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The front of the red truck was smashed in by a direct hit, its right
front fender falling to the ground. Smoke filled the air. A woman
screamed, "They killed my children!" People began fleeing the town on
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Alba woke to find herself bathed in blood, her arm nearly severed.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, at the drugstore, Maria Panqueva was knocked flat
by a piece of steel that hit her leg. The woman standing next to her,
Nancy Castillo, was killed while nursing her 3-month-old, the top half of
her head nearly sliced off. The baby was found lying next to her,
screaming.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearby house, Margarita Tilano was stunned by the noise. Then she
heard screams. Her daughter, Katherine Cardenas, 7, and granddaughter,
Edna Bello, 5, were dead. Her grandson, Jaime, 4, was wounded and would
die on the way to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from the blast, Amalio Neite, 22, was blown six feet
from where he had been standing. He turned to see his brother holding his
father, Salomon, writhing on the ground, a hand over his abdomen to keep
in his intestines.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen people died and more than 25 were wounded, some of them
crippled for life. Today, Alba cannot move her left arm above her head.
Its scars resemble the crude stitching on a rag doll.</TE>
<TE>   At the eastern edge of Santo Domingo, Olimpo Cardenas was about 150
yards away with his back to the explosion. When it occurred, he turned
around to see dead and wounded everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas jumped on a motorcycle and rode out of town to the home of a
friend who owned a Ford flatbed truck. The two men drove back slowly. At
10:20 a.m. they pulled up in front of the drugstore, where many of the
dead and wounded had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   They loaded up about seven of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   As they left town, they saw another helicopter hovering above them.
About 200 meters, or about 219 yards, away from town, they heard a burst
of gunfire, and saw earth and concrete flinging up next to them. Then the
helicopter flew off.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who had gotten out of the truck, stayed until he was sure
everyone had left town. Then he walked out on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the last one out," he said. "The place was a ghost town."</TE>
<TE>The Investigation</TE>
<TE>   The dead and wounded began arriving at hospitals in the afternoon.
Most told a similar story: At 10 a.m., a military helicopter had dropped
a bomb on Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   But separate investigations by the Colombian air force and army
concluded that the carnage was not the military's fault. They said that
guerrillas had installed a car bomb inside the red truck, the epicenter
of the damage. They said the plan was to lure Dragon Company into Santo
Domingo, then detonate the bomb. But after troops arrived to reinforce
Dragon Company and save the unit, the bomb went off by mistake, killing
the villagers.</TE>
<TE>   The military said that conclusion was based on both testimony and
forensic proof--both of which were later called into question.</TE>
<TE>   Fragments from the town tested positive for chemicals commonly found
in homemade explosive materials, according to court records. Two FARC
deserters who gave themselves up after the bombing blamed the incident on
their former comrades. Another witness, a local man who reported seeing
the FARC at work on the truck, recently recanted, saying a military
officer from the 18th Brigade had paid him to lie.</TE>
<TE>   Air force officials also said a cluster bomb would have destroyed
structures or left large craters, a puzzling claim since AN-M41s have a
relatively small charge designed to kill people, not destroy buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, and it's only a suspicion . . . that the guerrillas put the
bomb there," Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco, the head of the Colombian air
force, said in an interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   Olaya, the air force's local link to the army, refused to turn over
documents to civilian federal prosecutors when they arrived Dec. 17,
according to military court records.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco continued to insist that no bombs had been used in the
operation, even after air force officials had sent notice to headquarters
about the use of the cluster bomb. Velasco later explained that the air
force classifies cluster bombs as low-power explosives, not as bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The military's insistence that the combat and the air force bombing
occurred far from town is also in question.</TE>
<TE>   Using a satellite-guided measuring device accurate to within a few
meters, The Times traveled to Santo Domingo several times to measure
distances mentioned in the military's accounts of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The military has said in interviews and military court testimony that
the fighting began where the Cessna had landed, about 6 kilometers, or a
little more than 3.5 miles, from Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The actual distance between Santo Domingo and the landing site, based
on the coordinates supplied by the military to the court, is 3
kilometers, according to a hand-held Global Positioning System that can
measure distances between geographic coordinates.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots indicated on a map that they dropped their bomb in a stand
of jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters from Santo Domingo, 200 meters west of
the road. But that stand of jungle is at maximum 650 meters away.</TE>
<TE>   As to the testimony of more than 30 survivors, military officials said
they were probably lying--either out of fear or sympathy for the
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials weren't the only ones clouding the story.</TE>
<TE>   Days after the bombing, Leahy fired off a letter from his Senate
office demanding information. Then-Ambassador Curtis Kamman responded
with a detailed note that only further confused matters.</TE>
<TE>   Kamman made no mention of the involvement of the U.S. P-3 plane on the
day before the incident, though he said Colombian air force planes had
done surveillance of the Cessna that landed outside Santo Domingo,
initiating the operation.</TE>
<TE>   He also told Leahy that embassy officials had viewed a five-hour tape
of the incident, which showed that Santo Domingo had remained "intact" at
the time people in the town reported being bombed. The tape "directly
refut[ed]" their claims, he said, and supported the military's story of a
guerrilla car bomb that had exploded at another time.</TE>
<TE>   Kamman said in an interview that he did not know the origin of the
tape and had "no information" on AirScan's involvement in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   But if the tape was the same one viewed by The Times--and there is no
evidence that any other aircraft filmed the operation--it is unclear how
embassy officials missed the wreckage of the red truck and the loading of
bodies on the truck. Both are visible on the tape.</TE>
<TE>The Breakthrough</TE>
<TE>   By June 1999, almost all the investigations were over or dormant. The
general conclusion: The guerrillas and the people of Santo Domingo had
attempted to pull a fast one, and they had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, civilian investigators were not convinced. The first forensic
examinations of Santo Domingo had been done in the days after the
bombing, when combat was still going on. Two teams of experts had been
shot at. No team spent more than 90 minutes in the town.</TE>
<TE>   So the investigators--a federal prosecutor and the procuraduria, a
sort of inspector general--requested a more thorough look. Teams went
back to Santo Domingo in June 1999 and February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In June, they determined that the red truck had been hit from above by
an explosive device. In February, they compared metal fragments that
remained in the town's wooden buildings to fragments of an exploded
AN-M41. The two sets of metal were similar. They also discovered six
craters in and near the town, corresponding with the six bomblets,
according to military court files.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in perhaps the biggest breakthrough, federal prosecutors dug
back through the evidence to find metal fragments taken from the bodies
of two bombing victims.</TE>
<TE>   They sent these fragments, taken from a 42-year-old woman and a
16-year-old boy, to the FBI via the U.S. Embassy. They also sent some of
the fragments they had found in their February hunt.</TE>
<TE>   On May 1, 2000, the FBI produced its report. The fragments were
"consistent" with a U.S.-made AN-M41. One piece had "NO E BOM" stamped on
the side. The phrase "NOSE BOMB FUZE" is printed on AN-M41 cluster bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI analysis also found that there were no signs that the cluster
bombs had been delivered through an "improvised" delivery system--i.e.,
it had not been modified to be used as a car bomb.</TE>
<TE>   This was enough to convince prosecutors they had a case. They accused
the crew of the Huey of aggravated homicide and aggravated personal
injury, although they left open the question of whether the crew had
bombed the village on purpose or accidentally.</TE>
<TE>   Then, because the act was committed in a military setting, they turned
the case over to the air force to reopen its investigation of the
crew--Romero, Jimenez and Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   But the military made little progress in the investigation. Velasco,
the air force general, told reporters in Colombia that more than $1
million had been spent by unknown parties to manipulate evidence to make
his pilots appear responsible.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a year, fearing that the military was not conducting an
impartial investigation of itself, the civilian prosecutors asked to
regain control. The case has been tied up in jurisdictional wrangling
ever since. The most recent decision places the investigation in the
hands of the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The military was hiding the truth," said one former prosecutor who
was involved with the case. "We knew the investigation wouldn't happen if
it stayed with the military."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers for the men now say they believe that the bomb
fragments were not taken from townspeople, but guerrillas. Under this
theory, the guerrillas were killed after the cluster bomb dropped on them
in the jungle. Their comrades then transported the bodies into Santo
Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that there are no photos of the bodies during the
autopsies, that not much blood was found at the scene and that some of
the bodies arrived nude, perhaps meaning they were stripped to hide their
identity.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been too much international pressure to condemn these men,"
said Ernesto Villamizar, a top Bogota lawyer who represents one of the
pilots. "This is going to be a very long process, and at the end, the
truth will come out that the munitions dropped from this helicopter had
nothing to do with the deaths in Santo Domingo."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials also question whether the fragments analyzed by the
FBI actually came from the explosion in Santo Domingo, citing doubts over
the chain of custody.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI said, yes, this is a fragment, but that doesn't mean
anything," Velasco said. "There isn't any proof that these fragments were
really from there."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the charges against him, Romero has advanced in rank to
captain. Jimenez believes that he was denied promotion because of the
investigation. Nonetheless, both men are now regularly flying combat
missions with the Colombian air force.</TE>
<TE>   Romero continued to receive training in the U.S., despite strict
regulations that prevent instruction when there is even the suspicion of
human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy said Romero received a refresher flight-simulation
course at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, in September
2000--three months after the prosecutor's May ruling ordering an
investigation against him for possibly killing 18 civilians, and only one
month after the military reopened its investigation into the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials said they were unaware of the investigations at the
time of Romero's training. No formal system exists to exchange data
between the embassy and the prosecutor's office on suspected human rights
violators, and embassy officials say there are no plans to implement one.</TE>
<TE>An Error?</TE>
<TE>   For all the investigation that has been done, one central question
remains: If the Colombian air force did drop a cluster bomb on Santo
Domingo, was it deliberate or a mistake?</TE>
<TE>   Those who believe the bombing was a war crime point out that
visibility was perfect on Dec. 13, 1998, that the townspeople had clearly
signaled they were civilians, and that at least two helicopter pilots
testified they had seen them.</TE>
<TE>   So even if the pilots believed there were guerrillas in town, they had
to have known that innocent people would be killed if a bomb was dropped.
Finally, it is difficult to make such a mistake with an AN-M41, a simple
gravity bomb. To have hit Santo Domingo, the bomb had to have been
launched very close to it.</TE>
<TE>   "The military has never said it was an error. If it was a mistake, why
aren't they just admitting it?" said one lawyer monitoring the case who
did not want to be identified because of its sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the same facts also argue for the possibility of error.
Romero has always said he dropped the bomb 1,000 to 1,200 meters from the
town. Two other pilots, however, said they believed the bomb was dropped
between 500 and 600 meters from town.</TE>
<TE>   If Romero's helicopter was at the height and speed he said it was, the
bomb would have traveled about 500 meters from where he launched it,
according to an analysis done by the Federation of American Scientists,
using testimony from the case. That means that if Romero was heading in
the direction of the town, something he denies, the bombs easily could
have landed in Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   If it was an error, some believe, the Colombian military is still
culpable.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pretty fine line between intent and tragic accident," said
David Stahl, a Chicago attorney who is on the advisory board of the
Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University. "I
think what happened is the Colombian armed forces put themselves in a
situation where a tragic accident was all but certain to happen."</TE>
<TE>   There are still crucial details that could clear up the mystery. For
instance, the Huey pilots said they never flew over Santo Domingo. Romero
said the helicopter was north of the village and flying west. The
co-pilot said they dropped the bomb while heading northwest.</TE>
<TE>   But the pattern of the impacts found by civilian investigators, and
the recollections of survivors, contradicts that testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors say the helicopter that passed over the village just before
the explosion was traveling from south to north. The analysis by the
American scientists indicates the helicopter that dropped the bomb most
likely passed over the town, and was probably headed either northeast or
southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "The key discrepancy is the direction. You can't match [the pilots'
testimony about their direction] with the direction of the bomb," said
Michael Levi, a physicist who did the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans who worked for AirScan might be able to resolve the
confusion. But two lawyers involved with the case said AirScan has told
the military court that the men no longer work for the company and that
it has no information on their whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy officials, meanwhile, said they have never investigated what role
the company and its facilities might have played. Nonetheless, they
rejected any ties to the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "We're truly sorry about what happened--though we don't know the
details--but in no way can we feel that we have any responsibility,"
Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights advocates say the U.S. government is duty-bound to
conduct its own investigation into the role played by Orta and Denny.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the U.S. has not done that. After being asked by the
procuraduria's office, embassy officials in Bogota checked their records
and found that one of the men had registered his U.S. home address with
the embassy during a stay in Colombia. They refused to turn over that
information to Colombian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials said they are prevented by the Privacy Act from
releasing any information. But, they said, if they receive a request from
the prosecutor's office, which currently does not have jurisdiction over
the case, they might be able to help by working through existing
treaties.</TE>
<TE>   At least one State Department official has expressed reluctance to
pursue the U.S. pilots. "Our job is to protect Americans, not investigate
Americans," one human rights group quoted the official as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the embassy made much progress with promises it has made to
have a copy of the tape its diplomats viewed independently analyzed. In
1998, Kamman said the tape he had seen would be reviewed for further
analysis. Current Ambassador Anne W. Patterson made that same promise in
a letter to Leahy in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups find it strange that the United States, which has
urged Colombia for years to investigate possible human rights violations,
is not doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. government is serious about promoting human rights, we
think they have the legal duty to seriously investigate human rights
violations," Stahl said. "So far, we've been disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern's human rights center staged a mock trial of the Santo
Domingo incident in 2000. They found the Colombian government responsible
for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>Conclusion</TE>
<TE>   For most of the three years since the bombing, the people of Santo
Domingo were seen as liars, leftist sympathizers or guerrillas. It was
only in recent years that some government officials came to believe them.</TE>
<TE>   The tape proved to be an asset for them. The times and events
recounted by the townspeople--who never saw the tape until recently and
could not have known what it contained--are consistent with what the tape
shows. The tape does show people with white material above their heads or
in white clothing wandering the streets during the morning. The red truck
does suffer damage between 9:45 and 10:10 a.m. And people can be seen
loading what appear to be bodies onto a truck about 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are inconsistencies among the more than two dozen
witnesses. Some say the bomb that struck Santo Domingo left a trail of
smoke--an accurate description of the Skyfire rockets that other
helicopters were firing at the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   The tape does not corroborate the account of machine-gun bursts from a
helicopter as the injured fled town in the flatbed truck. Though there
are small holes in the road where the people said the helicopter fired at
them, the video does not show the truck driver swerving, nor dirt or
concrete being kicked up.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the town held a ceremony to commemorate the third
anniversary. There was a small parade, and one of the judges of the
informal tribunal at Northwestern University flew in from Chicago.
Victims and human rights workers gave speeches in the main square of
Tame, the biggest nearby town.</TE>
<TE>   Some families have split over the stress of lost children, shattered
lives and the fight for recognition. Margarita Tilano and Olimpo Cardenas
separated, for example, and now live in different towns.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Castillo's husband left soon after her death, and her baby girl,
now 3, is being cared for by relatives. Alba Garcia lives with her
grandmother in a nearby town.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those who remain in Santo Domingo dismiss the investigations.
A civil suit is inching along, filed by 24 of the families. The average
claim seeks damages of $5,000. The biggest is for $43,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We want there to be justice, for sure," said Maria Panqueva, the
drugstore owner. "But we have lost the most beautiful thing we had: the
trust in what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Still others are worried about the future. For three years now, the
people of Santo Domingo have challenged the Colombian military.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of defiance may be enough to make them targets of Colombia's
violent paramilitary groups, which have recently moved into Arauca,
allegedly with the support of local military officers.</TE>
<TE>   The groups are known for the massacres of civilians they accuse of
being rebel sympathizers. So far, Santo Domingo has not been touched. But
in the surrounding area, more than 60 people have been killed by
paramilitary fighters since August, allegedly including Riveros, the
witness, and a congressional representative.</TE>
<TE>   Those who remain in Santo Domingo worry about what nightmares may
come.</TE>
<TE>   "I have talked and talked and talked and talked. I have talked to
investigators, to the military, to the press, to human rights groups. And
I have told everyone the same thing," said Tilano, who lost a child and
two grandchildren in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to do justice, do your work well," she said, "so there
will be no more massacres of children, so defenseless people won't be
killed, so they don't shoot at us anymore."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Case Enters Crucial Penalty Phase</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine states waging a landmark antitrust battle against Microsoft
Corp. are preparing to venture into territory that has been barely
visible during the past years of legal slogging: the future.</LD>
<LD>   Since the case began four years ago under the leadership of the
Justice Department, it has been focused on the past--whether Microsoft
broke the law as it bullied customers to ensure it kept a stranglehold on
hundreds of millions of desktop computers.</LD>
<LD>   But with the Justice Department's surprise decision in November to
settle its dispute with Microsoft, the nine states that refused to go
along are pushing forward with a far more aggressive strategy in a new
trial that begins Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In this punishment phase of the case, they are seeking to prevent
Microsoft from quashing its competitors not only in the old world of
personal computers but also in the emerging markets of advanced cell
phones, hand-held computers, television set-top boxes and countless
devices yet to be invented.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to protect nascent technologies--the next
Netscape--whatever that might look like," said California Senior
Assistant Atty. Gen. Tom Greene, one of a team of lawyers lent to the
mammoth task by the nine states and the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   The states are facing a difficult assignment, taking on not just
Microsoft but its new ally, the Justice Department. The rules of
engagement, laid down in a mixed ruling by a federal appeals court, are
not entirely in their favor.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who stepped into the
long-running saga last fall, said at a recent hearing that expanding the
case to include technologies outside of personal computers might be
beyond the scope of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The states, however, are undaunted. They have enlisted the help of one
of Washington's most intimidating litigators, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.,
who defended Oliver L. North in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.</TE>
<TE>   And they have corralled some witnesses the Justice Department couldn't
get at the first trial, including one representing Microsoft's primary
victims, the computer makers, who refused to testify earlier for fear of
reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the states intend to use their six weeks in the spotlight to
raise a ruckus.</TE>
<TE>   After years of dense technological debates and circular legal
maneuvers, they hope above all to restore a sense of urgency to a case
that will shape the dynamics of the world's high-tech industries for
years.</TE>
<TE>   The groundwork for the trial was laid last year in a unanimous ruling
by the appeals court, which upheld the verdict that Microsoft had broken
federal antitrust laws to keep its operating system monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   But the court sided with Microsoft in throwing out allegations that it
tried to expand that monopoly into new areas. Most important for
Microsoft, the higher court threw out an order that the company be broken
in two.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court called for a new trial to determine how to take away
Microsoft's ill-gotten gains, foster new competition and ensure the
company does not repeat its misbehavior.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's enemies, including AOL Time Warner Inc., buyer of the
improperly bludgeoned Netscape, and Sun Microsystems Inc., home of the
victimized Java programming language, welcomed the appeals court's
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   But the government case veered in an unforeseen direction when the
Justice Department, run by new Bush appointees, suddenly agreed to settle
its part of the fray. The company's rivals were outraged and the 18
states that had been tagging along in the proceedings reeled in shock.</TE>
<TE>   Widely criticized as a slap on the wrist, the proposed Justice
Department deal would require standard pricing for Windows, forbid
Microsoft to discriminate against computer companies that include other
firms' software, and mandate more disclosure from Microsoft about how
Windows works.</TE>
<TE>   The 18 states split down the middle, with half grudgingly joining the
proposed resolution and half vowing to pursue the case on their own in
the remedies trial.</TE>
<TE>   The nine holdout states, led by California and Iowa, now have a chance
to prove the timidity of the Justice Department's settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The states have called on Kollar-Kotelly to require Microsoft to
disclose far more about the inner workings of its software, including
details about the company's major Internet commerce initiative, known as
.Net. That's designed to make sure that the company doesn't have too much
of an edge as it competes in the emerging market for Web services.</TE>
<TE>   More dramatically, the states want Microsoft to release the source
code for the Internet Explorer Web browser, essentially making it a free
part of the technological landscape. They want Microsoft to auction the
rights to develop versions of the Office productivity suite for Linux and
other operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   And they want Microsoft to produce a "modular" version of Windows, so
that computer makers can strip out Microsoft's browser, video player or
other pieces, known as middleware, if they choose to. Such unbundling
would be a "loathsome" prospect for Microsoft, which conquered market
after market by wrapping in goodies to use its dominance in one area as a
springboard for the next, California's Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides agree on little except what subjects will provoke the
biggest battles during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The first key debate will be over what exactly the court of appeals
meant when it said Microsoft must be prevented from repeating its
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The court found that Microsoft had broken the law 12 times, such as
when it threatened not to give Apple a Macintosh version of Office if it
shipped Netscape as the default browser on its machine.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is only too happy to promise never to do any of those 12
things again.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, those items took place five or six years ago. The
market is completely different now," said University of Baltimore
antitrust professor Robert Lande. "If Microsoft can limit it to those 12
specific items, it's a huge, huge victory."</TE>
<TE>   That's why the states are pulling in the other direction, trying to
show that the appeals court's ruling must be taken broadly to prevent
Microsoft from using its heft to preserve its current monopoly--even if
the threats come from barely foreseeable directions, such as cellular
phones.</TE>
<TE>   The other big fight will be over whether the states' demands are even
possible to implement.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has said it's unrealistic to
think that Microsoft could come up with multiple Windows versions that
work equally well. And Microsoft attorneys said that breaking Windows
into pieces will just force PC makers to stitch the units back together
or force software writers to make hundreds of versions of their
programs--moves that will ultimately cost consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft argues that the states' remedies will force the company to
stop selling Windows, which sits on more than 90% of the world's personal
computers. The company warned in a pretrial brief that the remedies would
cause "grievous harm . . . to the entire PC industry and to the tens of
millions of consumers around the world."</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to bring in [Microsoft founder Bill] Gates and have him
tell Kollar-Kotelly it will mean the end of Microsoft and the world as we
know it," said Stephen Houck, an attorney for the states. "It's sort of
like nuclear warfare, daring her to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Gates is on Microsoft's witness list, as is Ballmer. The states expect
to see Gates alone, and his testimony could be pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   Gates' evasive, videotaped deposition in the last trial was a
disaster. If he testifies this time, he will face Sullivan's withering
interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   "Brendan Sullivan is an absolute marvel. The issue is whether he will
be able to crack Gates and show some of the less-believable aspects,"
Lande said.</TE>
<TE>   The states are preparing to present an executive from beleaguered
Gateway Inc. and the computer maker's former chief technical officer,
Peter Ashkin.</TE>
<TE>   Ashkin will testify that Microsoft coercion controlled Gateway so
thoroughly that the company couldn't offer consumers real choices about
what came with their machines, according to a pretrial statement.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly's views remain unclear. In tactical matters, she has
leaned in one direction and then the other. If she rules at least
partially against Microsoft, as analysts believe is likely, Microsoft
will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But it may be unable to delay the remedies again while higher courts
conduct their review. That means that as soon as this summer, the world
may finally change.</TE>
<TE>   And that possibility is what keeps Greene and the others in the
states' coalition going.</TE>
<TE>   "Some claims were dismissed, but this is still pretty much the
antitrust case of our generation," Greene said. "It needs to be borne out
in the enforcement."</TE>

<HD>New Rep as Killer Drives Up Demand for Presa Canario</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the mauling trial of two San Francisco lawyers nears its
conclusion, breeders of the type of vicious dogs that killed lacrosse
coach Diane Whipple are caught in a paradox. Business has never been
better--but for all the wrong reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The massive, boulder-headed Presa Canario is gaining in popularity as
a result of the publicity surrounding the gruesome attack. They are the
dog of choice for those who want the most explicit symbol of ferocity the
pet kingdom has to offer, breeders and trainers say.</LD>
<LD>   As with pit bulls, Rottweilers and German shepherds before them, some
say it is a question of whether man's best friend is being bred to be
man's worst enemy.</LD>
<TE>   "They're looking for that designer weapon that could make them look
tougher," said Tracy Hennings, a breeder in Cleveland who is president of
the Dogo Canario Club of America. "They want that tough, macho, big dog
at the end of the chain, lunging and charging."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Whipple case is drawing interest and concern from law
enforcement officials, already alarmed by both the growing number of
aggressive dogs and dog-bite cases.</TE>
<TE>   "A gun doesn't have a mind of its own," said San Francisco Police Sgt.
Bill Herndon, the city's vicious-dog hearing officer. "With a dog, the
owner has to be even more vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, who housed the powerful dogs
that killed neighbor Whipple, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter
and keeping a mischievous dog. Knoller, who was with the dogs when they
attacked Whipple in the hallway outside her apartment in January 2001,
also faces a second-degree murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are set to begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior
Court, where the trial was moved because of a torrent of pretrial
publicity in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>People Are Looking for 'Killer Dogs'</TE>
<TE>   The case has served as a perverse advertisement for Presa Canario
dogs, which were first imported to North America a little more than a
decade ago. Breeders say they are receiving dozens and dozens of calls,
faxes and e-mail messages requesting information about the 120-pound
canine titans. Most, they add, are not exactly from people looking for a
family pet.</TE>
<TE>   "They want those 'killer dogs,' " said Dan Wilson, a Presa Canario
breeder in Canada. "As soon as the dog killed that woman, they wanted
them."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson says Presa Canarios, which are loyal and not overly aggressive
if purebred, are likely to be long stigmatized as a result of the
gruesome San Francisco case.</TE>
<TE>   "These dogs are going to be ruined," said Wilson, owner of Vulcan
Kennels near Toronto. "It's going to catch on with lunatics before it
gets a good base with serious owners."</TE>
<TE>   Presa Canarios, which have large heads, muscular necks and low-slung
bodies, were brought to America from the Canary Islands. Originally, the
dogs were bred from English mastiffs and the now-extinct Bardino Majero.
Long ago, they were used by butchers to hold down cattle and bulls while
they were being slaughtered, and by farmers to pull heavy carts and for
other tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Since their arrival here, the breed has not been recognized by the
American Kennel Club. But some breeders continue to produce only
purebreds, saying they have superior coloring, size and temperament.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, are cross-breeding Presa Canarios with such
aggressive canines as pit bulls and mastiffs. Those dogs, Hennings and
others say, are larger, stronger and more violent.</TE>
<TE>Dogs Can Weigh Up to 140 Pounds</TE>
<TE>   North American breeders are now producing crossbred males that weigh
120 to 130 pounds. In some cases, they weigh as much as 140 pounds and
can cost $1,500 and up. Bane, the dog that attacked Whipple, weighed
about 123 pounds; the second dog that participated in the mauling, Hera,
weighed 112 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Although the killing of Whipple is the only known human death
attributed to Presa Canarios, the case is drawing attention from
authorities concerned about an increasing number of attacks by ferocious
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Health says about 170,000 dog
bites a year are reported in the county, 153,000 of those to children
under the age of 12. Officials believe, however, that the true numbers
are far higher because many bites are never reported.</TE>
<TE>   From 1979 to 1996, there were 300 dog bite fatalities across the
nation, according to a study by the Humane Society of the United States.
Of those, Rottweilers were the most commonly reported breed involved,
followed by pit bull-type dogs. Together, those two breeds were
responsible for 60% of the deadly attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have dogs like pit bulls who are not trained or not well
trained, it's like having a loaded gun," said Jackie David, spokeswoman
for the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services.</TE>
<TE>   In response, authorities are increasingly turning to force themselves.
Last year, the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department shot 53 dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Bane and Hera, who were eventually euthanized, were crossbred Presa
Canarios. Bane's ancestry included mastiffs and Great Danes.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel cared for the dogs after taking them from a farm
where authorities believe they killed livestock and ripped fences.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller testified last week that when she first saw the dogs, they
were chained outdoors. Hera was barking and Bane, she said, was acting
"like a wild animal."</TE>
<TE>   Animal-care experts and others say Presa Canarios require rigorous
training well before they turn 1 year old. In that way, they can be
controlled and their aggressive tendencies reduced.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Bane and Hera, however, several experts said it was
clear they did not receive adequate socialization or training in their
early lives. Rather, authorities allege, the dogs were being raised
illegally as part of a breeding ring of fighting dogs owned by two
inmates in Pelican Bay State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The monsters were created before they ever came into the hands of the
defendants," said Richard H. Polsky, a Los Angeles animal-behavior
specialist who was hired by the defense in the Whipple case but never
testified at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even those who say responsible owners will provide their dog
with proper training and socialization acknowledge that Presa Canarios
are powerful, territorial animals.</TE>
<TE>   On one Presa Canario Web site, photos are shown of the dogs with
infants. But a cautionary note adds: "The Presa Canario is a very tame
dog with the family. . . . However, he may not be a 'baby-sitter dog.' If
the Presa is introduced in a family with children, it is necessary to
teach the children how to treat and respect the dog for preventing any
unfortunate inconveniences."</TE>
<TE>Fear, Excitement Said to Incite Dog's Biting</TE>
<TE>   Another breeders' Web site--BraveHeart Kennel in North Carolina--also
acknowledges the reputation of the breed.</TE>
<TE>   "With the naming of our dogs, we are not implying that our dogs are
overly aggressive, loaded guns, lethal weapons or attack dogs. They are
just firm guard dogs with Brave Hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Breeders warn that Presa Canarios should not be wrestled with nor
allowed to play tug-of-war games in which they grab rags and shake their
heads vigorously. Such activities, in the words of breeder Tracy
Hennings, can "build up the dog's bite drive."</TE>
<TE>   To Hennings and others, Bane and Hera displayed classic aggressive
tendencies. Hera appears to have been a fear biter, Hennings said. "They
take real weak bites with the front of the mouth. They snap, they bite
and they release." Authorities say Hera shredded Whipple's clothes in the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Bane, however, appeared to be motivated by excitement, Hennings and
others said, and was virtually unstoppable. Authorities say Bane bit
Whipple's throat and was responsible for the most serious of the 77 bites
on her body.</TE>
<TE>   Breeders across the country, who are closely monitoring the trial, say
it appears obvious that Knoller did not know how to properly handle her
dogs, a prescription for potential disaster.</TE>
<TE>   When Knoller encountered Whipple in the apartment hallway, she
acknowledged in court, she "could not stop him [Bane] from doing what he
was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Canadian breeder Wilson: "She walked out with 250 pounds of dog
on a leash. The thought of someone walking around like that blows my
mind. It's sickening."</TE>
<TE>   Breeders say well-trained Presa Canarios can serve as loyal guard
dogs. Richard Kelly, who owns Show Stopper Kennels in Middlesex, N.J.,
says many of his calls for the breed come from families in which one
parent is traveling and the spouse needs protection.</TE>
<TE>   Several Presa Canario owners say their dogs are loving and
well-behaved with their children. They would not attack unless someone
was attempting to hurt them, the owners say.</TE>
<TE>   But police, animal regulation officials and others say such large,
aggressive dogs are also often used by gang members, drug dealers and
others to protect them as they undertake their illicit activities.</TE>
<TE>   "This breed," said Polsky, the animal-behavior specialist, "is
increasing in popularity, and undoubtedly, this breed will fall into the
wrong hands."</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BUTLER, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Two doctors say it was all but impossible for Victoria Bell Banks
to have been pregnant in 1999, years after sterilization surgery. But a
third physician reported hearing a fetal heartbeat, and Banks herself
talked of being pregnant--though she later denied it.</LD>
<LD>   Although no newborn was seen and no body found, Banks and two
others--all poor blacks described by a defense lawyer as mentally
retarded--are serving 15-year terms in state prison for killing a baby
and burying the infant in the piney woods of rural Alabama.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with murder charges that carried a possible death sentence, all
three pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a case that has stirred pent-up
emotions, including racial concerns of civil rights groups.</LD>
<TE>   "The overall feeling is that there's a miscarriage of justice in this
case," said the Rev. Gregory Mullen, who travels from Birmingham to serve
as pastor of a Baptist church in Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Roshdy Habib, the first physician to check Banks, found no sign of
pregnancy, noting that she had had surgery on her Fallopian tubes to
prevent it.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it almost impossible to become pregnant," said Habib, who
examined Banks at the Choctaw County Jail. "The evidence is very clear
that she was not pregnant." If she were, he said in a recent interview,
it could have been "by the Holy Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael P. Steinkampf, director of Reproductive Endocrinology and
Fertility at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said after an
examination of Banks last year "it was impossible" that she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   But Sheriff Donald Lolley said he felt certain she was. He saw her two
or three times a week and noted, "I can usually tell by looking at a lady
if she appears to be pregnant or not."</TE>
<TE>   There was an even more compelling reason to think a baby was on the
way--Banks said so herself. A boyfriend, George Bonner, also testified
that she grew large in pregnancy. Authorities allege the baby would have
been delivered in June 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, one month after Habib's examination of Banks, Dr.
Katherine Hensleigh reported hearing a fetal heartbeat, but conducted no
in-depth medical examination at the jail clinic, according to court
records.</TE>
<TE>   Not long afterward, Sheriff Lolley saw Banks in town, no longer
looking pregnant, and he said she told him the baby had been delivered
stillborn.</TE>
<TE>   But what had happened to the infant? A criminal probe into the missing
newborn eventually brought capital murder charges against Banks, her
estranged husband, Medell Banks Jr., and her sister, Dianne Bell Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities accused Tucker and Medell Banks of taking part in the
death of the newborn, with Medell Banks allegedly burying it in a hole
two feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers say the three were incapable of understanding their
legal rights and, facing a possible death sentence, were manipulated into
pleas.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks, 30, completed 12 years in special education, but never
passed the graduation exam. Victoria Banks, 33, also was in special
education, testing as trainable mentally retarded at age 12. Victoria
Banks has an IQ of 40, and her husband about 57, defense attorney Joseph
W. Hutchinson III says.</TE>
<TE>   "What choice did they have?" Hutchinson says of the pleas.</TE>
<TE>   When Medell Banks agreed to plead guilty, he says, he was under the
impression that he would receive the minimum sentence in a 2-to-20-year
range discussed by his lawyers and the prosecutors. The judge imposed a
15-year term.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys are seeking a new trial; Medell Banks had said in court
that he was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't there. I don't know nothing about nothing," he told Choctaw
County Circuit Judge J. Lee McPhearson.</TE>
<TE>   The judge accepted the guilty pleas, though he expressed doubt about
Victoria Banks' credibility.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony, he noted, she "denied ever having the baby. She has
apparently told investigators and numerous other people that she was, in
fact, pregnant during the spring of 1999, but has likewise made numerous
statements, after the investigation of this matter occurred that she was
not pregnant."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Robert D. Keahey disputes that the three are retarded.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no truth to that at all," the district attorney said. "The
court won't allow them to plead guilty to something if they're mentally
retarded."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors suggested Banks' Fallopian tube surgery had reversed
itself, permitting pregnancy. Tubes spontaneously reattach in about 1% of
cases, medical experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But Steinkampf, brought in after the pleas were made, ruled that out.
Using a test in which dye is forced into the tubes and scanned, he
reported results that were 100% consistent with tubes that were severed
and permanently closed.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey, the district attorney, said all three defendants "gave a
statement there was a child born. Every one gave a statement they
disposed of it." The body allegedly was buried near the abandoned mobile
home where the birth occurred. Neither a body nor any trace of the birth
was found, attorneys said. The case proceeded on witness statements.</TE>
<TE>   Troubling prosecution evidence came from Bonner, the boyfriend who
claimed to be the baby's father, who said Banks told him she was going to
"get rid of the damn baby" because she heard that Bonner was with another
girlfriend in Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner is serving a 30-year sentence for second-degree rape of a
12-year-old, a case in which Victoria Banks was also convicted. She was
in the county jail on that charge the first time she told Habib that she
was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen, the pastor at the Banks family's church, called the
prosecution baffling.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally don't understand how three mentally retarded people
could cover up," Mullen said. "None of them had any experience in
delivering a child. Then we're to think they were smart enough to get rid
of the evidence?"</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Campbell, editor of the weekly Choctaw Advocate, said blacks in
the area have raised questions of fairness, and the newspaper has gotten
calls from the "community in general--not judgmental-type calls. People
just really are asking, 'What's going on here?' "</TE>

<DH>Warfare: As countries build deep bunkers, the Pentagon seeks bombs
to penetrate the fortresses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The power of the U.S. military was on dazzling display on the first
night of the 1999 war in Yugoslavia, when a single B-2 bomber wiped out
all the Serbian military planes at the Pristina airport in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   But the limits of American might were demonstrated near the same
airport on the final day of the war. With the threat of attack lifted,
Serbian troops threw open the doors of a hangar dug beneath a mountain,
then looked on with satisfaction as scores of unscathed MIG fighters
roared into flight.</LD>
<LD>   The planes were beyond the reach of all the bombs and missiles in the
U.S. arsenal. Their survival illustrates why a growing number of
countries are burying their most precious military assets--and why the
Pentagon is racing to build weapons powerful enough to reach them.</LD>
<TE>   The urgency of this contest became clear last week, with the
disclosure of a secret Pentagon report calling for the United States to
take the controversial step of developing small nuclear weapons suited to
this bunker-buster mission. The report said that America's most worrisome
potential adversaries are moving their weapons underground, and
acknowledged that "at present, the United States lacks adequate means to
deal with these facilities."</TE>
<TE>   The report quickly touched off a worldwide debate among foreign
governments, lawmakers and arms experts. At issue are whether such "mini
nukes" could be used effectively without endangering civilian
populations, and whether such smaller weapons would make it more likely
that the United States and other countries would actually use them.</TE>
<TE>   The trend of the world's militaries migrating underground poses one of
the gravest challenges faced by the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been reaching a point where the conventional weapons are not
good enough against an opponent who has the time and money to build
things underground," said Robert Hewson, editor of Jane's Air-Launched
Weapons publication.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bomber aircraft have been trying to find and destroy underground
facilities since World War II, when Germany's Adolf Hitler sought to
conceal his V-2 rockets in shelters. During the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet
planners fretted about how to preserve their missiles and leaders
underground during a nuclear war--a worry lampooned in the movie "Dr.
Strangelove" as a "mine-shaft gap."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. anxieties have deepened in recent years, as world leaders
have become convinced that the recesses of the Earth are one of the last
places beyond the reach of U.S. arms.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review said there are an estimated
10,000 underground facilities in 70 countries. About 1,400 sites are
considered "strategic" because they house leadership bunkers, missiles
and facilities for manufacture and storage of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons, it said.</TE>
<TE>   That number has increased by more than one-third just since 1998, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   These underground complexes can cover acres, and many are equipped to
garrison hundreds of troops for months. They are often protected by
surface-to-air missiles and have multiple ventilation, communications and
power systems so they can still operate if part of their equipment is
damaged in an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most dedicated builders of underground facilities are the
North Koreans, who have hollowed out granite mountains near the
demilitarized zone to conceal planes, tanks, troops and artillery that
could cross the border in an attack.</TE>
<TE>   They also have become popular in the Middle East and are widely used
by the Iraqis, who are believed to be hiding chemical and biological
weapons. The Russians continue to maintain vast underground facilities.
Even in the late 1990s, with a shrinking military budget, U.S.
intelligence believed the Russians were spending billions on a huge
underground facility in the Urals called Yamantau Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has its own large network built during the Cold War,
including several in the Washington area designed to protect national
leaders. Among them are Mt. Weather in western Virginia and Raven Rock
near the Maryland-Pennsylvania border.</TE>
<TE>   With the threat from Russian missiles declining, authorities have
mothballed many of these old facilities. But others still are in use,
including the U.S. Space Command's nuclear-hardened Cheyenne Mountain,
near Colorado Springs, Colo., and the U.S. Strategic Command center
beneath Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, where President Bush flew
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about such foreign facilities grew during the Persian Gulf
War, when U.S. forces struggled to improvise new conventional weapons and
techniques to get at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's underground
sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   That war saw the debut of the laser-guided bunker-buster, called the
GBU-28. The 4,700-pound bomb was built out of 8-inch Army gun tube--a
casing that gave the bomb the weight and durability to punch through 100
feet of earth. The bomb was used to destroy an important bunker north of
Baghdad protected by 30 feet of earth, concrete and hardened steel.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks of Sept. 11 have brought new impetus for developing more
bunker-busters with heavier, slimmer casings and fuses that explode at
just the right moment. With new worries about the chemical, germ and
nuclear weapons that may be hidden underground, U.S. officials have been
accelerating existing programs and scouring defense labs for other
promising ideas.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, the military introduced a "thermobaric" weapon
designed to destroy equipment and kill people in tunnels hundreds of
yards away from the detonation. Called the BLU-118, the bomb involves two
explosions. The first sprays out a powdered chemical and the second
ignites it, releasing tremendous heat and a high-pressure wave that
scorches and crushes targets at some distance.</TE>
<TE>   Military planners hope the weapon can kill any live germ weapons that
might be released from underground storage tanks in an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these and other improvements in conventional arms, U.S.
officials still are worried because it is easier for America's
adversaries to dig deeper than it is for the Pentagon to develop weapons
that can reach those depths, Jane's Hewson said.</TE>
<TE>   A key problem is that destroying bunkers requires the kind of precise
intelligence that usually is hard to come by. With spy satellites and
other sources, general locations of such facilities often can be found.
Intelligence officials can draw certain conclusions about the design of
the installations from how many people they see coming and going, and how
much earth is being trucked away, for example.</TE>
<TE>   But it's much harder from above-ground surveillance to pinpoint
important sections of the facility. Underground tunnels leading from
entrances to the bunkers are often long and tortuous.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon report said that, without such intelligence, U.S.
conventional weapons generally can only disrupt the functioning of
underground facilities by severing power lines near the surface or
blasting the entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of using nuclear weapons argue that the nuclear blast and
fireball would provide extra power to reach and incinerate unconventional
weapons stored underground.</TE>
<TE>   The only nuclear weapon now in inventory for this purpose is the
B61-11, and its effectiveness is in doubt. Introduced in 1997, the bomb
has a pointed nose made of hard depleted uranium that is supposed to give
it extra power to penetrate the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In tests in Alaska, the bomb was dropped from 40,000 feet, yet
penetrated only 20 feet into the earth, analysts say. The Pentagon report
acknowledges the weapon has problems.</TE>
<TE>   But officials insist the B61-11 holds out hope for other nuclear
penetration bombs, pointing out that, with a more effective design,
buried targets could be attacked using a smaller weapon than would be
required for a nuclear strike on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for using nuclear bunker-busters argue that, if an enemy
regime killed thousands of Americans with a chemical or biological
weapon, a U.S. president might feel justified in using a nuclear weapon
to try to obliterate the enemy's remaining weapon supplies. They also
contend that the nuclear weapons in the current U.S. inventory are so
large and destructive as to make their use unthinkable in most
circumstances, and that only by developing smaller weapons can the U.S.
deter potential adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   The flip side of that coin is that, by developing such arms, the
United States might foster the worldview that nuclear weapons are
acceptable tools.</TE>
<TE>   For that very reason, Congress eight years ago banned U.S. labs from
conducting research and development of a bomb smaller than 5 kilotons,
lest it "blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional arms."</TE>
<TE>   Arms control advocates also argue that a nuclear bunker-buster, even
one that reached depths of 100 feet, would inevitably spew radiation that
would devastate the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   Robert D. Nelson, a Princeton University physicist associated with the
pro-arms control group Federation of American Scientists, contended in a
report last year that "no earth-burrowing missile can penetrate deep
enough into the earth to contain an explosion with a nuclear yield even
as small as 1% of the 15-kiloton Hiroshima weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Such an explosion "simply blows out a massive crater of radioactive
dirt, which rains down on the local region an especially intense and
deadly fallout," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts question whether anyone could develop nuclear arms
mechanisms robust enough to explode only after plowing through yards of
rock and concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, advocates believe this new generation of weapons is not out
of the question.</TE>

<HD>Lonely Battle Against AIDS in China</HD>
<DH>Health: Prejudice, ignorance are rife as disease's toll rises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QINGDAO, China
</DL>
<LD>Shut up in his tiny, smoke-filled office, Zhang Beichuan sits
hunched at his desk, editing a small but groundbreaking magazine.</LD>
<LD>   It has an innocuous title--Friend Exchange--and an even more innocuous
look. Articles are printed on plain white paper. There are no photos, no
fancy graphics, no splashy ads. It's about as visually appealing as an
address book.</LD>
<LD>   But inside every issue is a page that Zhang hopes will save lives. Its
content is always the same: a primer for gay men on how to avoid AIDS.
Use condoms. Don't mix sex with drugs and alcohol. Fewer partners means
less risk.</LD>
<TE>   The advice sounds painfully basic to anyone from the West. But in
China, for all the social change of the past 20 years, such information
is scarce, fueling ignorance and misconceptions that experts fear may
precipitate a health crisis in this country's gay community.</TE>
<TE>   The community is at high risk for AIDS but has been neglected by the
government and the public, even as attention begins to focus on the
spread of the disease in China.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers highlight the plight of needle-sharing drug users who
contract HIV, hospital patients infected through blood transfusions and
poor farmers afflicted after selling their blood at unsanitary collection
stations. China's top health official said recently that at current
infection rates, the country could have 10 million people with HIV or
AIDS by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   But amid the media coverage, almost nothing has been said about
acquired immune deficiency syndrome's inroads among gay men. The taboo
against talking about sex in general and homosexuality in particular
remains a block against getting information to those in need.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of people are trying to break the silence. Even the
China Society for the Prevention of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted
Disease, composed of officials, doctors and researchers, stays relatively
mute on the issue of gays and the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in that circle know that gays are a high-risk group. But
you won't find 10 of them who are actually taking action and working with
the gay community," said Zhang, a physician who gave up a dermatology
practice to promote AIDS awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do feel lonely at times," he added.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many gay men in China are infected with AIDS or with
the human immunodeficiency virus, which can lead to the disease. Of all
registered cases--which are but a fraction of infections--less than 1%
are attributed to homosexual activity.</TE>
<TE>   But no one doubts that the figure does not reflect the extent of the
problem or that the infection rate among gay men is climbing, especially
in major cities.</TE>
<TE>   At the two hospitals in Beijing known for treating venereal disease,
one-third of all AIDS patients are gay men, said a Western researcher
with a foreign-funded AIDS project in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, a measure of government recognition came when a senior
health official acknowledged that homosexuals were at risk, adding that
the number of gays in China was "alarming."</TE>
<TE>   Yet state-supported education and prevention efforts targeted at gay
men is rare.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang's bimonthly magazine is the only publication in China directed
at the gay community. Its modest funding comes from the New York-based
Ford Foundation. Each issue contains articles, essays and letters on
homosexuality--stories about coming out of the closet, scientific
studies, news around the world affecting gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>Focusing on Target Audience</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 pages in every edition deal with AIDS, including the guide
to safe sex directed at male readers. Lesbians in China, as elsewhere,
have a lower risk then men of contracting AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to put out basic information," Zhang said one
recent morning, the proofs of the latest issue of Friend Exchange
cluttering his desktop. "Our volunteers tell us we need to keep repeating
the ABCs."</TE>
<TE>   From his cramped, rather dilapidated office in Qingdao, the port city
famous for its Tsingtao beer, Zhang's journal rides the roads and rails
to most of the nation's major cities through a network of committed
volunteers. Between 7,000 and 8,000 copies are distributed every other
month and reach more readers than those numbers suggest, but still just a
tiny sliver of a gay population estimated in the tens of millions.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone appreciates his work. A few months ago, some neighbors
flung a bucket of human waste at his office door, apparently upset by the
visitors and volunteers who come calling, whom they assumed to be AIDS
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   But a hutch in the corner of his office attests to the impact of
Zhang's magazine. Stuffed into drawers are thousands of letters from
readers who are grateful to discover that they're not alone, who vent
their despair at their isolation--usually in China's countryside--or who
ask for medical advice. At least one is a suicide note that had Zhang
phoning around in an unsuccessful bid to locate the writer. Zhang tries
to answer every letter he receives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing a remarkable job. . . . He showed that it is possible" to
reach gay men in China, said Dr. Emile Fox, the director in China for
UNAIDS, a United Nations program. "Otherwise, there is very, very little
being done."</TE>
<TE>Resources Are Sorely Lacking</TE>
<TE>   The lack of outreach is part of a larger pattern of, at best,
piecemeal and superficial government efforts to combat the epidemic or,
at worst, official indifference.</TE>
<TE>   In a still relatively poor nation of 1.3 billion people, AIDS
prevention and education programs remain pitifully underfunded and
understaffed. The resources of the Ministry of Public Health have been
stretched paper-thin as the nation's once-sturdy social safety net
unravels amid market reforms.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the number of people infected with AIDS or HIV has
soared. Unofficial estimates put the total at more than 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the government recorded a 67% jump in reported HIV cases in
the first half of 2001, compared with the same period the year before. In
response, health officials pledged to spend $12 million a year on AIDS
prevention and control.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the United States allotted $767 million last year for
prevention in a country with one-fifth the population of China. In
addition, Washington shelled out more than $100 million for global
efforts to combat HIV and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   To reach homosexuals in the U.S., officials can tap into a
well-established infrastructure of gay organizations, support groups and
publications.</TE>
<TE>   In China, such a visible network does not exist. There is only a
loose, informal sodality of friends and acquaintances who congregate in a
few gay bars, saunas and public parks. Few men live openly gay lives for
fear of ostracism.</TE>
<TE>Reluctance to Come Forward</TE>
<TE>   At an AIDS conference in Beijing last October, some doctors expressed
their willingness to work with homosexuals but said they had no idea how
to recognize or find them. Of about 20 gay listeners in the audience,
only one finally stood up and identified himself as a gay man, according
to people who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Until a few years ago, a lot of people thought that China had no
homosexuals," said Xiao Ya, an activist who runs a nationwide hot line
for fellow gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   He and his associates do their best to spread the word on AIDS.
They've printed up pamphlets and left them at bars. They hold seminars.
Volunteers sometimes deliver free condoms to bathhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge about AIDS seems to be spreading, Xiao said, but not
everyone practices what they know. And some of what they know is
downright wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think that having sex with a foreigner is how you get
AIDS," Xiao said. "They think they're safe because they've never been
with a foreigner."</TE>
<TE>   In a small-scale study conducted in Beijing two years ago, Kyung-Hee
Choi, a medical professor at UC San Francisco, found that half of the gay
and bisexual men she surveyed did not practice safe sex.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Choi is about to discover the consequences of such laxity,
through a study of 500 gay and bisexual men in Beijing that will show the
prevalence of HIV infection among them. The rate could turn out to be as
high as 4% to 5%, say people familiar with the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of scared to find the results of my study, to be honest,"
Choi said. "I don't really think that gay men in Beijing have a sense of
crisis. They think that AIDS is a problem for IV drug users and farmers
who give blood."</TE>
<TE>   Activists and researchers report a worrisome attitude among many gay
men, an almost blase fatalism that sees no point in getting tested for
HIV or modifying behavior. Free, confidential HIV screening is almost
unheard of, and effective AIDS medications cost a fortune by Chinese
standards, even after the price was slashed recently from about $1,100 a
month to $365.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who has the disease," said Fei Yu, 25. "But my
friends and I have all decided that even if we suspect we have it, we
won't go to the hospital. We'll save the money for a little more fun in
our shortened lives."</TE>
<TE>   Others fear going to physicians only to encounter judgment and
hostility. Although homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness by
the Chinese Psychiatric Assn. last year, old attitudes die hard. A recent
newspaper article quoted a psychiatrist as calling gays and lesbians
perverts.</TE>
<TE>Adversity Only Steels His Resolve</TE>
<TE>   Such prejudice was what galvanized Zhang, the Friend Exchange founder,
into action.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he watched in disbelief as his mentor, another dermatologist,
suffered abuse and harassment from colleagues who had found out that he
was gay. Zhang, who is heterosexual, knew little about homosexuality but
considered his mentor a decent man and refused to take part in
victimizing him. That in turn made Zhang an object of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the experience, Zhang published a book five years later titled
"Homosexuality," a compilation of essays. He admits now that some of the
book's contents were somewhat negative--his views have evolved over
time--but it did conclude that "our society must treat gay people
equally."</TE>
<TE>   Friend Exchange was born in 1998, funded at first by three gay men who
asked Zhang if he would do something to help combat AIDS in the gay
community.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Zhang runs his operation on the strength of a three-year,
$120,000 grant from the Ford Foundation awarded in 2000--and on the
stream of cigarettes he smokes.</TE>
<TE>   His office space, provided by the Qingdao Medical College, is smaller
than a jail cell. It is located in a rundown building that also houses
migrant workers who do odd jobs on campus. Until he had enough money to
install air-conditioning, the walls were slicked with mildew.</TE>
<TE>   But he is determined to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there's enough money, I'll keep on doing it," he said. "As
a dermatologist, I made a difference, but I saw only a small number of
patients. But as an AIDS expert, I can have an impact on a lot more
people."</TE>

<DL>SANTO DOMINGO, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Death came to Santo Domingo as its people celebrated life.</LD>
<LD>   Villagers were planning a street fair that bright December morning,
but a battle had broken out between the Colombian army and leftist rebels
in the nearby jungle.</LD>
<LD>   The villagers heard a military helicopter roar overhead. Seconds
later, an explosion ripped through this collection of wood huts on the
edge of Colombia's northeastern plain.</LD>
<TE>   Two children were cut down as their grandmother made them breakfast. A
father was eviscerated as his sons watched. A nursing mother was nearly
decapitated, her 3-month-old baby still in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 11 adults and seven children died in Santo Domingo on Dec. 13,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the attack seems to be another bit of homemade carnage
in Colombia's long, bloody guerrilla war, notable, perhaps, only for the
number of children who died.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Colombian military court records, the U.S. government
helped initiate military operations around Santo Domingo that day, and
two private American companies helped plan and support them.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that the U.S. government or American companies
knew that their aid might lead to the destruction of a village. But more
than three years later, no one has been held accountable for the deaths.
Civilian prosecutors accuse a Colombian air force helicopter crew of
dropping a U.S.-made cluster bomb while supporting the troops engaged in
battle.The military claims that guerrillas accidentally detonated a car
bomb in the town.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is bogged down in jurisdictional disputes. U.S.
pledges to help have languished. But an examination by the Los Angeles
Times reveals an alarming picture of the Colombian conflict just as the
U.S. prepares to become more deeply involved.</TE>
<TE>   According to a videotape admitted as evidence in a closed military
court tribunal, Colombian court documents and interviews with more than
three dozen military officers, witnesses and experts:</TE>
<TE>   * The events leading to the battle outside Santo Domingo and the
explosion began when a U.S. government surveillance plane detected an
aircraft allegedly carrying weapons for the guerrillas. In doing so, the
plane may have violated rules that restrict American activities in
Colombia to counter-narcotic operations.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum, which runs an oil complex 30
miles north of Santo Domingo, provided crucial assistance to the
operation. It supplied, directly or through contractors, troop
transportation, planning facilities and fuel to Colombian military
aircraft, including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   * AirScan Inc., a private U.S. company owned by former Air Force
commandos, helped plan and provided surveillance for the attack around
Santo Domingo using a high-tech monitoring plane. The U.S. Coast Guard is
investigating whether the plane was flown by a U.S. military pilot on
active duty. Company employees even suggested targets to the Colombian
helicopter crew that dropped the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   * In a violation of U.S. guidelines, the U.S. military later provided
training to the pilot accused of dropping the bomb, even after a
Colombian prosecutor had charged him with aggravated homicide and causing
personal injury in the Santo Domingo operation.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan officials deny involvement in the incident, saying their plane
was used only to survey Occidental's oil pipeline, and the company is not
accused of any illegal activity. Occidental officials say they routinely
supply nonlethal equipment for military operations in northeastern
Colombia but they could neither confirm nor deny their role on the day of
the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the incident touches on many of the issues that make
Colombia's war so problematic for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, U.S. involvement was supposed to be black and white: The
U.S. government provided military training and aid to wipe out the vast
fields of coca plants and poppy flowers that produce the majority of
illegal drugs on America's streets.</TE>
<TE>   But leftist rebels have increasingly financed their war with drug
profits, meaning that operations against guerrillas and against narcotics
often blend seamlessly. And since the breakdown of Colombia's peace
process in February, rebels have unleashed a campaign against the
country's infrastructure, including the pipeline that moves Occidental's
oil, bringing private industry ever closer to the war.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military brigade that oversaw the operations around
Santo Domingo is in line to receive enhanced training and equipment as
part of the Bush administration's $98-million proposal to help protect
oil facilities in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Events in Santo Domingo also reveal a contradiction in U.S. attitudes.
Even as Washington insists that Colombia vigorously pursue human rights
abuses, it has shown little interest in investigating the possible role
of American citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) sponsored amendments to the last two U.S
aid packages to Colombia that require suspension of aid to any military
unit suspected of human rights violations, unless the government is
actively pursuing a case against the accused.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years have passed, and we have yet to see anyone prosecuted for
the needless deaths of 18 people or the flagrant attempts by Colombian
military officers to cover up the crime," said Leahy, now the chairman of
the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   This is perhaps what is most important to the people of Santo Domingo.
While the war raged around them for years, the town's 200 people mostly
avoided the violence, until Dec. 13, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are surrounded by it. Early this year, a resident who had
been a key witness against the Colombian military in the case was
assassinated by suspected right-wing paramilitary fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can fix what happened," said Margarita Tilano, a 44-year-old
grandmother whose daughter and two grandchildren died in the 1998 attack.
"We want justice, nothing else."</TE>
<TE>The United States</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 7, 1998, according to military court records obtained by The
Times, Colombian army intelligence intercepted a scratchy radio
conversation between two commanders of the country's largest rebel army,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian army officers have said that they interpreted the coded
conversation to mean that the FARC high command was sending a small plane
loaded with weapons to land near Santo Domingo. In return for the
weapons, the local rebel commander would hand over 1,000 kilograms, or
2,200 pounds, of cocaine that his men had recently seized from drug
traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   What made the rebel operation particularly important to the Colombian
military was that German Briceno, a top local FARC commander, was
suspected of overseeing it.</TE>
<TE>   Briceno, better known as Grannobles, is the brother of the FARC's
military commander and a vicious, if not adept, leader. Two months after
the Santo Domingo incident, he is believed to have ordered the kidnapping
and killing of three Americans who were working to protect the rights of
indigenous people.</TE>
<TE>   The reported involvment of drugs allowed the Colombian military to
call for help from U.S. Customs P-3 Orion surveillance planes that
normally track clandestine drug flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, at 2:45 p.m., according to court records, a P-3 packed
with high-tech monitoring equipment detected a Cessna 206 heading toward
Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna landed north of the village. Men in civilian clothes
swarmed the plane and began unloading boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Within five minutes, the plane was airborne again. The Colombian
military pounced. A company of soldiers from the 18th Brigade was sent to
pursue Grannobles on the ground, while the air force intercepted the
Cessna and forced it to land.</TE>
<TE>   No drugs were found on the plane--not even after prosecutors performed
tests able to detect microscopic traces of cocaine. An internal Colombian
air force control tower log recorded the mission as an attempt to block
an "arms delivery"--there was no mention of narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it is unclear whether drugs were ever part of the rebels'
operation, current and former U.S. Embassy officials said the United
States was right to aid the mission despite the restrictions limiting
U.S. aid to counter-narcotics operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna was flying from a known drug zone, they said, and they
believe that no drugs were loaded onto the Cessna because the pilot
realized he was being monitored.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Grannobles on the ground fared even worse. Helicopters
transporting the 70 soldiers of Dragon Company took heavy fire as they
landed. Then, as the troops fought to cross a bridge about 700 yards
north of Santo Domingo, one soldier was killed and four were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard [the commander] on the radio. He was desperate. He said,
'They're killing us,' " Lt. Guillermo Olaya, the air force liaison with
the army, said in military court testimony. "Hour after hour, the combat
grew more intense."</TE>
<TE>Oxy and AirScan</TE>
<TE>   At 9 a.m. the next day, worried air force and army commanders gathered
in a tiny room to plan an operation to rescue Dragon Company, according
to military court testimony and interviews with pilots involved in the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The location of the meeting was Occidental Petroleum's Cano Limon oil
complex about 30 miles north of Santo Domingo. Occidental has long been
active in Colombia. In 1983, it discovered a billion-barrel oil field. To
develop the site, Occidental and a Spanish oil company with a minority
interest entered into a 50-50 partnership with Colombia's state oil
company, Ecopetrol.</TE>
<TE>   But in discovering oil, Oxy walked into the middle of Colombia's
decades-old internal conflict with two guerrilla armies, the FARC and a
smaller group called the National Liberation Army.</TE>
<TE>   Both made Oxy, its workers and the oil pipeline a target. There have
been more than 900 attacks against the pipeline since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   To stop the attacks, Oxy decided to undertake the unusual mission of
bolstering a foreign military force by strengthening the under-equipped
and underfunded local army unit, the 18th Brigade, current and former Oxy
officials said. In effect, Oxy became the unit's quartermaster.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy or its contractors provided troop transport helicopters, fuel,
uniforms, cars and motorcycles. It even paid for leave tickets and better
rations to improve morale, according to the Oxy officials and local
military commanders.</TE>
<TE>   The company also provided cash to the military, about $150,000 a year,
according to one rough estimate by a top Oxy official. Both the in-kind
and cash aid, a total of about $750,000 a year, was strictly limited to
logistical support. Oxy insisted that its help not be used for arms.</TE>
<TE>   But as a result, the army had more money available to combat the
leftist guerrillas throughout Arauca state, where Santo Domingo is
located, as well as improve security along the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th Brigade has been accused of abuses, including cooperation
with violent paramilitary groups in the kidnapping and murder of
suspected guerrilla sympathizers. The recent killing of Angel Riveros,
who was a key witness for the prosecutors in the Santo Domingo attacks,
is a case in point. Local human rights groups say the killers passed
through a military roadblock maintained by the 18th Brigade before the
Jan. 24 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had serious problems with the military in Arauca in terms of
human rights and in the way the military deals with paramilitaries," said
Robin Kirk, a Colombia expert for Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy has given classes to military officers on human rights and
required its workers to sign contracts promising to respect international
norms. But it hasn't implemented other steps, such as insisting on an
independent review of the human rights record of the military units they
are supporting.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy officials say they have little control over such matters. They say
relying on the military is better than having their own armed security
service.</TE>
<TE>   "We have military protection because we must have it, because we have
no alternative," said Guimer Dominguez, the president of Oxy's Colombia
operations. "Unfortunately the armed forces are short in some areas, and
in this sense, we give them nonlethal support."</TE>
<TE>   Part of this support, according to interviews and court testimony, was
"Room G" at Oxy's Cano Limon complex, where the military commanders
gathered on the morning of Dec. 13, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked in a corner of the complex, the room was surrounded by sandbags
and equipped with TV monitors and computers. Room G, according to those
present, served as the planning center for the operation in Santo
Domingo, thanks, in part, to a second U.S. company, an obscure and
low-profile firm called AirScan.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Rockledge, Fla., AirScan came to Colombia in 1997 as a
contractor for Oxy, according to Oxy officials. One of the Colombian
army's deficiencies was that it simply couldn't find the highly mobile
guerrillas. AirScan owned a fleet of small planes equipped with high-tech
monitoring devices, such as infrared cameras, that could track guerrilla
activity along the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The company had a handful of contracts for aerial surveillance and
monitoring, some of them with U.S. Air Force bases such as Vandenberg and
Cape Canaveral.</TE>
<TE>   The founders of AirScan, Walter Holloway and John W. Mansur, both have
backgrounds as air commandos, the Air Force version of Special Forces.
Mansur, 61, the company's chief executive, retired from the Air Force in
1987 as a highly decorated colonel, having served as a military assistant
to the secretary of the Air Force and as the commander of the Air Force's
Eastern Space and Missile Center at Patrick Air Force Base, near
AirScan's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Mansur impressed Oxy officials.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan pilots "were not gung ho jocks. They were very
professional," said a former Oxy official. "They were not mercenaries in
the classic sense."</TE>
<TE>The Switch-Over</TE>
<TE>   The reconnaissance flights didn't stop the guerrillas, who recognized
that being spotted by AirScan didn't mean the army was on its way. They
actually began waving at the AirScan pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials began pressuring Oxy to use AirScan to
conduct intelligence patrols far away from the pipeline, according to
former Oxy and State Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the middle of 1997, about six months after Oxy's contract with
AirScan began, one top Oxy official approached the U.S. Embassy to ask
what sort of limits should be put on providing intelligence to the
Colombian military. The response was simple: Stick to the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, you're getting into a dirty area, it's very
dangerous,' " one former State Department official recalled. " 'If you do
flights like mercenaries, then you'll be responsible.' "</TE>
<TE>   To avoid trouble, Oxy officials say, they ended their direct
involvement with AirScan by transferring its contract. Instead of
Occidental, AirScan ended up having a contract with the Colombian air
force that was paid for by Ecopetrol, Oxy's Colombian partner in the
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, AirScan said it patrolled only the pipeline during the
time of the bombing in Santo Domingo, 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of AirScan activity was simply pipeline surveillance,"
Mansur wrote in a brief statement to The Times. "This was the only
activity in which AirScan crews or aircraft were engaged."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots involved in operations around Santo Domingo disputed that
account, testifying that AirScan played a far larger role that day.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, pilots also said that AirScan flew missions all over
Arauca, which at 9,000 square miles is about the size of New Hampshire.
It frequently provided intelligence on guerrilla patrols and helped pick
out targets, they said, and even celebrated kills when an air force pilot
successfully blew up a guerrilla squad.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say, 'Good job, you got him,' " said one of the Colombian
military helicopter's crew members who is accused in the Santo Domingo
bombing. In an interview, he said he was on dozens of missions with
American pilots working for AirScan, including one who identified himself
as a Navy SEAL.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan's role became so vital that military forces insisted on a
patrol before almost every battle, according to the crew member. Once, a
low-flying AirScan pilot took ground fire and had to have his fuel tank
replaced when he returned to base.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were confrontations between the army and guerrillas, they
were always there," the crew member said, referring to AirScan. "They
were our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "They frequently strayed from their missions to help us in operations
against the guerrillas," said another of the accused crew members. "The
plane would go and check and verify [guerrilla] patrols and say, 'Hey,
there are people here.' "</TE>
<TE>The Briefing</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly what two AirScan crew members did during the Santo
Domingo operation, according to Colombian pilots involved in the
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The briefing at Oxy's Cano Limon oil complex on the morning of Dec.
13, 1998, was convened so that Colombian military officials from the 18th
Brigade and the air force could figure out how to save Dragon Company,
which had been pinned down since the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the information supplied at the briefing came from AirScan
employees Joe Orta and Charlie Denny, who had been flying since 6:33 a.m.
with Colombian air force Capt. Cesar Gomez, according to testimony and
interviews with those present, as well as a flight log obtained by The
Times from military court files.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez was on the AirScan plane to guarantee a Colombian military
presence on a mission flown by Americans. He was also the military's
designated liaison with Oxy, Gomez testified in court.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was supposed to be in control, he testified that he only
sat in the back of the plane and watched the developing operation on a
small monitor.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan plane, which was flying with Colombian air force markings,
"provided day and night aerial surveillance of [Santo Domingo] and
adjacent villages in support of the counter-guerrilla forces," Orta wrote
in his summary of the Dec. 13 flight.</TE>
<TE>   Orta and Denny used video of the area around Santo Domingo that they
had made earlier in the morning to show nests of guerrilla soldiers to
the Colombian military officers present, according to those who attended
the briefing.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed out guerrillas who they said could be seen in the town,
mingling with civilians, according to one of the accused crew members
present at the briefing.</TE>
<TE>   The AirScan crew never indicated that guerrillas had taken up
positions in the town, but they did suggest attacking a concentration of
guerrillas in a stand of jungle a few hundred meters away, according to
military court testimony and interviews with several pilots present.</TE>
<TE>   After the briefing, Gen. Luis Barbosa, the local army commander,
decided to request air support for a company of troops to land and
reinforce Dragon Company.</TE>
<TE>   "The [AirScan pilots] helped us throughout the operation, taking a
quantity of videos where you could see the town, the movement of the
guerrillas and the movements of the troops," said Olaya, the air force
liaison with the army.</TE>
<TE>   Orta's identity is something of a puzzle. Colombian Foreign Ministry
records show that a man named Barbaro Jose Orta was given a six-month
temporary visa to work in Colombia for AirScan beginning in February
1998. There is no indication that his visa was renewed before December
1998.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military files also show that in 1998, a man named Barbaro Jose
Orta was an active-duty member of the U.S. Coast Guard's Search and
Rescue team in Miami, assigned to coordinate rescue missions.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph of Orta in those files was picked out of a stack of
photographs by two Colombian military pilots involved in the operation as
the man who called himself "Joe" Orta. And one of Barbaro Jose Orta's
family members, who spoke briefly with The Times, confirmed that Barbaro
Orta usually goes by the name "Joe."</TE>
<TE>   The military records also show that Barbaro Orta was on authorized
leave between Dec. 9 and Dec. 19, 1998. But there is no indication that
he sought permission to work a second job or that he asked permission to
go abroad, both of which were required at the time for active-duty
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Though Barbaro Orta left the service in November 2000, Coast Guard
officials have opened an inquiry into whether Orta was the AirScan pilot,
after being contacted by The Times. Barbaro Orta, still in U.S. military
service as a member of the Puerto Rican Air National Guard, did not
respond to numerous attempts to contact him through his military postings
or through his family.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Barbaro Orta] was on board the aircraft, it was without the
knowledge or authorization of the U.S. Mission in Colombia," said an
embassy official in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   As for the other American AirScan crewman, neither the Foreign
Ministry nor the Colombian customs agency has a record of anyone named
Charlie Denny entering Colombia.</TE>
<TE>The Pilot</TE>
<TE>   Once Colombian military commanders gave the go-ahead, Lt. Cesar Romero
and his crew began preparing their Huey helicopter for combat.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Romero, co-pilot Johan Jimenez and technician Hector
Hernandez flew transport routes, moving food and troops between battles.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, their Huey was mounted with a World War II-era AN-M41
cluster bomb, given to the Colombian military by the United States in the
1980s, according to Colombian air force officials. Romero, who has no
blemishes on his service record, had twice before dropped such devices.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, comprising six bomblets, is mounted on a metal rack. Each
bomblet weighs 20 pounds and is packed with 2.7 pounds of explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The rack attaches to the side of the helicopter. When the target is in
sight, a wire is pulled and the bomb falls out. The individual bomblets
separate, hit the ground, and bounce about an inch and a half high. Then
they explode, sending chunks of metal at 2,800 feet per second in all
directions from a steel coil wrapped around the charge.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, last used by the U.S. in Vietnam, has an effective diameter
of about 30 yards, meaning anybody within 15 yards of it is likely to be
killed.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:30 a.m., Romero's Huey and four other helicopters, including a
Russian-made MI-17 that military officials say was provided by Oxy
through a contractor--took off for Santo Domingo from Cano Limon. They
carried relief troops, the cluster bomb, Brazilian-made Skyfire rockets
and heavy machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   According to pilots present at the scene and military court records,
they were joined on site by the AirScan plane, which also took off from
Oxy's oil complex and was filming the entire operation. Colombian
military pilots said in court testimony that throughout the day, the
plane and helicopters returned to Cano Limon to refuel and review new
mission plans in Room G.</TE>
<TE>   There is a dispute over the targeting of the cluster bomb. Some say
Romero was supposed to consult with ground troops before dropping it. But
Romero said he talked only with the AirScan pilots and the pilot of an
armed H500 Hughes helicopter also at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "The coordinates were made directly with the armed helicopters that
were in the area and the Skymaster plane that was crewed by American
pilots," Romero told a military judge last year. "The troops were
communicating directly with the armed helicopters and the Skymaster."</TE>
<TE>   A Colombian UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter was also airborne. It had been
donated by the U.S. primarily for use in anti-drug missions. It began
firing rockets into the jungle. The Huey pilots have testified that they
heard the AirScan pilots warn the Black Hawk pilot, "Careful, you're
shooting at civilians!"</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Romero said he focused on his target: a thick stand of
jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters north of Santo Domingo, 200 meters west of
the road where the Cessna had landed the afternoon before.</TE>
<TE>   The Huey circled the area twice to be sure of the target, then Romero
started the countdown: "Three, two, one, now!" he shouted. Hernandez
pulled a steel cable and the bomb fell away.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Romero nor his co-pilot can recall seeing the bomb hit. The
pilots have been consistent with this account for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem: There is no stand of jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters
north of Santo Domingo, and 200 meters west of the road where the Cessna
landed. There is only open field.</TE>
<TE>The Bomb</TE>
<TE>   Santo Domingo is a nothing place, some three dozen wooden shacks hard
against a curve in a two-lane highway. There is no electricity. No
phones. No running water. Just big sky, open savanna and thick jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people raise cattle or grow corn. Others have small
stores. The Colombian government has no permanent presence, so FARC
guerrillas move openly through town. Unlike other parts of Colombia,
drugs are not a big part of the economy, though coca is grown and cocaine
is produced in the region. The road where the Cessna touched down is one
of the primary clandestine landing strips.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, in December, when the crops are harvested and Christmas
is coming, the town holds a two-day street fair to raise money for civic
projects. In 1998, the aim was to put a concrete floor in the two-room
schoolhouse and add doors.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, family and friends from hamlets throughout the region
began arriving to play in a soccer tournament, watch a beauty contest and
eat barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   But in the afternoon, they began to hear gunfire, then explosions,
coming nearer. Aircraft flew overhead throughout the night, shooting into
the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Some people decided to stay, fearful they would be caught in the
cross-fire. Others left. Still others tried to leave but turned back
because of their own fear, or because soldiers stopped them, warning that
it was too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Dec. 13, the town's community leader and bus driver,
Wilson Garcia, then 44, decided to go to the nearest town that had a
phone, about 15 miles away, to call the Red Cross for help. Before he
left, he told townspeople to wave white rags to show the aircraft above
that they were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stay calm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So people remained. There was Nancy Castillo, who'd given birth to a
baby girl just three months before. Salomon Neite, 58, a farmer who was
about to retire and hand over his land to his two sons. Luis Martinez,
25, a soccer fanatic with a wife and child. Edilma Pacheco, 27, was
working at the local store as a clerk. Giovanny Hernandez, 16, had come
from a nearby town for the fair.</TE>
<TE>   When the aircraft appeared about 9:30 a.m., people followed Garcia's
advice. They began waving white rags above their heads. Some even lay
down on the pavement, hoping to better demonstrate their neutrality.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 a.m., Garcia's daughter Alba, then 16, and many of her
friends were in the street near a broken-down red truck, a 1955 Chevrolet
parked across from the town's drugstore.</TE>
<TE>   They watched as a helicopter came into view, then turned to pass over
Santo Domingo from south to north. As it drew overhead, Alba looked up
and saw about four dark objects falling.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," she said to a friend. "They're throwing rolls of paper at us."</TE>
<TE>   Then, darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Santo Domingo had just been bombed.</TE>
<TE>   A tape of the operation viewed by The Times--identified by those
involved as a tape made by AirScan--does not capture this moment. The
camera is focused on a field less than half a mile away where relief
troops were landing. But the survivors have vivid, slow-motion memories
of what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The front of the red truck was smashed in by a direct hit, its right
front fender falling to the ground. Smoke filled the air. A woman
screamed, "They killed my children!" People began fleeing the town on
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Alba woke to find herself bathed in blood, her arm nearly severed.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, at the drugstore, Maria Panqueva was knocked flat
by a piece of steel that hit her leg. The woman standing next to her,
Nancy Castillo, was killed while nursing her 3-month-old, the top half of
her head nearly sliced off. The baby was found lying next to her,
screaming.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearby house, Margarita Tilano was stunned by the noise. Then she
heard screams. Her daughter, Katherine Cardenas, 7, and granddaughter,
Edna Bello, 5, were dead. Her grandson, Jaime, 4, was wounded and would
die on the way to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from the blast, Amalio Neite, 22, was blown six feet
from where he had been standing. He turned to see his brother holding his
father, Salomon, writhing on the ground, a hand over his stomach to keep
in his intestines.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen people died and more than 25 were wounded, some of them
crippled for life. Today, Alba cannot move her left arm. Its scars
resemble the crude stitching on a rag doll.</TE>
<TE>   At the eastern edge of Santo Domingo, Olimpo Cardenas was about 150
yards away with his back to the explosion. When it occurred, he turned
around to see dead and wounded everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas jumped on a motorcycle and rode out of town to the home of a
friend who owned a Ford flatbed truck. The two men drove back slowly. At
10:20 a.m. they pulled up in front of the drugstore, where many of the
dead and wounded had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   They loaded up about seven of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   As they left town, they saw another helicopter hovering above them.
About 200 meters away from town, they heard a burst of gunfire, and saw
earth and concrete flinging up next to them. Then the helicopter flew
off.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who had gotten out of the truck, stayed until he was sure
everyone had left town. Then he walked out on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the last one out," he said. "The place was a ghost town."</TE>
<TE>The Investigation</TE>
<TE>   The dead and wounded began arriving at hospitals in the afternoon.
Most told a similar story: At 10 a.m., a military helicopter had dropped
a bomb on Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   But separate investigations by the Colombian air force and army
concluded that the carnage was not the military's fault. They said that
guerrillas had installed a car bomb inside the red truck, the epicenter
of the damage. They said the plan was to lure Dragon Company into Santo
Domingo, then detonate the bomb. But after troops arrived to reinforce
Dragon Company and save the unit, the bomb went off by mistake, killing
the villagers.</TE>
<TE>   The military said that conclusion was based on both testimony and
forensic proof--both of which were later called into question.</TE>
<TE>   Fragments from the town tested positive for chemicals commonly found
in homemade explosive materials, according to court records. Two FARC
deserters who gave themselves up after the bombing blamed the incident on
their former comrades. Another witness, a local man who reported seeing
the FARC at work on the truck, recently recanted, saying a military
officer from the 18th Brigade had paid him to lie.</TE>
<TE>   Air force officials also said a cluster bomb would have destroyed
structures or left large craters, a puzzling claim since AN-M41s have a
relatively small charge designed to kill people, not destroy buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, and it's only a suspicion . . . that the guerrillas put the
bomb there," Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco, the head of the Colombian air
force, said in an interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   Olaya, the air force's local link to the army, refused to turn over
documents to civilian federal prosecutors when they arrived Dec. 17,
according to military court records.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco continued to insist that no bombs had been used in the
operation, even after air force officials had sent notice to headquarters
about the use of the cluster bomb. Velasco later explained that the air
force classifies cluster bombs as low-power explosives, not as bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The military's insistence that the combat and the air force bombing
occurred far from town is also in question.</TE>
<TE>   Using a satellite-guided measuring device accurate to within a few
meters, The Times traveled to Santo Domingo several times to measure
distances mentioned in the military's accounts of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The military has said in interviews and military court testimony that
the fighting began where the Cessna had landed, about 6 kilometers, or a
little more than 3.5 miles, from Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The actual distance between Santo Domingo and the landing site, based
on the coordinates supplied by the military to the court, is 3
kilometers, according to a hand-held Global Positioning System that can
measure distances between geographic coordinates.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots indicated on a map that they dropped their bomb in a stand
of jungle 1,000 to 1,200 meters from Santo Domingo, 200 meters west of
the road. But that stand of jungle is at maximum 650 meters away.</TE>
<TE>   As to the testimony of more than 30 survivors, military officials said
they were probably lying--either out of fear or sympathy for the
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials weren't the only ones clouding the story.</TE>
<TE>   Days after the bombing, Leahy fired off a letter from his Senate
office demanding information. Then-Ambassador Curtis Kamman responded
with a detailed note that only further confused matters.</TE>
<TE>   Kamman made no mention of the involvement of the U.S. P-3 plane on the
day before the incident, though he said Colombian air force planes had
done surveillance of the Cessna that landed outside Santo Domingo,
initiating the operation.</TE>
<TE>   He also told Leahy that embassy officials had viewed a five-hour tape
of the incident, which showed that Santo Domingo had remained "intact" at
the time people in the town reported being bombed. The tape "directly
refut[ed]" their claims, he said, and supported the military's story of a
guerrilla car bomb that had exploded at another time.</TE>
<TE>   Kamman said in an interview that he did not know the origin of the
tape and had "no information" on AirScan's involvement in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   But if the tape was the same one viewed by The Times--and there is no
evidence that any other aircraft filmed the operation--it is unclear how
embassy officials missed the wreckage of the red truck and the loading of
bodies on the truck. Both are visible on the tape.</TE>
<TE>The Breakthrough</TE>
<TE>   By June 1999, almost all the investigations were over or dormant. The
general conclusion: The guerrillas and the people of Santo Domingo had
attempted to pull a fast one, and they had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, civilian investigators were not convinced. The first forensic
examinations of Santo Domingo had been done in the days after the
bombing, when combat was still going on. Two teams of experts had been
shot at. No team spent more than 90 minutes in the town.</TE>
<TE>   So the investigators--a federal prosecutor and the procuraduria, a
sort of inspector general--requested a more thorough look. Teams went
back to Santo Domingo in June 1999 and February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In June, they determined that the red truck had been hit from above by
an explosive device. In February, they compared metal fragments that
remained in the town's wooden buildings to fragments of an exploded
AN-M41. The two sets of metal were similar. They also discovered six
craters in and near the town, corresponding with the six bomblets,
according to military court files.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in perhaps the biggest breakthrough, federal prosecutors dug
back through the evidence to find metal fragments taken from the bodies
of two bombing victims.</TE>
<TE>   They sent these fragments, taken from a 42-year-old woman and a
16-year-old boy, to the FBI via the U.S. Embassy. They also sent some of
the fragments they had found in their February hunt.</TE>
<TE>   On May 1, 2000, the FBI produced its report. The fragments were
"consistent" with a U.S.-made AN-M41. One piece had "NO E BOM" stamped on
the side. The phrase "NOSE BOMB FUZE" is printed on AN-M41 cluster bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI analysis also found that there were no signs that the cluster
bombs had been delivered through an "improvised" delivery system--i.e.,
it had not been modified to be used as a car bomb.</TE>
<TE>   This was enough to convince prosecutors they had a case. They accused
the crew of the Huey of aggravated homicide and aggravated personal
injury, although they left open the question of whether the crew had
bombed the village on purpose or accidentally.</TE>
<TE>   Then, because the act was committed in a military setting, they turned
the case over to the air force to reopen its investigation of the
crew--Romero, Jimenez and Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   But the military made little progress in the investigation. Velasco,
the air force general, told reporters in Colombia that more than $1
million had been spent by unknown parties to manipulate evidence to make
his pilots appear responsible.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a year, fearing that the military was not conducting an
impartial investigation of itself, the civilian prosecutors asked to
regain control. The case has been tied up in jurisdictional wrangling
ever since. The most recent decision places the investigation in the
hands of the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The military was hiding the truth," said one former prosecutor who
was involved with the case. "We knew the investigation wouldn't happen if
it stayed with the military."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers for the men now say they believe that the bomb
fragments were not taken from townspeople, but guerrillas. Under this
theory, the guerrillas were killed after the cluster bomb dropped on them
in the jungle. Their comrades then transported the bodies into Santo
Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that there are no photos of the bodies during the
autopsies, that not much blood was found at the scene and that some of
the bodies arrived nude, perhaps meaning they were stripped to hide their
identity.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been too much international pressure to condemn these men,"
said Ernesto Villamizar, a top Bogota lawyer who represents one of the
pilots. "This is going to be a very long process, and at the end, the
truth will come out that the munitions dropped from this helicopter had
nothing to do with the deaths in Santo Domingo."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials also question whether the fragments analyzed by the
FBI actually came from the explosion in Santo Domingo, citing doubts over
the chain of custody.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI said, yes, this is a fragment, but that doesn't mean
anything," Velasco said. "There isn't any proof that these fragments were
really from there."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the charges against him, Romero has advanced in rank to
captain. Jimenez believes that he was denied promotion because of the
investigation. Nonetheless, both men are now regularly flying combat
missions with the Colombian air force.</TE>
<TE>   Romero continued to receive training in the U.S., despite strict
regulations that prevent instruction when there is even the suspicion of
human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy said Romero received a refresher flight-simulation
course at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, in September
2000--three months after the prosecutor's May ruling ordering an
investigation against him for possibly killing 18 civilians, and only one
month after the military reopened its investigation into the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials said they were unaware of the investigations at the
time of Romero's training. No formal system exists to exchange data
between the embassy and the prosecutor's office on suspected human rights
violators, and embassy officials say there are no plans to implement one.</TE>
<TE>An Error?</TE>
<TE>   For all the investigation that has been done, one central question
remains: If the Colombian air force did drop a cluster bomb on Santo
Domingo, was it deliberate or a mistake?</TE>
<TE>   Those who believe the bombing was a war crime point out that
visibility was perfect on Dec. 13, 1998, that the townspeople had clearly
signaled they were civilians, and that at least two helicopter pilots
testified they had seen them.</TE>
<TE>   So even if the pilots believed there were guerrillas in town, they had
to have known that innocent people would be killed if a bomb was dropped.
Finally, it is difficult to make such a mistake with an AN-M41, a simple
gravity bomb. To have hit Santo Domingo, the bomb had to have been
launched very close to it.</TE>
<TE>   "The military has never said it was an error. If it was a mistake, why
aren't they just admitting it?" said one lawyer monitoring the case who
did not want to be identified because of its sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the same facts also argue for the possibility of error.
Romero has always said he dropped the bomb 1,000 to 1,200 meters from the
town. Two other pilots, however, said they believed the bomb was dropped
between 500 and 600 meters from town.</TE>
<TE>   If Romero's helicopter was at the height and speed he said it was, the
bomb would have traveled about 500 meters from where he launched it,
according to an analysis done by the Federation of American Scientists,
using testimony from the case. That means that if Romero was heading in
the direction of the town, something he denies, the bombs easily could
have landed in Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   If it was an error, some believe, the Colombian military is still
culpable.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pretty fine line between intent and tragic accident," said
David Stahl, a Chicago attorney who is on the advisory board of the
Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University. "I
think what happened is the Colombian armed forces put themselves in a
situation where a tragic accident was all but certain to happen."</TE>
<TE>   There are still crucial details that could clear up the mystery. For
instance, the Huey pilots said they never flew over Santo Domingo. Romero
said the helicopter was north of the village and flying west. The
co-pilot said they dropped the bomb while heading northwest.</TE>
<TE>   But the pattern of the impacts found by civilian investigators, and
the recollections of survivors, contradicts that testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors say the helicopter that passed over the village just before
the explosion was traveling from south to north. The analysis by the
American scientists indicates the helicopter that dropped the bomb most
likely passed over the town, and was probably headed either northeast or
southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "The key discrepancy is the direction. You can't match [the pilots'
testimony about their direction] with the direction of the bomb," said
Michael Levi, a physicist who did the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans who worked for AirScan might be able to resolve the
confusion. But two lawyers involved with the case said AirScan has told
the military court that the men no longer work for the company and that
it has no information on their whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy officials, meanwhile, said they have never investigated what role
the company and its facilities might have played. Nonetheless, they
rejected any ties to the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "We're truly sorry about what happened--though we don't know the
details--but in no way can we feel that we have any responsibility,"
Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights advocates say the U.S. government is duty-bound to
conduct its own investigation into the role played by Orta and Denny.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the U.S. has not done that. After being asked by the
procuraduria's office, embassy officials in Bogota checked their records
and found that one of the men had registered his U.S. home address with
the embassy during a stay in Colombia. They refused to turn over that
information to Colombian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials said they are prevented by the Privacy Act from
releasing any information. But, they said, if they receive a request from
the prosecutor's office, which currently does not have jurisdiction over
the case, they might be able to help by working through existing
treaties.</TE>
<TE>   At least one State Department official has expressed reluctance to
pursue the U.S. pilots. "Our job is to protect Americans, not investigate
Americans," one human rights group quoted the official as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the embassy made much progress with promises it has made to
have a copy of the tape its diplomats viewed independently analyzed. In
1998, Kamman said the tape he had seen would be reviewed for further
analysis. Current Ambassador Anne W. Patterson made that same promise in
a letter to Leahy in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups find it strange that the United States, which has
urged Colombia for years to investigate possible human rights violations,
is not doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. government is serious about promoting human rights, we
think they have the legal duty to seriously investigate human rights
violations," Stahl said. "So far, we've been disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern's human rights center staged a mock trial of the Santo
Domingo incident in 2000. They found the Colombian government responsible
for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>Conclusion</TE>
<TE>   For most of the three years since the bombing, the people of Santo
Domingo were seen as liars, leftist sympathizers or guerrillas. It was
only in recent years that some government officials came to believe them.</TE>
<TE>   The tape proved to be an asset for them. The times and events
recounted by the townspeople--who never saw the tape until recently and
could not have known what it contained--are consistent with what the tape
shows. The tape does show people with white material above their heads or
in white clothing wandering the streets during the morning. The red truck
does suffer damage between 9:45 and 10:10 a.m. And people can be seen
loading what appear to be bodies onto a truck about 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are inconsistencies among the more than two dozen
witnesses. Some say the bomb that struck Santo Domingo left a trail of
smoke--an accurate description of the Skyfire rockets that other
helicopters were firing at the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   The tape does not corroborate the account of machine-gun bursts from a
helicopter as the injured fled town in the flatbed truck. Though there
are small holes in the road where the people said the helicopter fired at
them, the video does not show the truck driver swerving, nor dirt or
concrete being kicked up.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the town held a ceremony to commemorate the third
anniversary. There was a small parade, and one of the judges of the
informal tribunal at Northwestern University flew in from Chicago.
Victims and human rights workers gave speeches in the main square of
Tame, the biggest nearby town.</TE>
<TE>   Some families have split over the stress of lost children, shattered
lives and the fight for recognition. Margarita Tilano and Olimpo Cardenas
separated, for example, and now live in different towns.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Castillo's husband left soon after her death, and her baby girl,
now 3, is being cared for by relatives. Alba Garcia lives with her
grandmother in a nearby town.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those who remain in Santo Domingo dismiss the investigations.
A civil suit is inching along, filed by 24 of the families. The average
claim seeks damages of $5,000. The biggest is for $43,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We want there to be justice, for sure," said Maria Panqueva, the
drugstore owner. "But we have lost the most beautiful thing we had: the
trust in what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Still others are worried about the future. For three years now, the
people of Santo Domingo have challenged the Colombian military.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of defiance may be enough to make them targets of Colombia's
violent paramilitary groups, which have recently moved into Arauca,
allegedly with the support of local military officers.</TE>
<TE>   The groups are known for the massacres of civilians they accuse of
being rebel sympathizers. So far, Santo Domingo has not been touched. But
in the surrounding area, more than 60 people have been killed by
paramilitary fighters since August, allegedly including Riveros, the
witness, and a congressional representative.</TE>
<TE>   Those who remain in Santo Domingo worry about what nightmares may
come.</TE>
<TE>   "I have talked and talked and talked and talked. I have talked to
investigators, to the military, to the press, to human rights groups. And
I have told everyone the same thing," said Tilano, who lost a child and
two grandchildren in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to do justice, do your work well," she said, "so there
will be no more massacres of children, so defenseless people won't be
killed, so they don't shoot at us anymore."</TE>

<DH>Health: Chronic wasting disease spurs officials to take drastic
measures, turning some elk ranches into death camps. A big grave is dug
for family's dream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STONEHAM, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>Every time the backhoe bites into the hard, dry prairie of the All
American Antler Ranch, Craig McConnell winces as if the iron claw was
ripping open his own belly.</LD>
<LD>   Seven hundred tawny elk cluster beneath a blue horizon that seems to
reach into forever, like the ocean. The animals fidget as the machine
growls and the hole grows deeper, wider.</LD>
<LD>   McConnell takes a blind step backward and stumbles against bundles of
fence posts.</LD>
<TE>   Soon the posts will become the crackling pyre on which McConnell's
herd and his own celebrity as Colorado's "Mr. Elk"--you can read it on
the license plates on his enormous truck--will be torched by government
farm agents.</TE>
<TE>   "They're digging a big grave," McConnell shouts into a howling wind
that blasts his face with grit and diesel. "I'm losing my livelihood
today--$4 million down into that hole."</TE>
<TE>   At the AAA, it's a showdown between modern science and the legacy of
the American West. All because of the latest version of mad cow
disease--chronic wasting disease, CWD, which strikes deer and elk instead
of cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Although mad cow disease has not been seen in the United States, CWD
was first described 25 years ago. Once a campfire topic among hunters,
it's become a "front-burner" public health concern, experts say, as
demand grows for lean game meat and Asian folk medicines made with antler
velvet.</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting disease is not known to jump from deer and elk to
cattle or people. But scientists say that cannot be ruled out. Until the
1980s, no one thought mad cow disease could strike people either.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell acknowledges losing one animal to CWD. But state officials
say they have traced at least five sickened animals to his ranch, and
they believe he tried to hide other CWD evidence, a suggestion he hotly
denies.</TE>
<TE>   He has shipped elk to breeders as far east as Pennsylvania. Those
animals are being traced, and if necessary, eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that we eradicate it right here or it's likely to
spread," says Colorado assistant state veterinarian Keith Roehr, who
supervises the dirty work.</TE>
<TE>   State veterinarians will euthanize and incinerate elk rounded up from
McConnell's four quarantined ranches. Crews already have carried out this
scorched-earth policy at two other sites in Colorado. Ultimately, 1,500
farm elk from seven ranches will be killed and burned like hundreds of
thousands of cattle in Europe, 6,000 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   There, the beef industry has been devastated by mad cow--bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. More than 100 people have been
diagnosed with the incurable human form of it, variant Creutzfeld-Jakob
Disease. They had eaten tainted beef.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, mad cow turned up in Japan, reigniting beef fears.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest threat in this country at the moment is from wild
deer, with an estimated 15% infected. Government biologists have begun
shooting thousands of deer in parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, South
Dakota and Kansas. This winter, CWD was detected in three deer in
Wisconsin, the first wild cases to jump the Mississippi River.</TE>
<TE>   About 1% of wild elk are infected. Last week, biologists at Rocky
Mountain National Park, where viewing wildlife up close is a big draw for
tourists, confirmed that one of the park's 3,000 elk had died of CWD.
Tests show 5% of the park's mule deer are infected too.</TE>
<TE>   Ranch elk could be at even higher risk. In the last five years, CWD
has popped up at 15 elk ranches in five states and Saskatchewan, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   All spongiform diseases incubate for many years and display wretched
symptoms: tiny holes in the brain, emaciation, slobbering and wobbling,
then death.</TE>
<TE>   Today's feedlots concentrate thousands of animals, and interstate
trucking spreads infectious agents in hours. Left unchecked, even a
slow-acting spongiform disease could become a biological prairie fire,
experts fear.</TE>
<TE>   There is no economical live test for it. So all exposed animals are
killed as a precaution, even though they appear healthy.</TE>
<TE>   On the McConnell ranch, the killing hole is as large as a house
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Behind a white privacy curtain, the elk are lethally injected, then
beheaded for brain samples. The remains are cremated. Bellows fan the
flames to 2,500 degrees, creating a portable blast furnace that could
forge steel.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it be smoky? Will it smell?" asks McConnell's wife, Noreen. As
petite as her husband is lanky, she favors full denim skirts and sweeps
her long brown hair into a bun.</TE>
<TE>   While her husband paces, she extends a plate of brownies--"I bake when
I'm nervous"--and pours iced tea. Her hospitality can't defuse the
tension.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect that it will be," Roehr replies, stroking his floppy brown
mustache.</TE>
<TE>   "We can euthanize 100 animals a day. But we can't eliminate them that
quickly. The equipment can't keep up."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine the AAA being the epicenter of anything.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is 25 miles from the last irrigation pivot, six miles from
the nearest pavement. It's sandy, lonesome country marked by a few
strands of barbed wire and "No Trespassing" signs painted on bald tires.</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of years, these High Plains belonged to bison and the
Indians who followed them.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant farmers like Noreen's forebears busted the sod with iron
plows. But this is not Iowa; 13 inches of rain is normal.</TE>
<TE>   Once furrowed, the life just drained from the prairie. Dust storms and
grasshoppers chased off homesteaders. The railroads abandoned spur lines,
and towns like Stoneham were swallowed by the silence.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell left as a young geologist to seek his fortune in the Alaska
oil fields. He returned in the 1980s to punch cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Logical choice. Nearby billboards remind drowsy drivers that "Nothing
Satisfies Like Beef!"</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, it's a $50-billion industry with cattle outnumbering
ranched elk 1,000 to 1. For 96 straight Januarys, Denver has hosted the
Super Bowl of livestock auctions; the grand champion steer is primped
like a supermodel to command six-figure bids.</TE>
<TE>   Decades after the Dust Bowl, however, this marginal land hasn't become
any more forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, a struggling McConnell bought five breeding elk.</TE>
<TE>   It was ecologically sensible. Elk are native Plains animals; they'll
eat spiny weeds that cattle wouldn't consider. Soon McConnell was
grossing $300 an acre. His elk herd swelled.</TE>
<TE>   Noreen turned their home into a dude ranch. The guest book bulged with
the compliments of visitors--and investors--from 49 states and 27
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The McConnells built a two-story headquarters with a family apartment
and an indoor auction stage. One sale drew 350 bidders, more than twice
the population of Stoneham.</TE>
<TE>   Even better, elk enabled the McConnells to live as cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell and his eldest son, Brandon, packed revolvers to shoot
rattlesnakes as they strung miles of tall fence. Sometimes they forgot
their manners and wore their holsters at the dinner table, astonishing
citified guests.</TE>
<TE>   "I nearly wore out Brandon's shoulder driving 60 fence posts an hour,"
McConnell recalled. "No wonder he left for fiber optics."</TE>
<TE>   What brought it all crashing down?</TE>
<TE>   A Jekyll-and-Hyde protein called a prion, invisible to all but an
electron microscope.</TE>
<TE>   It was considered heresy in 1982 when prions were suggested as the
villain behind spongiform diseases. Nobody knows exactly what prions do.
They vary slightly between species; a human prion differs by 30 amino
acids from a cow prion.</TE>
<TE>   When a prion goes bad, it adopts a twisted shape that seems to control
the pace of infection and the rate of brain changes.</TE>
<TE>   How prions spread remains a mystery. Unlike bacteria or viruses,
prions do not appear to have their own genetic material.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, scientists believe a mutant prion acts as a template
that other prions mimic. Disinfectants and microwaves won't kill them,
and they aren't digested.</TE>
<TE>   "Science does not have an all-knowing grasp on the problem," said
Dorothy Preslar of the Washington-based Federation of American
Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting disease was identified in 1977 when graduate student
Elizabeth Williams saw tiny holes in brain samples from deer and elk that
looked suspiciously like scrapie in sheep. "When we heard about prions
later on, it was obvious," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Williams diagnoses animal diseases for the Wyoming state
veterinary laboratory in Laramie. The squat, octagonal blockhouse has
been encircled by razor wire since the anthrax attacks last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Williams' dark, narrow office is dominated by a large painting
of a vulture pecking at a meaty buffalo skull. For added realism,
pranksters glue dead flies to the artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Under 400-times magnification, a slide of infected deer brain shows
clumps of abnormal proteins and tiny holes amid healthy cells.</TE>
<TE>   "This animal probably was quite ill," Williams says. "They develop
these characteristics late in the incubation."</TE>
<TE>   It's a necessary chore that distracts her from more troublesome
outbreaks, like E. coli and salmonella. But working the killing hole
would be worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes killing healthy animals," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Where did it start? Some believe CWD is endemic. Or, it might have
been sparked during a nutritional study by Colorado biologists in the
late 1960s in which sheep were penned with deer. Three dozen deer died,
while others were returned to the wild or sold to zoos.</TE>
<TE>   Critics point out that interspecies transmission is difficult. Mad cow
and the human version, it is believed, occurred after infected carcasses
were used in livestock feed.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has set aside $12.5 million for CWD losses.
McConnell said he is fighting for "100% compensation" and calculates his
share to be at least $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   His ranch must remain CWD-free for five years. He plans to reintroduce
what didn't work here before--cattle. Or maybe bison.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the yak people calling," he adds. Would he then be called
Mr. Yak? (Note: The license plate is available.)</TE>
<TE>   Harder to replace will be a way of life. McConnell's youngest son,
Brolin, planned to raise elk and extend the family's High Plains
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that's shot out of the saddle," Noreen McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   She started thinking about the cake for Brolin's upcoming 16th
birthday, then paused to look out the window at the backhoe working the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   Deeper. Wider.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going ahead with the party," Noreen decided. "But I think I'll
put a curtain over that window."</TE>

<HD>Financial Ills Plague Public Colleges</HD>
<DH>Education: Stung by the recession, state systems nationwide hike
tuition, cut course offerings, limit enrollment and reduce faculty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many public colleges and universities around the country are caught
in financial squeezes, prompting midyear tuition increases and
belt-tightening measures such as enrollment caps and faculty cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The financial problems stem from strains on state budgets due to the
slow national economy over the last year and a bulge in the number of
youths reaching college age.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time in the modern history of higher education that
we've had enrollment pressure and a bad economy at the same time," said
Patrick M. Callan, president of the nonprofit National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education in San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   Among the consequences: The University of Wisconsin system nine days
ago stopped admitting new students and later froze hiring, amid a budget
squabble between regents and lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst last week announced that it
will eliminate seven of its 29 varsity sports teams. That follows an
array of earlier cutbacks, including early retirement initiatives to thin
the ranks of professors.</TE>
<TE>   During recent months, some hard-pressed state schools, including
universities in Ohio and Missouri, have taken the unusual tack of
imposing midyear tuition increases.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where lawmakers are struggling to plug a projected
$17.5-billion gap in the state budget, the initial money-saving maneuvers
have been comparatively gentle on higher education, especially at the
four-year schools.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some community college systems were heading for trouble even
before the recent state budget meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is the Los Angeles Community College District, which has
seen a spike in enrollment over the last four years. Administrators there
are considering eliminating scores of classes, hoping to hold enrollment
to 130,000. That effectively would mean turning away an estimated 10,000
to 17,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really at the end of the rope," said Marshall "Mark" Drummond,
chancellor of the nine-campus district.</TE>
<TE>   For the current school year, a College Board survey found that tuition
at public schools--which serve more than three-quarters of the nation's
estimated 15 million college students--was up 7.7%. That was the biggest
jump since 1993, and a blow to students and families already hurt by the
sluggish national economy.</TE>
<TE>   But at many campuses even heftier increases are coming for next year,
and some schools have resorted to midyear hikes. At the University of
Cincinnati, part of Ohio's state university system, tuition rose 8% in
June. Then, after the school year started in the fall, two more boosts
totaling an additional 6% were imposed, bringing the annual cost to
$6,175.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a sort of contract with students about what they expect to
pay for the year," grumbled Robert E. Richardson Jr., an electrical
engineering major and the student body president at University of
Cincinnati. In the middle of a school year, he said, "that shouldn't be
dealt to us. We shouldn't have to take the financial burden for what the
state didn't do" to finance higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said he has heard from students who are reducing their
course loads, working longer hours in their part-time jobs or getting
bigger loans to offset the extra tuition costs.</TE>
<TE>   For students at hard-pressed schools, higher education experts say,
scholarship dollars are likely to be less plentiful. That would continue
a long-running trend in which low-income students and others rely
increasingly on loans to finance their educations.</TE>
<TE>   The coming school year also is expected to bring more crowded
classrooms. That's worrisome for students like Dylan Lee Lehrke, an
international studies major at the University of Washington in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already really hard to get into classes, and when you do get
into them they're really large," said Lehrke, 23. "Our faculty are
already stretched really thin."</TE>
<TE>   A bill awaiting the signature of Washington Gov. Gary Locke would
reduce the state's higher education funding by 5% and would permit
tuition for resident undergraduate students to rise by as much as 16%.</TE>
<TE>   To a lesser extent, private schools and their students also are
feeling the financial pinch. Although some of the nation's most elite
schools are cushioned by ample endowment funds, other private schools
with more modest resources are receiving fewer and smaller donations from
their financial supporters.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time a wave of recession has crashed on
campuses. In the early 1990s, California's public colleges and
universities endured spending cuts, declining enrollments and cost
increases for students. This time around, the state's four-year schools
mostly have been spared.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, California officials say they don't expect attendance
costs to go up for most students in the state's systems. The exception is
students who aren't California residents; they are expected to be hit
with higher charges from both the University of California and California
State University systems.</TE>
<TE>   University officials in California acknowledge, however, that the
financial outlook could darken once work on the state's 2002-03 budget
intensifies in May. Lawmakers will be looking for an additional $5
billion in state spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Historically well-funded schools such as those in California may be
able to survive a lean year or two without much damage, Callan said, but
then they too will face trouble. "We were getting more than our fair
share, but all of a sudden [the economy] turned on us."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, states increased funding for higher education
for the current school year by an average of just 4.6%, the smallest rise
in five years, according to one study. Higher education spending now is
under even more pressure as legislators seek to pare state budgets for
the coming year, despite signs that the nation is pulling out of
recession.</TE>
<TE>   The hard times are hitting campuses now because swings in state
revenue typically lag the performance of the overall economy. State
governments during the second half of last year suffered their first
revenue decline in nearly a decade, according to the Nelson A.
Rockefeller Institute of Government, the public policy research arm of
the State University of New York.</TE>
<TE>   For many state legislatures, higher education is an easier target than
prisons, Medicare, welfare and kindergarten-through-12th-grade education.</TE>
<TE>   By slashing higher education, "You're not throwing kids out on the
street. You're not starving people. You're not throwing them out of
hospitals. You're perhaps degrading higher education, but that just
doesn't have the same impact," said Nicholas W. Jenny, senior policy
analyst with the Rockefeller Institute.</TE>
<TE>   States such as Oregon, Idaho, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and
South Carolina are considering, or already have enacted, higher education
spending reductions or tuition increases--or both.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Massachusetts' flagship campus in Amherst last week
decided to eliminate varsity sports teams including men's and women's
gymnastics, men's tennis and women's water polo and volleyball by year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   That move, which is expected to reduce the athletic department's
budget by $500,000 to $1 million annually, follows two early retirement
programs that could slash perhaps 80 faculty positions, along with other
campus staff jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the school is considering or already has imposed caps on
enrollment in popular majors including economics, communications and
biology, as well as for the honors program.</TE>
<TE>   Unless there is a turnaround in the state's budget, the outlook for
next school year is grim, said Ernest D. May, secretary of the
university's faculty senate. Many students, he said, "will not be getting
courses they want, they'll not be able to get the professors they want,
and they'll not be able to get the majors they want."</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, budget-slashing proposals prompted the university system
to abruptly halt student admissions, leaving thousands of high-schoolers
and would-be transfer students in the lurch.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature then made further cuts, bringing the proposed higher
education reduction to $108 million overall. Then the university
administration imposed a systemwide hiring freeze.</TE>
<TE>   High school students are feeling the pain as well. At Oshkosh West
High School in the industrial city of Oshkosh, Wis., about 80 miles
northwest of Milwaukee, some of the students on admissions waiting lists
could find themselves out of luck if there is no thaw in the admissions
freeze, said guidance counselor Cecil Streeter.</TE>
<TE>   Streeter said he is particularly concerned about high school
sophomores and juniors who have planned, through a program coordinated
with the state university system, to take courses next year providing
both high school and college credit.</TE>
<TE>   These dual-credit courses are on hold amid the admissions freeze. If
there is no thaw by the time the high schools need to finish their
schedules in June, "we could be in serious trouble," Streeter said.</TE>

<HD>EU Will Open Its Energy Markets</HD>
<DH>Summit: The deal, which will take effect by 2004, is limited to
commercial sector. Blair praises 'change of gear.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain
</DL>
<LD>European Union leaders agreed here Saturday to reforms designed to
make their economies more competitive, though resistance from France
produced a proposal to open the alliance's energy markets by 2004 only in
the commercial sector.</LD>
<LD>   Conducted within a security cordon of about 15,000 police, the
Barcelona economic summit was the first in a year that has seen the
introduction of a single European currency, the euro, and the assumption
of the EU's rotating presidency by the Spanish government.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting was symptomatic of a curious contradiction: Even as Europe
drifts further from the United States because of tensions over foreign
policy, leaders are undertaking economic changes that will make the
region more closely resemble the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The agreements in Barcelona amounted to an economic "change of gear,"
an enthusiastic British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday. Even
center-left governments accept that markets will have to be opened and
competition stimulated to achieve the lofty official goal of making
Europe's economy "the most competitive in the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been an idea that the European social model is about more and
more regulation, is about state control, is about an old-fashioned
attitude toward science and technology," Blair said. "The discussion of
economic policy at this summit might be a world away from the type of
discussion" five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As Blair spoke, a massive police deployment in this prosperous coastal
city prepared for a third day of protest marches, which so far had
produced only minor street clashes. Caravans of armored vehicles, riot
squad vans and police sentries armed with heavy weapons filled the
elegant, tree-lined boulevards that flow down urban hills to the
Mediterranean. Authorities were on guard against a triple threat of
Islamic and Basque terrorists and violent opponents of globalization such
as those who wreaked havoc at international finance meetings in Genoa,
Italy, and Seattle in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In ironic counterpoint to the EU ideal of erasing borders, security
fears caused Spain to temporarily reinstate during the two-day summit the
border passport checks that were eliminated for travel within the EU
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from attending to the safety of its guests, the center-right
government of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar played a decisive
role in the political configuration shaping the debate here. After years
of social democratic dominance in the union, the new push for U.S.-style
free market policies has been led by Spain, Britain and the center-right
government of Italy.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, Aznar has overseen an impressive boom, eliminating budget
deficits, sustaining high growth rates and creating, according to
official figures, 590,000 jobs in the last two years alone. The pragmatic
Aznar has used the EU presidency to tout the Spanish model and promote
policies that are tough on terrorism and more closely aligned with the
United States than those of many other European administrations. Peers
praised Aznar on Saturday for winning advances on an economic agenda that
had been stalled for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a process that had been paralyzed in many respects," Aznar
told reporters. "What we have done in Barcelona is unblock it and make it
irreversible."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the center-left governments of France and Germany proved
that they are still a formidable power axis. France, in particular,
resisted efforts to throw open European energy markets to full
competition by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France
attended the summit at a delicate political moment: They are opposing
each other in a presidential election next month. Both adamantly defended
France's view that energy is a vital public service that must be
carefully protected from the vagaries of the market.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the French won a compromise. The EU's 15 leaders agreed to
liberalize electricity markets by 2004 for industrial consumers but not
for households.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy's Talks Continue in Mideast</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Israel says Sharon is to discuss a cease-fire with
Palestinians today but later retracts statement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni held a second day of separate meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat on Saturday amid quickening efforts to broker a
cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Israel said that Sharon was willing to meet with top Palestinian
officials to declare a cease-fire in the deadliest fighting between the
two sides in decades. Palestinian officials said they too wanted a truce
but would not meet with the Israelis until the army pulls out of
Palestinian territories it has entered in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli forces have withdrawn from several cities but remain
entrenched in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   Israel may have jumped the gun by issuing an announcement that Sharon
would open cease-fire talks today with senior Palestinian officials. The
announcement from Sharon's office followed Zinni's late Saturday visit
with the prime minister at his farm in southern Israel's Negev desert.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Palestinians insisting that they could not participate
because of the Israeli military presence on their land, and with American
officials suggesting that the Israeli statement was premature, Sharon's
office later issued a clarification. No meeting had been agreed upon for
today, the new statement said, but Zinni would continue in his efforts to
broker a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's statements appeared to be an effort to pressure the
Palestinians into joining talks even though the conditions they set forth
had not been fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, the Palestinian Authority's culture and information
minister and a spokesman for Arafat, accused Israel of pulling a fast one
and of "lying" to impress Zinni. Abed-Rabbo reiterated his government's
insistence that Israeli forces be out of the West Bank and Gaza before
Palestinian officials sit down to talk.</TE>
<TE>   If talks do get started, it will be an important step in pulling the
two sides back from a conflict raging seemingly out of control. The last
two weeks were the deadliest yet in nearly 18 months of fighting, as
Israel launched a massive military assault on Palestinian refugee camps
and towns, and Palestinians staged a string of suicide bombings and
shooting ambushes.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 20% of all the people killed in the conflict died in the last
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Israel came under unusual criticism from its strongest ally, the
United States, which demanded a full withdrawal from Palestinian areas.
Scenes of massive roundups of young Palestinian men, blindfolded and with
their arms marked with numbers, triggered an outcry among human rights
organizations here and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military operations, with a stated goal of wiping out
terrorism, did little to improve Sharon's political position. Under
pressure to restore security to his citizens, the prime minister saw his
popularity ratings drop again precipitously in weekend polls. In one
survey, only 35% of respondents said they thought that he was doing a
good job--even though the same poll showed huge support for the army's
raids on refugee camps.</TE>
<TE>   If a cease-fire is agreed to, Israel wants to move quickly into a
security plan drafted last year by CIA Director George J. Tenet. It calls
for the Palestinian Authority to confiscate weapons and arrest terrorist
suspects. Israel would be required to pull its troops back to lines that
existed before the current conflict erupted in September 2000, which
would mean dismantling numerous roadblocks and outposts.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians want to add political issues to the discussion and
not limit it to security matters. Israel is resisting that.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous cease-fires declared in the past have collapsed.</TE>

<HD>Herb Lures Tourists to Mexico for Legal Mind-Bending Trip</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Salvia divinorum, a relative of mint, is more powerful than
peyote. Mazatec Indians use it for sacred ceremonies and healing, but it
can be dangerous.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>HUAUTLA DE JIMENEZ, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>This sweltering corner of the Sierra Mazateca Mountains has seen
some unusual visitors lately, thanks to a fern-like plant with thick
stems and fluffy leaves.</LD>
<LD>   A British businessman showed up with a sack of pesos, asking to trade
them for a sack of leaves. A Spanish importer offered a theater-style TV
and satellite service in exchange for three seedlings. A couple from
Mexico City spent four days asking questions, learning how to dry the
plant's stems and extract its bitter juice.</LD>
<LD>   All were trying to grab a piece of the small but growing market for
Salvia divinorum, a legal hallucinogen that packs a more powerful
psychedelic punch than peyote, psyllocybin mushrooms or any other natural
hallucinogen.</LD>
<TE>   "More and more people come here and ask to try it. Others ask me how
they can grow it," said Alejandro Martinez, a 24-year-old student who
grows more than 700 Salvia plants next to a mountain stream. "I had
coffee plants, but now I'm planting Pastora. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Known to locals as "Maria Pastora," or "Mary the Shepherdess," Salvia
is a member of the mint family and a distant relative of cooking sage
that grows naturally only around Mazatec Indian settlements in this
remote corner of Oaxaca state.</TE>
<TE>   Internet sites around the world hawk the herb as "legal ecstasy,"
boast of its wild popularity on the streets of New York's Greenwich
Village and encourage would-be buyers to experience a Salvia trip before
authorities declare it illegal.</TE>
<TE>   But for dozens of Mazatec healers, Salvia is a powerful and sacred
plant with curative powers and frightening mind-altering effects.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to be very delicate with Pastora. It is the most dangerous
plant we have," said Aurelia Catarino Oseguera, a 56-year-old shaman who
speaks only Mazatec. "It opens doors in your head that let you see God,
and that can be frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Users say Salvia can produce vivid hallucinations and out-of-body
experiences, but can make them feel like inanimate objects and cause
short-term memory loss.</TE>
<TE>   Its unpredictable effects make even regular users nervous. One
Internet chat room participant warned those trying Salvia to be ready for
"the most intense experience humanly possible next to death."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a party drug. It's a drug that takes you to a very deep
and introspective place, and that's not always a fun place to be," said
Daniel Siebert, creator of a Malibu-based Web site devoted to selling and
researching Salvia.</TE>
<TE>   "With high doses, its effects happen so fast and are so intense that
you don't have time to really understand what's going on and you spend
your time trying to get back to reality."</TE>
<TE>   The Mazatecs believe that people who disrespect an animal, a river or
any other feature of nature can find themselves cursed with illness. They
must seek the advice of a shaman who offers patients psyllocybin
mushrooms or Salvia to discover what they did wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Herbal healers say rubbing Salvia on skin can heal burns and make
scars disappear. They say wearing the sage on the head for 20 minutes can
cure any headache.</TE>
<TE>   "For our ancestors, Pastora was the most important plant there was,"
said Arturo Ortiz, a 38-year-old healer whose one-room shack is cluttered
with an assortment of pickle jars filled with herbal concoctions for
afflictions from foot pain to cardiac arrest. "Its juices have more power
to heal than outsiders can understand."</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1960s, this scruffy coffee-growing city of 50,000 has
been famous in hard-drugging circles, attracting thousands of hippies
looking for a shaman to guide them on a magical mushroom trip.</TE>
<TE>   The promise of psychedelic romps brought Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones
and Pete Townsend to Huautla. Locals even swear that the Beatles arrived
here by helicopter to celebrate Ringo Starr's birthday in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   But fresh mushrooms are available only during the rainy season between
May and August. Four-foot-high Salvia plants grow year-round.</TE>
<TE>   Catarino has overseen the mushroom trips of hundreds of foreigners
inside a fiberglass-roofed barn plastered with statues and pictures of
Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. She said so many tourists have come
asking for Salvia recently that she now refuses to give it out.</TE>
<TE>   "When you die, everyone has to pay for what they did in life," said
Catarino, who still grows Salvia in her garden to treat sick neighbors.
"If I give Pastora to people who don't need it, I will pay for it and be
punished when I die."</TE>
<TE>   Salvia's burgeoning popularity has spawned a cottage industry of local
coffee farmers who grow the plant for export, said Juan Campos, an
anthropologist at the National Indigenous Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some evidence that ritual use is declining and that some
Mazatecs are growing the plant for sale," he said, adding that shipping
the sage out of the country is legal as long as exporters obtain a permit
from Mexico's forestry service.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, the student who makes extra money pairing tourists with
their desired drug, said he meets five foreigners a week who are looking
for Salvia.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago nobody wanted Pastora," he said. "Wait two more years
and everyone is going to be like me: They are going to be selling it to
lots of people."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez offers foreigners the eight to 30 Salvia leaves it takes to
get high for $5.50.</TE>
<TE>   On Internet sites from Madison, Wis., to Manchester, England, an ounce
of 100-200 leaves fetches up to $120.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said the longer the sage stays legal, the more people will
come here looking for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The attitude now is, 'Why not try it?' " he said. "Many of us hope
that doesn't change."</TE>

<HD>Songbirds Are High Note for Afghans</HD>
<DH>Culture: A native passion is flourishing again, a testament to
people's longing to escape the misery of their war-torn lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The south side of Kabul is a desolate place--bomb-blasted
buildings, mud streets and houses like medieval hovels--but its narrow
and decrepit passageways are once again home to an Afghan passion that
lightens the harsh days: singing birds.</LD>
<LD>   Electricity, running water and plumbing are unknown here.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, little seems different from the days of the repressive Taliban
regime. But the air is filled with bird song.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of shops, each no more than a single room, lean toward the
streets looking as if they might collapse at any moment were it not for
the towers of caged birds that fill each to the ceiling and wash the air
with music. Chattering canaries and parakeets, cooing doves, robins,
chirping chickadees and the sweet-singing mountain nightingale compete
for attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban came here and hit me with wire cables for selling my
birds," Nur Ahmed, 80, said on a recent day. "I said: 'What else can I do
for a living? I am an old man. I have no teeth, and I've been selling
birds for 40 years. I cannot learn something new.' "</TE>
<TE>   One of the odder of the Taliban's legion of rules was its mandate that
Afghans give up their centuries-old custom of keeping songbirds. Rooted
in courtly tradition, in which kings kept both hunting birds for sport
and singing birds--usually confined in ornamental gardens--to entertain
guests, the practice long ago spread to even the poorest of Afghan homes.</TE>
<TE>   But to the fundamentalist Taliban, bird song was a distraction from
the only meritorious song, the reading of the Koran. And with a sort of
Islamic twist on animal rights, the regime decreed that God intended
birds to be free. Talibs strode through bird markets forcing shopkeepers
to open their cages. When the Talibs found people who kept birds at home,
they forced the owners to free those too.</TE>
<TE>   However, because many of the birds were raised in captivity, freeing
them meant that they perched in trees--confused, starving and easy prey
for cats and dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Now the native passion for birds is openly flourishing again. Its
perseverance even in these economically difficult times serves as
testimony to people's deep longing for something that can lift them out
of the devastation of their war-torn lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I am jobless, but I have to buy a bird today and my family does not
mind, because if we do not have birds, we will have a bad mental
condition," said Jan Mohammed, 22, who was purchasing a saira, a small
bird from the thrush family with a red marking on its head whose chirping
call is believed to say, "Allah, just you."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many people in this country, Mohammed--who already owned two
sairas--has had personal contact with violence and grief. He lost three
cousins in the fighting here in the last eight years, two during
skirmishes between moujahedeen warlords and one in a battle with the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "During all this fighting, the people of Afghanistan have lived with a
lot of turmoil. These were dark days and we felt very bad, and because of
that we want to forget everything. When people hear the birds sing, they
can dream," Mohammed said.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, birds are at once a reminder of a more peaceful time
and a source of music where the sounds of gunfire and mortars are more
familiar than any melody.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to spend my life with birds, I like the singing, and when I
come home tired and cold, if I hear the sound of my birds I will forget
everything," said Mohammed Hassan, a slender bird seller with a lined
face who looked far older than his 65 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I had four sons, but I lost three in the fighting. And I have one
left. He likes birds too but not to keep at home," he said sadly.</TE>
<TE>   Many younger people, however, do share Hassan's passion. Some, like
Jan Mohammed, buy birds for peace of mind. Others view them as both a
pleasure and a way to make money. They buy canaries, breed them at home
and then sell their offspring at the bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   Some canaries, especially the one known here as the warbling "Polish"
canary, are particularly prized. A "Polish" canary sells for as much as
$7--and, with the exception of the nightingale, is among the most
expensive birds sold here.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul, the capital, supports two bird markets, while smaller
provincial towns generally have only one. Many of the older bird sellers
and bird keepers remember a time when people imitated the royal tradition
and kept birds as a kind of decorative element in their homes, making
bird selling a busy trade.</TE>
<TE>   "For hundreds of years, the kings of Afghanistan kept birds in
greenhouses along with the best flowers," said Shir Agha Omar, the
director of the Kabul Zoo and himself a bird lover. "Rich people imitated
that tradition and built greenhouses where the birds could fly free . . .
or they put them in very large, fancy cages. Often, these greenhouses
were near their guest house, so that visitors could enjoy them."</TE>
<TE>   Omar's greenhouse was destroyed during the moujahedeen fighting. Now,
he says, he has only a small home: half for his family and half for his
birds and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The addictive quality of birds is well known among Afghans, be they
buyers or sellers.</TE>
<TE>   "Birds are like cigarettes. Once you have one, you will have them the
rest of your life," said Khodadost, 45, a bird seller who specializes in
mountain nightingales--birds with a sweet trill that is easy on the ear.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their relationship to fighting birds--which are also beloved by
Afghans and sell for far more money--bird keepers seem to develop a
special bond with their songbirds. Perhaps that's because for so long,
birds were the only thing in people's lives that seemed to hold a promise
of better times.</TE>
<TE>   One man, Shirnagha, now has a small shop in the old bird market in
Kabul, where he sells blue, green and yellow parakeets as well as
pigeons. He used to be a farmer on the rich Shomali plain, about an
hour's drive north of the city. But the Taliban laid siege to that area,
driving out its inhabitants and ruining its gardens and orchards.</TE>
<TE>   The day rocket-propelled grenades began landing at his house,
Shirnagha fled to a neighbor's home. But as the hours wore on, he became
increasingly anxious about the 40 birds he had left behind. When darkness
fell, he crept back and went around his house collecting his cages.</TE>
<TE>   "Then terrible fighting started again and I could only gather 10 of my
birds, and the rockets were falling all around and I had to escape," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That was five years ago, but the memory haunts him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened to my other birds. I loved them very much.
I am still thinking about them. Were they killed by rockets? Nobody was
there to feed them or give them water. Maybe cats and dogs ate them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Afghans are very poor," Shirnagha explained, "and their hearts
are breaking because they have lost someone they know in the fighting and
they have lost their houses and their gardens. The only way they can
forget their sadness is to listen to the singing of their birds."</TE>
<TE>   'When people hear the birds sing, they can dream.'</TE>

<HD>Peru Under a New Dark Cloud</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Poverty and joblessness prove to be as much a test
for the increasingly unpopular President Toledo as any graft cooked up by
former leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>This nation's true-life soap opera, a saga of bribes, lies and
videotape, has finally gone into reruns. The intelligence chief who
blackmailed much of the Peruvian political elite with secretly recorded
tapes is completing his ninth month behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Democracy is flowering again--which means angry crowds are free to
take to the streets nearly every working day to demand jobs and food. And
Peruvians can say openly how little they think of their new president,
Alejandro Toledo, a hero of the battle against the regime of discredited
President Alberto Fujimori.</LD>
<LD>   Poverty and unemployment are proving to be as much a test to Peru's
fragile democracy as any plot cooked up by Vladimiro Montesinos, the
jailed spymaster who, along with Fujimori, transformed Peru during the
1990s into a Kafkaesque empire of venality and fear.</LD>
<TE>   "People think that if you restore democracy after 10 years of
corruption, then automatically everyone will have work," Toledo said in a
recent interview with editors and reporters in New York. "This is a
difficult mission to complete."</TE>
<TE>   When Toledo plays host to President Bush here this month, he will do
so with one of the lowest overall approval ratings of any Latin American
leader: about 30%, according to two recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo blames Montesinos for many of his difficulties, saying the
ex-spy remains a dark force undermining efforts at recovery and reform.
The president argues that Montesinos still wields influence over judges,
television stations and reporters--even from prison, where he is awaiting
trial on dozens of corruption and homicide charges.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is a meshuggena," the U.S.-educated Toledo said in New York,
using a Yiddish word for a crazy person. "He goes to court, and he has
the supreme judges by the you-know-where."</TE>
<TE>Polls Find High Disapproval Ratings</TE>
<TE>   But Peruvians appear more worried about Toledo. They wonder if the
president, who proved so adept at organizing the street protests that
helped end the reign of Montesinos and Fujimori, can run a country.</TE>
<TE>   According to a poll by Apoyo, a Lima-based firm, 62% of respondents
disapprove of Toledo's performance as president. A similar poll by the
University of Lima found that 63% of respondents were disaffected. It is
an astonishing fall for a man who won a resounding election victory last
June.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't that worried about corruption anymore," said Augusto
Alvarez Rodrich, managing director of Apoyo. "But Toledo has this mental
block. He tells himself: 'Things are going bad for me because Montesinos
is working behind my back to undermine me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Apoyo also found that 49% of those polled thought that Toledo should
make creating jobs his priority. Only 2% thought that he should focus on
investigating Montesinos and Fujimori, while 3% thought that he should
concentrate on fighting corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo could be forgiven for being paranoid about the lingering power
of his nemesis, Montesinos, who is imprisoned at a high-security base
outside Lima, the capital. Fujimori is living in exile in Japan, defying
a Peruvian warrant for his arrest on corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   Sifting through the detritus of the Fujimori-Montesinos era continues
to occupy several dozen government inquiries. The latest "Vladivideos,"
released in December, featured top television executives accepting
six-figure bribes from Montesinos in 1999 and 2000. In February,
prosecutors replayed in court the first "Vladivideo" made public; a
congressman on trial for corruption was forced to watch himself on tape
through the bars of a courtroom cell.</TE>
<TE>   With much of Toledo's energies focused on the corruption inquiries,
the wave of protests seems to have caught the government by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's true that Montesinos still has power," Alvarez Rodrich
said. "But that power has been exaggerated. Let's say you took Montesinos
out of the equation. The economic problems would still be there."</TE>
<TE>   In February, cotton workers demanding better wages blocked roads into
the capital for several days. Demonstrators looted stores and attacked
government buildings in the provincial town of Chimbote, where Toledo
spent his childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers are planning to strike this month, as are
provincial government leaders in southern Peru who are angry at Toledo's
privatization plans.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Toledo's political movement, Peru Possible, have been
locked in a power struggle. An ongoing war in neighboring Colombia is
threatening to create havoc in northern Peru. More than a few Peruvians
fear that their country is slipping into the sort of anarchy that brought
Fujimori to power.</TE>
<TE>   "What this country needs more than anything is a bit of order," said
Mary Gonzales Diaz, a mother of three who works as a driver for the city
of Lima. "There are too many demonstrations. I voted for Toledo. I don't
think he's a bad man. But they're not letting him govern. You get the
impression that he's not going to last very long."</TE>
<TE>   Will Peruvians give Toledo enough time to sort out the country's
profound economic and social problems? Unemployment has been rising
steadily for four years and stands at about 10%, though some studies put
the level of underemployment as high as 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strong desire among the political class to give Toledo a
chance," said Julio Cotler, a sociologist at the Institute of Peruvian
Studies in Lima. "That, in itself, is a sign of progress. Not everyone is
trying to bring him down. They realize that if Toledo goes down, they all
might go down."</TE>
<TE>   Cotler believes that Toledo has made important gains in restoring
respect to Peru's battered democratic institutions, especially to its
court system. At the same time, he thinks that the new president's
inexperience has come into play in the first few months of the new
administration, as Toledo quickly became known for making contradictory
promises and public gaffes.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics is an art form, one that Toledo is still learning," Cotler
said, adding: "People want to see leadership. They want Toledo to say,
'This is where we're going and how we're going to get there.' "</TE>
<TE>   Having grown up in a provincial family, Toledo was rescued from
poverty by religious workers who sent him away to the United States to be
educated. Now, his support has dropped most precipitously among the
sector whose votes helped make him the first person of indigenous descent
to be elected Peru's president: the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand Toledo hasn't had much time [in office], but there are
still so many things to do," said Belen Ocona, 31, who joined a group of
shantytown residents in a recent march on the Government Palace. "We want
potable water, light, work and food, the basic needs. We're not asking
for miracles."</TE>
<TE>Job Program Hasn't Had Much Impact</TE>
<TE>   In central Lima's Plaza de Armas, Cesar Gonzales, 23, said he would be
willing to give Toledo more time--"at least a year more"--to sort things
out. His patience is laudatory considering his position: He shines shoes,
just as Toledo used to as a youth.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't much work where I live," Gonzales said. "You go to apply
for a job, and 100 people show up for one opening."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's job creation program, called To Work, has yet to have much of
an impact since it began last year. The government says 40,000 rural jobs
have been created. The urban portion of the program was launched in
January, with a target of 60,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the controversies surrounding the reign of Fujimori and
Montesinos linger, threatening to become a permanent distraction to the
government. The top prosecutor in the Montesinos case said recently that
it could take five years to sort through all the charges surrounding the
spymaster.</TE>
<TE>   This month, an unnamed "witness one" told members of the Peruvian
Congress investigating the alleged crimes of the Fujimori-Montesinos
regime that army intelligence had an incinerator in the basement of its
headquarters to burn the bodies of suspected guerrillas who fell into
their custody.</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, two members of Congress toured the basement of the
headquarters to see whether the story was just another rumor, like many
others that have surfaced about the dark days of Peru's recent past.</TE>
<TE>   Using a map provided by the witness, the lawmakers found something
hidden behind plates of scrap metal--an incinerator. Tests will be
conducted to determine whether it was used to burn bodies.</TE>

<DH>Art: Between breaths, a Ukrainian craftsman creates detailed works
so tiny they can be seen only through a microscope.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>KIEV, Ukraine
</DL>
<LD>Wearing a lacy skirt and holding up an umbrella, the slender girl
gracefully rocks a shapely leg, her elegant shoe barely hooked to a tiny
toe. All the while, she perches--on the nose of a mosquito.</LD>
<LD>   This micro statue, made of pure gold, is so small that the veins on
the life-size mosquito's wings can be seen clearly only with the help of
a strong microscope.</LD>
<LD>   It's not work for the easily distracted or someone with anything but
rock-steady hands.</LD>
<TE>   "When I make my miniatures, I try to hold my breath and touch the work
with the instrument between the beats of my heart to prevent my hand from
trembling," says Nikolai Syadristy, a 64-year-old Ukrainian who crafts
some of the tiniest art in the world.</TE>
<TE>   A museum containing his works is in the Orthodox Christian Monastery
of the Caves, a 12th century holy place in the center of the Ukrainian
capital, Kiev, where golden cupolas rise above whitewashed walls and
church bells peal. Another Syadristy museum is in Andorra, the tiny state
in the Pyrenees, while a third is to open soon in Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the Kiev museum can see a 0.15-inch model of the Santa
Maria, Christopher Columbus' sailing ship, composed of 256 gold parts.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Little Prince stands just 0.03 inch tall, on a
pearl planet with a 0.08-inch airplane nearby.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a miniature book of verses by Ukrainian national poet
Taras Shevchenko--12 pages of poetry and pictures bound with a spider
web. The book can fit through the eye of a needle.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't sell the works, preferring to see them displayed in
collections. He lives off his salary from the Kiev museum, which is
financed by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Born into a family of farmers in eastern Ukraine in 1937, Syadristy
studied art and agriculture, and he worked as an engineer at the Kiev
Institute of Superhard Materials. Long interested in Chinese, Indian and
Japanese miniatures, and punctilious by nature, he set himself the task
of making things ever more delicate--such as the flea on which he put
little golden boots, one of his first miniature works.</TE>
<TE>   Syadristy has created about 100 miniatures with instruments he made
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's infernal work, considering the fact that very often it has taken
more time to make an instrument than to process a part with it," he says.
"Moreover, every new piece needs a new set of instruments."</TE>
<TE>   At first it took Syadristy a whole year to create one or two
miniatures. Now it takes him nearly a month of painstaking work to create
one piece--whether it's baby swallows inside a nest made of half a poppy
seed, or a red rose on a green stem 0.002 inch thick, inside a human hair
that has been polished so thoroughly that the flower can be clearly seen
through it.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the Museum of Microminiatures, which Syadristy founded in
1977, view the works through microscopes mounted on the white walls of
the Baroque building.</TE>
<TE>   One case features a minuscule electrical clockwork mechanism inside a
dragonfly's head. It consists of 130 parts, including gears, ruby
bearings and two human hairs that form the hour and minute hands. Another
electrical motor is one-twentieth the size of a poppy seed.</TE>
<TE>   Creating miniatures is "poetry embodied by technical means," Syadristy
says. "A miniature is a way of poeticizing small forms."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Wages Lonely Battle Against AIDS in China</HD>
<DH>Asia: A surprising lack of information fuels ignorance that experts
fear may lead to a health crisis in this country's gay community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QINGDAO, China
</DL>
<LD>Shut up in his tiny, smoke-filled office, Zhang Beichuan sits
hunched at his desk, editing a small but groundbreaking magazine.</LD>
<LD>   It has an innocuous title--Friend Exchange--and an even more innocuous
look. Articles are printed on plain white paper. There are no photos, no
fancy graphics, no splashy ads. It's about as visually appealing as an
address book.</LD>
<LD>   But inside every issue is a page that Zhang hopes will save lives. Its
content is always the same: a primer for gay men on how to avoid AIDS.
Use condoms. Don't mix sex with drugs and alcohol. Fewer partners means
less risk.</LD>
<TE>   The advice sounds painfully basic to anyone from the West. But in
China, for all the social change of the past 20 years, such information
is scarce, fueling ignorance and misconceptions that experts fear may
precipitate a health crisis in this country's gay community.</TE>
<TE>   The community is at high risk for AIDS but has been neglected by the
government and the public, even as attention begins to focus on the
spread of the disease in China.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers highlight the plight of needle-sharing drug users who
contract HIV, hospital patients infected through blood transfusions and
poor farmers afflicted after selling their blood at unsanitary collection
stations. China's top health official said recently that at current
infection rates, the country could have 10 million people with HIV or
AIDS by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   But amid the media coverage, almost nothing has been said about
acquired immune deficiency syndrome's inroads among gay men. The taboo
against talking about sex in general and homosexuality in particular
remains a block against getting information to those in need.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of people are trying to break the silence. Even the
China Society for the Prevention of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted
Disease, composed of officials, doctors and researchers, stays relatively
mute on the issue of gays and the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "The people in that circle know that gays are a high-risk group. But
you won't find 10 of them who are actually taking action and working with
the gay community," said Zhang, a physician who gave up a dermatology
practice to promote AIDS awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do feel lonely at times," he added.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many gay men in China are infected with AIDS or with
the human immunodeficiency virus, which can lead to the disease. Of all
registered cases--which are but a fraction of infections--less than 1%
are attributed to homosexual activity.</TE>
<TE>Infection Rate on Rise Among Gay Men</TE>
<TE>   But no one doubts that the figure does not reflect the extent of the
problem or that the infection rate among gay men is climbing, especially
in major cities.</TE>
<TE>   At the two hospitals in Beijing known for treating venereal disease,
one-third of all AIDS patients are gay men, said a Western researcher
with a foreign-funded AIDS project in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, a measure of government recognition came when a senior
health official acknowledged that homosexuals were at risk, adding that
the number of gays in China was "alarming."</TE>
<TE>   Yet state-supported education and prevention efforts targeted at gay
men is rare.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang's bimonthly magazine is the only publication in China directed
at the gay community. Its modest funding comes from the New York-based
Ford Foundation. Each issue contains articles, essays and letters on
homosexuality--stories about coming out of the closet, scientific
studies, news around the world affecting gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 pages in every edition deal with AIDS, including the guide
to safe sex directed at male readers. Lesbians in China, as elsewhere,
have a lower risk then men of contracting AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to put out basic information," Zhang said one
recent morning, the proofs of the latest issue of Friend Exchange
cluttering his desktop. "Our volunteers tell us we need to keep repeating
the ABCs."</TE>
<TE>   From his cramped, rather dilapidated office in Qingdao, the port city
famous for its Tsingtao beer, Zhang's journal rides the roads and rails
to most of the nation's major cities through a network of committed
volunteers. Between 7,000 and 8,000 copies are distributed every other
month and reach more readers than those numbers suggest, but still just a
tiny sliver of a gay population estimated in the tens of millions.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone appreciates his work. A few months ago, some neighbors
flung a bucket of human waste at his office door, apparently upset by the
visitors and volunteers who come calling, whom they assumed to be AIDS
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   But a hutch in the corner of his office attests to the impact of
Zhang's magazine. Stuffed into drawers are thousands of letters from
readers who are grateful to discover that they're not alone, who vent
their despair at their isolation--usually in China's countryside--or who
ask for medical advice. At least one is a suicide note that had Zhang
phoning around in an unsuccessful bid to locate the writer. Zhang tries
to answer every letter he receives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing a remarkable job. . . . He showed that it is possible" to
reach gay men in China, said Dr. Emile Fox, the director in China for
UNAIDS, a United Nations program. "Otherwise, there is very, very little
being done."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of outreach is part of a larger pattern of, at best,
piecemeal and superficial government efforts to combat the epidemic or,
at worst, official indifference.</TE>
<TE>   In a still relatively poor nation of 1.3 billion people, AIDS
prevention and education programs remain pitifully underfunded and
understaffed. The resources of the Ministry of Public Health have been
stretched paper-thin as the nation's once-sturdy social safety net
unravels amid market reforms.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the number of people infected with AIDS or HIV has
soared. Unofficial estimates put the total at more than 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the government recorded a 67% jump in reported HIV cases in
the first half of 2001, compared with the same period the year before. In
response, health officials pledged to spend $12 million a year on AIDS
prevention and control.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the United States allotted $767 million last year for
prevention in a country with one-fifth the population of China. In
addition, Washington shelled out more than $100 million for global
efforts to combat HIV and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   To reach homosexuals in the U.S., officials can tap into a
well-established infrastructure of gay organizations, support groups and
publications.</TE>
<TE>   In China, such a visible network does not exist. There is only a
loose, informal sodality of friends and acquaintances who congregate in a
few gay bars, saunas and public parks. Few men live openly gay lives for
fear of ostracism.</TE>
<TE>   At an AIDS conference in Beijing last October, some doctors expressed
their willingness to work with homosexuals but said they had no idea how
to recognize or find them. Of about 20 gay listeners in the audience,
only one finally stood up and identified himself as a gay man, according
to people who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Until a few years ago, a lot of people thought that China had no
homosexuals," said Xiao Ya, an activist who runs a nationwide hot line
for fellow gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>Pamphlets, Seminars Help Spread Awareness</TE>
<TE>   He and his associates do their best to spread the word on AIDS.
They've printed up pamphlets and left them at bars. They hold seminars.
Volunteers sometimes deliver free condoms to bathhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge about AIDS seems to be spreading, Xiao said, but not
everyone practices what they know. And some of what they know is
downright wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think that having sex with a foreigner is how you get
AIDS," Xiao said. "They think they're safe because they've never been
with a foreigner."</TE>
<TE>   In a small-scale study conducted in Beijing two years ago, Kyung-Hee
Choi, a medical professor at UC San Francisco, found that half of the gay
and bisexual men she surveyed did not practice safe sex.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Choi is about to discover the consequences of such laxity,
through a study of 500 gay and bisexual men in Beijing that will show the
prevalence of HIV infection among them. The rate could turn out to be as
high as 4% to 5%, say people familiar with the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of scared to find the results of my study, to be honest,"
Choi said. "I don't really think that gay men in Beijing have a sense of
crisis. They think that AIDS is a problem for IV drug users and farmers
who give blood."</TE>
<TE>   Activists and researchers report a worrisome attitude among many gay
men, an almost blase fatalism that sees no point in getting tested for
HIV or modifying behavior. Free, confidential HIV screening is almost
unheard of, and effective AIDS medications cost a fortune by Chinese
standards, even after the price was slashed recently from about $1,100 a
month to $365.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who has the disease," said Fei Yu, 25. "But my
friends and I have all decided that even if we suspect we have it, we
won't go to the hospital. We'll save the money for a little more fun in
our shortened lives."</TE>
<TE>   Others fear going to physicians only to encounter judgment and
hostility. Although homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness by
the Chinese Psychiatric Assn. last year, old attitudes die hard. A recent
newspaper article quoted a psychiatrist as calling gays and lesbians
perverts.</TE>
<TE>   Such prejudice was what galvanized Zhang, the Friend Exchange founder,
into action.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he watched in disbelief as his mentor, another dermatologist,
suffered abuse and harassment from colleagues who had found out that he
was gay. Zhang, who is heterosexual, knew little about homosexuality but
considered his mentor a decent man and refused to take part in
victimizing him. That in turn made Zhang an object of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the experience, Zhang published a book five years later titled
"Homosexuality," a compilation of essays. He admits now that some of the
book's contents were somewhat negative--his views have evolved over
time--but it did conclude that "our society must treat gay people
equally."</TE>
<TE>   Friend Exchange was born in 1998, funded at first by three gay men who
asked Zhang if he would do something to help combat AIDS in the gay
community.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Zhang runs his operation on the strength of a three-year,
$120,000 grant from the Ford Foundation awarded in 2000--and on the
stream of cigarettes he smokes.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there's enough money, I'll keep on doing it," he said. "As
a dermatologist, I made a difference, but I saw only a small number of
patients. But as an AIDS expert, I can have an impact on a lot more
people."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Embassy Target of Attack in Yemen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>An unemployed Yemeni man tossed one or two sound grenades at the
U.S. Embassy in Sana on Friday, hitting a wall but injuring no one,
Yemeni and U.S. officials said. The attack came a day after Vice
President Dick Cheney visited Yemen.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said two grenades were thrown but caused no
injuries or damage. "They were noisemakers" rather than weapons, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Yemeni police, however, said only one grenade was thrown. They said
the man was reaching for a second grenade in his pocket when Yemeni
security guards outside the embassy opened fire and arrested him. It was
not immediately known whether he was wounded by the gunfire, they added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged attacker was a 25-year-old high school dropout named Samir
Yahya Awadh, according to Faris Sanabani, editor of the Yemen Observer
newspaper. Awadh was unemployed and had no known political affiliations,
Sanabani said.</TE>
<TE>   An Interior Ministry statement said his family had described him as
psychologically disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni police and soldiers closed off streets around the embassy and
searched vehicles. Witnesses had reported seeing a car speeding from the
site after the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The blast comes a day after Cheney visited Sana airport for two hours
of talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney was notified about the embassy incident, which members of his
entourage in Oman on Friday characterized as an isolated incident, a U.S.
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Security in Yemen has been a top concern of the United States since a
boat laden with explosives slammed into the Navy destroyer Cole in
October 2000, killing 17 Americans.</TE>

<LD>China voiced "strong indignation and resolute opposition" to
growing U.S.-Taiwanese military contacts, summoning the American
ambassador to demand that Washington reverse course on ties with the
island.</LD>

<HD>Cheney Finds Chilly Response in the Gulf to Any Attack on Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JIDDA, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>On a day that began with a personal display of respect for Islam
and ended at a palace, Vice President Dick Cheney delved into the thicket
of Middle Eastern history and hatreds Saturday, conferring with Crown
Prince Abdullah here about the Saudi's proposal to restrain the latest
Israeli-Palestinian violence.</LD>
<LD>   But as to the centerpiece of his Persian Gulf tour--the future of
efforts the United States wants to lead to restrain Iraq--he has been
thwarted at each stop, and the only public signals from the Saudis were
of outright opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling from Oman to the United Arab Emirates to Jidda on Saturday,
the vice president arrived at the difficult diplomatic junction where the
tragedies of the Middle East encounter the new pressures brought to the
region by the U.S.-led war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney had dinner with the crown prince, one of the most powerful
figures in the region, and then met with him at mid-evening.</TE>
<TE>   The crown prince has proposed that if Israel returned to its pre-1967
borders, Saudi Arabia would open normal diplomatic relations with it.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding a campaign against Iraq, Abdullah has sent a message of
adamant opposition, one reflected by other nations on Cheney's tour, most
notably Egypt and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Using American television to convey this opposition publicly even
before the vice president had made his case, Abdullah said the United
States cannot overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and in interviews
with CNN and ABC, he said Iraq must remain unified.</TE>
<TE>   The concern is reflected throughout the region and goes to the heart
of a question the Bush administration has had to confront as it
contemplates a military campaign against Iraq: What would happen after
Hussein?</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, said in an
interview with ABC's Barbara Walters that the United States could not use
Saudi bases for an attack against Iraq, as it had during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   At one of Cheney's earlier stops--Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United
Arab Emirates, the vice president paused to discuss the Saudi plan with
the country's president, Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayyan. A Cheney
aide said that the two men, who met in a palace, agreed that the plan had
"provided a path" worth exploring.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney began the day in Muscat, Oman, at the Sultan Kaboos Grand
Mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The mosque was a reminder--if the vice president needed one--of some
of the many crossroads of the Middle East: The massive rug that covers
much of its 60,000-square-foot worship area was made in Iran; the
ornately carved marble arches are of Iraqi design.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's every stop on his 11-country, 12-day trip has been carefully
planned. So, when he scheduled a stop at the mosque at the last minute,
it took on the cast of something more than tourism. Rather, it served as
a visual message to counter critics' complaints that the United States is
waging war against Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's trip, which began last Sunday, was built around
the next step in the administration's anti-terrorism campaign,
specifically the state of efforts to rid Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction--and to determine whether the United States could expect a
positive response if it sought military basing rights and other support
for what could be a very large operation.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's mission was originally to report to Middle East and Persian
Gulf leaders on the administration's thinking on expanding the war beyond
Afghanistan, to gauge their reaction, court their support and report back
to President Bush and the rest of the national security team. But the
intensity of the violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories has
forced that conflict onto his agenda at each stop.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah is taking his peace proposal, a variant of the
"land-for-peace" offerings that have been debated and negotiated for at
least two decades, to a summit of the Arab League at the end of the
month. Normalization would be a new wrinkle. But whether he is offering
full diplomatic relations or something else has been unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has expressed interest in the plan, and it is likely to be on the
agenda when Cheney meets with Israeli leaders later. The vice president's
aides said he would not comment on it until today, at a news conference
after leaving the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Jidda stop was particularly important and sensitive. Saudi Arabia,
as an economic and political counterweight to Iraq and as custodian of
Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, has a reach that goes beyond
its borders.</TE>
<TE>   But the Saudi royal family is exceedingly skittish about maintaining
stability throughout the region. At the heart of its concern is the
potential division between popular support for Saddam Hussein and radical
Islamists, among them Osama bin Laden, and the more conservative bent of
the elite and the authoritarian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi royals are also sensitive to the fact that 15 of the 19 men
accused of hijacking four airliners on Sept. 11, in a plot that
Washington blames on Bin Laden, were Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concerns throughout the region is the energy the United
States would put into a military operation: Leaders want assurances that
if the United States took on Hussein, it wouldn't leave him a wounded
tiger able to recover--as he did after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever Cheney has gone, he has encountered such anxieties as those
prevailing in Saudi Arabia regarding Iraq and an aggressive U.S. presence
that could rile the populace.</TE>
<TE>   In Oman, for example, officials try to keep under wraps their military
cooperation with the United States, and White House officials showed
great sensitivity in confirming that the vice president visited the
island of Masirah, a small U.S. military facility.</TE>
<TE>   The region also disagrees with the United States about which problem
should be tackled first: the Middle East violence or Iraq and the
expansion of the anti-terrorism war.</TE>
<TE>   With the Taliban subdued and Al Qaeda's operations seemingly seriously
disrupted, leaders there "don't see the immediate threat," said Edward S.
Walker, president of the Middle East Institute in Washington and a former
U.S. ambassador to Egypt and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration's preference, Walker said, would be to get
Hussein out of the way. This, officials argue, would leave the region
free to wrestle with the Israeli-Palestinian issues.</TE>

<HD>Russian Books Escape a Tragic Ending</HD>
<DH>Culture: Eviction put bookshop and its 2 million tomes at risk of
incineration until a salvation effort surfaced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA LING</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A member of the House and the head of the Library of Congress
brokered an 11th-hour deal last week to save a unique collection of 2
million Russian books from an incinerator.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a win-win for everybody," said Igor Kalageorgi, owner of the
Victor Kamkin bookstore in the Washington suburb of Rockville, Md., after
he won a temporary reprieve from eviction for his shop and kept his books
from being discarded.</LD>
<LD>   "There will be no book-burning, and the books will find a home,"
Kalageorgi added.</LD>
<TE>   The bookstore was founded in 1953 by Victor Kamkin, Kalageorgi's
great-uncle. During the Cold War, it represented a treasure trove
virtually unparalleled in the United States as a source of
Russian-language books, both classic and obscure.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoying an exclusive contract with the Soviet government to import
Soviet books and periodicals into the United States, the Kamkin store
during its heyday was a magnet for the entire community of U.S. Slavic
scholars.</TE>
<TE>   But the shop had faced eviction last Monday after falling behind on
its $15,000-per-month rent because of slack sales over the last year,
Kalageorgi said.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Allen Kronstadt said the enormity of the task facing the
Montgomery County, Md., sheriff in hauling the estimated 2 million books
out onto the sidewalk and to the local dump and incinerator already had
delayed the eviction date twice.</TE>
<TE>   "We warned the sheriff's department early on how massive the job was,"
said Kronstadt, managing partner of Randolph Buildings, which rents space
to Kamkin.</TE>
<TE>   He said a crew of 60 men and several trucks had been slated to remove
the books the day the deal was reached.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of burning these books for me personally was distasteful
and I struggled with it," Kronstadt added.</TE>
<TE>   After the Washington Post reported on the fate awaiting the books,
Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.) extracted a promise from local
officials not to destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   Morella and Librarian of Congress James Billington, a prominent
historian and Russia specialist, sat down with Kronstadt and Kalageorgi
to work out the three-week reprieve on the eviction.</TE>
<TE>   Kalageorgi said he will work over the coming days with Billington and
Library of Congress Slavic experts to put together collections to donate
to the library and other institutions throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like it [in the United States]," said one Library of
Congress official, noting that such obscure items as a Tagalog-Russian
dictionary among Kamkin's collection deserved to be saved for future
generations of researchers.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't have people importing books from Russia on the leaves
of Kamchatka or 12th-century law in Ukraine."</TE>
<TE>   Kronstadt said that under the deal he would write off the roughly
$200,000 he says the bookstore owes him in rent, legal and other fees,
and would donate to the Library of Congress any books left in his
possession at the end of the three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also allows the continuation of the Victor Kamkin bookstore
itself, which Kalageorgi says he plans to reopen at a new location once
he has finishes taking inventory and donating books.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a definite location yet, but we're going to get that
all organized in short order," Kalageorgi said.</TE>
<TE>   After 10,000 customers deluged the store last weekend in fear of its
closure, he no longer doubts that a market exists for it, despite
competition from rivals in New York's Brighton Beach. "It tells me the
power of advertising," he said.</TE>

<HD>Manure Clouds Brewing Plans of Belgian Monks</HD>
<DH>Beer: Fertilizer runoff from neighboring farms is getting into the
water. Two new threats stir the abbey to action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAF CASERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROCHEFORT, Belgium
</DL>
<LD>Of all the complex mixtures of yeast, malt, sugar and hops that
produce great beers, something as seemingly simple as water tops the
ingredient list of Trappistes Rochefort.</LD>
<LD>   "Water is just like all the other ingredients--only more important,"
Dom Jacques Emmanuel of the Notre Dame de Saint Remy abbey says
matter-of-factly, keeping his hands tucked deep inside his
brown-and-beige frock.</LD>
<LD>   The abbey is one of only a half-dozen monasteries where monks still
follow the centuries-old Trappist tradition of beer-making, and its
strong, dusky brews are hailed by connoisseurs as some of the world's
best.</LD>
<TE>   For the abbey, hidden between the ancient woods and hunchback hills of
southern Belgium's Ardennes, sparkling spring water from a nearby plateau
was a given for almost 800 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It has great purity; it's harmonious. Nature has simply done a
splendid job," says Dom Jacques Emmanuel, who runs the abbey and its
brewery.</TE>
<TE>   But the water of the Tridaine spring is under threat. As farming has
gone industrial, the enemy of Rochefort's Trappist beers has become
manure.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the lab at the abbey's labyrinthine brewery, chemical engineer
Gumer Santos stands over tiny vials of water being tested by a
"photometer" for excess nitrates. "We need protection," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Low levels of nitrates contribute to the dark, malty beer's fame and
silky-smooth texture. An increase would threaten that, as well as upset
the delicate yeast preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Manure brims with nitrates.</TE>
<TE>Trouble Brewing Just up the Road</TE>
<TE>   Two events have conspired to force the monks of the Cistercian Order
of Strict Obedience, the formal name of the Trappists, to shed their
customary reclusiveness and make their complaints heard.</TE>
<TE>   First, a nearby chicken farm wants to expand, and because "more
chickens means more manure," it would create a source of pollution close
to the Tridaine spring, Dom Jacques Emmanuel says.</TE>
<TE>   The second threat may be more elusive, but also more political. The
many farms on the plateau that feed the spring may be used as a dumping
ground for surplus manure.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past generation, Belgium's Flanders region in the north has
become one of the world's most intensive industrial farming areas, and
over the past decade it has been running out of land to spread its
manure.</TE>
<TE>   Wallonia in the south, with its stunning vistas of rolling hills and
dense woods, is not farmed nearly as intensively and it has become a
repository for Flemish manure, much of it dumped illegally by farmers
evading environmental controls.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not enough checks, there is not enough legislation and the
fines are smaller than the profit," Dom Jacques Emmanuel says with a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more springs and lakes in Belgium are being contaminated,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>Belgium Lags Rest of Europe</TE>
<TE>   International studies support his claim that Belgium is one of the
worst examples in the European Union when it comes to environmental
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The abbot and the local authorities in the nearby town of
Marche-en-Famenne have ordered a study into the geological composition of
the plateau. They want to find out which parts of the plateau feed
directly into the spring so they can be better protected from pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, the abbey sells 568 gallons of its Trappist ale, even
though demand, and production capacity, could easily double or triple
that.</TE>
<TE>   Producing more is not the monks' higher calling, Dom Jacques Emmanuel
says. But the last thing they want is for their great beer to be tainted.</TE>
<TE>   It's a concern shared by beer lovers around the world, who give the
abbey's brews top marks.</TE>
<TE>   "Big, sweet and fruity, like ripe plum that melds with a spiciness
that brings English Christmas pudding drizzled with rum to mind," says a
review of the abbey's Rochefort 10 at www.beeradvocate.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Beer like this gives us a reason to live."</TE>

<LD>   But for Shira, hope has come in the form of animal welfare activists
who visit squatter camps like Zandspruit, on the outskirts of
Johannesburg. They come to treat sick cats and dogs but leave helping the
people as well as their animals.</LD>
<LD>   Cora Bailey, who founded Community-Led Animal Welfare, and her
assistant loaded Shira into a rusty wheelbarrow and carted her to their
van so they could drive her to a veterinarian's office.</LD>
<TE>   "Generally in these settlements these animals will just die a long and
lingering death," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey's organization started going to townships in 1998 to offer free
animal welfare services, including deworming, sterilization and dipping
the animals in solutions that repel ticks and fleas. They have since
sterilized more than 6,000 dogs and cats.</TE>
<TE>   But Bailey said their mission goes beyond the physical well-being of
the animals. "If you teach a child to love an animal, they learn to love
human beings," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Social services are scarce in South Africa's overcrowded squatter
camps, where thousands of people live in close quarters, sharing small
makeshift corrugated tin shacks and a handful of portable toilets.</TE>
<TE>   When Bailey and her staff make the rounds looking for animals to
treat, they are besieged by pleas for help as varied as clothes and toys
for a nursery school for abandoned children to assistance for AIDS
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, a tall, thin woman with wispy blond hair and a warm smile,
said it's been a challenge making the project work in such poor areas.</TE>
<TE>   With financial help from the International Fund for Animal Welfare,
her group provides basic animal welfare services on a rotating basis to
17 squatter camps--areas that often lack electricity, running water or
formal buildings to set up operations.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby schools or churches sometimes let the project use spare rooms
to sterilize animals. Otherwise, they use donated empty railway cars for
the procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Where there are no facilities, Bailey and her team set up dipping tubs
and tables covered with syringes and medicine bottles on patches of
gravel outside.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of children often gather around the dipping tub and help dunk
their pets in the milky liquid. They laugh when the dogs jump out and
shake themselves, spraying everyone nearby.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Appeals to Berlin Expatriates to Return, Help Rebuild
Afghanistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Afghan leader Hamid Karzai said Friday that he hoped to stay in
power beyond his initial six-month term, and he implored expatriates to
return home and help rebuild Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The prime minister said he and his Cabinet were working to restore
Afghans' confidence in government and to establish international
credibility. But the process will take time, he said, and his appointment
by the upcoming tribal assembly, or loya jirga, would provide necessary
stability.</LD>
<LD>   "Now we are responsible, we are in charge and we have to serve the
people . . . [and] we should try and be the government even after the
loya jirga," Karzai said.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai was named interim leader after a U.S.-led coalition drove the
Taliban rulers from power in Afghanistan. His term began in December and
lasts until June, when the assembly convened by the 87-year-old exiled
king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, selects a government to rule Afghanistan for
18 months, when elections will be held.</TE>
<TE>   One expatriate, 34-year-old Akbar Mazari, said Karzai was his
country's best chance.</TE>
<TE>   "He has great contacts--America, Germany, France, Russia, Great
Britain. It is like a company--it is important to have people with
contacts," said Mazari, who fled Kabul after the 1979 Soviet invasion and
is an insurance salesman in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's minister of women's affairs, Sima Samar, who was with
Karzai on the three-day visit to Berlin, which ended Friday, said she
would try to ensure that the assembly includes at least 25% women.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing his message to Afghan expatriates living in Moscow, where he
stopped before Germany, Karzai said he needed educated citizens to return
home to help make the country self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has one of the largest Afghan communities outside Asia and the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We have resources--fertile land and many other resources we can use
to make the country wealthy," Karzai said. "We don't want Afghanistan to
be a long-term receiver of funds only; we want to be able to help other
countries too."</TE>
<TE>   He said his top priorities were establishing a national army and
police force, bringing electricity and water to all citizens, building
roads and establishing banks.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A man on a U.S. list of most-wanted terrorists has been captured in
Sudan, a published report said today.</LD>
<LD>   Citing unidentified U.S. intelligence sources, the Sunday Times said
Anas Al-Liby, described as a senior militant from Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda network, was being held at a high-security prison in the Sudanese
capital, Khartoum.</LD>
<LD>   He was accused of plotting the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 224 people.</LD>
<TE>   "He is one of nine militants seized in Khartoum and now being handed
over to U.S. authorities," the newspaper quoted a source close to the CIA
as saying.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect lived in Manchester, northern England, before fleeing
Britain two years ago as an arrest warrant was issued for him by the
United States, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   British police tracked him down at his home, but he had left by the
time they raided it, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   A Scotland Yard spokesman declined to comment on the report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Commander Visits Ethiopia</HD>
<DH>Military: Gen. Tommy Franks discusses security with officials
concerned about Somalia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
</DL>
<LD>Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan,
discussed regional security and the war on terrorism with top Ethiopian
leaders Saturday, a senior Ethiopian official said.</LD>
<LD>   The visit by Franks, head of the U.S. military's Central Command whose
sphere of responsibility includes Ethiopia and other Horn of Africa
nations, came amid concerns among U.S. and Ethiopian officials that
neighboring Somalia could become a center for terrorist activities.</LD>
<LD>   His talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and the military
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Samora Yenus, focused on regional security and
the fight against global terrorism, the Ethiopian official said on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Franks has not spoken to reporters during an African tour that has
also included stops in Eritrea and Kenya. The Central Command, based in
Tampa, Fla., is responsible for U.S. military operations in 25 countries
in the Persian Gulf, Asia and the Horn of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. officials have named
Somalia, which has been without an authoritative central government since
January 1991, as a possible haven for members of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ethiopia and Kenya have large ethnic Somali communities and long,
porous borders with Somalia, which is controlled largely by clan-based
factions rather than the 2-year-old transitional government.</TE>
<TE>   The Ethiopian official did not give details of the talks, but Meles
has made no secret of his concern about Al Ittihad al Islami, a Somali
Islamic fundamentalist group that the United States says has ties to Al
Qaeda, which he recently said has members in the transitional government.</TE>

<HD>Kabul University Library Gets 20,000 U.S. Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The United States gave 20,000 books to Kabul University on
Saturday, shifting a collection that had been housed in the U.S. cultural
center here to the university's newly refurbished library.</LD>
<LD>   The collection, which includes reference books, works of American
literature and college texts on physics, biology and English grammar, was
transferred days before the new school year, which will begin Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Acting U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said the collection should help
the university as it rebuilds its foundations and faculty after two
decades of war and years of Taliban rule.</LD>
<TE>   Before being ousted by U.S. forces and Afghan fighters last year, the
Taliban ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist, imposing a strict form of
Islam and barring women and girls from school.</TE>
<TE>   Crocker said the books weren't designed to dictate to the Afghans how
they should educate their students.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to try to help provide the tools so that the Afghans can once
again think for themselves," he told a ceremony inaugurating the
library's new "American Corner."</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan minister of higher education, Sharif Faez, said the new
U.S. books would be put to good use. Library staff members have already
purged old Russian and Arab texts from the library's own collection that
were filled with damaging "old ideologies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our university will be in the front line in the fight against
extremism, against terrorism, against those who want to turn our
universities into their ideological and extremist fields," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The collection had belonged to the American Cultural Center in Kabul,
which is now closed.</TE>

<DH>Education: Mainstream curriculum can collide with fundamentalism.
How conflict plays out could affect whether students see U.S. as home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE STRAUSS</AU>
<AU>EMILY WAX</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Eleventh-graders at the elite Islamic Saudi Academy study energy
and matter in physics, and read stories about slavery and the Puritans.</LD>
<LD>   Then they file into their Islamic studies class, where textbooks tell
them the Day of Judgment can't come until Jesus Christ returns to Earth,
breaks the cross and converts everyone to Islam, and until Muslims start
attacking Jews.</LD>
<LD>   Seventh-graders at Al-Qalam All-Girls School learn about the American
Revolution and about respecting other people's beliefs. But students also
talk about the taunts they face outside school--being called "terrorist"
and "bomber"--and ask whether Osama bin Laden is simply the victim of
such prejudice. Maps of the Middle East, minus Israel, hang in
classrooms.</LD>
<TE>Schools Reflect Society</TE>
<TE>   Such tensions within Muslim day schools in many ways symbolize the
U.S. Muslim community's political concerns, fears, biases and hopes, all
brought into sharp focus since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   These schools--and Muslims in this country--are at a crucial juncture,
with some working to stay true to their religion while trying to adapt to
the U.S. experience, as Catholics and Jews did before them. At stake,
educators acknowledge, is how the next generation of Muslims coming of
age in the United States will participate in the country they live in.</TE>
<TE>   The fall attacks could serve as the catalyst in determining whether
these schools and their students focus on the culture and politics of
faraway Muslim lands or find within Islamic tradition those ideals
consistent with U.S. democracy and religious liberty.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to get us out of the cocoon, out of our little comfort
zone that is more of an isolation from the community at large," said
Shabbir Mansuri, founding director of the California-based Council on
Islamic Education. "And it is going to put us into a position where we
are going to have to put our own feet to the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Most Muslim children in the United States attend public schools, but
the growth of the Muslim population in the past two decades has prompted
a proliferation of day schools: 200 to 600 nationally, with at least
30,000 students. Thousands of others attend Islamic weekend schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools face the same prejudices that Catholics and their schools
did beginning in the 1800s, when their loyalty to the pope was seen as
inherently anti-American.</TE>
<TE>   "We put Catholics through that, Jews through that, Mormons through
that and many other groups," Mansuri said. "It is the Muslims' turn . . .
and if Muslims are not living up to the ideas of Islam, then we certainly
should take them to task."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, some Muslim educators are writing a new curriculum that
infuses Islamic tenets in every lesson while providing a broad-minded
worldview. Textbooks, often from overseas and rife with anti-American
rhetoric, are being replaced in some schools. Some parents are forming
PTAs and seeking a curriculum that teaches the civic virtues of tolerance
and pluralism.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised if some teachers are sometimes anti-American
or anti-Semitic," said Abdulwahab Alkebsi, whose 12-year-old daughter
attends the Islamic Saudi Academy in suburban Springfield, Va. "But I
don't want it to be that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I choose the school because of the same reason why all American
parents choose private schools--it's a better environment and no peer
pressure of drugs and being a sex symbol at too young an age. But there
are other American values, like freedom of speech and assembly, that we
should be teaching our kids to respect."</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-grader Ali Alkhafaji, 9, poses a question for classmates at the
Washington Islamic Academy, also in Springfield, echoing a lesson from
their teacher:</TE>
<TE>   "Is it better to be a fashion star or to listen to Allah?"</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters agreed it was better to listen to God, though wide-eyed
India Abdullah, 8, said: "It's hard to be a good Muslim. But if we do the
right deeds and stuff, the devil is locked up and the door of heaven is
unlocked."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the pictures of Britney Spears and the Islamic holy city of Mecca
adorning lockers and notebooks attest to the challenge of providing an
Islamic education amid the beckoning popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Muslims consider many such schools not truly "Islamic"
because there isn't yet a curriculum that teaches all subjects through an
Islamic prism, nor is there an Americanized curriculum for Islamic
studies, said Hamed El-Ghazali, head of the Muslim American Society's
Council on Islamic Schools.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they use public school curriculum and add classes in Islamic
studies, Arabic language and the study of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   The schools "do have a lot of growing to do," said Sharifa Al-Khateeb,
president of the Muslim Education Council and the North American Council
for Muslim Women. "They are still working out the exact curriculum. They
are still working out how much readiness they would like to see in the
children for taking mainstream exams. They are still going through the
throes of rewriting materials that would be more appropriate for kids
here in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Most Muslim schools, with the exception of one network of schools for
African American Muslims, develop their own approach.</TE>
<TE>   At the coeducational New Horizon School in Los Angeles, Principal
Shahida Alikhan said the school is "on the progressive side," with
teachers stressing tolerance and students feeling connected to the
outside world.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Majida Zeiter described a different role for the Washington
Islamic Academy, which serves kindergarten through fourth-grade students.</TE>
<TE>   "We want it to be a place where they don't have to assimilate, where
they can practice their religion. It's like any other religious school,"
said Zeiter, who teaches Islamic studies. "We teach them the history and
good values and what it takes to be a good Muslim."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Zeiter said, she takes pains to present balanced lessons to
students, piecing together a curriculum from books published both in the
United States and overseas.</TE>
<TE>   When she feels she must use material in a popular Pakistani textbook,
she said, she photocopies certain pages and never uses those calling
Christian beliefs "nonsense" or portraying Jews as treacherous people who
financially "oppress" others. Yahiya Emerick, author of "What Islam Is
All About," said he will soon release a new edition for U.S. audiences
that eliminates the tendentious parts.</TE>
<TE>   Political views, though, pervade the school.</TE>
<TE>   Third-graders spent one recent morning learning how volcanoes work and
where the Great Smoky Mountains and Yosemite National Park are.</TE>
<TE>   But on world maps that hang every day in the classrooms, Israel is
missing. At Al-Qalam girls school, housed upstairs at the academy, the
word is blackened out with marker, with "Palestine" written in its place.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at both schools defended the maps, noting that some students
are Palestinian refugees and want their heritage represented.</TE>
<TE>   They said that the schools have no anti-Israeli policy, nor any policy
teaching students to be disrespectful of others, and that Islam is a
religion of peace and tolerance. If teachers are slipping opinions into
lessons, they say, it is because they lack proper qualifications. The
average salary at Muslim schools nationwide is about $16,000.</TE>
<TE>Foreign-Policy Focus</TE>
<TE>   In a history class at Al-Qalam, Jill Fawzy teaches events from the
Revolutionary War to the Civil War. But even before Sept. 11, a major
topic had been what Muslims consider the U.S. government's unfair
treatment of Muslims abroad, particularly in the West Bank and Iraq. Some
students question the government's claim that Bin Laden is responsible
for the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Fawzy, 19, who will graduate from college in 2003, said she wonders
whether the United States simply needed someone to blame and picked a
Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the students can't make up their minds if he is a good guy
or a bad guy," Fawzy said. ". . . We don't have any real proof either
way."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say the schools may legally teach whatever they want, as long
as they meet state requirements, but have a responsibility to be
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of educational policy, no, it's not a good idea to cross
a nation off the map or to in any way misrepresent history," said Charles
Haynes, of the First Amendment Center in Arlington, Va. "It is a civic
responsibility of all schools, religious and secular, to do the best job
of educating students to a variety of perspectives."</TE>

<HD>8 Soldiers Honored With Purple Hearts</HD>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Eight U.S. soldiers received Purple Hearts on Saturday for injuries
suffered during an intense, 18-hour firefight on the first day of
Operation Anaconda.</LD>
<LD>   "The men standing here . . . showed their mettle and their steel in
the sense that they were wounded in the early morning hours and were
unable to be extracted until the early evening," said Maj. Gen. Frank L.
Hagenbeck, commander of the coalition that waged the battle in eastern
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The battle began early March 2, when the platoon from Charlie Company
of the 10th Mountain Division dropped into a valley on the eastern ridge
of Shahi Kot, nearly directly on top of an Al Qaeda and Taliban
stronghold.</LD>
<TE>   The battle raged until about midnight, with 28 of the 86 U.S. soldiers
injured but none killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We eliminated a lot of Al Qaeda that day," said Command Sgt. Maj.
Frank Grippe, 39, of Frankfurt, N.Y., who received the award after taking
shrapnel to his hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Thomas Byrne, a doctor who was one of three medics treating the
wounded, was injured when a mortar blast went off next to him as he was
treating a casualty. He continued treating the wounded even after
becoming one himself.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne, 32, of Renton, Wash., said it was "a miracle" that none of the
men was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. James Taylor, 29, of Long Valley, N.J., who was hit by shrapnel
from a mortar round in the shoulder, said he never feared that the men
wouldn't make it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was just a matter of time until we got the situation under
control," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The other men who received the Purple Heart were Maj. James Hall, 41,
of Greenville, S.C.; Capt. Timothy Gittins, 25, of Harlan, Iowa; Sgt. 1st
Class David Jackson, 37, of Midland, Texas; Pfc. Jack Horn, 25, of
Lafayette, La.; and Pfc. Chad Ryan, whose age and hometown were not
available.</TE>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Unidentified gunmen shot Cali's Roman Catholic archbishop in the
head and chest Saturday, killing the critic of drug-money corruption as
he left a church where he had presided over a wedding, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Colombian authorities said they suspected Marxist guerrillas, but no
group immediately claimed responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   The men shot Isaias Duarte Cancino at point-blank range and escaped on
a motorbike.</LD>
<TE>   Edilberto Ceballos, Duarte Cancino's driver, told Caracol radio: "Two
guys came and opened fire and hit him three or four times, maybe even six
times. I saw him dead."</TE>
<TE>   Duarte Cancino, who just weeks ago said that drug money was funding
congressional campaigns, was dead on arrival at a nearby hospital, Dr.
Ricardo Vanegas said.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte Cancino had also publicly criticized leftist guerrillas and
far-right paramilitary outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities accuse both the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and
paramilitary groups of deep involvement in drug smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this was the work of the subversives," said police Gen.
Heliodoro Alfonso Roa.</TE>

<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>The military released Serbia's deputy prime minister Saturday, two
days after detaining him on suspicion of spying for the United States,
but said it still might charge him, fueling tensions between the Serbian
leadership and army hard-liners left over from the era of Slobodan
Milosevic.</LD>
<LD>   The incident on Thursday has angered Washington, which protested the
treatment of an American diplomat who was arrested with Momcilo Perisic.</LD>
<LD>   Military agents snatched Perisic and the U.S. diplomat, whom they
identified as John David Neighbor, on Thursday night as the two dined
together in a restaurant. Perisic was held on suspicion of passing secret
documents to the American.</LD>
<TE>   The diplomat was held for 15 hours, at one point reportedly with a
hood over his head. He was released Friday, and Perisic was freed
Saturday. But controversy boiled over the detentions, which highlighted a
rift between hard-line generals, backed by the Yugoslav president, and
Serb leaders trying to impose civilian control on the military.</TE>
<TE>   Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic said his deputy had been "set
up" and that military intelligence was "out of control."</TE>
<TE>   An advisor to the president of Montenegro, which along with Serbia
makes up the Yugoslav federation, said the federal army was becoming
"increasingly dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest "demonstrates that the military is not subject to any
parliamentary or civilian control," said the advisor, Blagoje Grahovac.</TE>
<TE>   Perisic and two other Yugoslavs arrested with him were released
without charge. But the military said Saturday that evidence pointed to
"the criminal act of espionage," and the military prosecutor's office
said it would examine the evidence to determine in the next few weeks
whether to indict.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not consider myself guilty," Perisic told the independent Beta
news agency after his release.</TE>
<TE>   Perisic was the head of the Yugoslav military until then-President
Milosevic fired him in 1998 for criticizing the army's campaign in
Kosovo. Since Milosevic's fall in 2000, Perisic has continued his
criticism, saying Yugoslavia cannot grow closer to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization until hard-line commanders from the war are sacked.</TE>

<HD>INS on Long Slide Before Visa Fiasco</HD>
<DH>Bureaucracy: The agency had become legendary for blunders before
last week, when it cleared two dead Sept. 11 hijackers to work in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When James Ziglar took over the Immigration and Naturalization
Service last year, he knew the agency stood as an epitome of a clunky,
old-fashioned, mistake-prone bureaucracy.</LD>
<LD>   The INS had become legendary for admitting terrorists and other
criminals into the United States, losing track of people it wanted to
deport and failing to control a population of illegal immigrants that has
soared to 8 million. Ziglar had no illusions that he could "turn it
around tomorrow and streamline it and make everything hunky-dory."</LD>
<LD>   Yet nothing could have prepared the former financial executive and
high-ranking Senate staffer for last week's revelation. On Monday,
exactly six months since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, the INS notified a Florida flight school
that the two men who had piloted hijacked jetliners into the World Trade
Center had been granted legal status to study in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "The truth is, the INS is beyond reform. It needs to be rebuilt from
scratch," said Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), expressing an increasingly
common view.</TE>
<TE>   How did the INS get so bad? The answer has much to do with the
agency's rapid and rocky transformation since the 1970s from a Justice
Department backwater to a high-profile bureaucratic behemoth with
conflicting but politically sensitive tasks: helping some foreigners
enter and remain in the country, while keeping others out.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration plans to divide the agency into separate
enforcement and service wings to address that conflict. Some in Congress
would like to abolish the INS, distributing its duties to other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The role of the INS expanded as the nation began to absorb a
completely unanticipated wave of new arrivals--legal and illegal--who
would become the largest sustained group of immigrants in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Congress piled new tasks and responsibilities onto the INS even though
the agency already fell short of expectations. Yet Congress rarely gave
the agency its full attention, much less the resources it needed.</TE>
<TE>   More fundamentally, the public was ambivalent about the INS and its
role in an open society. Officials demanded thorough yet speedy
inspections of incoming airline passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "We need an agency that can better enforce the laws, but we need laws
that can better be enforced," said Frank Sharry, executive director of
the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department supervisors regarded the agency warily as its
annual budget burgeoned toward $6 billion and employee ranks shot past
30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The INS has been a stepchild of the Justice Department for so long
that now, when it's being asked to do more, it's hard to jump over the
hurdle," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches at Cornell Law School. "The
INS today has a mission that is going to land it on the front page no
matter what it does. It's harder to ignore its failings and harder to
ignore its failure to overcome its failings."</TE>
<TE>   The INS has remained locked in a mentality more suitable to the 1950s
than the global economy of 2002. Even today, the system for tracking the
arrival of foreign air travelers is based on a paper coupon that
travelers are supposed to fill out and airlines are supposed to turn over
to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The INS culture also has been slow to embrace the concept of customer
service. Border Patrol officers are trained to arrest people, not help
them with their paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   The chaos at the agency so lowered morale that an outsider could
easily sense it after spending any amount of time with line agents or
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI culture is, 'We're smart, we're strong, we're good,' " Sharry
said. "The INS culture is, 'We're bad, we screw up, and everybody kicks
us around--even though we've got a lot of talented people.' "</TE>
<TE>   That has led to high turnover. Today, as the Federal Aviation
Administration gears up to hire more sky marshals, INS officers are among
the largest pools of applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "If an agency is not well run, the people who are smarter or better
are more likely to jump ship," Yale-Loehr said.</TE>
<TE>   The INS is not the only federal agency to make high-profile mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be difficult to imagine a president dismissing any other
agency with the scorn that President Bush readily heaped upon the INS on
Wednesday, when he said that "I could barely get my coffee down," after
hearing of the flight school letters.</TE>
<TE>   Four high-level INS managers were shuffled into new positions Friday
in the wake of the embarrassment, including the acting deputy chief for
the Border Patrol and the regional director for the Western region. The
shake-up followed what Ziglar called a "breakdown in communication." He
said the changes were aimed at improving accountability in the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of respect for the INS may have something to do with its core
clientele: immigrants. Except for naturalized citizens, they are
disenfranchised. "The INS is a convenient whipping boy because its
primary constituency doesn't vote," said Rick Swartz, a veteran
immigrants rights advocate in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   This has allowed for consistently deplorable service--long waits and
rude treatment--that most U.S. citizens would not tolerate. "I feel like
I'm back in the Third World," an exhausted Jorge Custodio said at the end
of a 13-hour vigil outside the Los Angeles office last year as he and
hundreds of others waited to file papers to make one of the agency's
ever-shifting deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   The blame can't be pinned on the agency alone. The INS often is
ill-equipped to carry out pet projects ordered up without due
deliberation by the Justice Department or the White House. Witness the
case of Citizenship USA, a Clinton administration plan to boost
citizenship totals in 1995 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Applications for citizenship more than tripled. World War II-era
records for swear-ins of new citizens were shattered. But Republicans
alleged a partisan plot, likening the Clinton-Gore team to Tammany Hall
operatives rounding up immigrants at the docks a century earlier. The GOP
accusation was not proved, but revelations that thousands became citizens
without complete background checks derailed the initiative and caused
massive new delays.</TE>
<TE>   On a visit to the L.A. office in the late 1990s, INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner saw the results: tens of thousands of manila folders
containing citizenship applications that had been gathering dust for as
long as several years. "This," she said, "this is the black hole."</TE>
<TE>   Congress has mirrored the public in its conflicting expectations of
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, lawmakers backed away when U.S. colleges and
universities resisted making the student visa system more intrusive than
it already was. Congress also bowed when commercial interests fearing a
traffic slow-down balked at an attempt to record exits from the United
States--a crucial way to keep track of foreign visitors. Sept. 11 exposed
these regulatory gaps, and opposition to closing them has crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also has directed the great bulk of INS enforcement resources
toward the Southwest border. That left little room for finding illegal
immigrants elsewhere or to keep a careful eye on the northern border with
Canada, where authorities are especially fearful of terrorist
infiltration.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress routinely increases the workload of the INS, but doesn't
provide the added manpower and resources necessary," said Steven
Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies,
which favors cuts in new arrivals. "The INS has all these huge structural
problems, but the criticism tends to be manifested in these spectacular
gaffes. The real debate should be: Are we giving the agency too much to
do?"</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the House passed a bill that would require the INS to
review tens of thousands of new applications from lawful residents
seeking legal status for close relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly minor legislative demands can have major ripple effects on
the agency's overall performance, former officials said.</TE>
<TE>   David A. Martin, INS general counsel in the 1990s, recalled how in
1996 Congress passed tough restrictions on foreigners seeking political
asylum. Then in 1997, it created a special exemption for Nicaraguans and
Cubans, while subjecting asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Guatemala to
different guidelines. The INS had to train and retrain personnel to meet
those complex and overlapping provisions, which affected only a fraction
of a case backlog now approaching 5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The pace is unbelievable, and the demands come fast and furious,"
Martin said. "It's hard for people at the top to focus on fixing things.
. . . The business of regulating migration is just a lot more complicated
than people think, and allowances have to be made for that."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, experts say, the INS has made some progress in dealing
with its daunting challenges. It is moving forward with plans to
modernize the student visa system and to use the FBI data base to catch
those who have fled deportation proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree that part of the solution is to separate the agency's
law-enforcement function from routine services. That is a theme of the
administration plan and a more drastic overhaul sought by Rep. James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
whose proposal comes close to breaking up the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some warn that history may offer a lesson: At the INS, highly
ballyhooed reforms have a way of backfiring. Indeed, the letters sent to
the flight school last week originated at a privately run operations
center once touted as an innovation that would improve service to
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Given such a background, some warn against putting too much distance
between the agency's service and law-enforcement roles. Closer
coordination between those two functions, Martin argues, might have saved
the INS from its newest embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   "I marvel sometimes," the former INS chief counsel said, "that people
don't recognize that their prescription is a poor match for the disease."</TE>

toward the Pleez-All Billiard Parlor. "This," he says, "is where all the
trouble started."</LD>
<LD>   That's Trouble with a capital "T" and that rhymes with "P" and that
stands for Pool.</LD>
<LD>   And indeed, there it is: a pool table. Enticing young boys to fritter
away their chore time. Undermining staunch Midwest morality.</LD>
<TE>   And, just maybe, giving this careworn town--one of the biggest cement
producers in the nation--a shot at cultural glory.</TE>
<TE>   For this is not just any pool table. It represents the fictional one
that set off such a ruckus in that spectacle of cornfed Americana, "The
Music Man." And it has become the centerpiece of a controversial project
to honor the man behind the music.</TE>
<TE>   Mason City, the inspiration for "The Music Man's" River City, is
building a $22-million tribute to native son Meredith Willson, who wrote
not only that hit but other snappy tunes, including "It's Beginning to
Look a Lot Like Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Willson's boyhood home has been meticulously restored by local
volunteers. A museum filled with his artifacts and music will open this
summer to mark the centennial of his birth. And a block of
storefronts--some facades, some real establishments--copied from the set
of the 1962 movie "The Music Man" (which itself was modeled after Mason
City of 1912) woos visitors with marshmallow malts at the soda fountain
and displays of vintage bloomers. There's also a cafe serving old-style
tea cakes and a Victorian bed and breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   And there's even talk about commissioning a sculpture made up of 76
trombones.</TE>
<TE>   Many here are convinced that they have, as Willson wrote, a bang-beat,
bell-ringing, big-haul, great-go, neck-or-nothing, rip-roaring,
every-time-a-bull's-eye blockbuster on their hands. Without a dime's
worth of advertising, the Willson home and River City shops have drawn
33,000 tourists since last May. Visitors have come to this isolated
northern Iowa town from all 50 states and 14 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Under Miller's direction, the nonprofit foundation in charge of the
tribute has raised nearly $9 million--half from Willson's widow,
Rosemary, who lives in Los Angeles. She has pledged a $2-million
endowment plus additional matching funds, calling "the dedication and
hard work of all the people in Mason City the most fitting tribute" to
the spirit of cooperation that her husband tried to capture in his
musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has no doubt he'll be able to raise enough money to cap off the
project with a 500-seat theater and an old-time bakery like the one
Willson's father managed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a piece of Americana," he says firmly, as if that settles it.</TE>
<TE>   But Iowans are a famously skeptical lot, "so by-God stubborn," as
Willson wrote, "that we can stand touching noses for a week at a time and
never see eye to eye." And not everyone in town has jumped on "The Music
Man" bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   A few critics grumble that the project has grown way out of proportion
for a working-class town of 30,000. They question whether Willson, who
died in 1984, has enough fans to sustain such an elaborate tribute.</TE>
<TE>   "Meredith who?" asks Max Weaver, a former councilman, his voice
dripping with disdain.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver is so fed up with the ever-expanding project that he has taken
to comparing Miller to the con-artist hero of "The Music Man" who preys
on small towns "where the people are as green as the money," selling them
grandiose dreams. "This is a case of life imitating art," Weaver says.
"Carl Miller is Professor Harold Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver and other skeptics doubt the proposed theater will draw quality
acts to what one local called "a little itty-bitty town in a social
desert." They worry that the private funds will dry up, leaving city
taxpayers holding the bag. A few flat-out cringe at hooking their town's
reputation to a musical written in 1957 that they consider unbearably
sappy.</TE>
<TE>   "When's the last time you've watched 'The Music Man?' " demands Al
Duitman, an antique store owner. He snorts and strings out his words for
emphasis. "It is the most hokey musical!"</TE>
<TE>   The critics are especially irate over recent decisions by the city and
county to kick in $825,000 for the Willson project. Organizers had
promised from the start that they would not tap taxpayer funds. But
Miller appealed for some public money last month, saying he needed to
show local support in order to secure a state grant.</TE>
<TE>   With some reluctance, local politicians signed on. "We would prefer
not to commit a penny of taxpayer money to it," said Mayor Bill Schickel.
"But we're also able to look at the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   And in the big picture, he believes, the project can transform Mason
City.</TE>
<TE>   Some business owners say they've already seen a bounce in sales from
the tour buses that stop at the Willson home. Even over at the Body
Graphix tattoo shop, owner Don Murl expects some spinoff bounty from "The
Music Man." "It'll probably bring in more of an older crowd. But hey, I
just had a 57-year-old in here getting a tattoo of Elvis."</TE>
<TE>   The presence of that tattoo parlor makes clear--if there was ever a
doubt--that Mason City bears little resemblance to the town Willson so
lovingly memorialized.</TE>
<TE>   In the River City of his musical, "swell" was about the most depraved
slang imaginable, and the arrival of the Wells Fargo wagon was excitement
enough for a week. Driving into Mason City today, you pass a
Harley-Davidson motorcycle shop, a Rent-A-Dent car lot, check cashing
joints and fast food aplenty. The music stores sell Britney Spears CDs.</TE>
<TE>   But attentive "Music Man" fans will note that many of the names given
to its characters are still listed in the phone book.</TE>
<TE>   There are cultural attractions quite apart from the Willson tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Puppeteer Bil Baird grew up here, and many of his puppets, including
the yodeling ones from "The Sound of Music" film, are on display. There's
a museum of antique trucks, featuring the first known snowmobile, a
modified 1917 Model T. And the private foundation that runs the Willson
project is set to renovate the 91-year-old downtown Park Inn, the last
remaining Frank Lloyd Wright hotel in the world. (Work will take years,
but in the meantime, visitors can see other examples of Prairie School
architecture, including a home and bank designed by Wright.)</TE>
<TE>   Up the road a few miles, there's a monument to rock 'n' roll star
Buddy Holly, whose plane crashed in a cornfield near here in 1959. And
every summer, a marching band festival draws hundreds of kids to a Mason
City parade with more trombones than Harold Hill himself could conjure.</TE>
<TE>   This year's festival coincides with the opening of the Willson museum,
and organizers had hoped to make the parade a tribute to "The Music Man."
They ran into just one hitch.</TE>
<TE>   With a sheepish grin, Karen Werle, the manager of a music store,
explains: "It turned out '76 Trombones' was about the only thing he wrote
that's still in print for marching bands. We're all really proud of
Meredith Willson here. [But] most of the rest of his music is out of
print."</TE>

<HD>Rustic Spot Smoothed Knots of President's Brow</HD>
<DH>History: To Teddy Roosevelt and his wife, their Virginia hideaway
was the perfect antidote to the White House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For a presidential retreat, the house was about as plain as a knot
in a pine board, which is what it was named for. The place had no running
water, electricity or telephone. Theodore Roosevelt took to it like a
bird to a tree.</LD>
<LD>   There were birds in profusion at Pine Knot, Roosevelt's Virginia
cottage about 100 miles and a four-hour rail journey southwest of the
capital. Over three spring days in 1908 the bird-watching president and
John Burroughs, the great naturalist, counted 75 individual species.</LD>
<LD>   But one of the chief attractions was what the place lacked. There were
simply no government officials, reporters or unexpected guests, all of
whom laid claim to the president's time at the White House.</LD>
<TE>   First Lady Edith Roosevelt bought, remodeled and named Pine Knot in
1905, not long after her husband--who had become president after the
assassination of William McKinley--was elected to a full four-year term
in his own right.</TE>
<TE>   By 1905 Edith Roosevelt had seen the White House through a
redecoration that gave it the airy elegance it retains nearly a century
later. Pine Knot and its 15 acres of pine and oak and wildflowers
required no such fuss. The first lady bought it from local landowners for
$195 and spent $85 on remodeling. She was, her husband said, "a great
deal more pleased with it than any child with a toy I ever saw."</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, so was the president, who visited eight times during
his remaining four years in office. "It really is a perfectly delightful
little spot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The house, about 17 miles south of Charlottesville near Keene, was two
stories of unornamented clapboard, painted light yellow with olive-green
shutters. There were two rooms upstairs, reachable by an open plank
staircase. The large room occupying all the downstairs was flanked on
each end by a large stone fireplace. There was a broad front porch
supported by cedar posts on which the Roosevelts often sat and talked by
starlight as the night birds sang.</TE>
<TE>   "Edith Roosevelt wanted a place that met his needs for hiking,
bird-watching and hunting and all the things he loved to do, and this
did," said William Harbaugh, professor of history emeritus at the
University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately before the president's first visit in June 1905, word
reached the White House that the czar of Russia had agreed to accept
Roosevelt as a mediator in Russia's disastrous war with Japan.</TE>
<TE>   At Pine Knot his concerns were quite different.</TE>
<TE>   "In the morning I fried bacon and eggs, while Mother boiled the kettle
for tea and laid the table," he wrote his son, Kermit. "Breakfast was
most successful, and then Mother washed the dishes and did most of the
work, while I did odd jobs like emptying the slops."</TE>
<TE>   The first lady had hoped Pine Knot would prove a place of "rest and
repair" away from the pressures of her husband's job. By late Sunday
afternoon of that first visit, writes biographer Sylvia Jukes Morris, she
"noticed that the lines had smoothed out of Theodore's face."</TE>
<TE>   It was at Pine Knot that Roosevelt, outdoorsman and naturalist, had an
encounter that, given his enthusiasm for shooting wild things, may have
given him a unique and ironic place in natural history.</TE>
<TE>   He may have been the last American to see a flock of now-extinct
passenger pigeons in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   There were no passenger pigeons in view when Burroughs visited in May
1908. He and the president climbed out of the wagon before they got to
the house, "as there were a good number of warblers in the trees."</TE>
<TE>   They started counting warblers: the black-poll, the black-throated
blue, Wilson's blackcap. "He knew them in the trees overhead as quickly
as I did," Burroughs said.</TE>
<TE>   One quiet evening, as Burroughs and Roosevelt read by the light of
kerosene lamps and the first lady was busy with her needlework, the
president's hand "came down on the table with such a bang as made us both
jump."</TE>
<TE>   "He had killed a mosquito with a blow that would almost have
demolished an African lion," Burroughs said.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Knot offered much solitude but no visible security. Burroughs
asked the president if he were at all concerned to be virtually alone in
such an out-of-the-way spot. Roosevelt clapped his hand on his rear
pocket. "I go armed and they would have to be mighty quick to get the
drop on me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs said Mrs. Roosevelt told him later that two Secret Service
men were staying at a nearby farmhouse and patrolled near the cottage at
night. The president had not been told, she said, "because it would
irritate him."</TE>

<HD>Experts Question 'Trade-Offs' in U.S. Security</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: A mix of safety measures is said to focus too much on
aviation, and too little on other likely targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<AU>RICARDO ALONZO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Six months after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, security experts worry that the nationwide effort to make
Americans safer has grown seriously unbalanced, with huge resources
allocated to some threats and comparatively little to potentially greater
dangers.</LD>
<LD>   The nation, according to this view, has failed to set priorities--to
accept lesser risks in order to avoid greater ones. In the language of
emergency medicine, it has forgotten the practice of triage.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not consciously making trade-offs," domestic security
specialist Frank Hoffman said last week. What's missing, he said, is
overall "national risk assessment."</LD>
<TE>   In 10 years, Hoffman said, the country may wish it had hired 10,000
more security personnel for nuclear power plants and added 10,000
specialists to deal with biochemical threats, instead of putting all
40,000 airport screeners on the federal payroll.</TE>
<TE>   It may rue the day when it embarked upon a massive effort to tighten
airline security, but let border inspectors generally check only a
fraction of the 50,000-plus cargo containers entering the United States
every day.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the pressure to do something visible--and to do it
quickly, even hastily--proved irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first six months, the administration has been influenced by
two emotional factors: fear and anger," said William H. Webster, who has
headed both the FBI and the CIA. "Both of them were justified. Both
demanded action sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Webster gives President Bush high marks on both counts, saying he
assuaged the nation's anxiety and channeled its anger into measured
responses. Further, each of the measures already adopted deals with a
serious problem and is justifiable when considered alone.</TE>
<TE>   The ragged army of airport screeners will almost certainly meet higher
standards than before. Baggage will be checked more thoroughly.
Laboratories are already more aware of the need to protect sensitive
materials. So are private shipping companies.</TE>
<TE>   From coast to coast, thousands of local fire and rescue teams are
preparing to be retrained and reequipped to handle biochemical and other
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, simply by erecting more obstacles, the welter of new
procedures forces would-be attackers to expand their efforts, thus
increasing the chances they will betray themselves or fail.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, most of the initiatives now in train have been adopted
with almost no comprehensive weighing of comparative costs and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials plucked many initiatives from existing security
studies. Some address what experts consider relatively moderate,
self-contained problems, while potentially catastrophic threats get
lesser responses.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the United States government has done a great deal to
prevent and protect against international terrorism, and to be prepared
to respond to it if it comes, we still remain a country greatly at risk,"
former Sen. Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire said recently. As a member
of the President's National Intelligence Advisory Board, Rudman was a
co-author of an exhaustive study of 21st century U.S. security needs.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, some experts suggest, the Bush administration may modify
some of the early commitments and readjust its priorities.</TE>
<TE>   A comprehensive security plan that homeland security director Tom
Ridge plans to deliver to the president this summer could encourage a
balancing of priorities. So could the fine-print scrutiny Congress will
give Bush's budget request for $37.7 billion next year to fight
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting priorities will not be easy. Each program already underway
has a constituency and addresses a real need. And the sheer volume of
what government officials have on their plates now makes it hard to
consider alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Screening airline passengers is a case in point.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 670 million passengers a year boarding commercial
airline flights, security personnel watching for potential terrorists
might improve the odds if they could narrow their focus, instead of
trying to check everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Inspecting only certain, presumably high-risk racial or ethnic groups
is the controversial, discredited practice called "profiling." More
benign is singling out low-risk passengers, starting with government
workers, government contractors and others with federal security
clearances, to issue them "safe-traveler" cards that would let them move
quickly through checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Experts disagree about the idea. Ridge is interested, while John
Magaw, head of the new Transportation Security Administration, is
skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the merits, the proposal may not get a thorough vetting any
time soon because the officials involved are just too busy.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Magaw and his fledging organization have their hands full in
staffing the organization while at the same time dealing with a
continuing crisis in aviation security," said Bille H. Vincent, an
aviation consultant who was the Federal Aviation Administration's
security chief. "Creating a 40,000-person organization under normal
conditions would be a major undertaking. To do so under the existing
threat conditions is mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   "What people have got to understand," Magaw said recently, "is that
four weeks ago, it was just me and a white piece of paper."</TE>
<TE>   It is not immediately clear how the blaze starts aboard the GrandCamp,
a French Line freighter nestling against a dock in Galveston, Texas. But
at mid-morning, when flames reach the cargo of ammonium nitrate, the ship
explodes in a blast that shakes a seismograph in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the docks and an adjacent chemical plant are burning. Deadly
gases fill the air as the fire jumps to a nearby oil tank farm, then
detonates a second freighter loaded with fertilizer chemicals. The
disaster leaves 3,500 people dead or injured, a major petrochemical
complex in ruins and a community that once housed 15,000 people
incinerated.</TE>
<TE>   This is no hypothetical scenario for some future terrorist attack. It
actually happened--in 1947. It is just the kind of disaster that many
specialists see near the top of the list of terrorist threats that are
getting too little attention now.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest threat to the country today is from weapons of mass
destruction--or, in the near term, conventional explosives--coming into
the country in cargo that is not inspected," Rudman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about chemical and biological warfare, as well as
potential weapons of mass destruction. We have to protect what is coming
into our country," said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), a member of
the Senate Commerce Committee. "We need a system to check cargo as well
as people."</TE>
<TE>   In a country that imports more than half its oil, every major harbor
is lined with tanker terminals, storage farms and petrochemical plants.</TE>
<TE>   What makes them especially attractive targets--beyond the destructive
power and economic impact--is the fact that cargo shipping has become one
unified global, intermodal system, while security is balkanized. Modular
containers, which may travel on trucks, ships and trains, are only
loosely monitored as they sit on wharves, warehouse floors and outdoor
rail yards.</TE>
<TE>   Big trucks stream through border crossing points from Mexico and
Canada by the thousands each day. Trailers are shunted from rail to road
and from one shipping concern to another with no comprehensive system to
assure the integrity of cargoes or drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, with its 275
inspectors, only recently began to focus on terrorism. After Sept. 11, it
counted 38,800 trucking companies with access to U.S. highways that haul
"high-consequence" hazardous materials such as explosives, toxic
chemicals and radioactive materials.</TE>
<TE>   At the federal level, responsibility for border security is divided
among the Border Patrol, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard and other
agencies--each with its own traditions, priorities, procedures and
often-incompatible technology.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to be consolidated in one Cabinet agency," said
a veteran of the security policy wars. Ridge suggested such consolidation
soon after his appointment last year, however, the idea ran into massive
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Its fate did not reassure Washington insiders, who have watched a
succession of other czars--especially in the now-forgotten war on
drugs--break their lances against intransigent bureaucracies and special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Almost certainly, it is in commercial aviation that the greatest
strides have been made in the last six months. But even here, remaining
loopholes and lingering resistance to change demonstrate just how large
the challenge remains.</TE>
<TE>   Congress set a Dec. 31 deadline for screening all checked luggage, an
estimated 1 billion bags a year, for explosives. But explosive-detection
machines are bulky, expensive and scarce, and they are plagued with
operating problems. Integrating them into the flow of baggage handling so
that passengers avoid long delays will require millions of dollars in
reconstruction of existing systems.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, better machines may be developed. "We don't want to be
locked into buying machines that will essentially be obsolete,"
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, bags checked by passengers on multi-flight trips get no
enhanced screening after being shuttled to a second plane. Airlines
argued successfully that the cost and inconvenience would be too great.</TE>
<TE>   "You've still got the same deference to the airlines that you always
had," said Brian Sullivan, a retired FAA agent, "and I don't think that
bodes well for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's cargo. Airlines still count on shippers to vouch that
their cargo is safe, though several recommendations to improve cargo
screening are under review.</TE>
<TE>   From airports and seaports to nuclear power plants, landmark buildings
and all other potential terrorist targets; protection is not impossible.
But it requires choices.</TE>
<TE>   "You could shut the country down to an absolute stop if you made it
impossible for anything to happen. That could have a more deleterious
effect than an occasional failure to stop something, " said Webster.</TE>

<DH>Security: Architects offer alternatives to those unsightly hunks of
concrete meant to deter attacks on buildings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may not have the historic import of the Boston Tea Party, but a
rebellion is brewing these days that literally could change the national
landscape. And federal officials are getting an earful.</LD>
<LD>   "Something has to be done about this," Don Miles, a Seattle architect,
thought to himself as he walked by the federal courthouse recently. "We
seem to have forgotten all about the fact that the word 'city' comes from
the word 'civility.' "</LD>
<LD>   What has Miles and other prominent architects so riled is the
profusion of those ugly concrete barriers now protecting federal
buildings from terrorist attacks. The architects, landscape artists and
urban planners leading the charge have no quarrel with the need for
increased security. But they argue passionately that an array of
alternatives--shrubbery, reinforced benches, street lights, moats, grassy
lawns, trees, fountains, raised curbs and even street sculpture--can
serve security needs while preserving the majesty of public space. They
talk of how the barriers are unsafe, vulnerable to becoming projectiles
in a bomb attack. Mostly, they talk about democracy.</LD>
<TE>   "Those barriers are a really terrible metaphor for the moment we're
living in," said Cathy Simon, an architect in San Francisco. "They send a
very unfortunate message to the public about democratic institutions."</TE>
<TE>   There are even some who argue that the rush to wall public buildings
is misguided: Those "Jersey barriers," so named because they were modeled
after the medians on New Jersey's highways, only contribute to a culture
of fear that is more harmful to Americans than to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put barriers up, you are identifying places of fear," said
Fred Kent of the New York-based Project for Public Spaces. "Fear isolates
places from the public. What we're working on is how to create a sense of
openness."</TE>
<TE>   Gavin de Becker, a risk assessment analyst in Los Angeles who advises
the federal government on security issues, goes even further. Noting that
barriers often are the first knee-jerk reaction to attack, he suggests
that fear is unhealthy, risk inevitable. In an era when terrorists retool
after each escalation of security, he asks: "Do we really want to put
barricades around every federal building in response to something that
happens once every 250 years?"</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the fervor for the artistic restoration of public space
greater than in Chicago, where the federal plaza--designed by
world-renowned architect Mies van der Rohe and anchored by an Alexander
Calder sculpture called "Flamingo"--is considered a masterpiece. So an
emissary from the General Services Administration in Washington recently
came to the city that produced Frank Lloyd Wright to hear the protests.</TE>
<TE>   For many who attended the session, the essential question was how to
provide protection for federal employees and access for the public to a
much-used plaza while still honoring the man who made minimalism
mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "Many spoke about looking for a Zen approach," said Philip Enquist, an
urban designer. "What would Mies do? That's sort of the debate."</TE>
<TE>   The artists and architects urged respect for simplicity in the square,
which hosts everything from farmers markets to political protests. "We
all agreed that less is more," said architect Margaret McCurry.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one Chicago designer, who was not invited to the session,
thinks whimsy might help. Peter Exley, an architect whose specialty is
designing children's museums, likes the idea of converting the Jersey
barriers into shapes like cows, Ping-Pong tables and couch potatoes
watching television. "Chicago has been very lucky because we have a high
regard for street furniture," he said. Noting that the purpose of design
is to draw people in and get them excited, he voiced admiration for Main
Street in Walt Disney World, where "they have mouse ears on the trash
cans."</TE>
<TE>   At a similar meeting in New York last fall, some architects wondered
about the enormous use of public funds on security that is unattractive
and potentially ineffective. Los Angeles recently removed the barriers
that went up around City Hall after the terrorist attacks last fall. And
in Boston, architects came to a consensus last month that the normal
elements of a street's appearance--lampposts, newspaper racks, benches
and trees--could be used as part of a security strategy. Combined with
some bollards (cylindrical concrete sticks that can be painted and shaped
to match a building's appearance), the whole street scene would deter car
bombs while preserving aesthetic integrity. "It's a way to make security
less in-your-face," said Alex Kreiger, chairman of the department of
urban planning and design at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   Kreiger, who participated in the meeting, said federal officials were
receptive.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to strike a balance between security needs and
accessibility for the public," said Ed Feiner, the GSA's chief architect.
"We want to make sure not to separate the American people from their
public buildings because then the people who want to terrorize us will
have won. It's a serious philosophical issue." Federal officials are
planning more brainstorming sessions in other cities in the months to
come.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems odd that the GSA, often thought of as the principal
supplier of paper clips and metal desks to government bureaucrats, is
inviting proposals to enhance the aesthetics of public space, don't tell
Feiner.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981, he has endeavored to remind politicians and bureaucrats
alike that the federal government has an obligation--after decades of
building boring utilitarian structures--to leave a legacy of landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   "These are public buildings, which represent to most citizens their
government," said Feiner, whose 20 years in Washington have not lessened
a Bronx accent. "They should not look like schlock."</TE>
<TE>   So began the GSA's design excellence program, which over the years has
enlisted some of the nation's top architects to create distinguished
public buildings: The new courthouse in Boston, Manhattan's Foley Square,
even the federal building in Oklahoma City that replaced the Alfred P.
Murrah building owe their designs to the government's increased awareness
about the importance of aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, tighter security is a necessity. Buildings are being set
back farther from the street. Glass has been designed to not splinter.
Structure is being studied to ensure that if buildings are hit, they will
stand long enough for employees to escape. (The World Trade Center stood
for an hour, allowing those below the crash site to escape. Most of the
168 killed in Oklahoma City, by contrast, died in the building's
collapse.)</TE>
<TE>   But even before the latest wave of protests against the Jersey
barriers, architects were being asked to balance security measures with
beauty. At a federal courthouse planned in Miami, for instance, designers
are expanding a nearby park so that the building will be surrounded by an
arboretum and by earth sculptures created by Maya Lin, who designed the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts also are underway to mask the aesthetically challenged legacy
of an earlier generation of federal buildings, those utilitarian edifices
that resemble Soviet architecture at its most Stalinesque. First
Impressions (because every government program needs a name) already has
achieved what many feared was impossible: the removal of Jersey barriers,
these in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   At the 35-year-old Byron G. Rogers Federal Courthouse in Denver, where
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh was tried, planners put shrubbery
and trees around the exterior plaza, planted grass and put park benches
in strategic locations--what the GSA called a $1.65-million face lift.
The renovation won kudos from local newspapers and the public. "The first
day when we opened up we saw a young couple lounging around on the
grass," said regional GSA director Paul Proudy. "A week later we saw an
older couple on a bench, and we knew we had a hit."</TE>
<TE>   And not a moment too soon, according to Marice Chael, a Miami urban
planner. "We shouldn't flaunt our paranoia," she said. "There are more
elegant ways to deal with issues of security. There is nothing worse in
the eyes of the public than to think they're not welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Patti Gallagher, director of the National Capital Planning Commission,
agrees. And she has an $800,000 budget approved by Congress to research
the options. In a report last fall, the commission issued a "kit of
parts"--a display of alternatives to barriers that it hopes schools,
municipal buildings, hospitals and other public places across the country
will adopt. By July, the commission hopes to issue recommendations for
what it calls the "monument core" in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's capital is uniquely reactive to attack and fond of
barriers. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, sandbags went
up around the White House. After a 1983 bombing near the Senate chambers,
concrete sewer pipes were placed outside the Capitol. After a plane
crashed into the south side of the White House in 1994, federal officials
closed Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic. And after the embassy
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania four years ago, a ring of concrete
barriers went up around the Washington Monument, still there Feb. 22
when, on George Washington's 270th birthday, the monument was reopened to
the public after a $10.5-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees the way things look is criminal," Gallagher said. "We
were funded to prepare this plan, to make specific recommendations for
removing those ugly barriers."</TE>
<TE>   If the Jerseys actually are removed in Washington, given its history,
it will be a major victory for the urban planners and architects who so
despite them.</TE>
<TE>   One trend working in their favor is an increased fascination with
public art. Chicago asked artists to create sculptures of cows for
display on its famed Michigan Avenue in the summer of 1999. New York is
putting public art in Central Park, including a 50-foot tree made of
stainless steel.</TE>
<TE>   All of which prompts Bernard Zyscovich, a Miami architect, to wonder
if art could not be part of the solution to increased security needs. "In
Miami, we could create them as alligators. The visual result could be
very provocative."</TE>

<DL>LOUP CITY, Neb.
</DL>
<LD>It came as no surprise to anyone here in Sherman County when the
latest census showed that the population had plummeted 11% in the 1990s.
Even the editor of the weekly paper said the news had been inevitable and
that dwelling on it--in print or otherwise--didn't serve any useful
purpose.</LD>
<LD>   In Rockville, one town over, postmistress Marie Arthur saw the news as
confirmation of what has been going on in the small rural towns of the
Great Plains for years: "We don't have much left here." Indeed, out on
Main Street, only two commercial buildings remain: her post office and,
next to a shuttered bank, Jane's Tavern.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff James Kugler, whose office wall is adorned with a life-size
poster of John Wayne, didn't pay much attention to the report either;
he's been busy investigating the county's first murder since 1941.</LD>
<TE>   With 3,318 residents, or less than six people per square mile, Sherman
County was one of nine in the United States to revert to "frontier
status" in the 2000 Census. (The term was coined in 1890 to distinguish
"civilization" from unsettled land.)</TE>
<TE>   For some folks here, there is an acceptance of the inevitable: The
rural counties of the Great Plains have lost one-third of their
population since the peak of the 1920s. While the 1990s saw the nation's
population expand by 13%, nearly 60% of the Plains' counties grew smaller
as the old died and the young left to seek opportunity elsewhere in
nonfarming careers.</TE>
<TE>   But in places like Loup City (population 1,104), residents are
marshaling resources to try to save their towns--and the neighborly
lifestyles they offer.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, deaths outnumbered births in Sherman County, 44 to 36. The
population in Hazard has fallen to 78, the high school has closed and the
primary school enrollment stands at 12. Ravenna's graduating high school
class had 68 students in 1971, 32 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we're losing 10 or 15 kids, and a school obviously can't
go on like that forever," said Dwaine Uttechi, the superintendent in
Ravenna, which is in adjoining Buffalo County. "When you get down to
about 40 students in high school, you have to ask if you can still
provide the social interaction and other necessities kids need. But
people fight hard to keep their schools. They think, 'If we lose the
school, we lose the town.' "</TE>
<TE>   To try to stem the tide, more than 100 Nebraska communities have set
up tax-deductible foundations to underwrite local projects. Loup City has
used bonds to build a new high school and swimming pool, and one couple's
$250,000 donation went toward a community center and two ball fields. The
town of Ord instituted a 1% sales tax for development. Ravenna raised
$2,000 for a child-care center by holding a bake sale and spaghetti
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The proprietor of Jane's Tavern breathed some life into Rockville by
importing Maine lobsters; she sold 36 to diners one recent Saturday. A
summer lobster festival draws thousands of visitors to Rockville, which
calls itself the "lobster capital of Nebraska."</TE>
<TE>   "Some people in the small communities have a sense of hopelessness,"
said Tom Osborne, the district's Republican congressman and a former
University of Nebraska Cornhuskers football coach. "But I tell them there
is real potential here. All the land in Nebraska is good for something.
We don't have wasteland. We don't have a lot of federal land. And with
the Ogallala Aquifer, there's accessible and bountiful water under all
this land."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to create opportunities and incentives for young people
to stay, Osborne is promoting increased computer literacy, expanded
access to broadband technology and the idea of local scholarships that
provide a college education for students who agree to return to their
community for a set number of years. Partly as a result, almost every
town now has its own Web site, including tiny Hazard, which currently is
profiling Tom Croston, a lifelong resident who is 92.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, two Rutgers University teachers--land-use expert Frank Popper
and his wife, Deborah, a geographer--offered a radical solution for the
development of the Plains' troubled rural counties: Turn them into a
"buffalo commons" on which bison could roam free again. Their plan called
for the federal government to return the land to the way it was before
white settlers arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and ranchers were so outraged that the Poppers for a time
needed police protection when giving speeches in the Great Plains. Their
idea smacked of East Coast academia, and the gentlest message they
received from townspeople was that they should go back home and take care
of New Jersey. (Since then, with the depopulation of rural counties
continuing at a steady clip, the hostility has faded.)</TE>
<TE>   "Sherman County is a small-scale confirmation of what we're talking
about--that the American frontier is returning," said Frank Popper, who
notes that Ted Turner runs bison over Plains' acreage larger than
Delaware. "Clearly Plan A, with huge federal subsidies underwriting aging
populations, falling water tables and troubled economies, didn't work.
It's time to try Plan B: ecotourism, prairie restoration, cultural and
historical preservation and marketing bison products."</TE>

<HD>Bank Says Deposits Went Uncredited</HD>
<DH>Glitch: Bank of America scrambles to correct a computer error that
blocked payments to customers' accounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America acknowledged on Saturday that 1.1 million direct
deposit customers in California, Arizona and Nevada were affected by a
computer glitch that prevented their payroll and Social Security checks
from being credited to their accounts on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A bank spokesman said late Saturday that the institution was still
trying to determine whether customers who pay their bills electronically
were affected as well.</LD>
<LD>   The bank did not know the exact cause of the problem, but believed it
was an internal software glitch.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not a hacker or a computer virus," said bank spokesman Ken
Preston in Los Angeles. "We believe it's an internal problem."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, things like this happen when a bank changes software
programs, said Trent Fleming, a bank technology expert based in Memphis,
Tenn. "We like to do tests before we put these systems on line but you
can never exactly replicate the data that the real system is going to
encounter," Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank officials could not say whether all direct deposit accounts were
affected, or just certain types, such as Social Security checks or
railroad retirement payments.</TE>
<TE>   However, Fleming said such information was key and would help
determine whether a software program had merely skipped a specific
transaction code, which would be fairly simple to fix, or if it was a
major glitch affecting all types of electronic transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America officials said its computer specialists were working
feverishly to get the problem resolved Saturday night, but could not give
an estimate of when the problem would be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "We apologize to our customers who are affected by this problem," said
Ken Preston. "We are doing everything possible to immediately correct
it."</TE>
<TE>   The bank said that while it appeared that automated teller deposits
had been properly credited, paychecks and other automatic deposits had
not.</TE>
<TE>   "The killer is that this happened on the 15th when everyone is getting
paid," said Preston.</TE>
<TE>   The bank said it had launched "backup procedures" to ensure "complete
and accurate posting of transactions to customer accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Customers who called the bank's automated help line (1-800-622-8731)
were told by recorded message only that the bank was "aware of an
automated deposit posting problem" and the bank appreciated customer
patience while it attempted to resolve it.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the bank said it would work with customers to
"resolve any issues related to this situation."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, said Preston, was that the bank would take care of
any fees and charges if customer checks bounced as the result of the
computer error.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., is one of the nation's
oldest and largest financial institutions, with nearly a 25% market share
in California.</TE>

<HD>National Debt Is Growing Concern</HD>
<DH>Economy: With boom times of late '90s fading and defense-related
costs soaring, talk of eliminating the national deficit has been
silenced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES TOEDTMAN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The buds are set on the giant magnolia tree glowering over
President Bush and the Oval Office. The 150-foot magnolia was planted in
1835 by Andrew Jackson because he was lonesome for a reminder of his
beloved Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   With glistening leaves and its floral and aromatic revival each year,
it is an imposing legacy of the seventh president. It has also gained
notoriety in recent years as a marker of the last time the U.S.
government had no national debt. As the economy roared through the 1990s,
politicians and economists began talking about the prospect of actually
eliminating the national debt for the first time since 1835, when Andrew
Jackson planted that tree.</LD>
<LD>   In his last official attempt to lockbox Bush 14 months ago,
then-President Clinton forecast that the national debt could be fully
eliminated by 2008 if his policies were pursued. As the Bush era
unfolded, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hedged slightly. He
felt that he might have a little more leverage for implementing monetary
policy if the debt weren't fully eliminated. But he agreed that it should
be drastically reduced and could eventually be paid off.</LD>
<TE>The Vanishing Surplus</TE>
<TE>   Alas, any hopes of actually paying off the debt vanished quicker than
you can say "Old Hickory." The January 2001 forecast of a $5.6-trillion
budget surplus over the next decade was revised in February to $1.6
trillion.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the publicly held debt is climbing again--from $5.6 trillion
two years ago to $5.8 trillion last year to $5.933 trillion last month.</TE>
<TE>   That puts the administration in the awkward circumstance of having to
ask Congress' permission for more borrowing. The current debt limit,
$5.95 trillion, was set in 1997. The administration wants to raise it by
$750 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That has several immediate consequences, none of them good. The
government's interest costs, which had been falling, are on the rise. The
$226-billion bill for debt service is the fourth-largest spending item in
the federal budget next year, behind the Defense Department, Social
Security and Medicare. The spiral of anticipated deficits over the next
decade has also pushed long-term interest costs higher, Greenspan said.
That raises the cost of home mortgages and may also stifle the latest
round of home refinancing.</TE>
<TE>Falling Along Party Lines</TE>
<TE>   But the real mischief is political.</TE>
<TE>   The debt limit must be raised, which is a necessity, but an
embarrassment nonetheless to the Bush band of fiscal pragmatists.
Democrats want to highlight that Republican embarrassment any way they
can. They oppose Republicans' idea of smothering the debt limit provision
with other critical spending, such as defense or education. Some
Democrats have discussed breaking the $750-billion request into smaller
pieces, forcing repeated votes to gradually raise the debt ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Republican House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) wants it passed as
part of larger legislation, perhaps the supplemental budget request being
crafted by the administration. There is also some preliminary discussion
about attaching this to a still-undefined trigger mechanism aimed at
capping spending or tax cuts to curtail future budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has started prodding House and Senate
leaders to move the legislation. Democrats are in no hurry and
Republicans can't decide what to do. That makes it almost certain that
the Andrew Jackson magnolia will be in full bloom before this is
resolved.</TE>

<HD>St. Patrick's Day Marked by Tributes</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Amid the traditional Irish fun, revelers stop to honor
victims of Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>St. Patrick's Day celebrations unfolded across America on Saturday,
led by the nation's oldest and largest parade, which paused for a silent
moment to honor the dead in a city healing from terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   As bagpipers played the last chords of "God Bless America," thousands
of marchers and hundreds of thousands of spectators along Fifth Avenue
faced south in silence toward where the World Trade Center towers had
stood.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of those who were lost on Sept. 11 would otherwise be marching
proudly. . . . We know their spirit marches with us," said Ireland's
president, Mary McAleese, who joined the New York parade for the first
time.</LD>
<TE>   The parade, like others across the country, was filled with small,
poignant tributes to the victims, but it also carried the usual sprightly
twists of Irish humor.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush marched with politicians and firefighters in Chicago,
where the Chicago River was dyed green for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "People are generally good and fun-loving and they need little reason
to show it--this day has a lot of tradition about being a happy day,"
said Steve Healey, 33, an engineer who ran in a pre-parade race in
Rochester, N.Y., carrying an Irish flag.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its reputation for treating the day as a post-Mardi Gras beer
bash, Savannah, Ga., celebrated by playing up patriotism and toning down
the shenanigans. The biggest cheers were reserved for marchers wearing
camouflage and police blues.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard St. Patrick's Day is over the top down here and we've had an
unbelievable reception from people," said New York police officer Jack
Bishop, pausing for photos and lipstick-smeared kisses from women rushing
out of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, controversy emerged over how best to honor firefighters.
Parade organizers decided against letting a fire engine lead the parade,
but agreed to honor the victims with the moment of silence.</TE>

<HD>Fungus Food Poses Meaty Dilemma</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: It's packed with protein and supposedly tastes like
chicken, but some consumer watchdogs are crying foul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRASHER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A fake meat that is made from fungus, but looks and tastes like
chicken, has arrived in U.S. supermarkets. In Europe, the meat substitute
rivals soyburgers and similar products in popularity.</LD>
<LD>   Known as mycoprotein, it is marketed under the trade name Quorn
(pronounced kworn) and made into a variety of products, including
chicken-like nuggets, lasagna and fettuccine Alfredo--even an alternative
to ground beef, called "grounds."</LD>
<LD>   "It's wonderful as far as consumers are concerned," said Leslie Bonci,
a nutrition specialist who first tried mycoprotein in a London
restaurant. "It's a lot of protein for a minimal amount of calories and
three to four grams of fiber."</LD>
<TE>   Scientists found the fungus growing on farms west of London in the
1960s and discovered that its long strands could be made into a product
that mimicked the fibrous tissue of meat.</TE>
<TE>   The fungus is now grown through fermentation, mixed with egg and
flavorings and fashioned into imitation chicken or beef.</TE>
<TE>   The product was developed by a subsidiary of the Anglo-Swedish
pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and introduced in Britain in 1985. It is
now eaten in one in 20 British households, the company says, and is sold
in six other European countries. It arrived in U.S. stores in January
after getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's got a lot of potential. We just have to make sure fungus
is not going to appear on the label anywhere," said Bonci, director of
sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Labels on Quorn products say that mycoprotein "comes from a small,
unassuming member of the mushroom family, which we ferment like yogurt."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds much more appealing than calling it a fungus--mycoprotein
means fungal protein--but it also is not accurate, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   "It has as much to do with mushrooms as you and I have to do with
salamanders," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the advocacy
group Center for Science in the Public Interest. "We all know what a
mushroom looks like. This ain't it."</TE>
<TE>   His group has complained to the FDA about the label, and says the
agency should not have approved mycoprotein without requiring more review
of its potential to cause allergic reactions, because it has not been
consumed in this country before.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of U.S. scientists that reviewed the product at the
manufacturer's expense decided there was little chance that people would
be allergic to Quorn and that the product had many nutritional benefits.
Their report, published last year in the journal Food Technology, was
submitted to the government.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to lend itself to a lot of different things,
particularly for people who want to limit their intake of meat protein,"
said Sanford Miller, a former FDA food safety chief who headed the panel.</TE>
<TE>   A serving of Quorn nuggets has 180 calories, eight grams of fat (about
six less than chicken nuggets), three grams of fiber and no cholesterol.
A 10.6-ounce box of the product sells for $3.69 in Washington-area
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Quorn's maker had $150 million sales in Europe last year and is
projecting 20% growth this year with the U.S. introduction. It's sold in
about 200 U.S. natural-foods stores and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of all new food products fail within two years, but this
one may be different, said John Lord, a professor of food marketing at
St. Joseph's University. "It sounds like it's a really good opportunity
for people who want to eat healthy but still have some sort of sensory
satisfaction."</TE>

<HD>Professor's Calendar Is Set in Stone</HD>
<DH>Science: The ambitious project built along the lines of Stonehenge
is used as a teaching tool.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY TYNAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>AMHERST, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>Even with big, powerful earth-moving machines, it isn't easy to
build a calendar of standing stones to mark the seasons.</LD>
<LD>   But using an ancient design and 56 tons of Berkshire granite, Judith
Young has created a teaching tool for a new millennium with her massive
modern stone circle. It sits outside the football stadium at the
University of Massachusetts.</LD>
<LD>   The rough granite blocks are labeled to mark the rising and setting of
the sun on the solstices and equinox, as well as the extremes of moonrise
and moonset.</LD>
<TE>   Young's sunwheel, a stone circle 130 feet in diameter, has evolved
over the past six years. It is no mere replica of Stonehenge, the
4,000-year-old stone circle that rises from Britain's Salisbury Plain,
aligned along the rising of the sun at the summer solstice.</TE>
<TE>   Her standing stones are precisely aligned to Amherst's latitude to
allow university students, schoolchildren and just ordinary folks to
explore the mysteries of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way to teach people about the sky and to love science and the
universe without using electricity or computers," said Young, an
astronomy professor who has developed special lessons for middle and
elementary school teachers using the sunwheel.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't something you find in a book," she said. "It was the first
science."</TE>
<TE>   The most popular times for visitors--about 3,000 have visited in the
last year--are the midsummer and midwinter days. The solstices mark the
times when, because of the earth's 23.5-degree tilt, the sun's path seems
farthest from the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer
solstice, June 21, is the longest day; the winter solstice, Dec. 21, is
the shortest.</TE>
<TE>   On a winter afternoon with dark shadows stretching across the great
stones and the frost-seared grasses in a field outside the football
stadium, it's easy to understand why the solstices were so important to
ancient civilizations.</TE>
<TE>   "The word solstice means to stand still," Young said. "For two weeks
around the summer and winter solstice, the sun appears to stand
still--rise and set in the same spot. They couldn't miss it."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, the sun set and rose on the university's
solstice stones from Dec. 13-29.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the spring and fall equinoxes, which mark the times when
day and night are of equal length, last only a few hours, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Young's first sunwheel was made of 1- and 2-foot-high boulders. Then,
armed with a $35,000 National Science Foundation grant, she began
building the existing stone circle.</TE>
<TE>   She admits she developed a bit more respect for the ancient
calendar-makers. The first thing she discovered is that most modern
quarries produce smooth, shaped stones, not rugged, natural boulders like
those used by ancient monument-builders.</TE>
<TE>   She finally found the stones at the small Chester Granite Co. in East
Otis, about 45 miles away. The largest is 10 feet high, weighs 7,000
pounds and marks sunrise on the summer solstice. The smallest are the
6-foot-high stones that mark the moon's 18.6-year cycle. The next time
the moon, because of the tilt in its orbit, will appear to reach a major
standstill is 2007, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The ancients handled the problem of the heavy stones settling and
knocking their calendars out of alignment by choosing boulders big enough
so they could bury the base deep in the earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't afford that much stone," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep her 12 stones in trim, Young had 4-foot-deep holes dug for
each one. The holes were lined with a water-permeable fabric and filled
with some 51 tons of crushed stone. A 2-foot stainless-steel pin and a
coating of modern epoxy anchored each stone to a foot-thick granite base.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a modern crawler excavator and the help of civil engineering
professors, it took four days to erect the stones.</TE>
<TE>   "The only easy part was calculating where to place them," Young said.</TE>

<HD>Accused Priests Continued to Work, Paper Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>New York Cardinal Edward M. Egan allowed several priests accused of
sexual abuse to continue their duties for years while he led a
Connecticut diocese, a newspaper reported, citing court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show that Egan did not refer complaints to criminal
authorities and suggested during closed testimony in 1999 that a dozen
people who accused the same priest of rape, molestation and beatings may
have all been lying, the Hartford Courant said in a story for today's
editions.</LD>
<LD>   "Allegations are allegations," Egan testified, according to the
paper's story.</LD>
<TE>   The court documents were sealed last year when the Roman Catholic
Bridgeport diocese settled sex abuse lawsuits, the Courant said. Included
were transcripts of pretrial testimony by Egan and previous Bishop Walter
Curtis, internal diocesan memorandums and personnel files. The paper did
not say how it got the documents.</TE>
<TE>   The records show that, in addition to the eight priests who were
originally sued, at least nine others were accused of molestation but
were not publicly identified. The documents name seven of the priests,
one of whom leads a Connecticut parish.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said the documents show that Curtis, who is deceased,
testified in 1995 that the diocese deliberately moved priests accused of
pedophilia among parishes to give them a "fresh start."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with plaintiffs' lawyers, Curtis was asked if he had
ever transferred a priest "because of pedophilic conduct" and replied,
"Yes," the paper said. Curtis said the new parish was not notified of the
allegations against the priest.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said Egan did not respond to requests for comment, and
his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, referred questions Saturday to the
Bridgeport diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph McAleer, a spokesman for the Bridgeport Diocese, told the
newspaper that "this was litigated for eight years and was in the
newspapers practically every day."</TE>
<TE>   Current Bridgeport Bishop William E. Lori said last week that the
diocese was examining the records of all clergy for signs of sexual
misconduct and was creating an advisory board to address the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese settled complaints against six priests for an undisclosed
amount in March 2001, shortly after Egan was appointed to the New York
archdiocese. Egan served in Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The documents show that Egan defrocked at least one priest for sexual
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   The Courant said that when a dozen complaints were made against Father
Raymond Pcolka of Greenwich, Egan allowed Pcolka to work as a priest
until 1993. He suspended him after Pcolka refused to get psychiatric
treatment.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Two investigation teams arrived in southern Arizona Saturday to
probe a midair collision between an Army airplane and a civilian aircraft
that killed a military pilot.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the Aviation Safety Center at Ft. Rucker, Ala., and
the National Transportation Safety Board began scouring the wreckage at
the crash site in Marana, Ariz., where Chief Warrant Officer Lowell K.
Timmons, 45, was killed Friday, said Julia Bobick, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. Army Recruiting Command in Ft. Knox, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   The airplane used by the Army's Golden Knights skydiving team crashed
in a dry riverbed one mile north of the Marana Airport after colliding
with a Cessna carrying five civilians. Four Golden Knights parachutists
jumped from the Porter turboprop plane before the collision.</LD>
<TE>   The pilot of the civilian aircraft, which took off from the Marana
Skydiving Center, about 20 miles north of Tucson, landed the plane with a
damaged wing, said Officer Tim Brunenkant, a Marana police spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Clinton Aides in Tight Congressional Primary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Rahm Emanuel is using all the political skills he honed as an
operative for President Clinton--from tireless campaigning to slick
television ads and high-powered endorsements--in the final days of a
tight Democratic primary race for Congress.</LD>
<LD>   But that may not be enough to overcome a well-financed former state
lawmaker who's won her own share of national endorsements in a
multimillion-dollar battle that also features another ex-Clinton aide.</LD>
<LD>   A recent poll of voters in the diverse district on this city's far
North Side showed Emanuel in a dead heat with former state Rep. Nancy
Kaszak as Tuesday's primary election nears.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very competitive," Kaszak said at Saturday's St. Patrick Day
parade. "But the key thing is that we're going to pull it off on Tuesday
because we have a tremendous number of community people who are knocking
on doors, sending notes to their neighbors, calling them up on the phone
and saying you've gotta come out on Tuesday to vote."</TE>
<TE>   About 50 yards away Emanuel was surrounded by supporters and wearing a
green bowler as he prepared to march in the parade. He expressed
confidence as long as the verdict came down to "my agenda versus her
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very good about our chances," he said. "I feel very good about
the response I'm getting from voters all over the district."</TE>
<TE>   The district runs from the lakefront west to blue collar neighborhoods
surrounding O'Hare International Airport, and it's impossible to go more
than a few blocks without seeing signs for Kaszak, Emanuel and former
Clinton aide Pete Dagher.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates also have been blanketing the airwaves with
commercials--often negative--and stuffing mail boxes throughout the
district with glossy pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel and Dagher are among about a dozen veterans of the Clinton
administration running for prominent political offices this year,
including former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, ex-Atty. Gen. Janet
Reno and Erskine Bowles, a former White House chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's primary will be the first time voters have the chance to
decide on any of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, is vacating the seat to run for
governor. The district leans heavily Democratic and the winner of the
primary is expected to be the odds-on favorite against the Republican
candidate in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   While some former members of the Clinton administration rarely mention
Clinton on the campaign trail, the 42-year-old Emanuel has embraced
Clinton's legacy and touted his work in the White House.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Trail Leaves Lasting Impressions</HD>
<DH>History: Traces of the thousands of pioneers who took the rugged
yet beautiful route west are still visible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMALIE YOUNG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NYSSA, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Wagons carved such deep ruts in some dusty hills on the Oregon
Trail in the mid-19th century that nothing will grow there yet. The
parallel path of the wheels stretch for miles in those spots.</LD>
<LD>   From a crossing at the Snake River, visitors can follow parts of the
route taken by more than 300,000 homesteaders and adventure-seekers as
they pressed north toward the Columbia River into what is now Oregon,
then west to their Eden--the lush Willamette Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Wasted away by weather and use, much of the 2,170-mile Oregon Trail
has become disconnected and too faint to find.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no single trail," says Michael Evans-Hatch, a historian who
has contracted with the National Park Service to identify and research
the path. "Throughout the western United States there are enormous gaps."</TE>
<TE>   Those gaps grew as modern road builders followed deeper, more
permanent sections of the trail, paving over wagon ruts with highways.
The first transcontinental railroad, the Union Pacific, was built along
parts of the route. And new roads have shifted settlements far away from
old emigrant towns, leaving much of the trail unkempt and abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   To remind visitors of the perilous journey made by those long-ago
weary travelers, museums, wayside stops and parks have been built along
the route, offering a glimpse of the struggles of those who helped open
up the West.</TE>
<TE>Not for Faint of Heart</TE>
<TE>   Between 1841 and 1869, a wave of emigrants set out from Independence,
Mo., crossing through what are now the states of Kansas, Nebraska,
Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Most walked, often barefoot. They were tired and hungry. The going was
slow, with the oxen that pulled their wagons plodding across only about
15 miles a day. At least 20,000 people died along the way, many of
cholera.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the pioneers reached what is now Oregon, they had been on
the trail for months.</TE>
<TE>   Near the pioneer crossing over the Snake River, close to what is now
Nyssa, a wayside marker at dusty Keeney Pass points out several miles of
still-visible wagon ruts.</TE>
<TE>   A pioneer named John Henderson died there; a stone marker outside the
nearby town of Vale reads: "Died of Thirst Aug. 9 1852 Unaware of
nearness of the Malheur River."</TE>
<TE>   "He just gave up," says Virginia Bloom, who works at the Oregon Trail
Regional Museum not far away in Baker City, where about 150,000 visitors
stop each year. "He was only so many yards from where he could've gotten
water."</TE>
<TE>   Settlers who found the river several miles to the northeast rested on
its banks, bathing and washing their clothes in the hot springs there.</TE>
<TE>   In Vale, an 1873 building that once offered bare accommodations for
travelers has been transformed into the Rinehart Stone House museum.
These days, the town is adorned with more than 20 graceful murals
depicting the history of the area.</TE>
<TE>   From Vale, the emigrants forged north, meeting up with the Snake River
one last time at Farewell Bend. A state park now marks the spot where, as
early as 1840, pioneers stocked up on wood and water before bidding
farewell to the river that had guided them for 320 miles.</TE>
<TE>Taste of Old West</TE>
<TE>   One of the most spectacular stops is the Oregon Trail Regional Museum,
built just outside Baker City 10 years ago by the Bureau of Land
Management to re-create the everyday hardships and heroics of life on the
trail.</TE>
<TE>   The museum gives the rare opportunity to stand in old wagon ruts. A
4.2-mile trail system loops around Flagstaff Hill, leading to a series of
viewpoints and historic sites. Life-size models, artifacts and sound
recordings of journal entries pull visitors back in time.</TE>
<TE>   Sonja Estes, who lives in nearby Richland, stopped by the center to
kill time on one recent cold afternoon and found herself enthralled with
the local history.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine?" she said, looking at a life-size display of a
haggard pioneer woman offering clothes to an American Indian in exchange
for a fish. "I like the creature comforts myself."</TE>
<TE>   Pioneers may have struggled as they passed through the Burnt River
canyon in barren eastern Oregon, and welcomed the grass, wood and water
available once they reached Baker City.</TE>
<TE>   Close to the end of the wagon-train era, a miner struck it rich,
transforming the town. By 1900, the city's hotels, opera house, trolleys,
electricity and telephone service made it the cultural showplace of the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Baker City now boasts more than 100 buildings listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and is a jumping-off point for spectacular
scenery, wildlife encounters and historic exploration of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Before reaching the Columbia River, the travelers had to traverse
through the rugged Blue Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Trail Interpretive Park at Blue Mountain Crossing, located
between La Grande and Pendleton, offers a paved, half-mile trail through
the forest, guiding visitors along some of the best-preserved sections of
the pioneers' path.</TE>
<TE>   After the pioneers crossed the Blues, the vast Columbia Plateau
stretched before them. Off in the distance was the last mountain range to
cross, the Cascades.</TE>
<TE>   Many emigrants passed through the twin towns of Echo and Stanfield,
following the Umatilla River on their way to the Columbia. Several old
emigrant cemeteries, as well as hiking and camping sites, are located
around town.</TE>
<TE>   A replica of Fort Henrietta, the first military stockade for local
American Indians, stands on the edge of Echo.</TE>
<TE>   From there, pioneers met the mighty Columbia. Those who could afford
it paid local boatmen to take them and their wagons on rafts down the
dangerous river, or they built their own rafts. Many chose to continue by
land and cross the Cascades on the Barlow Road, where they paid a a toll.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sort of a jolt to have to face those choices," said Richard
Engeman of the Oregon Historical Society. "Neither was easy, neither was
cheap."</TE>
<TE>   But after a six-month journey--and 400 miles across Oregon--the
settlers were near the end of the great trail.</TE>

<HD>Manure-to-Methane Plan Picks Up Steam</HD>
<DH>Northwest: Dairy farms could provide consumers with an alternative
source of renewable energy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA ASHTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SUNNYSIDE, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>It's a little bit like the old saying, "When life gives you lemons,
make lemonade."</LD>
<LD>   Dairies have given the Yakima Valley an abundance of cow manure and,
one day, it might be used to make methane.</LD>
<LD>   To that end, Energy Northwest, the public power group that owns the
region's only nuclear power plant, is looking at the possibility of
teaming up with dairy farms in Washington, Oregon and Idaho to develop
this form of "green" power.</LD>
<TE>   The goal is to build a 3- to 4-megawatt electrical power plant fueled
with "biogas," or manure-derived methane.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working with the dairy industry for 10 to 15 years, trying
to solve the manure waste problem," said Ivan White, president of
Sunnyside Inc., the economic development group for this central
Washington city of 14,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sunnyside in Yakima County is one of the locations Energy Northwest is
looking at, along with northwestern Washington's Whatcom County, Boise
and Twin Falls, Idaho, and Tillamook, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Yakima County alone has 85,000 head of dairy cows, and tons of manure.
That's a very renewable resource.</TE>
<TE>   And it's no bull that biodigester technology today makes it possible
to get about 0.3 kilowatts of electricity per cow, as much as 0.9
kilowatts in some European studies, said Stan Davison, business
development specialist for the Richland-based utility. One kilowatt is
enough to power 10 100-watt lightbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   The manure-to-methane project would work like this:</TE>
<TE>   A big digester tank, acting essentially as a mechanical stomach, is
filled with a slurry of manure and water. Bacteria, already present in
the waste, process the manure into methane while thriving in the
130-degree temperature of the tank.</TE>
<TE>   The methane rises to the top--it's lighter than air--and is piped off
to power a pair of modified diesel generators outfitted with spark plugs.</TE>
<TE>   While the generators make electricity, the remaining fiber in the
tanks settles to the bottom. Liquid squeezed out of the fiber makes
fertilizer and the dry fiber makes compost.</TE>
<TE>   The Northwest accounts for 8% of the nation's dairy farm business. A
biomass power plant would need access to a dairy or dairies, room to
build the power plant and access to transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is high capital costs," Davison said. "If you ignore
the capital costs, the fuel is free--it's a byproduct of milk. It's
something you're going to be producing anyway. You might as well handle
it as fuel as handle it as waste."</TE>
<TE>   The rough estimate for building such a plant is about $2,800 dollars a
kilowatt. Wind power runs about $1,000 per kilowatt.</TE>
<TE>   But on average, a wind farm only produces about 30% of capacity over
the course of a year, while a cow-powered plant can produce at 90%. That
just about evens up the costs, Davison said.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, there have been a number of people promoting methane
digesters. The one thing they're always lacking is capital," said Jay
Gordon, a Lewis County dairy farmer and director of the Washington State
Dairy Federation, which represents about 650 family dairy farms in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The margin is thin, Davison said. So Energy Northwest's next step is
to approach utilities to see if there's enough interest in such a project
to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a nice fit for a lot of dairy farms, if it doesn't cost
the farmer money, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the technology works. We know it's a great concept. We know
it's renewable. We know it's green," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the construction and capitalization of the facilities and the
issue of return on investment could make a good idea in theory difficult
to execute, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Oregon, Portland General Electric is working cooperatively with
dairies in Boardman and Salem, Ore., on digester projects, and it doesn't
cost the farms anything, said Joe Barra, director of distributed energy
for the utility.</TE>
<TE>   Manure management has been a problem for dairies, faced with more
environmental regulation and suburban expansion into agricultural areas.</TE>
<TE>   The actual percentage of reduction in manure is small, Gordon said,
but the leftover fiber and liquid are more sanitary and less aromatic.</TE>
<TE>   "If the energy utility comes in and says it won't cost anything, and
you get a little less smelly product, a little more usable product, it
fits with the nature of the farm," Gordon said.</TE>

<HD>Air Travel May Follow Geese's Lead</HD>
<DH>Nature: Fowl's familiar V-pattern could be a fuel-saving strategy
for commercial aircraft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BRIDGES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Taking a cue from the world of geese, scientists are developing a
system that will allow airplanes to fly autonomously in tight
V-formations over long distances.</LD>
<LD>   For geese, the carefully arranged formation saves energy on migratory
flights. Scientists hope passenger, cargo and military planes will one
day mimic the flight pattern to cut fuel consumption by as much as 20%.</LD>
<LD>   Geese cut resistance by drafting, a technique also used in automobile
and bicycle racing, where racers line up one behind another to cheat the
wind.</LD>
<TE>   The Autonomous Formation Flight project instead makes clever use of
the swirling horizontal tornado of air that flows from another plane's
wing tips to literally surf that vortex.</TE>
<TE>   By dipping a single wing into the upward-flowing portion of the
vortex, the plane can use the additional lift it provides to cut fuel
consumption.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can find where that upward wind is and put your airplane in
it, you are essentially riding a wave," said Dick Ewers, a retired Marine
Corps pilot helping to test the system.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots normally avoid vortices that persist for miles--and minutes--in
the wake of other aircraft. Indeed, officials suspect such a whirl of air
may have contributed to the November crash of American Airlines Flight
587 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the joint project by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, UCLA and the Boeing Co. is to exploit their potential
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible you can use something that can be a detriment to
flight--that you can use the vortex as an enhancement as well," said
Robert Meyer, director of aerospace projects at NASA's Dryden Flight
Research Center at Edwards, where the program is being tested on a pair
of F/A-18 fighter planes.</TE>
<TE>   The system was first tested in flight last February. In December, two
of the NASA jets demonstrated for the first time what scientists had long
suspected: that formation flying can provide significant fuel savings.</TE>
<TE>   During a 96-minute flight that took the jets cruising at 40,000 feet
into Nevada and back, the trailing aircraft spent most of the time with
its left wing inserted in the vortex spiraling off the lead jet's right
wing.</TE>
<TE>   The two planes flew just 55 feet apart, close enough for the glint of
the sun on the lead aircraft's aluminum wing to flash in Ewers' eyes as
he trailed.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't be waxing that airplane so much," Ewers quipped. A dozen
engineers at Edwards monitored the flight on multiple video screens at
the base's control room.</TE>
<TE>   Although the planes flew the same distance, initial results suggest
the second plane used 660 pounds, or 12%, less fuel than did the lead
plane.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have extended the range of the aircraft by 117 miles," said
Gerard Schkolnik, the project's manager at NASA. Scientists are targeting
savings of up to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The system relies on Global Positioning System units and an advanced
autopilot system to work. By pinpointing each plane's position in
space--and shuttling that information from one to the other--the system
allows the jets to maintain distances that vary by a foot.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have already used the system to allow the planes to fly
autonomously in formation and, separately, to locate the vortex or "sweet
spot" that makes the fuel savings possible. The next goal, if flights
resume next summer, is to test how well the system can find a vortex and
keep the trailing plane plugged into it. However, NASA's ongoing budget
crisis has made the future of the $8-million project uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The mix of hardware and software theoretically could allow the planes
to hold their positions for hours, without constant human intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "To do it manually for a pilot is almost prohibitively tiring and
demanding," Ewers said.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Cobleigh, the project's chief engineer, said the technology
could also allow a single pilot to control swarms of robotic aircraft or
to ease the tricky business of refueling airplanes in flight from
airborne tankers.</TE>
<TE>   The experimental system is at least five to 10 years away from
entering common use, he said.</TE>

<LD>A Changed America--Some extraneous wording appeared in the early
edition of last Sunday's story about how Sept. 11 has affected civil
liberties. The altered paragraph should have read: Since Sept. 11, the
federal government has approved secret military tribunals for accused
terrorists, given law enforcement unprecedented powers to tap phones and
read e-mail, and helped foster an atmosphere of self-censorship summed up
shortly after the attacks by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, who
warned Americans to "watch what they say."</LD>

<HD>Hantuchova Sheds a Fear</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Playing her first tour final, Slovakian teenager
overcomes self-doubt and Hingis to win Pacific Life Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>So often, victory has intimidated and eluded Daniela Hantuchova,
costing her in the last year against the elite players in women's
tennis.</LD>
<LD>   When the slender 18-year-old from Slovakia faltered in Saturday's
Pacific Life Open final against Martina Hingis, it became difficult
to watch. But this time self-confidence, not self-destruction,
carried the day as Hantuchova defeated Hingis, 6-3, 6-4, in 75
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   When Hantuchova allowed a shot to drop on the line with the
second-seeded Hingis serving at 3-5 in the second set, she was
visibly dismayed. It was a rare rookie mistake.</LD>
<TE>   Hantuchova lost that game at love, but the past experiences of
misery helped her rather than haunted her. She won the first point of
the next game, resumed breathing and took the title on her second
match point, rifling a backhand winner down the line. Having
completed the biggest upset on the WTA tour since Meghann Shaughnessy
defeated Venus Williams last summer at Stanford, a stunned Hantuchova
dropped her racket and put her hands over her face, basking in the
applause at Indian Wells Tennis Garden. She jogged over to celebrate
with her jubilant parents, Marianna and Igor, who had flown in from
Bratislava on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's like dream coming true because this was my first
final ever in such an important tournament and playing one of the
greatest players, beating her the way I did today was just
unbelievable for me," said Hantuchova, who won $332,000.</TE>
<TE>   "That was always my dream to have both [parents] at my first
final. So I'm very happy my dad came, too, that they were both
watching my match."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hingis: "Oh, she just played very fearless, had nothing to
lose. I had a few opportunities, which I didn't take, especially
early in the set and she was hitting those lines. I'm like, 'OK, not
much I can do about that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, 21, thought about it some more. She had hit a strange note
in the on-court ceremony, twice mentioning the possibility of revenge
against Hantuchova, who was poised and classy in her acceptance
speech.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 18, I was fearless too, I guess," Hingis said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova was appearing in her first final, acting as though it
was her 40th, not her first. She was broken in the opening game but
came back and broke Hingis. In all, she broke Hingis' serve six
times. Passivity was never part of her game plan. Hantuchova's smooth
yet powerful groundstrokes continually caught the lines, keeping
Hingis off balance and unable to read her shots.</TE>
<TE>   She had 20 backhand winners to five for Hingis. It was just as
one-sided on the forehand side, as Hantuchova had 10 winners to three
for Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   Nigel Sears, who has coached Hantuchova since the middle of last
year, kept the game plan simple.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, if you want to win this match, you've got to take
it to Martina, you've got to hit her off the court,'" he said. "The
people that beat Martina are the people that hit her off it. You're
not going to win it if you get sucked into her game. I said, 'I
really want you to take some risks, and go for it.' There's a balance
on how much you give away when you're going for it.</TE>
<TE>   "She has the game to do it. The people that give Martina problems
are the Williamses [Venus and Serena], [Lindsay] Davenport, [Kim]
Clijsters, people who go for it. People who try and rally with her,
they get beaten every time. So that wasn't an option."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova will move to No. 17 when the new rankings are released.
She said the final was her best match because of the magnitude of the
tournament and the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "I was believing from the first point that I can beat her,"
Hantuchova said. "I was just trying to do the right things, just to
follow the tactics that were set up before the match. And it worked
out."</TE>
<TE>   As always, the final points were the most difficult. Serving for
the title at 5-2, she missed two forehands and two backhands.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a bit nervous at this point because I knew I was four
points away from winning such a big tournament," Hantuchova said.</TE>
<TE>   Sears was unsettled in his courtside seat, as were Hantuchova's
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "How many [chances] do you get against Martina Hingis?" Sears
said. "Because she's got so much experience and you always got to
feel, if you blow an opportunity, it might come back and bite you.</TE>
<TE>   "When she lost that game at 5-2, it was stressful. But she hung on
and I thought she deserved to win because she did dominate and kept
her head together. What can you say? I'm absolutely thrilled."</TE>

<HD>Players Stunned by Penalties</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels expected fallout from two bench-clearing brawls with the
San Diego Padres last week. But they were surprised Saturday by the
severity and the distribution of punishment handed down by Bob
Watson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations.</LD>
<LD>   Angel infielder Scott Spiezio was suspended for six games, third
baseman Troy Glaus was suspended for two and pitcher Aaron Sele was
fined an undisclosed amount but was not suspended.</LD>
<LD>   Padre pitcher Bobby Jones was suspended for seven
games--essentially one start--and outfielder Ryan Klesko for five.
Outfielder Ron Gant and first baseman Phil Nevin were fined.</LD>
<TE>   All the suspensions are to be served during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, who recently replaced Frank Robinson as baseball's dean of
discipline, informed the Angels late Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "What Bob is saying is this type of behavior is not going to be
tolerated," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The disciplinary action stems from incidents that occurred March
9. Sele hit Klesko with a pitch, prompting Klesko to charge the mound
and start the first brawl. Klesko and Nevin said that Sele promised
last year to hit Klesko in retaliation for perceived showboating
after a home run, a charge Sele has denied.</TE>
<TE>   After Sele hit Klesko, Jones nearly hit Glaus with a pitch,
prompting Glaus to charge the mound and trigger another brawl.
Klesko, who was ejected after the first fight, returned to the field
in street clothes during the second one.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't figure out the whole thing," Nevin said. "Apparently, you
can tell somebody you're going to drill them, then drill them, and
that's OK. But if you try to defend yourself or a teammate, you get
in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a classic case of having people in charge who haven't played
the game, or if they have played the game, they've forgotten what
it's like to play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Watson, who played 19 major-league seasons, was at the Angels'
camp Wednesday and Thursday and met with Scioscia and General Manager
Bill Stoneman. Watson told reporters that he would review videotape
of the brawls and interview all participants before meting out
punishment. However, none of the players involved said they were
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, who was suspended for aggressive actions and fighting,
will miss the first six games of the season, which begins March 31
against the Cleveland Indians at Edison Field. Glaus' suspension for
charging the mound will begin April 8, allowing Spiezio, who plays
first and third base, to replace Glaus in the lineup. It is not
unusual for baseball to stagger penalties when they involve players
who play similar positions on the same team.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio said he will appeal the suspension. Glaus said he was not
sure if he would appeal. Sele said he will pay the fine.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio was disappointed with the length of his suspension and
what he perceived as unequal treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's way too many games," he said. " ... I'm real surprised that
Klesko got less than me. Jones misses one start. That's not a big
deal. I thought I might get fined. I thought three games would be
really high. Even in a worst-case scenario, I wasn't thinking more
than three."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said Watson informed him of the penalties, not how they
were decided upon. "I'll be asking about their rationale," Stoneman
said. "If you're missing a starting pitcher for one game, it's not as
damaging as missing a regular position player for six games."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, Glaus and Sele said the penalties would not affect the
way players settle disputes on the field. "I would doubt that it's
going to be that big of a deterrent," Spiezio said. "I'll definitely
try to be more cautious, but when someone runs and attacks your
pitcher and has his fingers gouging his eyes, you're not going to sit
there and go, 'Oh well, let me think: I got six games and got fined
this amount. Maybe I better not do that.' You're reacting to the
situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost to the Chicago Cubs, 15-0, at Tempe and lost to
the Oakland Athletics, 10-4, at Phoenix. Jarrod Washburn gave up one
run and three hits in five innings against the Cubs. Outfielder Tim
Salmon played for the first time since suffering a bruised knee
Wednesday but was hitless in three at-bats against the A's.</TE>

<KH>THE 66th MASTERS TOURNAMENT / APRIL 11-14</KH>
<HD>Driver's Training</HD>
<DH>Changes on Nine Holes at Augusta Make the Masters Site
About 300 Yards Longer (Hello, Tiger!) and More Challenging</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>If he were to walk across that small, stone bridge that crosses Rae's
Creek as it hugs the left side of the 13th fairway at Augusta
National, bends gently toward the sloping green, then swoops in front
of it, Bobby Jones might notice the army of azalea bushes. If he were
to take time to count, he would find nearly 1,600 of them. Maybe
Jones would stop for a moment to admire them, then play on, probably
checking his lie and hoping to reach the green in two.</LD>
<LD>   The late Bobby Jones was born 100 years ago today, and Augusta
National, the golf course he made into one of the most famous in the
world, is nearing a special date of its own. In four weeks, just in
time for the 66th Masters tournament, the most sweeping and dramatic
changes that Augusta National has ever seen will be revealed to the
public.</LD>
<LD>   What would Bobby Jones say?</LD>
<TE>   "I think he would say, 'Well, this is today's golf, they've kept
up with the times,'" said Tom Fazio, the course designer who took the
lead on the changes. "He would say, 'It's logical.' All Augusta
National is doing is trying to protect the integrity of their
facility."</TE>
<TE>   And change is nothing new to the course, said Hootie Johnson,
chairman of Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   "Beginning in 1934 and throughout their tenures [as chairmen],
Cliff Roberts and Bob Jones made improvements to complement the
changing state of the game," Johnson said. "We have continued this
philosophy. I think [in] the changes we have made, we have attempted
to keep the golf course contemporary with the game of golf today."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is sure, it's not the same old Augusta National. Said
Larry Mize, the 1987 Masters champion, "On some holes, I don't know
if I'm even going to be able to see the green after I hit my tee
shot."</TE>
<TE>   There's some good news for Mize. On most of them, he will.</TE>
<TE>   Fazio directed a group of four contractors working together on the
project that began June 2, supported by as many as 15 subcontractors
and, on an average day, 156 workers. The work was completed Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Nine holes were altered, the course was lengthened by nearly 300
yards, bunkers were beefed up, landing areas were shaved, trees were
planted, tee boxes were shifted and now, there will be a whole new
way of doing business. Or at least that's what Johnson and the board
of directors are hoping for.</TE>
<TE>   Take the 18th hole, for instance. It's gone from 405 yards to 460,
still mostly uphill, with the bunkers on the left 10% bigger. It's
300 yards to the first bunker, 335 yards to carry both of them. The
fairway has been flattened a little to create a landing area, 285
yards from the tee, which is supposed to be the way to go.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more. There are seven new pine trees to the left of
the bunkers to discourage the adventurous from going too far that
way, and the green has been expanded slightly, recovering some lost
edges and establishing a pin placement at the back right, just over
another yawning bunker.</TE>
<TE>   The old 18th hole? That driver-and-sand-wedge that Tiger Woods
used last year to close out his second Masters title is gone forever.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened here is nothing less than the most ambitious
golf course makeover of all time--with an accompanying burden of
responsibility for history.</TE>
<TE>   The players will be the ultimate critics when the Masters begins
April 11, but Johnson is prepared for the scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the course," he said. "Along with the
rest of the Augusta National people, we feel comfortable with all the
changes in recent years. We've made the right decisions. We try to
think out things carefully. We don't do anything hasty at Augusta
National."</TE>
<TE>   There has been a parade of pros showing up to play the new course,
among them Woods, Greg Norman, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Mark
Calcavecchia, Mark O'Meara, Raymond Floyd, Ernie Els, Billy Andrade,
Tom Pernice, Vijay Singh and Tommie Aaron.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a driver's golf course," Els said. "It is a long
hitter's dream. You have to hit your driver a long way to attack the
par fives and some of the par fours. Like the first and 18th, you
will be hitting in mid-irons rather than wedges."</TE>
<TE>   When Singh played recently, he hit a three-iron second shot onto
the 18th green.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the consensus among the players is that the
alterations look as if they have been around for years.</TE>
<TE>   Work was done on seven of the 10 par-four holes and two of the par
fives. Woods said that the redone hole that really got his attention
was No. 7, which was lengthened by 45 yards to 410, with the tee area
framed by tall trees on either side. Nothing was done to the
greenside bunkers, which are numerous and tough enough anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods, "The fairway is narrowed up quite a bit because all of
a sudden, you can't hit a two-iron off that tee anymore because
you're going to be a hitting a five-iron or six-iron. [If] you drive
it down there, it narrows up quite a bit. And the fairway pitches
from left to right, so it's quite a big change."</TE>
<TE>   Woods used a driver there on Sunday last year and had only 45
yards to the flag. The feeling now is that most players are going to
have to hit a driver because of its added length.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he has no problem with the changes, which Johnson
announced the day before Woods began his successful run to a second
Masters title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the changes they have made, as Hootie has tried to
explain to me, they are trying to get the golf course back to how
they used to play it," Woods said. "Which is all right. Hitting
longer clubs into greens.</TE>
<TE>   "What they have tried to do more than anything is to bring driving
back into the game at Augusta. Before, you could just bomb and not
pay attention to where you hit it. It would help if you put the ball
on certain sides between galleries to give yourself a better angle
into the flag but, realistically, you could hit the ball anywhere and
go find it. Now you have to drive the ball in play to shoot a good
number.</TE>
<TE>   "Hootie has explained to me that driving is an integral part [and]
at Augusta, that hasn't always been the case. You have to drive the
ball ... really hit it solid and straight. You are going to really
have to have that in order to compete there."</TE>
<TE>   The new Augusta National wastes no time introducing itself. The
first tee, which used to be about even with the huge tree at the back
of the clubhouse, has been moved back 25 yards. That meant the
putting green had to be moved back as well. The fairway bunker on the
right, which wasn't in play before, returns to action in a big way.
It has also been extended 15 yards toward the green. To carry the
bunker requires a 300-yard drive. Some of the landing area has been
flattened so it doesn't look so uphill anymore, but it's still a
hike. The hole measures 435 yards.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 8, the big news--besides the tee being moved back 20 yards
and 10 yards to the right--is that the bunker on the right has been
doubled in size. It's 305 yards to carry the bunker now. The problem
is, you don't want to be too far left because that's the hardest
approach to the flag.</TE>
<TE>   The theory on the ninth hole always was to bomb it as far as you
could down the right side and let it roll down the hill toward the
crosswalk, then just pitch it on the green. Some new trees have been
planted on the right side at the bottom of the hill and pine needles
scattered. Slinging it right and letting it roll harmlessly into the
first cut is a thing of the past. The hole is 30 yards longer to 460.</TE>
<TE>   The tees at the downhill 10th are 10 yards back, making the hole
495 yards, and five yards to the left, asking more of a right-to-left
shot.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more dramatic changes is at the 11th, which has a new
tee box ringed by new magnolia trees, 35 yards farther back than
previously and five yards to the right. It's a 490-yard hole now and
Woods is probably going to hit a driver, just as he did last year.
Shorter hitters will find a flattened landing area, which will help
them, but longer hitters, like Woods, aren't going to have the
sloping fairway they used to bounce their shots off, watching them
roll toward the hole. It has been flattened. Second shots to the
green are going to call for longer irons than in years.</TE>
<TE>   The 13th tee box is a new area of the course, acquired from
neighboring Augusta Country Club, about 25 yards behind the old tees.
It's a 510-yard hole now, requiring players to hit their drives
around the corner on the dogleg left to give them a chance to go for
the green in two.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th is more difficult, lengthened 35 yards to 440, but with
the fairway rolling left to right, you can't miss it right in the
trees. And with longer irons required to reach the green, it's going
to be an adventure keeping the ball on the green.</TE>
<TE>   The official yardage at Augusta National is now 7,270 yards, with
four of the par fours measuring at least 460 yards and all of the par
fives at least 500. The official numbers are sure to take on more
importance when the players drive up Magnolia Lane and take their
first looks at the makeover. Woods has been popularly designated the
prime beneficiary of the changes because of his distance off the tee,
but his advantage remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   According to Palmer, that's the beauty of the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think that new distances will make any differences," he
said. "It's going to make the course a little more challenging, but
one thing about Augusta is that even though they've added distance,
you still have to hit the shots to the green."</TE>
<TE>   Right. It's just that getting there may be much different journey
than ever before.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In returning to my computer after a medical absence of several weeks,
the prognosis personally is far more optimistic than it is for
baseball's labor negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Those sporadic talks again threaten the game's stability and could
again end at a potentially disabling impasse.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, I had the opportunity to call on the surgical skill of
USC urologist Donald K. Skinner, who thwarted the spread of recently
detected cancer by removing my prostate gland.</LD>
<TE>   In the societal microcosm that is baseball, it's a procedure that
Dusty Baker also underwent during the winter and that Joe Torre,
Frank Robinson, Bob Watson and Larry Lucchino, among others, have
also experienced, proving that attention to RBIs and ERAs should also
include focus on PSA, the prostate-specific antigen that can be
tracked by regular blood tests and can indicate prostate cancer when
found in elevated amounts.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, there is no specialist and no known cure for the
potentially combustible labor ills if owners remain determined to
bridge their oft-bemoaned competitive and revenue-related disparities
with economic proposals that have no chance of being accepted by a
players' union in business to protect the stars and unwilling to
approve any plan that affects the ability of the top-revenue clubs to
reward the stars.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shakespeare might note that this is an industry with a
whopping $3.5 billion in revenue and call for "a plague o' both your
houses," it was the owners who set a mischievous tone even before the
bargaining agreement expired in November.</TE>
<TE>   They first pulled the negotiating rug from under Paul Beeston,
their chief operating officer and a man the union respected, last
summer and then unveiled that lamentable contraction scheme that:</TE>
<TE>   1) Quickly removed the World Series glow, 2) inflamed
long-smoldering union concerns about trust and communication, 3)
delayed labor negotiations almost three months, 4) ran headlong into
predictable legal hurdles and 5) proved only to be a smokescreen for
the clubs' comparatively hard-core approach to contract signings,
which some agents portrayed as collusion and which is expected to
leave many well-known players either out of work or receiving
surprisingly low salaries when the season opens in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It is no wonder that by the time the owners got serious about
labor, any hope of a nonconfrontational settlement was gone. It is no
wonder that three days of bargaining sessions last week--the longest
continuous talks--went nowhere, and that negotiations are not
expected to resume until after the season starts March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Whether either side ultimately has the support and/or stomach for
a ninth work stoppage is problematic.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is basically only one conclusion, given that:</TE>
<TE>   1) The owners' contraction manipulations of the off-season, 2)
their tougher approach to contract signings, 3) their claims in
congressional hearings of $500 million in losses despite that $3.5
billion in revenue, 4) the give-backs and payroll restraints they are
seeking from the union, 5) the basically forced resignation recently
of the conciliatory Beeston and 6) the alterations Commissioner Bud
Selig has made and continues to make in a negotiating team that
represents, in the opinion of one union lawyer, a hawkish extension
of his mid-market cabinet of San Diego's John Moores, Houston's
Drayton McLane, Kansas City's David Glass and Minnesota's Carl
Pohlad.</TE>
<TE>   The conclusion is that the owners, at some point, are planning to
declare a bargaining impasse and unilaterally implement their own
work rules.</TE>
<TE>   Said a veteran observer familiar with the thinking on both sides:
"Short of a capitulation by the players [on the key issues], which
won't happen, I don't see any other conclusion than to believe the
owners are working toward implementation, putting the onus on the
union [whether to strike in protest].</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen before opening day and may not even
happen until the 2003 season, but it's really the only conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   If the suggestion is that owners and players could end up
operating without a contract in 2002, it wouldn't be a first. It last
happened in 1993, a prelude to the union's decision to strike in late
summer of 1994--what proved to be valid anticipation of a unilateral
implementation by the owners.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ultimately found the owners guilty of illegal
labor practice, throwing out the implementation and ending baseball's
longest work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Reached in Milwaukee, Selig said it is "way too premature" to
consider the possibility of a new implementation.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was any kind of a charade, I wouldn't be asking Bob DuPuy
and Andy MacPhail to get involved on an everyday basis," Selig said
of his two most recent negotiating appointments. "Their time is too
valuable. I wouldn't have asked them to participate if I didn't think
we have a chance to make a deal. We need to change the system, to get
it right this time, and we need to aggressively pursue a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Strange business.</TE>
<TE>   In the restructuring of the commissioner's office, Beeston had
been lured from his position as the Toronto Blue Jays' chief
executive in 1997 in hope that his relationship with the union would
defuse the rhetoric of the past and ultimately produce a bargaining
agreement free of rancor.</TE>
<TE>   Sources believe he and baseball lawyer Rob Manfred were quietly
homing in on that agreement last summer when Selig, under pressure
from owners to put contraction ahead of a new bargaining contract and
concerned that their conciliatory chief operating officer might fail
to extract blood from the union, canceled Beeston's participation,
making it inevitable that the compromised executive would ultimately
resign, which he did earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   DuPuy, Selig's counsel since 1989, became COO, joining Manfred and
outside counsel Howard Ganz on a negotiating team that Selig
augmented this week with MacPhail, the Chicago Cubs' president and
general manager. Selig plans to add another club executive soon,
possibly handing out programs in the process.</TE>
<TE>   It may be recalled that during the long labor dispute of 1993-95
the owners went through Richard Ravitch, Chuck O'Connor and a
negotiating group of their peers, headed by Colorado's Jerry
McMorris, before Randy Levine--at the time an aide to then-New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and now president of the New York
Yankees--came in to consummate a deal with the union.</TE>
<TE>   Mention to the commissioner that the revolving door, then and now,
seems to represent a breakdown in negotiating continuity and he
bristles, pointing out that Manfred--baseball's executive vice
president for labor--has been a point man in the talks for 12 years
and that DuPuy and MacPhail have been totally briefed.</TE>
<TE>   If Don Fehr, the union's executive director, privately wonders if
the changing faces across the table can be truly aware of the
history, can be certain of who said what and when, he has always
contended that negotiations are driven by the issues and not the
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   To this point in the current sputtering talks, it has been a short
drive.</TE>
<TE>   For the owners, there are two key proposals:</TE>
<TE>   A 50% luxury tax on all payroll above $98 million and an increase
in the sharing of local revenue from 20% to 50% after ballpark
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The union considers a 50% luxury tax tantamount to a salary cap
and has no interest even in responding.</TE>
<TE>   As for revenue sharing, there is a wide difference in distribution
concepts as well as percentage.</TE>
<TE>   In this, the union appears disingenuous by claiming its split
method of distribution would send more money to the low-revenue teams
than the owners' straight plan. In reality, the union opposes the
straight method because it drains more money from the large-revenue
clubs and affects their ability to sign the star players.</TE>
<TE>   There are other chips on the table, including the owners' quest
for major and implausible give-backs by the union in the area of
salary arbitration, but nothing is more important to the clubs than
increased revenue sharing and meaningful payroll restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Can they achieve it? Can all those clubs with huge debts on new
ballparks be held in line if it comes to an impasse and possible
shutdown?</TE>
<TE>   The owners are 0-8 in previous negotiations, having always come
out unified and smoking, only to capitulate to their individual
agendas.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Selig, whose contract was recently extended, seems to have
the tenure and clout to control any opposition, of which there is a
silent minority--no owner willing to risk a $1-million fine for
talking publicly about the labor situation or critically of Selig.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Selig's recent announcement that he will be enforcing
the 60-40 rule, under which clubs must maintain a ratio of 60% assets
to 40% liabilities or face fines, the loss of national TV payments or
other sanctions, has compounded the uneasy and disconcerting
atmosphere of the off-season, underscoring the impression that the
owners are prepared to turn the screws wherever and whenever they
can.</TE>
<TE>   The union, whose contraction grievance continues to be heard by
arbitrator Shyam Das, unsuccessfully challenged the 60-40 rule with
an arbitration grievance in 1985 but may do so again, contending that
since player contracts have been factored into Selig's redefinition
of liabilities, the rule should be bargained collectively.</TE>
<TE>   Amid it all, the familiar sniping has begun:</TE>
<TE>   * Management has spread a rumor that players are out to get Selig
and intend to boycott the July All-Star game in Selig's new Milwaukee
ballpark, an absurd bit of misinformation since the players, whose
pension plan is funded partially by All-Star proceeds, would be
hurting only their own image and retirement account.</TE>
<TE>   * In response to comments by Mike Piazza in the New York Daily
News in late February that clubs used creative accounting methods (no
news there) and were divided on the issue of increased revenue
sharing (Piazza also criticized some owners for pocketing their
revenue-sharing grants instead of using them to improve their teams),
Manfred, the clubs' lawyer, sent a memo with the Piazza comments
attached to each owner, accusing Fehr of misinforming the players
regarding the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Said Fehr, in response: "We don't have any gag rules. Players say
whatever they want and get to attend meetings. Owners apparently
can't say what they want, can't come to meetings and can't talk to
one another. It's bizarre. I mean, the notion that you would muzzle
free speech is foreign to us, but apparently not to them. The notion
that you would not want to have a lot of communication between the
union and management is foreign to us, but apparently not to them.
And the notion that owners should somehow not be permitted to talk to
other owners is--I don't even know what to make of that."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, doctor! Do I have enough Vicodin left?</TE>

<HD>Blatter to Receive Strong Challenge</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Africa's Hayatou gains support in his candidacy to
unseat the current FIFA president in May 29 election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph "Sepp" Blatter's days as president of soccer's international
governing body appeared to be numbered Saturday when Africa, Europe
and Asia lined up behind a candidate who will challenge Blatter in
the May 29 FIFA election in Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football
(CAF) and a member of the International Olympic Committee, announced
in Cairo that he would run against Blatter.</LD>
<LD>   Hayatou, 55, a FIFA vice president from Cameroon, said he would
campaign on a reform ticket.</LD>
<TE>   "Myself and my supporters want to restore peace, confidence and
security to the FIFA organization," he said. "I want to reinforce the
credibility of FIFA and restore its integrity as an institution."</TE>
<TE>   The 204-nation body has been racked by controversy during
Blatter's term in office, which began immediately before the 1998
World Cup in France. Most notably, FIFA's financial situation has
been brought into question after the collapse of its World Cup
marketing partner ISMM/ISL last year at a cost to FIFA of at least
$30 million and possibly as much as $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hayatou's candidacy was immediately supported by Sweden's Lennart
Johnasson, the president of UEFA, European soccer's governing body.
Johnasson was defeated by Blatter, 111-80, in 1998 voting amid claims
that Blatter's supporters had resorted to bribery to win the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "When I bid for the FIFA presidency four years ago, Mr. Hayatou
supported me as if he were campaigning for himself," Johansson said.
"Now I fully endorse his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked with him since we both joined the FIFA executive
committee together in 1990. He is a man of honor, very productive and
loyal to football. He knows what transparency, solidarity and loyalty
mean. I sincerely hope he wins this campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Also backing Hayatou is Chung Mong Joon, president of the South
Korean soccer federation and a powerful figure in Asian soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure I have the support of a large majority of the African
[soccer] associations," said Hayatou, chairman of the organizing
committee for the soccer tournament of the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney, where Cameroon won the gold medal. "I am not a European, but
I have the support of UEFA.... If I didn't believe I had their
support, I would not have put myself forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to bring the transparency back to FIFA, not only in the
financial management, but in the management of men as well."</TE>
<TE>   Blatter's support at the moment comes only from CONCACAF and South
America. If Hayatou can unseat Blatter at the FIFA Congress in Seoul
in May, he would become the first African president in the 98-year
history of FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter has promised Africa it will stage the 2010 World Cup.</TE>

<LD>NBC golf commentator Roger Maltbie, discussing Tiger Woods with Jerry
Greene of the Orlando Sentinel: "Twenty years ago I would have said
you are out of your mind if you ever said a golfer could be the
greatest athlete in the world--but Tiger is the greatest....</LD>
<LD>   "Tiger doesn't play at his top every week. But the truth is that
when Tiger plays at his best, the game is over. Nobody on earth can
play with him. So what happens when one of these other guys plays at
his best--and still gets his butt handed to him?"</LD>
<LD>   He didn't answer his own question, but you get the drift.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NCAA men's championship game record for
free throws made?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not the first time: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "The
actions of Ruben Rivera, who was released by the Yankees after being
charged with stealing Derek Jeter's glove, were reprehensible but not
unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   "In his autobiography, former pitcher Eldon Auker tells how Babe
Ruth beat Leo Durocher to a pulp after setting a trap for him that
proved Durocher had stolen money and a watch while they shared a
hotel room. Durocher recovered and so did his baseball career."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's their game: Gary Shelton in the St. Petersburg Times: "More
than any other sport, and more than any time, college basketball is
ruled by the men with the scowl on their faces. It's their
personalities that define programs, their standards that define
success.</TE>
<TE>   "The players are important, of course, the way queens and rooks
are important to chess masters. But it is the coaches who turn
successful teams into programs, and programs into self-perpetuating
fiefdoms."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why not all of them? PGA Tour player Frank Lickliter on his
solution for speeding up the game in an interview with Bob Verdi in
Golf Digest magazine: "Rocco [Mediate] and I would like to see one
PGA tournament a year in which you have 4 hours 15 minutes for 18
holes. If you don't finish in that time, you're gone. No warnings, no
fines. Have it be sponsored by a watch company. 'The Better Be Ready
Open.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clever: Headline in the Chicago Sun-Times on a story about Texas
Tech's surprising season in Bob Knight's first year as coach: "The
surgin' general."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1995, UCLA beat Florida
International, 92-56, in an NCAA West Regional first-round game in
Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins won five more games, climaxed by an 89-78 victory over
Arkansas for the national championship in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gail Goodrich of UCLA, 18 (of 20) against Michigan
in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune on Mark Prior, the
former USC star pitcher, now a rookie with the Chicago Cubs: "[He]
doesn't need to go to West Tenn or any other minor-league stop. He's
ready to win at Wrigley Field, and might as well be there April 5
when the Cubs will be introduced along the third-base line before the
opener against Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "Said one veteran scout who has watched Prior's development since
he was at Southern Cal: 'The Cubs don't have five starters better
than him. They might not have two.'"</TE>

<HD>Quarter Doesn't Go Very Far</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After a strong start, Clippers go flat and
lose game and ground to SuperSonics, 95-87. Richardson bruises thigh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers got it all wrong Saturday against the Seattle
SuperSonics.</LD>
<LD>   After playing a strong first quarter, they missed shot after shot,
failed to adequately defend and were outhustled to too many loose
balls during the first of what promise to be many more pivotal games
down the stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake, however, the significant games will end soon
enough if the Clippers don't seize the day better than they did
during a 95-87 loss to the SuperSonics before a sellout crowd of
19,425 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   And there was more bad news.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson suffered a bruised left thigh in the second
quarter and did not play again. His status for Monday's game against
the Houston Rockets was uncertain. Forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar
Odom and guard Keyon Dooling are already sidelined because of
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton led Seattle with 23 points, helping to end the
SuperSonics' three-game losing streak. Jeff McInnis scored 30 points
to lead the Clippers, who were outscored, 12-2, in the final 4:45 of
the first half and failed to hold the lead again.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to match their intensity and we came out flat," McInnis
said. "I'm disappointed we didn't respond better. If you can't get up
for a game like this then you're in the wrong profession."</TE>
<TE>   With an opportunity to move within a game of a playoff spot, the
Clippers sputtered and stalled against the SuperSonics. The
ninth-place Clippers dropped two games behind the eighth-place Utah
Jazz and three games in back of the seventh-place SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Saturday's loss won't ruin the Clippers' playoff
chances. But a victory over Seattle would certainly have brightened
the possibilities with 15 games remaining in what has already been
the team's finest regular season in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we're closer to a playoff spot than we were a
week and a half ago," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "Don't get me wrong.
It's still a tough, tough loss."</TE>
<TE>   After a week or so of gauging their progress only by checking the
standings, the Clippers finally got an up-close and personal look at
one of the teams they have been chasing for a Western Conference
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have almost reeled in the SuperSonics (and the Jazz)
on the strength of seven victories in their last 10 games, and it
didn't hurt that the SuperSonics had lost three in a row going into
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   This was the sort of late-season matchup that had been missing
from the Clipper schedule since 1996-97, the last time they qualified
for the playoffs. In recent seasons, March and April had been
agonizing times for the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday's game was the sort the team has been desperate to
play.</TE>
<TE>   That it happened one night after a six-point loss to the Lakers
probably look away some of the luster. After all, one Clipper-Laker
game is probably worth twice the fan interest and media attention in
the Southland than a dozen, more meaningful Clipper-SuperSonic games.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Lakers, it was kind of tough to get up for Seattle,"
said Elton Brand, who scored only eight points to go with 14
rebounds, ending his streak of consecutive double-doubles at 11
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably got up for the wrong game."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, on the strength of 64% shooting in the first
quarter, controlled the play at the outset. They had a 25-16 lead
after Michael Olowokandi made a jump shot late in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics would rally, increasing their intensity and
fighting for loose balls and rebounds in the second quarter. By
halftime, Seattle had built a 45-41 lead and suddenly turned to a
suffocating pressure defense that kept the Clippers motionless on the
perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers went cold in the second quarter and finished the half
with 16-for-43 shooting (37.2%). By game's end, they made only 33 of
86 (38.4%). Among the misfiring Clippers were Darius Miles, who was
two for 11 and Brand (two for nine).</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't deserve to win this game," Gentry said. "We had
a good first quarter. But they outplayed us in every phase of the
game. That's what's really disappointing. We don't have time to feel
sorry for ourselves, though. We have to forget about this.... To me,
we can't get too high on wins or too low on losses. We can't get
down."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day after, the Clippers kept talking about Friday's loss to
the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   "That was the wildest game I've ever been in," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "One team went on a huge run, then the other."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry just as easily could have been speaking of the scuffle near
game's end between Clipper center Michael Olowokandi and Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal. Both players received their second technical fouls
of the game and were ejected with 19 seconds to play.</LD>
<TE>   "Any time we play them, we want to play our best," Gentry said.
"Any time they play us, they want to show they're superior."</TE>
<TE>   So it wasn't surprising to Gentry that Olowokandi and O'Neal
almost came to blows late in the Lakers' victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotions run high," Gentry said. "Michael's not the type of guy
who is going to back down.... There are a whole lot of blows
delivered on offense when you play them. In a competitive game, guys
are going to compete. I don't want to see fights, but Michael is a
man too. You also have to understand how Michael works."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry wasn't the least bit concerned that the Clippers had
expended too much energy and emotion Friday against the Lakers and
would have nothing left Saturday for the Seattle SuperSonics. He
wanted no part of questions about a possible Clipper-Laker
first-round playoff matchup, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you play the Lakers it's going to be an emotional game,"
he said. "Now we've got to channel those emotions in Seattle's
direction."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were without Keyon Dooling, Corey Maggette and Lamar
Odom because of injuries. The SuperSonics were without Vin Baker,
Calvin Booth, Rashard Lewis, Vladimir Radmanovic and Earl Watson.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the Injury Bowl right here," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tremaine Fowlkes, who has replaced Maggette, who had replaced Odom
as the Clippers' starting small forward, was named to the National
Basketball Development League all-star team. Fowlkes was a member of
the Columbus (Ga.) Riverdragons before the Clippers signed him to a
10-day contract Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Tremaine, he brings a lot of what Corey gave us,"
Gentry said. "He's a good defender. He's a good competitor. Plus, he
allows us to bring Darius [Miles] in off the bench. That's important
too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's team bus got a flat tire and the players didn't arrive
at Staples Center until 6 p.m.</TE>

<DL>IRWINDALE</DL>
<LD>Oak Hill's Tony Green benefited from a final-lap crash to take the
100-lap Jani-King Super Late Model Series feature race to open the
season at Irwindale Speedway on Saturday night in front of 5,424
fans.</LD>
<LD>   Green, who was in third place, took the lead when the first two
cars, driven by Sean Woodside and Brandon Loverock, collided going
into Turn 3.</LD>
<LD>   Brent Reynolds and Rod Johnson finished second and third,
respectively.</LD>
<TE>   On the checkered flag, Loverock, who fell to 14th, pulled
alongside Woodside and traded words with him. Woodside responded by
turning his car into the back of Loverock's.</TE>
<TE>   Each driver got out of his car to fight, but they were separated
by track officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the Vista Paint Super Stock feature, Darren Cheek recovered
from a spinout on Lap 6 to win the 40-lap race, holding off Andrew
Phipps and Julianne Seeley for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Mike May won the 40-lap American Race Truck Series race.</TE>
<TE>   Bret Carlson of Quartz Hill was held overnight for observation at
Arcadia Methodist Hospital after crashing head first into a wall near
the entrance lane off Turn 2.</TE>

<HD>Kings Acquire Ronning and Beat Penguins, 4-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings got some offensive help Saturday, and not only from the
four players who scored in a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins
in front of a sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Cliff Ronning, the Nashville Predators' leading scorer in each of
their four seasons, was acquired in a trade for seldom-used
defenseman Jere Karalahti and a conditional draft pick.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings hope the addition of Ronning, 36, will shore up a need
they've been trying to address since they traded forwards Glen Murray
and Jozef Stumpel to the Boston Bruins in October to acquire center
Jason Allison.</LD>
<TE>   Allison is their leading scorer, but the Kings have not been able
to find a consistent point-producing second line.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning will be integrated into the Kings' top six forwards when
he skates with the team for the first time at this morning's practice
in El Segundo and will make his King debut Monday night against the
San Jose Sharks at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "Rat," the 5-foot-8, 165-pound Ronning played in all 67
games for the Predators this season and led the team with 18 goals
and 31 assists, numbers that would make him the Kings' third-leading
scorer.</TE>
<TE>   In 15 NHL seasons with the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks,
Phoenix Coyotes and Predators, he has 792 points, including 279
goals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very competitive player," King General Manager Dave Taylor
said. "He's been very consistent, creating offense with all the teams
that he's been with, particularly in Nashville the last few seasons,
and we think he can help us to generate more offense, which we feel
is one of our needs going down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said he has long coveted Ronning, who helped the Canucks
reach the Stanley Cup finals in 1994, but that the veteran was never
available.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the price was right for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators, looking to add size and toughness, dumped a player
in the final year of a contract that pays him $1.85 million this
season, with a club option for the same amount for next season, and
picked up a defenseman 10 years younger, plus a third- or
fourth-round pick in the 2003 draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, meanwhile, added offensive punch without depleting
their core.</TE>
<TE>   The trade, however, might be a hard sell in Nashville. The
Predators gave up their all-time scoring leader for a player who in
1997 spent eight months in drug rehab for heroin use.</TE>
<TE>   Karalahti, who will turn 27 on March 25, had played in only nine
games since November, the odd man out in the Kings' glut of quality
defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   "We like that aspect of it because our team has played very well,
probably since the first of December," said Taylor, whose team is
25-8-5-2 since Dec. 8, having accumulated all but 22 of its 79 points
over the last 15 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Andy Murray: "It's adding a player to our lineup for a
player that wasn't playing, so that in itself has to be a positive
addition."</TE>
<TE>   Not so positive was the Kings' effort against the Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   After Mikko Eloranta gave the Kings the lead for good when he
scored 13 seconds into the game, and Mathieu Schneider, Nelson
Emerson and Jaroslav Bednar added goals to extend the lead to 4-0
with 3:19 to play in the second period, the Kings nearly gave it all
back.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Robitaille made the score 4-1 midway through the third
period, then Michal Rozsival and Kris Beech scored goals 27 seconds
apart, trimming the Kings' advantage to 4-3 with 5:05 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings held on, completing a 3-0 home stand.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I don't think we were deserving of a 4-0 lead,"
Murray said. "I was not real pleased with the way our team played. We
had some players who had some very good games for us, but we had too
many players who I think relied on their skill and did not show the
right level of respect for our opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "And when you don't respect an opponent in this league, you get
kicked in the teeth, and we almost got kicked in the teeth."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings turned their heads just in time. The victory moved them
into sole possession of fifth place in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   And a proven scorer is on his way to help them down the stretch.</TE>

<LD>Jeff Burton made it two for two in the Busch series, leading every
lap Saturday to win the Darlington 200 stock car race at Darlington,
S.C.</LD>
<LD>   It was a repeat of his performance in the Busch race at Las Vegas
two weeks ago, when he started from the pole and led every lap to win
that event. Those are the only Busch races in which the Winston Cup
regular has competed this season.</LD>
<LD>   His only challenge came late in the race at Darlington Raceway
when Randy LaJoie hit the wall with 18 laps remaining to bring out a
caution.</LD>
<TE>   Burton then held off a challenge from Greg Biffle, his teammate at
Roush Racing. The two-lap duel was his only challenge in the race,
and Burton said it was because the Fords are so similar.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked really hard together this winter, and [they have] as
much to do with our success as our own team," Burton said. "We
combine the two teams in a great way."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Green was third and Jason Keller took over the points lead
with a fourth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always run terrible here, and the key was to take care of
the tires and wait until 10 [laps] to go and go after the leader,"
Biffle said. "The guys put me in position on the pit stop and got me
out second. The guys did a great job in the pits."</TE>

<TE>   Helio Castroneves gave team owner Roger Penske his first Indy
Racing League pole, taking the top spot for today's Copper World 200
at Phoenix International Raceway. Castroneves' fast lap was 179.888
mph. Defending IRL champion Sam Hornish Jr. was second at 179.735.</TE>

<TE>   Gary Densham beat John Force to earn the top qualifying spot for
today's Mac Tools Gatornationals at Gainesville, Fla. Larry Dixon in
top fuel, Ron Krisher in pro stock and Matt Hines in pro stock
motorcycle also took top spots in qualifying.</TE>

<HD>Anschutz Considers NFL Site</HD>
<DH>Football: Billionaire looking into the possibility of
building downtown stadium for transplanted team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Anschutz, the billionaire who built Staples Center and last
month broke ground on a $120-million sports complex in Carson, is
investigating the possibility of constructing a privately financed
football stadium in downtown Los Angeles, The Times has learned.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz, the majority owner of the Kings and four Major League
Soccer teams including the Galaxy, has never before indicated an
interest in pro football. But if the numbers look right and he
decides to build a stadium, it would be with the understanding the
NFL was coming back to L.A. for the first time since the Raiders and
Rams left in 1995, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz has already formed a powerful coalition to study the new
stadium effort. It includes Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Staples Center, and Casey Wasserman, the
grandson of movie mogul Lou Wasserman and owner of arena football's
L.A. Avengers. Also involved are billionaire financier Ron Burkle and
real-estate magnate Ed Roski, both of whom were part of failed
attempts to land an expansion franchise for L.A. in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking on behalf of the group, Wasserman confirmed a stadium
proposal is in the works but declined to elaborate on the details.</TE>
<TE>   The site the Anschutz group is discussing is unclear, although the
entire complex--complete with parking lots--would require about 55
acres.</TE>
<TE>   With 32 teams broken into eight four-team divisions for the
upcoming season, the NFL has no plans to expand in the foreseeable
future. Therefore, any team that L.A. gets will be an existing
franchise that relocates.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman and Leiweke recently met with Los Angeles Mayor James
Hahn to inform him about the stadium proposal and discuss the
prospects of the NFL's return to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn attended this year's Super Bowl in New Orleans as a guest of
the league and met with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue a few hours
before kickoff. Hahn said he believes L.A. will have an NFL team
within five years. Others, such as Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones,
think a move could come sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't give it a time frame," Jones said. "But I think there's
some significant interest in moving a team to L.A. in more than one
circle."</TE>
<TE>   Among the teams that could relocate to L.A. are San Diego,
Indianapolis, New Orleans or Buffalo, although the list is in almost
constant rotation as leases expire or loopholes spring open.</TE>
<TE>   Jones says he expects no movement this season but that interested
teams will be assembling at the starting line in a year, after San
Diego plays host to the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "That will put a lot of focus on the issue, by having the Super
Bowl on the West Coast that close to Los Angeles," he said. "It will
serve as a reminder, an instigator of, 'Let's go to work.'"</TE>
<TE>   The subject of pro football in L.A. is not on the docket at the
league meetings, which begin today in Orlando, Fla., and will be
attended by owners, general managers and coaches. However, getting
the NFL back to the nation's No. 2 television market remains a hot
topic with the league.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working on Los Angeles," said Joe Browne, one of the NFL's
senior vice presidents. "We like to think we'll leave no stone
unturned when it comes to L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Browne dismissed the notion football fans in Los Angeles have
grown increasingly apathetic about having a hometown team.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue in Los Angeles is not the passion of the fans," he
said. "The issue is where the team is going to play. The market is
not the No. 1 challenge; the stadium is the No. 1 challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Although Anschutz lives in Denver, he has proved he has the
ability to navigate L.A. politics and get major projects done. He is
the founder of Qwest Communications and has built a sports and
entertainment empire that includes ownership of the Kings,
part-ownership of the Lakers, and five European hockey clubs. Forbes
Magazine estimates his net worth at $9.6 billion, putting him 16th on
the 2001 list of richest Americans and 54th on the 2002 list of
world's richest people.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz has been a major force in reshaping downtown. In
September, the City Council approved his plans for a 27-acre
development near Staples Center--a $1-billion, 4-million-square-foot
project built around one large hotel and theater.</TE>
<TE>   AEG, a collection of 32 companies, manages Staples Center, the
Forum, the Kodak Theater--which is the new home to the Academy
Awards--and L.A. Live, the 7,000-seat theater to be built across from
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is only 27, Wasserman has already assembled an
impressive portfolio of accomplishments. As chairman of the Arena
Football League's television and properties committee, he helped
broker a network TV deal with NBC, which next spring will begin
broadcasting arena football games each Sunday. NFL owners will decide
Tuesday whether to exercise their option to acquire 49.9% of the AFL.
League sources say the owners probably will exercise that option.</TE>
<TE>   Browne said L.A. has always been on Tagliabue's radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   "The commissioner is being very aggressive on it," he said. "He
has been aggressive on that front, going back to the late 1990s when
the 32nd franchise went to Houston."</TE>
<TE>   "[Anschutz] is clearly a committed sportsman," said John Moag,
chairman of Moag &amp; Co., a Baltimore-based sports investment banking
firm. "He's not the least bit timid about putting resources into
things he believes in. That being the case, he clearly is an ideal
candidate to step forward at the appropriate time to lead an NFL
effort in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Three years have passed since L.A. lost its chance to get an NFL
expansion team. Houston billionaire Bob McNair bought the team with a
bid of $700 million. To house his Houston Texans--who kick off their
inaugural season in the fall--he spent more than $400 million on the
NFL's first retractable-roof stadium, complete with high-definition
TV sets on the concourses--another NFL first--the league's biggest
weight room and even an indoor swimming pool. L.A.'s best offer came
from Michael Ovitz and Burkle, who were ready to pay the NFL $400
million, agreeing to add an additional $150 million from revenue
earned on a new stadium three years after the team began to play.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue pulled hard behind the scenes for L.A. and had advised
Ovitz that his ownership group could gain approval for a Hollywood
Park stadium with a bid approaching $500 million, in anticipation of
McNair offering $600 million. But McNair shocked everyone by
presenting the owners with a $700-million offer they could not
refuse.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the Rose Bowl probably would serve as a
temporary home for a relocated franchise. Last month, Rose Bowl
officials got the go-ahead from Pasadena to court prospective NFL
tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is to try to get an NFL team here as a permanent
tenant," Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn said. "Why not the
Rose Bowl? We know there are issues here to be addressed. We've
thought those out."</TE>
<TE>   The 80-year-old landmark, which has been host to five Super Bowls,
would require extensive renovations to compete with modern, more
intimate NFL stadiums. And even getting to that point would require
clearing seemingly endless environmental, neighborhood and historic
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's contract with the Rose Bowl is up after next season, and,
with a new athletic director coming when Peter Dalis steps down this
summer, a venue change could be in the offing. Bruin alumni,
particularly those who live near the school, and students have long
complained about the cross-basin drive for Saturday games.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Rose Bowl, the Coliseum would be seriously affected by a
new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be taking a bite out of our business with Carson, and a
downtown stadium would be an additional bite," said Pat Lynch,
general manager of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego could also feel the bite if the Chargers move. The team
already is considering relocating its training camp from La Jolla to
Anschutz's facility in Carson when the complex is completed in summer
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sports issues have dominated San Diego politics for nearly five
years. Disputes over a proposed downtown ballpark for the Padres and
a lease arrangement with the Chargers that obligates the city to pay
the team for unsold tickets were the top issues in the mayoral
election in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple lawsuits have delayed construction of the Padres'
ballpark for two years; only after the last of the lawsuits was
rejected by a judge did construction resume this month. The Charger
ticket guarantee, which has cost taxpayers $25.3 million since 1997,
is a constant source of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   At San Diego City Hall, officials expressed confidence that the
city's lease with the Chargers, which runs through 2020, will provide
sufficient warning if the Chargers try to move.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Bruce Herring, the city's point man on issues
involving Qualcomm Stadium, said that under the lease the Chargers
can only "shop" for a new city if they exceed certain salary
restrictions imposed by the NFL. Even if the Chargers receive an
offer, San Diego retains the right to keep the team if it chooses to
match or exceed that offer.</TE>
<TE>   The Indianapolis Colts, whose lease runs through 2014, have
multiple escape clauses in their deal with the RCA Dome if their
total operating revenue dips below the league average. Beginning
after the 2004 season, the Colts have the right to look around if
they are below average in revenues and the city chooses not to make
up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffalo Bills have the option to terminate their lease in June
2004, but that would require paying a $20-million termination fee.
That fee gets progressively smaller each year until it reaches $2
million in 2012. But NFL insiders say Buffalo is not in danger of
losing the Bills as long as 82-year-old owner Ralph Wilson--for whom
the team's stadium is named--has say in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Benson, owner of the New Orleans Saints, has been pushing for
a new stadium to replace the Superdome, and, at times, has threatened
to sell the team. Complicating matters now is that New Orleans is
trying to get the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. Some question whether a
city with the No. 43 TV market can support two pro franchises.</TE>

<LD>The drawing power of Mexico's national team and its top clubs in the
United States continues to impress.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, a Mexico-Yugoslavia game in Phoenix drew 43,000. Last
Wednesday, a Mexico-Albania game in San Diego drew 31,902. The night
before, a turnaway crowd packed Titan Stadium at Cal State Fullerton
to see Cruz Azul play the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, another throng is expected at the Coliseum when Chivas
of Guadalajara takes on UNAM Pumas of Mexico City at 7:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier that day, the Galaxy will hold its annual kickoff luncheon
at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, a noon
event sponsored by the Los Angeles Sports Council and the L.A. Area
Chamber of Commerce and open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the crowds that Mexican players are attracting, it may
seem odd to those at the Biltmore that there is no Mexican player on
the Galaxy roster.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Coach Sigi Schmid still has some salary-cap room and at
least one foreign roster spot open, so things might change.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, why should they?</TE>
<TE>   There are no French, German, Italian, English, Iranian, Brazilian,
Spanish or Argentine players on the Galaxy, either, and yet the Major
League Soccer team survives.</TE>
<TE>   How many Mexican players do the Lakers have? The Kings? The bottom
line: Having a player with a Mexican passport hasn't added to the
gate in the past, and it's unlikely to do so in the future. It's not
the nationality of the players but the quality of their play that
brings the crowds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Testing Time</TE>
<TE>   This week offers a couple of interesting tests locally. Will
Chivas bring such stars as Oswaldo Sanchez, Ramon Morales, Ramon
Ramirez, Gustavo Naples and Joel "El Tiburon" Sanchez to the Coliseum
on Tuesday?</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, will Pumas, coached by Hugo Sanchez, play Jorge Campos,
Christian Ramirez, Gerardo Galindo, Miguel Espana and Emerson Dos
Santos?</TE>
<TE>   All too often, visiting Mexican teams and local promoters promise
more than they deliver. If the fans show up but the stars do not, it
will be one more reason to ignore such events.</TE>
<TE>   The game has an interesting sidelight. The Coliseum has been given
permission by U.S. Soccer to stage this game even though the Coliseum
Commission has a lawsuit in progress against U.S. Soccer, alleging
what amounts to restraint of trade.</TE>
<TE>   In the second test, at 7 p.m. Saturday, the Galaxy opens its
seventh MLS season against longtime rival D.C. United at the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing Tuesday's Coliseum crowd to Saturday's MLS crowd, both
in numbers and ethnic makeup, should provide Doug Hamilton, the
Galaxy's general manager, with a few clues about where to spend his
marketing dollars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Blather</TE>
<TE>   Also coming to town this week is Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the
beleaguered president of FIFA, world soccer's governing body.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, Blatter will be here to address a weeklong sports
medicine symposium at the Beverly Hills Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   It's more than likely, however, that Blatter--or Blather as he is
known by opponents--will spend some time huddled with Alan
Rothenberg, trying to figure out a way to retain his presidency when
he comes up for reelection in May.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg has a lower profile these days but still wields
considerable power within U.S. Soccer and, more to the point,
CONCACAF.</TE>
<TE>   If CONCACAF intends to support Blatter in his reelection bid, the
very least the U.S. should get out of it is the FIFA Confederations
Cup in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Also vying to be host of that event are Australia, Egypt, Italy
and South Africa, and France and Switzerland in a joint bid.</TE>

Shannon MacMillan, who leads the attack when the San Diego Spirit

<TE>   With international players MacMillan, Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett,
China's Fan Yunjie and Nigeria's Mercy Akide on the Spirit, and with
the CyberRays featuring Tisha Venturini, Brazil's Sissi and Katia,

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Once again, the point is the point.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA battered Mississippi in the first round of the NCAA
tournament in large part because freshman point guards Cedric Bozeman
and Ryan Walcott forced Jason Harrison, their Rebel counterpart, to
shoot from beyond his range.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison took nine shots--all from beyond the three-point arc--and
missed every one.</LD>
<TE>   But Bozeman and Walcott had little time to puff their chests.
Today's second round brings Cincinnati, the top-seeded team in the
West Regional.</TE>
<TE>   And Cincinnati brings Steve Logan, a former shoeshine boy from
Cleveland who is five inches taller than the 5-foot-5 Harrison and
infinitely more polished.</TE>
<TE>   The senior point guard scored 27 points in the Bearcats'
first-round blowout of Boston University, personally outscoring the
Terriers, 23-16, in the first half. He averages 22.1 points, 5.3
assists and about a dozen oohs and aahs from fans per game.</TE>
<TE>   No-nonsense Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins normally is not given to
hyperbole. But when it comes to Logan, he gushes.</TE>
<TE>   "Lo's intelligent enough to know when he's on a roll and when he's
not," he said. "That's the great thing about Lo. He can score and he
can distribute the ball. He's happy as long as we win."</TE>
<TE>   Logan heads a mature lineup of three seniors and two juniors that
has made this perhaps the most enjoyable of Huggins' 13 seasons with
the Bearcats. Unranked before the season, Cincinnati (31-3) set a
school record for victories, lost only to Louisville, Marquette and
Oklahoma State, and earned a No.1 seeding.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach doesn't have to get after us to work hard because we are
experienced enough to know what he expects," Logan said. "He doesn't
have to scream and yell and do the things he did in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The victory over Boston was No.500 in Huggins' 21-year career,
which began with stints at Walsh College and Akron. By now he is
regarded as one of the nation's best coaches, leading the Bearcats to
at least 25 victories in seven consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He knows what he's doing, and in Logan he has a player who is an
extension of himself on the court.</TE>
<TE>   When Boston's point guard twirled his finger in the air to signal
an offensive set, Logan twirled his too. When a Boston player tugged
at his shorts, Logan tugged at his own, signaling to his teammates to
defend a specific set.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew every play that they were calling," junior Leonard Stokes
said after the 90-52 rout. "We just watched film and studied it. We
were able take them out of stuff defensively.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy on the team asked me, 'How y'all know every play we're
running?' I just told him it was a secret, and we started laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Expect no chuckles from UCLA. The Bruins (20-11) are trying to win
their second game in a weekend for the first time since early
January. They know that matching Cincinnati's trademark intensity
will be crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Logan is the second-best guard in country, neck and neck
with Jason Williams [of Duke]," Bruin guard Rico Hines said. "He's
the best guard we've faced all year. Stopping him is like cutting the
head off an animal. Take him out of the game and let the rest of the
team try to beat you."</TE>
<TE>   Hines, a fifth-year senior and UCLA's best perimeter defender,
might get his chance. He asked Coach Steve Lavin at practice Saturday
for an opportunity to cover Logan, figuring the inexperienced Bozeman
and Walcott will have their hands full.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to chase him around and play with him, do anything to get
in his head," Hines said.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin said UCLA will employ its 1-2-2 matchup zone defense,
meaning that several players will be responsible for slowing Logan.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible, of course, that the Bearcat star could slow
himself. He made four of nine three-point shots against Boston, but
in the seven games leading up to the tournament made less than 24%.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, other players will have an impact. Bearcat guard
Field Williams made five three-point shots against Boston, the same
number UCLA guard Billy Knight made against Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Bearcat forwards Immanuel McElroy and Jamaal Davis are solid
contributors and center Donald Little averages 7.1 points and 6.7
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   At 6-11, Little is big, and he is aware of his large assignment
today. He and UCLA center Dan Gadzuric were roommates on an all-star
team that traveled Europe in 1997 and both attended private high
schools in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   But Little must also be ready to contend with sophomore center
T.J. Cummings. Lavin plans to use the five-man substitution strategy
that worked so well against Mississippi, inserting Walcott, Cummings,
Hines and freshmen Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson to press and
score in transition.</TE>
<TE>   If that group plays well again and starters Gadzuric, Jason Kapono
and Matt Barnes can merely hike their production to near their season
averages, it might not matter how well Logan plays.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA could be headed for San Jose and its fifth Sweet 16
appearance in six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough assignment, but I'm getting a different feeling than
in the last several weeks, a better feeling," Hines said. "I just
hope we don't go back to being Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."</TE>

<HD>This Close Call Goes to Continental Red</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After two tough losses, 6-year-old wins San
Luis Rey Handicap by a nose at Santa Anita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After losing in photo finishes in his two previous appearances in
graded stakes at Santa Anita, Continental Red deserved to have his
picture taken after Saturday's $250,000 San Luis Rey Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   A nose loser to Irish Prize in the San Marcos on Jan. 21 and a
neck behind Nazirali in the San Luis Obispo nearly four weeks later,
the 6-year-old gelding and 5-2 second choice prevailed in a blanket
finish with three longshots.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Ian Jory for owner-breeders Wes and Sharon Fitzpatrick
and ridden by Pat Valenzuela, the son of Flying Continental beat
Keemoon, the lone female in the Grade II and an 11-1 shot, by a nose.
Speedy Pick, the longest shot in the field at 58-1 who set the pace,
was a head back in third. Ringaskiddy, a 15-1 outsider, was fourth,
another neck behind.</LD>
<TE>   This was only the second win since the beginning of 2001 for
Continental Red, but the California-bred had been earning a nice
living. Besides the runner-up efforts in the San Marcos and San Luis
Obispo, he had been second or third six times last year.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jory: "I guess the San Juan Capistrano [at about 13/4 miles
on April 21, Santa Anita's closing day] is the logical next spot. I
don't think distance is a problem for him."</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment of the San Luis Rey was Denon. The even-money
favorite, he had no visible excuses as he checked in fifth under
jockey Chris McCarron. All three of his victories, including his win
in the Hollywood Derby last Nov. 25, have come on heavy or yielding
grass courses and he has never won beyond 11/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beaten by three lengths by Wrangler in last month's General George
Handicap at Laurel, Affirmed Success turned the tables in a big way
Saturday at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   An 8-year-old gelding trained by Richard Schosberg for
owner-breeder Albert Fried, Affirmed Success, the 2-1 second choice,
captured the $108,200 Toboggan Handicap by two lengths over 9-1 shot
Vodka.</TE>
<TE>   Wrangler, the 4-5 favorite looking for his fourth win in a row,
struggled home fourth in the field of six.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Richard Migliore, Affirmed Success ran the seven
furlongs in 1:22 4/5 in winning for the 14th time in 35 starts. He
has now banked close to $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ask Me No Secrets, the 9-5 second choice, led all the way under
jockey Mike Smith to win the $200,000 Oaklawn Breeders' Cup by 41/2
lengths at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Earl Shultz and trained by David Hofmans, the 4-year-old
Seattle Slew filly completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44 2/5 for her
third win in five starts. It was her first graded stakes win as she
had been third in the La Canada Stakes on Feb. 9 at Santa Anita
behind Summer Colony and recent Santa Margarita winner Azeri.</TE>
<TE>   Although Denon flopped in the San Luis Rey, trainer Bobby Frankel
did collect a stakes win when favored No Slip, under jockey Kent
Desormeaux, won the $155,000 Golden Gate Breeders' Cup Handicap at
Golden Gate Fields.</TE>

<HD>Stirred Frye Lifts Arizona</HD>
<DH>West: Freshman, criticized by teammates for being soft,
gets 18 points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots in 68-60 victory over
Wyoming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>It has been so long since Arizona wasn't supposed to be here, you
almost forget.</LD>
<LD>   "We were supposed to maybe go to the NIT," Jason Gardner said. "To
make it to the tournament, to the Sweet 16 ... there's no better
feeling than this."</LD>
<LD>   This was supposed to be Jason and the Freshmen.</LD>
<TE>   The team that played Duke for the NCAA title last season left en
masse for the NBA. Arizona was an unranked team. Luke Walton was a
fellow with a nice passing touch who couldn't shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Now Walton is one of the top 20 players in the nation and Arizona
is moving on after a 68-60 second-round victory Saturday over the
Wyoming team that upset Gonzaga in the first round at the NCAA West
Regional at the Pit.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (24-9) will play the winner of today's Oklahoma-Xavier
game on Thursday at the NCAA West Regional in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman of honor this time was Channing Frye, the slender
6-foot-10 center Coach Lute Olson says could someday be one of the
best big men to play at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The knock is that he is soft--a "ham sandwich," fellow freshman
Salim Stoudamire nicknamed him.</TE>
<TE>   But against Wyoming and its shot-blocking post men, Frye grew up.</TE>
<TE>   He scored 18 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked five shots.</TE>
<TE>   When Wyoming (22-9) tried to wedge its way back into a game
Arizona had led by 10, Frye helped close the door.</TE>
<TE>   Walton missed a three-point shot with a three-point lead with six
minutes left and the anti-Lute crowd roaring, but Frye put it back
for a five-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Later, with less than a minute left, the lead was four. Gardner
missed a free throw, and it looked as if Wyoming's opening had
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   But Frye, in the middle of the Cowboys' battling rebounders,
tipped the ball out to Rick Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed it when we went to the line," Anderson said. "See if
you can tip it my way, or Luke's. That was a big-time tip. Without
that, it would have been tough."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Walton went to the line with 43.6 seconds left and sank
both free throws for a six-point lead, and Gardner added two with 30
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Walton was once again the player who made many of the biggest
plays, making two leaning jump shots in the lane to stretch the lead
to five and then to seven with 3:49 left.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we'd cut it to four, or to three, he'd make a basket,"
Wyoming Coach Steve McClain said. "That's what makes him stand out,
and what should make him stand out."</TE>
<TE>   Walton led Arizona with 21 points and nine rebounds but had only
two assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Both times, I got into the lane and they stayed back and played
the passes," Walton said. "In the game on Thursday, I was still
trying to pass, so the coaches told me if they're not going to come
up and attack me, then take the shot. I just happened to make them
both."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner scored 14 points, driving to the basket to get fouled in a
game when he was only one for seven from three-point range and
Arizona made only four.</TE>
<TE>   Frye stepped up to battle Wyoming's Uche Nsonwu-Amadi and
ferocious post player Josh Davis. Davis scored 17 points, as did
forward Marcus Bailey, and Nsonwu-Amadi added 10.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, Coach always tells me, 'Stop being a ham sandwich in
practice,' and I really take that to heart," Frye said. "I feel like
for me to be productive on this team, I need to be aggressive on the
boards, and I need to be a defensive presence. I felt like I had to
do that for my team to win tonight."</TE>
<TE>   That's what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "Channing can be as good a big man as we've ever had through the
time that I've been at Arizona," Olson said. "The big thing with him
is to stay focused on what needs to be done. Sometimes you can see he
loses some of that aggression, and when he does that, he's not half
the player he is when he's affecting the shooter. He had five blocked
shots, but he affected a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Frye is something of a whipping boy in practice, but it's because
Olson sees so much potential.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was saying, 'You've got to play a 6-10, 260 guy,'" said
Frye, who weighs 222. "I just had to step up. I feel like when it
counts, every freshman is going to step up."</TE>

<HD>It's Nearly El Duke-Out in Fort Myers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orlando Hernandez and Rickey Henderson seemed to forget it was only
spring training.</LD>
<LD>   Henderson hit a leadoff home run for the Boston Red Sox in their
8-7 loss to the New York Yankees Saturday in a split-squad game at
Fort Myers, Fla. Henderson took a slow, wide shuffle out of the
batter's box, apparently angering the pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   After Henderson flied out to end the second inning, the pair
exchanged words as they passed while heading to their dugouts.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez then left the New York dugout, headed toward Henderson
near home plate and had to be restrained by Yankee Manager Joe Torre.
Henderson said that Hernandez, known as "El Duque," cursed at him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a big home-run hitter, but when I hit them, I enjoy
them," said Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old Henderson, who holds the career record for homers
leading off a game, said that if Hernandez doesn't like the way he
plays, "we'll go play in the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably when he was crawling around on his knees, I was playing
baseball, unless he's as old as I am--he probably is," Henderson
said. "Maybe he needs to grow up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Pedro Martinez gave up homers to Juan Rivera, Robin
Ventura and Shane Spencer, allowing six runs and six hits in four
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said his right shoulder, which caused him to miss much of
last season, felt fine.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams missed the game because of a
hamstring injury that is not considered serious. The team also said
reliever Ramiro Mendoza probably won't be ready to pitch by opening
day because of upper back and neck stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hudson's $6-million option for 2005 was exercised by the
Oakland Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson, who is to make $850,000 this year, $2.7 million next
season and $4.55 million in 2004, went 18-9 with a 3.37 earned-run
average last year and has a 49-17 career record with a 3.61 ERA. He
has won at least 10 games in each of his three seasons, the first A's
pitcher to do so in nine years.</TE>

<TE>   In Scottsdale, Ariz., San Francisco Giant first baseman J.T. Snow
left an exhibition game against the Milwaukee Brewers in the first
inning after being hit by a pitch on the right elbow by starter
Glendon Rusch.</TE>
<TE>   Snow had an elastic bandage wrapped around the elbow and thought
he would miss several days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rob Bell, who started 18 games and went 5-5 with a 7.18 ERA for
Texas last season, was optioned by the Rangers to triple-A
Oklahoma.... Mark Sweeney, an infielder-outfielder who hit .258 in 48
games for Milwaukee last year and is a .260 career hitter in seven
seasons, signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres....
Robert Person, 0-1 with a 19.13 ERA in four spring starts, was picked
to be the Philadelphia Phillies' opening-day starter.... Another
Phillie starting pitcher, former Dodger Terry Adams, retired the
first 12 Tampa Bay batters he faced, extending his scoreless-inning
streak to eight, then allowed four fifth-inning runs at Clearwater,
Fla.</TE>

<HD>Sanders Seeking Four on the Floor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Darius Sanders had already been a part of three Southern California
Regional champion teams, so the prospect of a fourth trip to
Sacramento wasn't what was pushing the Compton Centennial High
forward Saturday at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Compton Dominguez transfer was driven by the fact that it was
his senior year and he had finally become the go-to guy instead of
just another complementary player alongside Tyson Chandler.
Centennial was Sanders' team, and he made sure everybody knew it down
the stretch of the second-seeded Apaches' 56-47 victory over
top-seeded Torrance Bishop Montgomery in the Division III final.</LD>
<LD>   Sanders scored eight of his 15 points in the third quarter and put
Centennial ahead to stay with a dunk midway through the fourth as the
Apaches advanced to the state title game for the first time.
Centennial (31-1) will play San Francisco Riordan (30-4), a 67-61
winner over San Francisco Sacred Heart Cathedral in the Northern
California Regional final, at 2:45 p.m. Saturday at Arco Arena in
Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   The Apaches snapped a five-game losing streak against Bishop
Montgomery (26-7) in the playoffs over the last three years and ended
the Knights' bid for a third consecutive state title. Bishop
Montgomery defeated Centennial, 57-55, in the Southern Section
championship game two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, the Oregon-bound player who could be part of a record
fourth state champion if Centennial wins next week, called Saturday's
regional title the most important of his career. "I'm the focal point
of this team," he said. "It's my responsibility to lead."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders' dunk with 4:30 left gave Centennial, which had trailed by
as many as 10 points in the second quarter, a 41-40 edge. A Saul
Lankster dunk on a fast break and two Arron Afflalo free throws
expanded the advantage to 45-40 before Bishop Montgomery's Gavin Lee
converted a three-point play to make it a two-point game.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial's Sterling Byrd responded with a three-point play after
catching an entry pass under the basket to give the Apaches a 48-43
lead. The Knights never threatened again as the Apaches converted
eight of 11 free throws in the last 58 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Afflalo, a sophomore guard who watched his potentially game-tying
layup roll out of the rim late in Centennial's loss to Bishop
Montgomery in the Division III-A section final, scored a game-high
18.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Peace scored 14 points and Fred Washington had 12 for the
Knights, who made 35.4% of their shots from the field and were
outrebounded, 32-18.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Price 73, Reedley Immanuel 61--The top-seeded Knights,
with four players averaging double figures in scoring this season,
hit their mark in the Division V regional final at Long Beach City
College.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Peace and Darren Morrison each scored 17 points and Derrick
Williams and Kalief Washington had 10 apiece, each converting five of
nine shots from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Price (30-6) can join Compton Dominguez as the only team to win
three consecutive state titles with a victory Saturday against San
Francisco University in Sacramento. Immanuel (28-5), the Central
Section champion, stayed with Price until the third quarter, when the
Knights took a 47-39 lead.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>There's No Saving Ishii in Wild Outing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, citing Paul Lo Duca's take-charge
ability behind the plate, likened his catcher last week to "a
goalkeeper." Lo Duca did not have many save opportunities Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Just about every pitch Ishii threw was whacked before it could
reach Lo Duca's mitt, as a New York Yankee team featuring one
regular--second baseman Alfonso Soriano--ripped Ishii for six runs
and six hits in the first inning of a 10-8 exhibition victory over
the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii, who was so keyed up he threw two warm-up pitches over Lo
Duca and to the backstop, narrowly missing a photographer with one,
gave up consecutive home runs to Bobby Estalella, Marcus Thames and
Scott Seabol.</LD>
<TE>   Pitching in the Dodgers' first televised Grapefruit League game,
the Japanese left-hander also walked two and gave up three singles.
Often behind in the count and up in the zone, he threw 40 pitches, 20
for strikes, before being pulled with two outs in the first.</TE>
<TE>   "More than disappointment for the fans, I'm disappointed I was
showing my worst," Ishii said through an interpreter. "But I will be
ready to go in my next start.... With a few adjustments, I should be
OK."</TE>
<TE>   Like Kevin Brown on Friday night, Ishii had problems with the soft
Holman Stadium mound. "He was fine in the bullpen, then he gets to
the mound and throws two to the backstop," pitching coach Jim Colborn
said. "Pitchers are having trouble with their plant foot. We're
tending to it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers may need to tend to Ishii's nerves, too.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot of nervous energy," Lo Duca said. "He pitches on
adrenaline and is still getting used to everything. It's going to
take a little time. He's a polished pitcher, he's been doing this a
long time. He's not a kid. He won't get rattled.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone can fathom what he's going through. He was
an icon [in Japan], and there's double pressure on him to perform
here. It was like Chan Ho Park in Korea. He was like Elvis there, and
it was tough for him here too."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy found one benefit to Ishii's performance: "Now
we get an opportunity to see how the guy rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown spent so much time talking with reliever Matt Herges in the
clubhouse Saturday that Herges thought he might not make it to the
stadium in time for the game. It was a worthwhile chat, though.</TE>
<TE>   Herges, who gave up seven earned runs in 41/3 innings of his first
five games, threw two scoreless innings, giving up one hit and
striking out one. He worked ahead in the count, and his pitches had
good life.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me my job today was to throw strike one, get ahead, have
a plan and execute it," Herges said of Brown. "Worry about one pitch
each time. He said I didn't have anything to prove to anyone in this
clubhouse.... That was pretty awesome. That's a team leader right
there."</TE>
<TE>   Herges admitted his mind was too cluttered with thoughts of being
the Dodger closer, of his failed contract negotiations and of a cut
fastball he was experimenting with but eventually canned.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesse [Orosco] told me to just shut everything out and do what
I've done the last few years," Herges said. "This was definitely a
positive step.... I felt more locked in mentally."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four Dodger pitchers combined for 18 strikeouts Saturday,
including four each by Robert Ellis and Orosco. Lo Duca hit a
three-run home run in the fifth inning, and Jeff Reboulet also
homered for the Dodgers.... Brown, who is recovering from elbow
surgery, came out of Friday's start with no health issues, and Tracy
said the staff ace will pitch Tuesday against Houston.... Shawn Green
is hitting .100 (two for 20) in seven spring games.</TE>

<HD>Williams Gets Duke Home Free</HD>
<DH>South: All-American guard finds the mark just in time to
secure 84-77 win and ruin Notre Dame's upset bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENVILLE, S.C.</DL>
<LD>Jason Williams has been a liability at times on the free-throw line,
but the All-American guard didn't blink under NCAA tournament
pressure Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, only five for 18 from the field, made four consecutive
free throws down the stretch as top-seeded and defending national
champion Duke rallied for an 84-77 second-round victory over Notre
Dame in the South Regional.</LD>
<LD>   "I would rather have people who shoot free throws than people who
don't want the ball," said Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who improved to
58-14 in the NCAA tournament. "Jason has wanted the ball his whole
career at Duke."</LD>
<TE>   Williams is a 67% free-throw shooter, and one of his lowlights
came in Duke's first loss of the season, against Florida State on
Jan. 6. In that game, Williams missed six consecutive free throws in
the final five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he noticed some Irish fans doing the "tomahawk chop"
chant with the game on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since we lost to Florida State a lot of opposing fans are
doing that," Williams said. "If anything, it helps me focus even more
because it makes me remember when I missed six in a row. It helps me
buckle down."</TE>
<TE>   He made the go-ahead free throws with 1:04 left as the Blue Devils
(31-3) advanced to the round of 16 for the fifth year in a row and
18th time overall.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Ewing, a freshman who is the likely replacement for
Williams when he turns pro after this season, had a career-high 18
points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-seeded Notre Dame (22-11) got 20 points each from David
Graves and Matt Carroll, but the Irish folded down the stretch. Their
coach, former Duke assistant Mike Brey, couldn't pull off the
program's 10th victory over a No. 1-ranked team.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame led, 71-64, with about six minutes left, but was
outscored, 20-6, the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "When they were down seven and their life was flashing before
their eyes, [Duke] really locked in on defense," Brey said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the second half, Duke was one for seven from the
foul line, but made 11 of 12 free throws over the final 1:47.</TE>
<TE>   Two free throws by Chris Duhon tied it at 71-71 with 4:28 left,
and the score was tied twice more, the last time at 75 with one
minute remaining.</TE>

<HD>Havelid Makes Most of Rare Playing Time</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Niclas Havelid was dusted off and taken down
from the shelf Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   With Vitaly Vishnevski serving a two-game suspension for elbowing,
Havelid was forced into the lineup for only the second time in 19
games. His play, though, looked anything but rusty.</LD>
<LD>   Havelid was teamed with veteran Keith Carney and played 22 minutes
23 seconds in a 1-1 tie with the Chicago Blackhawks. Only Oleg
Tverdovsky played more among Duck defensemen.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought he was really good," Coach Bryan Murray said. "Keith
Carney has made a lot of people look pretty good. But Nick had good
legs and passed the puck well. His physical involvement was big
time."</TE>
<TE>   Havelid has struggled since suffering a knee injury a year ago. A
finesse defenseman, the injury robbed him of his strengths, and only
recently has he felt 100%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My knees almost look the same size now," Havelid said. "That's a
good thing."</TE>
<TE>   The injury, plus the acquisitions of Carney and Jason York, pushed
Havelid down the depth chart. He has spent most of the season as the
seventh defenseman, the odd-man out.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in the year, we didn't like everything we saw because his
mobility wasn't what it had been," Murray said. "It was nice to see
him in that kind of game shape and get in and play [Friday].
Sometimes it takes this kind of a break, a guy gets suspended or
injured, to get your turn."</TE>
<TE>   Havelid, who has one goal and three points in 38 games, was
preparing himself for the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "It is tough when you haven't played for a while," Havelid said.
"We have seven defensemen and only six play. All you can do is work.
You work, you get your chances."</TE>

<LD>   Maryland vs. Wisconsin: The top-seeded Terrapins are playing in
the friendly confines of the MCI Center, an arena where they've
played at least two games each of the past five seasons. They seemed
to recover nicely from their Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
loss to North Carolina State. Siena--a rare team to qualify for the
NCAA tournament with a losing record--provided little resistance in
the first round. Wisconsin might not be such an easy matter, but the
Badgers probably don't have the firepower on offense to stay in the
game with Maryland. Terrapin guard Juan Dixon--recently named ACC
player of the year, upsetting Duke's Jason Williams--is on the verge
of breaking the school's career scoring record, still held by the
late Len Bias. Wisconsin Coach Bo Ryan won his first NCAA Division I
tournament game Friday in his first attempt. As a Division III coach
at Wisconsin Platteville, he won four national titles. Wisconsin
isn't quite as offensively challenged as the Badger team that scored
only 41 points in a Final Four semifinal loss two years ago. Guard
Kirk Penney, a New Zealander who played in the Sydney Olympics and
played a smaller role on the Badgers' 2000 Final Four team, has been
Wisconsin's top scoring threat.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Connecticut vs. North Carolina State: Connecticut had to sweat a
little to hold off 15th-seeded Hampton, a team that left Coach Jim
Calhoun impressed. (The Huskies scored the final seven points to make
the 11-point victory look easier than it was.) Caron Butler is
Connecticut's leading scorer, but freshman center Emeka Okafor is a
force as a rebounder and shot blocker. N.C. State had to sweat a lot
against Michigan State, coming back from 12 points behind at halftime
to stop the Spartans short of the Final Four for the first time in
four years. Anthony Grundy is N.C. State's star, but with Grundy in
foul trouble Friday, freshmen Ilian Evtimov and Julius Hodge carried
the load. The season marks a resurgence for the program in a season
that probably would have been Coach Herb Sendek's last if N.C. State
hadn't rallied the way it did. An upset of Maryland in the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament semifinals was an extra measure of
success, but the NCAA victory meant more. "Last year this time, if
someone had told me we would be here celebrating an NCAA win over a
program like Michigan State, I wouldn't have thought it was
possible," Grundy said.</TE>

<TE>   Southern Illinois vs. Georgia: Southern Illinois enters the game
as the so-called "mid-major," but the Salukis played like one of the
big boys in their near-flawless first-round victory over Texas Tech.
Southern Illinois Coach Bruce Weber trumped all of Bob Knight's chess
moves with suffocating defense and intensity. Weber gets another
chance to beat another national championship coach when he matches
wits with Georgia's Jim Harrick. The Bulldogs had to rally from a
first-half deficit late Friday night to beat Murray State. Georgia
had too many great players to go out in the first round and got a
career-high 31-point performance from Jarvis Hayes. The key for the
Bulldogs, though, is the play of sophomore point guard Rashad Wright,
who had 16 points and 10 assists against Murray State.</TE>

<HD>Harlan's Holiday Proves Timing Is Everything</HD>
<DH>Florida Derby: Ohio-bred colt takes advantage of blistering
early pace to rally for 31/2-length victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>That supposed clock in jockey Jorge Chavez's head may have been
cuckoo, subjecting Booklet to a suicidal pace and a fourth-place
finish, but Harlan's Holiday was the best horse anyway in the
$1-million Florida Derby before 30,204.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of a 11/8-mile trip Saturday at Gulfstream Park,
Harlan's Holiday was 31/2 lengths better than runner-up Blue Burner
and 15 lengths better than Booklet as the Ohio-bred colt picked the
perfect time to atone for two narrow losses to Booklet earlier this
winter. Let's hear it for Ohio. Harlan's Holiday has become one of
the favorites for the Kentucky Derby, a race that has been won by
only one horse from that state--Wintergreen in 1909. Another
Ohio-bred, U S S Tinosa, will try to run himself into Derby
contention in today's San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Laurie Wolf of Atlanta, who races Harlan's Holiday with her
husband Jack, recalled the comment in the Daily Racing Form the day
Harlan's Holiday ran his first race, against maidens at Churchill
Downs last June. "It said, Ohio-bred, question mark," she said. "It
said, 'What are they thinking?'"</LD>
<TE>   Some railbirds were wondering what Chavez was thinking when he
allowed Booklet to run with an open engine along with another
speedball, Smooth Jazz, from the gate to the far turn. With Smooth
Jazz and Mark Guidry pushing Booklet and Chavez to the brink, the
first quarter-mile was reeled off in :222/5 and the half-mile flew by
in :451/5. Only two horses ever ran as fast for an opening Florida
Derby quarter, and the first four furlongs have never been run
quicker.</TE>
<TE>   Smooth Jazz was part of a Todd Pletcher-trained entry with Nokoma,
who didn't benefit from his stablemate's tactics and finished
seventh. Walking off the track after the race, Chavez decried
Guidry's tactics, but John Ward Jr., the trainer of Booklet, wasn't
bothered. "This is racing," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, winner of last year's Florida and Kentucky Derbys with
Monarchos, wasn't as generous.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unclassy to do that," he said. "I had no choice when the
other guy kept riding and riding and riding his horse. It's hard to
win a race, or ride a race, when someone else [Guidry] is riding your
horse on purpose. [Guidry] should have ridden his horse, not mine."</TE>
<TE>   Guidry said that he was just following the pre-race plan, trying
to make the lead with Smooth Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday is trained by Ken McPeek, the 39-year-old son of
a Kentucky breeder. McPeek has had only two Kentucky Derby starters,
the best of whom, Tejano Run, finished second to Thunder Gulch in
1995. Now McPeek could field two of the favorites at Churchill Downs
on May 4. His other top colt, Repent, won the Louisiana Derby last
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday finished second in that debut at Churchill, and
since then he has piled up five wins and three seconds in eight
tries.</TE>
<TE>   "From his first race, he showed a lot of heart," McPeek said of
the $97,000 yearling purchase. "It was good he was an Ohio-bred,
because we were able to run him in those races for state-breds, and
he developed a winning attitude early on. It's difficult to separate
my two horses. Harlan's Holiday might have the advantage because he's
got a tactical running style."</TE>
<TE>   That style Saturday was worth $600,000 to the Wolfs. Harlan's
Holiday, ridden by Edgar Prado for the first time as McPeek sacked
Tony D'Amico in favor of a more experienced big-race rider, paid
$5.40 as the favorite and covered the distance in 1:484/5, fastest
running of the stake since 1996. The rest of the field was stretched
out. Blue Burner, running for George Steinbrenner, finished 63/4
lengths ahead of Peekskill, and after that came Booklet (who had a
breathing problem in the race caused by a displaced palate), Monthir,
D'Coach, Nokoma, High Star, Puck, Smooth Jazz and Personal Reward.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday was fourth after a half-mile, 71/2 lengths from
Booklet, but Prado was not going to fry his horse.</TE>
<TE>   At the three-eighths pole, Harlan's Holiday unleashed his winning
move from the outside. Prado's four or five taps with the whip
through the stretch weren't even necessary.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek, who will keep his Derby contenders separated, will
probably run them once each in April, with the Illinois Derby at
Sportsman's Park, the Blue Grass at Keeneland and the Wood Memorial
at Aqueduct on the radar. Late Saturday at Gulfstream, the
accomplishments of his colts finally hit him between the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody pinch me," he said. "It's hard to believe I'm in this
position."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Ethan Man beat four horses to win the $150,000 Swale
Stakes. Trainer Patrick Byrne will run the colt one more time before
considering the Kentucky Derby.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By Ofa Tulikihihifo's admission, she played poorly in the first half
of Redondo Union's Southern California Regional Division II girls'
basketball final Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   At halftime, she was read the Riot Act by Coach Marcello Enriquez.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so frustrated, yelling at my teammates and myself,"
Tulikihihifo said. "[Enriquez] asked if this is the way I wanted to
go out, pouting and giving up."</LD>
<TE>   Tulikihihifo responded by scoring the first two baskets of the
second half, sparking a 12-2 run and leading Redondo to its first
state championship game with a 53-39 victory over Fullerton Troy at
Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Tulikihihifo, a 5-foot-9 senior, had all 14 of her points and
eight of her 13 rebounds in the second half as the Sea Hawks
stretched a 17-14 halftime lead to 29-15. By the time Troy used
defensive pressure to score a few fourth-quarter transition baskets,
Redondo had built a 36-21 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Troy (29-4) pulled within was 45-38 with 1:24
remaining as senior Alicia Komaki, who missed her first 10 shots,
scored all of her 16 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Hawks (26-7) play Stockton St. Mary's, a 66-54 winner over
Los Altos Hills Pinewood in the Northern Regional final, for the
state title at 6 p.m. Friday in Sacramento. Redondo defeated
Pinewood, 51-41, on Dec. 19, when Tulikihihifo was recovering from
torn ligaments in her right knee. Krista Areyan scored 12 points and
Jennifer Owens eight for Redondo.</TE>

<TE>   Playa del Rey St. Bernard 56, La Jolla The Bishop's
46--Georgia-bound senior guard Alexis Kendricks scored 13 of her
game-high 24 points in the second half and St. Bernard beat the
defending state champion in the Division IV regional final at Long
Beach City College.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings (23-7) will face Kentfield Marin Catholic--a 60-47
winner over Santa Rosa Ursuline in the Northern Regional final--in
the state championship game at 2 p.m. Friday at Sacramento's Arco
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings got there by knocking off the team that eliminated
them in the regional semifinals last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year when they dissed us, we said we weren't going to let it
happen again, so we returned the favor," said St. Bernard center
Shannon Clay, who had 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bernard took control of the game in the second half, turning a
27-21 halftime edge into a 13-point advantage by scoring the first
seven points of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Bishop's (27-4), which graduated four seniors from last
season's title team and had only one on this squad, trailed by as
many as 16 points in the second half.</TE>

<TE>   La Jolla Country Day 63, Los Angeles Pilgrim 37--Guards Brittany

But the Patriots fell behind early and never recovered.</TE>

<HD>Woods Still Leads, but 74 Lets Others Back in the Chase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods was everywhere he didn't want to be Saturday in the Bay
Hill Invitational, making four bogeys in a round of 74 that brought
just about everybody back into the tournament at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   On a steamy, sun-baked afternoon that felt like the middle of
summer, Woods squandered his four-stroke advantage by the time he
made the turn, then hung on down the stretch for a one-stroke lead
over Len Mattiace.</LD>
<LD>   It figured to be a runaway. It turned into a free-for-all.</LD>
<TE>   As far as Woods was concerned, "It could have been a lot worse."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, trying to win for the third consecutive time at Bay Hill,
was at 10-under-par 206. His PGA Tour record with at least a share of
the 54-hole lead is 21-2.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge could come from anyone--14 players were within three
shots of the lead, while 20 players were within five strokes.</TE>
<TE>   It starts with Mattiace, the Nissan Open winner and the only
player without a bogey on a rock-hard, cotton-mouth day at Bay Hill.
He holed a 40-foot putt for par on No. 17 and finished with a 68.</TE>
<TE>   Scott McCarron, who started the day four back, caught Woods at the
turn and stayed with him until he bogeyed two of the last three
holes. He had a 72 and was at 208, along with volatile Pat Perez
(69), John Huston (70) and two Campbells--Michael and Chad, who shot
68s.</TE>
<TE>   Right behind at 209 is some real star power.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly, tied for the lead after a birdie on No. 13, kept the
damage to a minimum and finished with a 71. Phil Mickelson and Vijay
Singh each had a 69, Sergio Garcia a 70 and Ernie Els finished strong
for a 72, which included a par save after going into the water on No.
16 and a birdie on the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Woods played the final seven holes with one birdie and the rest
pars, but the rest of the afternoon was a real adventure. That image
of Woods posing over well-struck shots turned into one of him holding
his arm out to the left to warn the gallery of an incoming ball.</TE>
<TE>   He three-putted from 30 feet on No. 7. He hit under the trees left
of the ninth fairway, and his punch shot under the limbs just caught
the thick rough, slowing its roll to the green. Another bogey. He
went left again on No. 10 and failed to get up and down from a bunker
for his fourth bogey of the round, and suddenly he was tied for the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit a lot of poor shots," Woods said. "But I hung in there and
scraped out a round that could have been pretty ugly."</TE>
<TE>   As Woods' lead kept shrinking, more players joined the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There's 15 other guys with a chance to win," Mattiace said.
"Anyone on this leaderboard can shoot a good round. It's who's going
to have the best day tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam zeroed in on her third win in as many
tournaments, shooting a four-under 68 to take a four-stroke lead into
the final round of the Ping Banner Health.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam has led or shared the lead in Phoenix six consecutive
rounds, starting with the second round last year in which she shot
the first 59 in women's tournament history.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't get sole possession of the lead this year until her
masterful play on a third blustery day pushed her 54-hole total to
11-under 205. She was 23 under at the same point in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cristie Kerr (70) and Australia's Rachel Teske (71) were tied for
second at 210. Kerr had two eagles in the round.</TE>
<TE>   In 34 previous tournaments in which Sorenstam held the third-round
lead, the Swedish star has gone on to win 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable in this position," said Sorenstam, who has won
four of her last five tournaments and two in a row this year--the
Australian Ladies Masters and LPGA Tour's season-opening Takefuji
Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I've been in it many times, and I love being the
leader. So I think I'm just getting more used to it and more
comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Sigel shot a one-over 73 in cold and windy conditions to take
a one-stroke lead after the second round of the Siebel Classic in
Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel, the two-time U.S. Amateur champion who won the last of his
six Senior PGA Tour titles in 1998, had a 3-under 141 total on the
Coyote Creek course at San Jose. He returned to the tour last June
after a seven-month layoff following operations on both shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   George Archer shot a 74 to join Ed Dougherty (72), Bob Gilder (75)
and Dana Quigley (75) at 142.</TE>
<TE>   With the wind gusting to 35 mph and temperatures in the low 50s,
no players broke par, the first time that has happened on the senior
tour since 1997.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Scares Up a Victory</HD>
<DH>South: Two days after toppling USC, North Carolina
Wilmington makes Hoosiers nervous before losing, 76-67.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Maybe USC shouldn't feel so bad after all.</LD>
<LD>   North Carolina Wilmington, that plucky 13th-seeded team that
pulled off the biggest upset of the NCAA tournament's first round
with its victory over the Trojans on Thursday, threw a scare at
another higher-seeded opponent Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   A 17-point second-half deficit was too much for the Seahawks to
overcome, though, and they fell to fifth-seeded Indiana, 76-67, in a
South Regional second-round game before 16,144 at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The Hoosiers (22-11) earned a Sweet 16 date with top-ranked Duke
in Lexington, Ky., on Thursday, while the Seahawks (23-10) earned
some prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like we lost the game; I feel like they beat us,"
Seahawk Coach Jerry Wainwright said. "But I'd also like to say we
belonged in the game. I don't think we're a fluke. What happened the
other night can happen, and that's no disrespect to USC."</TE>
<TE>   Against USC, North Carolina Wilmington held a 19-point second-half
lead and had to hold off the fourth-seeded Trojans in overtime to
pull off a 93-89 upset.</TE>
<TE>   Against the more deliberate, half-court-oriented Hoosiers, the
Seahawks never led but were within 31-25 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana took off again in the second half, going up, 49-32, with
12:41 to play. But the Seahawks wouldn't give up. They began to press
the Hoosiers into turnovers and started to make their three-pointers,
going on a spirited 31-17 run to close within 66-63 with 2:45
remaining after two Brett Blizzard free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Blizzard had a game-high 29 points for the Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers were led by forward Jared Jeffries' 22 points.</TE>

<DH>Midwest: After getting a scare from Holy Cross, Jayhawks
score first 15 points and roll to 86-63 victory over Cardinal.</DH>

<AU>ANDREW BAGNATO</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Kansas might not be the best basketball team in the nation, but it
could be the hardest to figure out.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after the Jayhawks flirted with becoming the first
top-seeded team to lose an NCAA tournament opener, they turned in
their most impressive performance of the season. Blitzing
eighth-seeded Stanford with a 15-0 opening salvo, Kansas annihilated
the Cardinal, 86-63, in a Midwest Regional second-round game in front
of 31,484 in the Edward Jones Dome Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "For all the doubters out there, that question mark on our team is
slowly disappearing," said Drew Gooden, Kansas' All-American forward.
"We have life left in us."</LD>
<TE>   The pregame story line--would Kansas star Kirk Hinrich be able to
play after severely spraining his left ankle in the first round?--was
rendered immaterial in a barrage of Kansas points. Hinrich did not
start, but he came off the bench and provided inspiration, along with
15 points, eight assists and five rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Hinrich also had a team-high eight "floor burns," a cherished
Jayhawk stat.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Jordan-like," Gooden said.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas has advanced to the Sweet 16 for the second consecutive
season. It will face the Illinois-Creighton winner Friday night at
Madison, Wis. A year ago, the top-seeded Illini eliminated the
fourth-seeded Jayhawks in the same round.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the NCAA tournament, Kansas is the ultimate
cipher. Who'd have thought the Jayhawks would have an easier time
with Stanford than they did with Holy Cross?</TE>
<TE>   It will give the Illini something to think about next week, not
that they'll be overlooking pesky Creighton today at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's romp extended Kansas' pattern of NCAA
unpredictability. A year ago, the Jayhawks thought they were flying
after drubbing Syracuse by 29 points in the second round. Five days
later, Illinois bounced them out of the tournament by 16.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas Coach Roy Williams spent as much time on the off day
between rounds working on his players' psyches as he did preparing
them for the Cardinal. The Jayhawks' uncomfortably close 70-59
victory over Holy Cross gave rise to speculation Kansas was primed
for another one of its patented March pratfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he told his players as they prepared to meet Stanford,
Williams replied, "The first thing I'm trying to tell them is, 'Quit
reading the paper; there's nothing wrong with you guys.'"</TE>
<TE>   Stanford will attest to that.</TE>
<TE>   Hinrich, who wore a brace on his left ankle, entered the game with
13:05 to go in the first half. Two minutes later, he took an outlet
pass and sailed downcourt, pulling up to swish a 10-foot jumper.</TE>
<TE>   On the next possession, he knocked down a three-pointer from the
left wing to give Kansas a 28-11 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how to explain Kirk Hinrich," Williams said.</TE>

<HD>Kent State No Flash in the Pan</HD>
<DH>South: No. 10 seed extends win streak to 20 with 71-58 rout
as No. 2 Alabama is highest seed to be eliminated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENVILLE, S.C.</DL>
<LD>Stan Heath is Kent State's basketball coach, not a fortune teller.</LD>
<LD>   But if his hunch about the team is right, the Mid-American
Conference champions aren't anywhere near finished with their
surprising run in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The 10th-seeded Golden Flashes ousted second-seeded Alabama,
71-58, Saturday in the second round of the South Regional, extending
the nation's longest winning streak to 20.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in uncharted waters right now," Heath said. "But I like to
read eyes in the locker room, and I wasn't looking at a bunch of guys
who were saying: 'Hey, our season is over. We've accomplished what we
want to accomplish.'</TE>
<TE>   "I saw some eyes of players that said we're doing some special
things. That's the attitude of my players, and I'm certainly not
satisfied right now as a coach."</TE>
<TE>   Kent State (29-5) advanced to a regional semifinal for the first
time. The Golden Flashes beat seventh-seeded Oklahoma State in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not here by fluke," Alabama Coach Mark Gottfried said.
"[Oklahoma State's] Eddie Sutton would agree with me, and probably a
whole lot of other coaches too."</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Huffman scored 20 points, and Antonio Gates had 18 to pace
the Golden Flashes, who built a 12-point halftime lead before pulling
away in the first 10 minutes of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (27-8), the Southeastern Conference regular-season
champion, became the highest-seeded school to exit the tournament.
The Crimson Tide also struggled in a first-round victory over Florida
Atlantic and shot only 38% in Saturday's loss.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Grizzard led Alabama with 17 points, but most came after Kent
State had built a comfortable lead. SEC player of the year Erwin
Dudley had 12 points and 10 rebounds, but freshman star Mo Williams
was limited to 12 points after scoring a career-high 33 in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   Kent State was 4-4 at one point this season, but has won 25 of its
last 26 games--the lone setback being a one-point loss at Buffalo on
Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Flashes are the first MAC team to advance to the final
16 since Wally Szczerbiak led Miami of Ohio in 1999. Last year, Kent
State upset Indiana in the first round, but was routed by Cincinnati
in the second.</TE>

<HD>Prince Has Day Fit for a King</HD>
<DH>East: Kentucky senior makes six three-pointers and scores
career-high 41 points to lead fourth-seeded Wildcats past Tulsa,
87-82.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A career-high 41 points didn't satisfy Tayshaun Prince, who broke out
of his shooting slump with authority.</LD>
<LD>   While perusing the statistic sheet following Kentucky's 87-82
victory over Tulsa in the second round of the East Regional on
Saturday, Prince noted that he didn't have a turnover in 37 minutes
but had only nine rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   "I should have had one more rebound," he said. "Should have had
the double-double."</LD>
<TE>   Kentucky's lone senior starter made 14 of 21 field-goal attempts,
including six of eight from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to the point where I was just shaking my head," Tulsa
guard Greg Harrington said. "We tried to find a way to stop him, but
nothing worked."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky, seeded fourth in the regional, never stopped giving
Prince the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the bench was yelling, 'Get the ball to Tayshaun!'" Kentucky
Coach Tubby Smith said. "It was spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   The rail-thin Prince, 6 feet 9 and 215 pounds, never ran out of
gas until after the game, when he showed up at the news conference
eating a cookie.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really hungry," said Prince, who went to Compton Dominguez
High. "I needed to get a bite of something."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky (22-9) fought off several runs by Tulsa (27-7). Both
teams were on target on three-pointers: Kentucky was 10 for 19 to
compensate for shooting 44% overall; Tulsa was nine for 20.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats led, 81-72, with 4:49 to go, but the Golden Hurricane
cut the gap to two points on a three-pointer by Harrington with 57
seconds left. The lead was three after Antonio Reed's layup 47
seconds later, but Prince clinched it with two free throws with 8.5
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "If we would have gotten a lead, momentum would have switched,"
Tulsa center Charlie Davis said. "Every time we hit a big shot, they
answered."</TE>
<TE>   Prince, Kentucky's leading scorer with a 16-point average, topped
his previous career best of 31 points. He made seven of his first
eight shots and had nine rebounds, three blocked shots and four
assists.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit a three that was ridiculously long," Tulsa Coach John
Phillips said. "If you make one from 25 feet, it's your night."</TE>
<TE>   Prince ended his slump after shooting 35% in the previous seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I got some to fall," Prince said. "Guys knew I had it going on,
so they tried to get it to me as much as possible."</TE>

<HD>Murray's Focus Is Firmly on 93 Points</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings are within striking distance of the first-place San Jose
Sharks in the Pacific Division. Home-ice advantage in the playoffs is
within their grasp.</LD>
<LD>   But all Coach Andy Murray is focused on is 93 points.</LD>
<LD>   Since mid-November, when the Kings were struggling to stay out of
the Western Conference cellar, Murray told his players that if they
garnered 93 points they would make the playoffs and their early
troubles would be forgotten.</LD>
<TE>   After Saturday's 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins, they've
got 79, meaning they need seven victories in their last 14 games of
the season, well off the pace they've maintained in going 25-8-5-2
since Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to make sure we're in the playoffs," Murray said. "I
know where we were at the end of November, and if somebody had told
me at that time, 'We'll give you the eighth spot,' we probably would
have taken it....</TE>
<TE>   "Once we get to 93, then I'll think beyond that. Get to 93, then
we'll talk about other things. But until we get to 93, I don't want
our players saying, 'We want home-ice advantage'--to even talk that
way.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we get to 93, we've got nothing to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His disappointing season notwithstanding, second-year King
defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, an all-rookie selection last season,
has drawn interest from teams hoping to make a deal before Tuesday's
trade deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of teams have inquired about him because he's been in and
out of the lineup a little bit," Murray said. "There are teams that
like him, and they should like him because he's a good player. But
he's not going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jaroslav Bednar will give up No. 7 to newly acquired Cliff
Ronning and will switch to No. 27.... Steve Heinze, who has gone 20
games without a goal, was benched for the second time in five
games.... The L.A. chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Assn.
nominated Kelly Buchberger for the Masterton Trophy, presented
annually to the NHL player who "best exemplifies the qualities of
perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey."</TE>

<HD>George's Price Keeps Going Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their desire to sign Kobe Bryant to a three-year contract
extension--and his apparent reticence--won't be the only summer
business for the Lakers, who could have as many as seven free agents
from a roster already pressing the luxury-tax ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   While there might have been no avoiding the player options of
Samaki Walker and Lindsey Hunter, nor the short contracts of Mitch
Richmond, Jelani McCoy, Slava Medvedenko and Brian Shaw, it was the
Lakers who chose to get out early on Devean George, a preseason
decision that could cost them plenty.</LD>
<LD>   In October, General Manager Mitch Kupchak declined the
fourth-year, $1.5-million option on George's standard rookie
contract, the same decision that set guard Ty Lue free after last
season.</LD>
<TE>   Five months later, as the Lakers embark on a critical stretch of
games against upper-tier Western Conference foes, beginning with
tonight's game against the Dallas Mavericks, George is an NBA player
in body and mind for the first time. Though his game can be erratic,
he could become one of the more popular unrestricted free agents in a
soft class.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak's choice could have cost the Lakers millions. It also
could have saved George's career. In Coach Phil Jackson's rotation
for the first time, he's averaging 7.3 points and 3.7 rebounds in
21.5 minutes, and is a strong, athletic defender who often plays
ahead of veteran Rick Fox in fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps none of it happens had he been assured of another NBA
season, another easy paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way of telling what would have happened had we picked
up [the option]," Kupchak said. "There may be some kind of a tie-in
to us not picking it up. You know, 'Hey, it's real now. This is
serious. Wake up.' ... It may have no connection to that, either. It
may be just the process young players go through. Looking back on
things, we're comfortable with the decision and the bottom line is,
for whatever the reason, he's really come on and played well. And
that helps us today."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of theories. Fox has had a subpar season, which
led to more minutes for George. Bryant has played few minutes at
small forward, which again meant more minutes for George. Also, the
ultra-competitive Bryant has spent hours pushing the once-timid
George to develop his game and his approach. And, George, from
Division III Augsburg College, simply needed additional time to grow.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged and said he merely needed playing time but did not
dispute the impact of the Laker decision, and his impending free
agency. "I was very disappointed," he said. "They basically said, 'We
don't have any plans for you.' So, now I'm out there trying to be
seen."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Lakers know what they have, they'll be bidding, too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rare when we lose a player that we want to keep," Kupchak
said. "We feel we'll be in a great position to re-sign him. We like
our young players who will be free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intentions are to sign Slava and Devean George."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 21 consecutive home games against the
Mavericks, dating to an overtime game at the Forum on Dec. 12,
1990.... Don Nelson's handy hack-a-Shaq scouting report: Shaquille
O'Neal made four of 16 free-throw attempts through three quarters
Thursday at Golden State and 10 of 12 in the final quarter. Then he
made one of four in the first half Friday against the Clippers, five
of seven after halftime.</TE>

<HD>Lynwood Defeats Cold-Shooting Narbonne, 52-33</HD>
<DH>Girls' basketball: Knights shut down Gauchos, who make only
eight of 48 shots, in Division I regional final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's a credit to Lynwood that a game so hyped could be so dull,
that two teams so good could look as if they were in a junior varsity
time warp, that the game of the year could be so decidedly one-sided.</LD>
<LD>   With a relentless commitment to its defense and transition game,
Lynwood won the Southern California Division I Regional girls'
basketball final Saturday at Long Beach Arena, beating Harbor City
Narbonne, 52-33.</LD>
<LD>   Lynwood (32-0), ranked No. 1 in the state and nation, hardly
looked the part.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it was because Narbonne (27-4), ranked No. 2 in the state
and No. 6 in the nation, looked even less so.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lynwood will try to win its first state title since
1993 when it plays Sacramento Kennedy, a 59-57 winner over San Jose
Archbishop Mitty, at 6 p.m. Saturday at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne won the last two Division I state titles and had reached
the final three of the last four years--vacating the title in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne made only eight of 48 shots from the field (16.7%) and 14
of 27 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Lynwood looked efficient. The Knights made 15 of 47
shots from the field (32.9%) and 21 of 34 free throws in a game that
never developed any rhythm because of 48 fouls, 28 against Narbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne got a three-point basket from Lisa Willis 69 seconds into
the game, and didn't make another field goal until 54 seconds into in
the third quarter. Narbonne finished with 20 turnovers, Lynwood 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to play our style and not let what happened last year
happen again," said Lynwood Coach Ellis Barfield, whose team lost to
Narbonne, 64-39, in the regional final last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our game is to manufacture points, drive to the basket. We didn't
want anything to stop us--stay relentless regardless of what

<TE>   Janice Bright scored five of her game-high 18 points in the first
quarter as Lynwood opened a 14-5 lead. The margin stretched to 25-14
by halftime as Narbonne's "offense" consisted of making 11 of 21 free
throws. The Gauchos were one of 18 from the field in the first half.</TE>

<HD>Fledgling King Upsets Mater Dei</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Riverside King, a school that opened its doors three years ago, had a
vision of greatness when its boys' basketball team played its first
varsity game two seasons ago, a dream that became startling reality
with a 70-65 upset Saturday over Santa Ana Mater Dei in the Southern
California Regional Division II final at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<LD>   With the victory, King (30-4) became firmly steeped in state
playoff lore, its fledgling program upending the school that has won
four state titles and was making a record 13th regional championship
appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Marvin Lea scored 28 points, Leon Rosborough added 13 and King
laid claim to a new reign against the Monarchs (29-5). The victory,
however unexpected it might have been, was explained with cool
confidence by King's players.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't come here thinking they had won all these state
titles," Rosborough said. "We looked at them as another team in our
way of winning a championship ring."</TE>
<TE>   A 16-3 run in the last four minutes of the third quarter sent King
on its way to Sacramento for the state Division II championship game
against Mountain View St. Francis (25-8) on Saturday at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Lea missed four layups in the first few minutes of the third
quarter, but recovered to score eight points during the decisive
spurt, which gave King a 44-40 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Lea scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, making nine of 10 free
throws to prevent Mater Dei from mounting a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my game was good enough that I'd be able to step up later
in the third and fourth quarter," said Lea, who set a Division II
regional final record by making 14 free throws. He had 19 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei had won 22 consecutive games and was looking for a
second consecutive state title after winning the Division I
championship last season.</TE>
<TE>   But the Monarchs were undone by 21 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to lose this game, we'd have to have several things go
wrong," said Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight.</TE>
<TE>   "We had quite a few things go wrong tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Strawberry had 18 points and Wesley Washington scored 13 for
Mater Dei.</TE>

<LD>Torrance Bishop Montgomery earned its third consecutive berth in the
Division III state championship game by rallying for a 62-57 victory
over top-seeded Lakewood Artesia in the Southern California Regional
girls' basketball final Saturday at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The second-seeded Knights (27-5), who fell behind by 13 points in
the first quarter, outscored the Pioneers, 17-10, in the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Junior guard Noelle Quinn led Bishop Montgomery with 21 points and
12 rebounds. Her basket with 5:30 to play gave the Knights the lead
for good, 51-49, and her three-point play with 40 seconds left
secured the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Sophomore guard Nykia Peace had 15 points and Veronica Torres
scored 13 for the Knights, who will be making their fifth appearance
in the state final in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Artesia (26-6), which lost in the regional final for the second
consecutive year, built a 16-3 lead behind junior guard Christian
Jackson and junior forward Cacie Pope.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pioneers were plagued by foul trouble. Senior guards
Brittney Thomas and Brittany Imaku each picked up two fouls within
the first four minutes of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery used an 18-7 run, capped by a Quinn basket, to
tie the score, 33-33, late in the first half. Artesia led at
halftime, 36-33.</TE>
<TE>   A steal by Imaku led to an Artesia basket and a 47-35 lead late in
the third quarter. Bishop Montgomery took its first lead with 7:03 to
play after a 12-2 run that began with consecutive baskets by center
Khiara Ferguson and ended with a basket by Peace.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, who had scored 63 points in her previous two games, was
held to eight.</TE>

<LD>   Illinois vs. Creighton: The teams are coming off vastly different
first-round experiences. Creighton, seeded 12th, needed double
overtime and every ounce of energy to upset Florida. Fourth-seeded
Illinois cruised to a 29-point victory over San Diego State. Fatigue
could be a factor for Creighton stars Kyle Korver and Terrell Taylor.
Korver played 37 minutes against Florida before fouling out, and
Taylor, who made the game-winning three-point shot, played 40
minutes. No Illinois starter played more than 30 minutes. Illinois
played like a Final Four team in its destruction of San Diego State,
and star guard Frank Williams continued his fine play of late,
scoring 25 points. It will be interesting to see whether Creighton's
Taylor, who scored 28 points against Florida, can rebound with
another clutch performance. The junior guard is a streaky player and
has become a mini-celebrity since his Michael Jordan-like performance
at the United Center. Will the adulation go to his head?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State vs. Texas: Third-seeded Mississippi State can
thank big man Mario Austin for making it to the second round. The
265-pounder powered his way to 14 consecutive first-half points to
lift the Bulldogs out of their slumber and lead his team to a
12-point victory over McNeese State. Mississippi State's defense used
tremendous pressure to hold McNeese scoreless for the last 6:45 of
the first half. The Bulldogs are expected to receive a stronger
challenge from sixth-seeded Texas. Freshman point guard T.J. Ford
played more like a senior in the Longhorns' 70-57 first-round victory
over Boston College. Ford, usually content to get his teammates
involved, finished with 20 points. He also had seven assists.
Mississippi State is a few hurdles from matching its 1996 run, when
it advanced to the Final Four.</TE>

<LD>Azusa Pacific overcame a slow start and defeated Oklahoma City,
80-72, Saturday in an NAIA Division I men's quarterfinal game at
Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   John Bourne scored 20 points for the ninth-seeded Cougars (28-7),
who will play fifth-seeded Oklahoma Baptist in a semifinal Monday. It
will be Azusa Pacific's third straight semifinal appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma City (26-6) opened the game with a 17-6 run but the
Cougars rallied for a 31-30 lead at halftime. The Cougars shot 37% in
the first half.</LD>
<TE>   "In the first half, we weren't making the extra pass," Coach Bill
Odell said. "We were doing too many things on our own. We know we can
shoot the ball. We just needed to get open."</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars shot 60% in the second half and 67% (eight for 12)
from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Caleb Gervin's two free throws with 4:13 to play gave the
Cougars the lead for good, 66-64. Gervin finished with 17 points.</TE>

<LD>In a salute to the NCAA tournament, here's my annual mock draft of
every amateur (European/salaried, NCAA/pure or whatever) in the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Personally, I'm with Billy Packer. None of the young guys are
ready. No one was ready when everyone stayed in school the whole four
years, so the youth thing is a mixed blessing for the NBA, not to
mention a disaster for Packer's NCAA.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, it's not up to us but the youths, who routinely
choose millions over an education. Go figure.</LD>
<TE>   Not that it has slowed things down, but this year's senior high
school class is thin. Now everyone has lost their minds over a
junior, LeBron James, who'd have to sue to get into the draft but has
suddenly become the most heralded prep since Wilt Chamberlain, with
Sports Illustrated putting him on the cover, Nike's Phil Knight
dropping in to court his parents and Shaquille O'Neal showing up at
one of his games.</TE>
<TE>   "What's unusual," an Eastern Conference general manager says, "is
there's no dissent among the people who see him. And I've talked to
conservative NBA guys who hate the high school thing."</TE>
<TE>   Wait 'til the conservatives learn the "high school thing" now
means "everyone in high school."</TE>
<TE>   One team (at least) is tracking Sebastian Telfair, a 5-foot-11
sophomore from Brooklyn, supposedly the Next Big Thing After James.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks go to the four GMs who helped me plus David Benezra of
Recruiting USA and ESPN.com and former Clipper/Net Coach Don Casey,
who's just back from China and says Yao Ming ought to be No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   1. LeBron James, 6-7, 210, junior, Akron (Ohio) St. Vincent-St.
Mary High--Supposed to combine best parts of Kobe Bryant and Magic
Johnson. No, really.</TE>
<TE>   2. Jason Williams, 6-2, 195, junior, Duke--Some say he's not
really a point guard and takes bad shots. OK, and their point is?
Coach Mike Krzyzewski turns him loose because he carries his team.
Williams does everything well, except shoot, which he does really
well. Think: bigger, more explosive Phil Ford.</TE>
<TE>   3. Yao Ming, 7-5, 283, Shanghai Sharks--Looks like he's coming.
NBA guys containing their excitement because he'll need time to
adjust and may always be a finesse player. On the other hand ...</TE>
<TE>   4. Qyntel Woods, 6-8, 225, sophomore, Northeast Mississippi
College. A scout, sent to Booneville, Miss., in January, found
colleagues from half the league on site. Admirers say he's in the
mold of (you're kidding, right?) Tracy McGrady.</TE>
<TE>   5. Mike Dunleavy Jr., 6-91/2, 220, junior, Duke--Once a scrawny
guard, now a full-size NBA small forward. Fine passer, good shooter,
son-of-coach feel for the game. Some scouts even mention (sober up)
Larry Bird. Says he'll stay.</TE>
<TE>   6. Dajuan Wagner, 6-3, 200, freshman, Memphis--Hyped to alarming
proportions, didn't turn out to be Allen Iverson or Steve Francis but
did improve. Says he's staying, which is a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   7. Amare Stoudamire, 6-9, 240, senior, Cypress Creek (Fla.)
High--Some see OK skills, some see none, but, says a GM: "He'd be one
of the toughest guys in our league right now."</TE>
<TE>   8. Drew Gooden, 6-10, 230, junior, Kansas--Athletic, puts up
numbers. Will have to show he can stand in against bigger pros so
it's probably not a good idea to go around saying they look "fat and
happy."</TE>
<TE>   9. Jared Jeffries, 6-10, 215, sophomore, Indiana--Second-best
prospect Bobby Knight ever landed, after Isiah Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   10. Chris Marcus, 7-1, 285, senior, Western Kentucky--Sat out most
of season because of foot injury and never caught up, but has only to
show he's sound to move up. Not athletic but huge with a nice touch.</TE>
<TE>   11. Chris Wilcox, 6-10, 230, sophomore, Maryland--Big, young,
athletic, started season as a sub but came fast.</TE>
<TE>   12. Kendrick Perkins, 6-9, 260, junior, Beaumont (Texas) Ozen
High--Next prep widebody on the horizon. More like Eddy Curry than
Shaq, but a GM says if he goes pro in '03, "He'd be in the top half
of the lottery."</TE>
<TE>   13. Nikoloz Tskitishvili, 6-11, 210, Benetton Treviso (Italy)--A
19-year-old Georgian, supposedly in mold of (gulp) Pau Gasol.</TE>
<TE>   14. Curtis Borchardt, 7-0, 230, junior, Stanford--Out of nowhere.
Has to work on that body, but he's a decent athlete, blocks shots and
shoots (44% on three-pointers.) Ate Chris Marcus' lunch in Thursday's
first-round meeting.</TE>
<TE>   15. Emeka Okafor, 6-9, 240, freshman, Connecticut--Blocked five or
more shots 11 times.</TE>
<TE>   16. Carlos Boozer, 6-9, 280, junior, Duke--Not the next coming of
Elton Brand but still a hard-working, full-sized NBA power forward.</TE>
<TE>   17. David West, 6-8, 232, junior, Xavier--Smaller than Boozer but
more skilled.</TE>
<TE>   18. Marcus Haislip, 6-10, 230, junior, Tennessee---Late bloomer,
athletic and strong, but unpolished.</TE>
<TE>   19. Caron Butler, 6-7, 235, sophomore, Connecticut--Did juvenile
jail time but straightened out. Tough, skilled small forward.</TE>
<TE>   20. Kareem Rush, 6-6, 218, junior, Missouri--Projected lottery
pick who had disappointing season, although he averaged 20 points and
shot 41% on threes. Great athlete. Questions now are shot selection
and toughness.</TE>
<TE>   21. Sam Clancy, 6-7, 240, senior, USC--More athletic than your
average human tree trunk. Very active, gets a lot of steals and
blocks.</TE>
<TE>   22. Frank Williams, 6-3, 205, junior, Illinois--Projected lottery
pick, once compared to (yeah, right) Gary Payton. Opted to stay,
although he may actually have left and just not told anyone. Takes
over some games, coasts in others. May rise to the challenge but now
a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   23. Kirk Hinrich, 6-3, 180, junior, Kansas--Point guard who made
47% of his threes.</TE>
<TE>   24. Frederick Jones, 6-4, 210, senior, Oregon--Athlete who got
serious this season, averaging 19 points, 5.6 rebounds, shot 39% on
threes.</TE>
<TE>   25. Casey Jacobsen, 6-6, 210, junior, Stanford--Put up numbers
when it became his team, but his position is manned by super
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   26. Dan Dickau, 6-0, 170, senior, Gonzaga--Point guard who made
48% of his threes.</TE>
<TE>   27. James White, 6-6, 172, freshman, Florida--Major athlete whom
the Gators broke in slowly. Apparently, it wasn't slow enough because
he's musing about the draft.</TE>
<TE>   28. Darius Songaila, 6-9, 245, senior, Wake Forest--Lithuanian who
shoots and makes plays.</TE>
<TE>   29. Jason Kapono, 6-7, 199, junior, UCLA--Stop me if you've heard
this annually. Still improving, lacks athleticism but can shoot and
pass, too.</TE>
<TE>   Right there:</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gadzuric, 6-11, 248, senior, UCLA--Big question is knees. Next
is why he isn't further along, but he's athletic, plays hard and has
a good shot at the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes, 6-7, 230, senior, UCLA--Overshadowed but intriguing
when he just slashed to hoop. Pros noticed when he started making
threes (three for 25 as a junior, 39 for 87 as a senior.)</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Ely, 6-10, 256, senior, Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   Antwain Barbour, 6-5, 180, sophomore, Wabash Valley (Ill.)
College--Headed for Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Carmelo Anthony, 6-7, 210, senior, Oak Hill (Va.) Academy--Headed
for Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Ridnour, 6-2, 165, sophomore, Oregon.</TE>

<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   It was one thing for Sports Illustrated to pose Charles Barkley in
broken shackles and chains to suggest how unfettered he was. It's
another--try deliberately manipulative--in light of O'Neal's
acknowledgement that he refused their request to pose first, which
suggests SI has been running all over the country, looking for an
athlete it could chain up. Looks like someone there is into
shackles.... John Stockton turns 40 in a week, doesn't dribble
between his legs or make fancy passes and never got the fashion memo
about short pants, so what's he still doing here? Stockton just got
his 15,000th assist, extending a record as likely as any to stand
forever, with Magic second all-time--at 10,141. "He never puts
himself in an awkward situation," Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said. "There
are lots of guys flying through the air trying to make passes. He's
always been a guy who looks at the floor from a little different
perspective than everyone else." ... With Michael Jordan out, Doug
Collins turned the delighted Washington Wizards loose. "We're not
old," said resurgent Courtney Alexander. "We want to run."
Unfortunately, the kids are 2-8 without Jordan, who keeps sending
word he'll return this season, perhaps just to keep their hopes
up.... Trading for Penny Hardaway in 1999 and giving him a
seven-year, $86-million contract was the Phoenix Suns' first mistake,
compounded two years later by trading Jason Kidd. In contrast, moving
Hardaway enabled Orlando to start clearing the cap space that led to
signing McGrady and Grant Hill. "People assumed that he [Hardaway]
could still play at the level he once could, but that just wasn't
going to happen with all of the injuries he's had," Magic Coach Doc
Rivers said. "I really think that's affected him emotionally.... It
doesn't seem like it takes a lot to get him sideways."</TE>
<TE>   So much for the classy approach: Before returning to Phoenix, Kidd
said he wouldn't say anything negative ("That's not me. There's a lot
of construction going on in Phoenix and I hope for the best for
them.") Then after he was booed and shot four for 18 in New Jersey's
loss, Kidd made an obscene gesture--to a heckler, he said, not the
crowd--zinged the Suns' owners ("I don't work for the Colangelos. If
I did, I'd probably quit.") and was fined $5,000 by the league....
Knick lameness anecdote of the week: Coach Don Chaney last week mused
how much Chris Webber might have helped them, although they didn't
even try to get him and aren't expected to in the future, perhaps
welcoming the chance to remind everyone he has no one like that....
Chaney also called Karl Malone a "dirty player." Replied Malone:
"He's on borrowed time. Dead man walking." ... The Charlotte Hornets
may not have a slam dunk gaining approval to move to New Orleans.
Said SuperSonic owner Howard Schultz: "When our fans in Seattle read
about the arrogance, the hubris of owners just picking up and leaving
and the way that trust and confidence has been broken in that
environment, it's very unhealthy for the NBA and it's very unhealthy
for me in Seattle."</TE>

<LD>Florida guard Brett Nelson said this season has "left a very bad
taste in my mouth" and he will consider going pro instead of staying
for his senior year.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what I'm going to do yet," Nelson said. "I'm going
to take the next couple of months and see what happens."</LD>
<LD>   Nelson played with a broken cheekbone in Florida's 83-82
double-overtime NCAA tournament loss to Creighton on Friday. He was
hurt in practice Tuesday in a fight with teammate LaDarius Halton.</LD>
<TE>   Nelson shot four for 19 and finished with 13 points. Expected to
be one of Florida's best shooters, he ended the season shooting 39%
from the floor.</TE>
<TE>   His draft stock dropped as the season went on. The deadline for
declaring for the NBA draft is in mid-May.</TE>

<TE>   Shouting "Don't stop, don't shop, till the flag drops," about 125
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People protesters
marched to the site of the NCAA tournament in a fight to remove the
Confederate flag from South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   As the group headed to the steps of the Bi-Lo Center, about 20
flag supporters waved banners, shouted and yelled across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "The first symbol of terrorism came to America years ago and it is
behind you," NAACP national field director Nelson Rivers said of the
Confederate group as Duke played Notre Dame inside the arena.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters fanned out around the building to hand out leaflets and
fliers after a brief rally.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP has had a tourism boycott against South Carolina since
Jan. 1, 2000, demanding the flag be removed from the Statehouse Dome.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP and others asked the NCAA two years ago to remove these
games. But the NCAA's executive committee chose to keep them and
placed a two-year hold on awarding championships to South Carolina.</TE>

<HD>NFL Might Be Ready To Use Arena Option</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>NFL owners don't plan to tinker much with their own league at their
annual meetings, which begin today. But this could be a landmark
session for arena football.</LD>
<LD>   The NFL has the option to acquire 49.9% of the Arena Football
League, and owners will vote Tuesday on whether to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks to me like the votes will be there," said Dallas Cowboy
owner Jerry Jones, who also owns the AFL's Dallas Desperados. "I
think the positives are really significant for arena football."</LD>
<TE>   Casey Wasserman, who owns the Los Angeles Avengers, plans to
attend the meetings and hopes to celebrate a merger. He played a
significant role in arranging the AFL's partnership with NBC, which
will televise arena games every Sunday beginning next season.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman is also part of a powerhouse coalition working on a
proposal to build an NFL stadium in downtown L.A. The subject of when
the league might return to L.A. is not on the docket for the
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not on the formal agenda," said Joe Browne, one of the NFL's
senior vice presidents. "That's not to say someone won't raise it
from the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay, chairman of the eight-member
competition committee, said the league is hitting its targets as far
as scoring, average margin of victory and length of games. Good
sportsmanship will be a particular point of emphasis again next
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we brought it to the players' attention last year, but we
have more work to do," McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   The league plans to enforce rules about the music and artificial
crowd noise piped through stadium speakers. The practice will be
outlawed when the visiting team has the ball and the clock is
running.</TE>
<TE>   Instant replay will be discussed, although no major modifications
will be implemented. The only change is officials will be reminded to
stop the action on the field the moment they are buzzed to review a
play.</TE>
<TE>   The chop-block rules will be examined, as will the "tuck" rule,
which many people believe cost the Oakland Raiders a playoff victory
at New England.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of staging future Super Bowls in New York and
Washington is also on the agenda. Currently, the league rule mandates
the average January temperature for a host city must be 50 degrees or
warmer. But NFL officials are considering bending the rules to give
back to the two cities most acutely affected by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Bruins' No. 2 Goalie Stops No. 1 Detroit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The league's two No. 1 teams brought out their No. 2 goalies, and put
on a pretty good show anyway.</LD>
<LD>   John Grahame stopped 29 shots and Glen Murray scored his
career-best 30th goal to break a second-period tie and lead the
Bruins past the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1, Saturday at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "It was almost like playoff hockey," Detroit forward Igor Larionov
said.</LD>
<TE>   Manny Legace, starting in place of Dominik Hasek for the first
time since Feb. 8, made 20 saves for Detroit, which lost for the
second time in 11 games. With 102 points, the Red Wings are first
overall in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Grahame made his first start since Feb. 28 to give Boston 84
points--tied for first in the East with Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to be too surprised by anything," said Grahame, who
learned earlier in the week that he would start. "It proves that we
can play with any team in the NHL. We're one of the top teams in the
league as well."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Rolston scored for Boston. Sergei Fedorov picked up his
500th career assist, helping out on Kris Draper's tying goal with
16:02 left in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Grahame made consecutive stops from point-blank range with six
minutes left to help preserve the win.</TE>
<TE>   "He was definitely ready, and he came through," said Byron Dafoe,
Boston's top goalie. "For me, it was a nonconference game and an
opportunity to get some rest. I'm sure that was [Detroit's] mindset
with Hasek as well."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 17,565 included quite a few Red Wings' fans, one of
whom threw a squid on the ice in the third period--a tradition in

<HD>Missouri Gives Critics Best Answer</HD>
<DH>West: Maligned Tigers, who began season 9-0 before
stumbling and being seeded 12th for tournament, rout fourth-seeded
Ohio State, 83-67.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>They were seeded 12th, but they were nobody's darling.</LD>
<LD>   Now the much-maligned Missouri Tigers are in the Sweet 16, and
they await the winner of today's UCLA-Cincinnati game in the NCAA
West Regional semifinals Thursday at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after upsetting Miami, Missouri tore through
fourth-seeded Ohio State on Saturday at the Pit, 83-67, in a game the
Tigers led by 21 points at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   "These are not upsets to us," said Kareem Rush, who played with a
prizefighter's lip, ugly and swollen because he took 21 stitches
after he was hit by an elbow in the Miami game.</TE>
<TE>   Rush went down hard one time in particular, and was fouled on the
play.</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates told me not to let them see me hurt," Rush said. "I
got up and hit two free throws."</TE>
<TE>   Missouri (23-11) is a team that got up off the mat.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers started the season 9-0 and rose to No. 2 in the nation.
Then they went 12-11--losing to Texas Tech by 23 in February.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are toughened by criticism, and humbled into a group that
works together.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of ran into a buzz saw," Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien
said. "It's hard for me to imagine they came in sixth in their league
and lost 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "An understatement is that we were beaten by a much better team
today. They were more physical, they were quicker and certainly they
dominated the game on the backboards."</TE>
<TE>   The rebounding score was Missouri 52, Ohio State 28.</TE>
<TE>   Rush had nine rebounds to go with his 17 points, but he made only
two of nine three-point shots and is no longer the focal point of
what has become an ensemble cast.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Rickey Paulding had 20 points and nine rebounds and one
spectacular breakaway tomahawk dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just Rickey," Rush said. "It probably wasn't even his best
move."</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Gilbert, the Tigers' tough senior point guard, scored 16,
made four of six three-pointers and had six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Center Arthur Johnson had 14 points, many of them early as
Missouri established its inside game to open up the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State (24-8) became the second Big Ten team to go home, along
with Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Brian Brown, who scored 33 against Davidson in the first
round, was held to 19 and was 0 for 2 from long range.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri rolls on, and might have played its best game Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Cinderellas don't come from the Big 12 Conference, but Missouri
will try to become the first team seeded 12th to reach a regional
final.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga, seeded 12th, made it to the Sweet 16 last year but did
not go further.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting everything together," Rush said. "This team is
becoming so special. It's been a long and hard process, but the work
we put in is paying off."</TE>

<HD>Three More Than Enough for Oregon</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Ducks reach first Sweet 16 since 1960 as Jackson,
Jones, Ridnour combine for 81 points in 92-87 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Had you told Ernie Kent that his reserves would supply only two
points and that Wake Forest would have five players score in double
figures in their Midwest Regional second-round game, the Oregon coach
wouldn't have blinked.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to remember," Kent said, "this is a team with a lot of
weapons."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, they relied on three. Luke Jackson, Frederick Jones and
Luke Ridnour were enough Saturday as they combined to score 81 points
in a 92-87 victory over the Demon Deacons at Arco Arena.</LD>
<TE>   No. 2-seeded Oregon (25-8) advances to the Sweet 16 for the first
time since 1960 and will play today's winner between Texas and
Mississippi State in Madison, Wis., on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect this out of each other," said Jones, a senior shooting
guard who scored 14 of his 24 points in the second half, including
two dunks that ignited key rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, a 6-foot-7, 215-pound small forward, had a game-high 29
points, equaling the career-high he scored at California on Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour, the Ducks' sophomore point guard, had a career-high 28
points while making a career-best seven three-point baskets. He also
had two assists, a steal and three turnovers in 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh-seeded Demon Deacons (21-13) were led by Craig
Dawson's 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   But with 7:45 remaining, and Wake Forest leading, 78-76, Dawson
had to be helped from the court after dislocating his left shoulder
battling for a rebound with Jones. Dawson, who had knocked down five
of eight three-point shots, did not return.</TE>
<TE>   "My feelings go out to him because he's one of my friends," Jones
said. "But I couldn't stop and ask him if he was all right because we
needed a bucket."</TE>
<TE>   In a game of scoring runs between Oregon, the regular-season
Pacific 10 Conference champion, and Wake Forest, which had lost six
of nine games before the NCAA tournament, the Demon Deacons embarked
on the first.</TE>
<TE>   After a Ridnour free throw completed a three-point play and gave
the Ducks a 25-22 lead with 11:39 remaining in the first half, Wake
Forest took off on a 14-0 spree over the next 4:01 to go up by a
game-high 11 points, 36-25.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, though, was able to close the gap, getting within 48-46 at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Kent made an adjustment in the locker room, going to a match-up
zone defense to try and negate the Demon Deacons' post presence.</TE>
<TE>   It worked.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon tied the score at 78-78 when Jones threw down a spectacular
dunk off a missed Jackson three-pointer with 6:26 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   A Ridnour three-pointer with 3:32 remaining gave the Ducks an
85-83 advantage, and they never relinquished the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half they were shooting the lights out and it was
tough to get a stop," Jackson said. Wake Forest made 55.9% of its
shots from the field, 66.7% (six of nine) on three-pointers, in the
first 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just so competitive that coming down the stretch, Luke
Ridnour started taking over a little bit," Jackson said. "Then there
were stretches down the game where Freddie Jones stepped up, and then
when I needed to knock down a shot, I stepped up and did that. We are
all just so competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also said the Ducks took satisfaction in beating a team
from the Atlantic Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We just feel like since the ACC is on the East Coast, they get a
lot of publicity," he said. "We had a lot to prove that the Pac-10 is
a great conference."</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Isn't Going Anywhere</HD>
<DH>West: Villanova's women eliminate Waves, 67-46, by slowing
them and holding them to their lowest point total.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Pepperdine tried to convince itself it was ready to make some noise
in this year's NCAA women's basketball tournament, but Villanova
showed the Waves it's still not yet their time to shout.</LD>
<LD>   The ninth-seeded Wildcats, who play the game slow and slower,
lulled the eighth-seeded Waves right out of the West Regional with a
67-46 rout in first-round play Saturday before 11,200.</LD>
<LD>   Villanova (20-10), led by Mimi Riley's 18 points and Katie Davis'
16, moves on to play Oklahoma, which routed Hartford, 84-52. Damaris
Hinojosa had 16 points for Pepperdine (23-8), which ends its season
with its most lopsided loss.</LD>
<TE>   The Wildcats held the Waves to a season-low scoring total for a
single game, and outrebounded them, 41-30, including a 15-4 edge on
the offensive boards</TE>
<TE>   By controlling the boards, Villanova dictated the tempo, often
taking all 30 seconds to get off a shot. Although the Wildcats made
only 38.9% of their shots, they rarely had to score under duress.</TE>
<TE>   "The game kind of got into the pace we wanted to get in,"
Villanova Coach Harry Perretta said. "We wanted a low-scoring game.
We are very successful when we can hold opponents under 60 points."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine, which made 18 of 48 shots (37.5%) never could speed up
things; the best the Waves could do was tie the score, at 14-14,
early in the first half, but they never led. They became the 11th
team Villanova has held under 50 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Villanova did a great job running their offense and real good job
defensively," said Pepperdine Coach Mark Trakh. "There are no
excuses."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how much the Waves were warned about Villanova's
deliberate style, Pepperdine still looked hypnotized at times by the
Wildcats' passing attack.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have to keep playing defense for 30 seconds ... we're
just not used to that. And it took us out of our game," said Wave
forward Nadja Morgan, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds in her final
college game.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the rebounding effort by Villanova that really
surprised Pepperdine, which had a size advantage in the front court.</TE>
<TE>   "On film we saw that if they shot and missed, they just kind of
ran back [on defense]," said Wave forward Sarah Richen. "They didn't
do that tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Down 26-16 at halftime, the Waves tried to pick up the pace but
the closest the Waves could get was 31-25. Villanova promptly went on
an 11-2 run.</TE>

<LD>The Long Beach Poly boys' and girls' track and field teams combined
to win 17 of 42 events Saturday in the Northridge-Alemany Relays at
Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   The Jackrabbits, competing in cool and breezy conditions that
hampered performances in most running events, won 10 individual
events and seven relays.</LD>
<LD>   Hurdler Tunisia Johnson, who has committed to USC, won the
100-meter highs and the 300 lows for the defending state girls'
champions.</LD>
<TE>   She ran 14.99 seconds in the highs while running into a wind of
1.9 meters per second and clocked 44.52 in the lows.</TE>
<TE>   Poly swept the top three places in both of those races, as well as
in the 100, which sophomore Shalonda Solomon won in 12.15 while
running into a wind of 1.8 meters per second.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbit boys won three individual events.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive victory came in the 100, when Dedrick Jones
clocked 10.93 to turn back teammate Chreston Anderson (11.07) and
Noah Smith (11.10) of Woodland Hills Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Compton Dominguez posted notable victories over Poly in winning

the 400 relay and they clocked 3 minutes 17.37 seconds in the 1,600
relay to win by more than two seconds.</TE>
<TE>   David Shipp of Valencia was a surprise winner of the 400 when his
career-best 49.62 turned back a highly regarded field that included
Justin Tryon and Tyrone Melton of Taft and Jarvis Littleton of
Dominguez.</TE>

<HD>Bearcats Must Solve the Puzzling Bruins</HD>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>This is so confusing for Cincinnati coaches and players.</LD>
<LD>   They watched UCLA demolish Mississippi in a breathless display of
two-platoon, take-no-prisoners basketball Friday night. They saw
coltish freshmen with long arms come off the bench to replace lanky
juniors and seniors with long arms. They saw 10 talented players, two
full teams of guys who could run and jump and shoot and hustle and
make plays.</LD>
<LD>   So Saturday morning Dan Peters, Cincinnati associate head coach,
stopped Cal Coach Ben Braun and asked a question.</LD>
<TE>   "I said to Ben, 'Does anybody in the Pac-10 have more talent than
UCLA?'"</TE>
<TE>   UCLA fans can guess the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me," Peters said, "not from 1 through 10. I know this:
UCLA is one of the top two or three most talented teams we've seen in
a few years."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the confusing part.</TE>
<TE>   "What," Peters said, "are these guys doing as No. 8 seeds?"</TE>
<TE>   What, indeed?</TE>
<TE>   Peters talked about watching tape of UCLA's victory over Kansas.
"I mean, geez, they had a lineup on the court where no one was
shorter than 6-7 and then you see those long arms. And they're
skilled. These guys, they can win a national championship. Wouldn't
surprise me."</TE>
<TE>   For a team that seemed to treat the regular season as something to
spit out, as if it were a bad apple, eighth-seeded UCLA has done all
right by the NCAA draw.</TE>
<TE>   A first game against a short, poor-shooting Rebel team that pretty
much couldn't win outside Oxford, Miss., was just the right kind of
practice game. The Bruins found out, yes, it still works, being a
talented UCLA team in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   And now they come up against a No. 1 seed--but one with flaws.</TE>
<TE>   The Bearcats are the anti-Bruins. They take every possession of
every game seriously. Their coach, Bob Huggins, considers himself
lucky to not be working in a steel mill or factory on the night
shift. He does not get many high school all-Americans. He is a
screamer, a shouter, a man not afraid to pull a player by the jersey
and exchange spit as well as words. He wants things done right all
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "If our team wins by 20 and we should have won by 30," Huggins
says, "I'm not happy."</TE>
<TE>   The Bearcats will play hard for 40 minutes. They will play
aggressively, on defense and offense. But are they good enough, 31-3
record aside? That's not a sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati has played only one team in the RPI top 10 (Mississippi
State) and was 4-2 in its six games against top-30 RPI teams
(including Marquette three times, Oklahoma State and Xavier).
Cincinnati played the 23rd-hardest schedule; UCLA the 11th.
Cincinnati played in Conference USA, ranked ninth-toughest, while
UCLA was in the fifth-rated Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Which was why the Bearcats were impressed by UCLA's 80-58 victory
over Mississippi. Which was why the Bearcats were confused. "They
lost 11 games, man," Cincinnati guard Steve Logan said. "How?"</TE>
<TE>   UCLA can beat Cincinnati. UCLA, with all its height and all those
long arms, can play a stifling zone defense. The Bearcats, except for
Logan, aren't great standstill shooters. It can be enervating,
shooting over those long arms, and if the Bruins don't turn the ball
over, don't let Cincinnati get to running and shooting on the move,
in rhythm, the Bruins can win.</TE>
<TE>   You can make a lot out of the physical matchups and the 10-deep
UCLA rotation and you can imagine many ways UCLA can upset
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Today's game is about will.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Bruins come out fearless and full of themselves and keep
playing, past the mistakes and missed shots and lost rebounds; will
they keep running hard and defending harder? Will they give the Ole
Miss effort or the Arizona State at Pauley effort?</TE>
<TE>   Billy Knight was sympathizing with Cincinnati's coaches. How,
Knight wonders, do you prepare for the Bruins? "How do you scout us?"
Knight asked. "On Friday our leading scorers struggled and we still
won by 20 and a freshman was our second-leading scorer. It's tough to
defend a team like that. It'll be interesting to see how they guard
us."</TE>
<TE>   This was an interesting analysis. The Bruins understand how, at
this time of the year when the opponents don't know them so well,
when the opponents haven't played the bad Bruins, their split
personality can be an asset.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going with the flow," senior Rico Hines said, "and we're
just playing basketball. It's like it's an AAU tournament or
something. Just play basketball and move on."</TE>
<TE>   What you notice about the NCAA tournament is that the
underachievers sometimes have an advantage over the overachievers.
Missouri upsetting Ohio State is an example. Sometimes, if your team
has the talent and the talent decides it's worth getting motivated,
the talent wins.</TE>
<TE>   It was not an accident that Cincinnati was mostly unranked in
preseason polls and UCLA was mostly in the top five. Huggins is a
tough, driven, well-prepared coach. But as Knight says, how to you
prepare for UCLA?</TE>
<TE>   That two-platoon thing, five-man, full-team substitutions that
worked so well against Mississippi? The Bruins did that one other
time this year, on Senior Day at Pauley. And it worked.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Pac-10 tournament came and Steve Lavin didn't use his
innovation. Why? Who knows. Maybe he forgot. "But I'm determined to
use it all during the NCAA tournament," the coach says.</TE>
<TE>   And here's the thing. There's not a team in the country that could
do the same thing. None with 10 players of such talent. So as hard
and as well as the Bearcats play, it might not matter.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens today will be up to UCLA. That's how it has been
most of this season. The great wins, the bad losses, they've all come
because of how UCLA played. It's not often a No. 8 seed can determine
its fate. But this one can.</TE>

<HD>Off Court, Schaen Has Built a Huge Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harrison Schaen has an IQ in the superior range, owns two companies,
manages a rock band, writes poetry, is an accomplished sketch artist
and ranks among the best junior basketball prospects in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   He turns 17 Monday, which makes him a boy genius in the mode of
Doogie Howser.</LD>
<LD>   His coach at Santa Ana Mater Dei High, Gary McKnight, is
constantly telling him to "get some sleep and turn off the computer."</LD>
<TE>   Except the 6-foot-9 Schaen can't settle for being ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "I was given a mouth and brain to express myself in every way I
possibly can and gain all the knowledge I can," he said. "I'm not
going to sit here and take it for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Schaen had helped Mater Dei (29-5) win 22 consecutive games until
their 70-65 upset loss to Riverside King in Saturday's Southern
California Regional Division II final in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He'd rather be playing basketball, but now that his season is
over, he could be wandering the malls handing out business cards for
his company that designs Web pages or seeking ideas for his newest
company that creates teenage clothing and logos. "I need something to
challenge me," Schaen said. "I get bored easily."</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, he uses his size and quick jumping ability to
disrupt opponents. He's averaging 12 points, seven rebounds and three
blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, he was sidelined with a stress fracture in his foot.
He started this season out of shape because of the injury, which was
a factor in Mater Dei's disappointing 7-4 start.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs, however, hadn't lost since holding a players-only
team meeting at an Oregon hotel in December after losing three
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat there for three, four hours, talked to each other, got on
the same page, and we've been together ever since," Schaen said. "It
was extremely calm. We talked about what our feelings were toward
every player, what we could do to get better. We felt really good
about ourselves because we were able to bond."</TE>
<TE>   McKnight still doesn't know what happened at the meeting, just
that the team was different.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids did it on their own," he said. "I don't know what took
place, but we took off."</TE>
<TE>   Having a player with the intelligence of Schaen certainly helps.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges who want to recruit Schaen next season had better not
show up at his Huntington Beach home with the simple recruiting pitch
of talking basketball.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to know about the school's business offerings, alumni
connections, class sizes, the percentage of students who graduate.
Basketball is his top priority, but getting a college education isn't
far behind.</TE>
<TE>   "How would that make me feel if I'm getting a $120,000 free
education and not taking advantage of it?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen is a teenage entrepreneur juggling commitments among school
work, basketball, business and social life.</TE>
<TE>   How does he do it all?</TE>
<TE>   "If you go to sleep at 3 o'clock in the morning, you can do it,"
his father, Lionel, said. "And the phone never stops ringing. You
think you are at the stock market. The kid has so much talent it's
sick."</TE>
<TE>   Schaen's biggest challenge was homework. It bored him. He felt
many of the assignments were mundane and redundant. But doing
homework is part of the requirement for getting good grades.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother told me the challenge lies in the homework and I
accepted that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen loves challenges. It's the reason he wanted to play for
Mater Dei. He was attending a middle school in the San Fernando
Valley when his parents decided to move to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen is Jewish, but attending one of the region's most
prestigious Catholic schools made perfect sense to him for academic
and athletic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play with the best because when you have the best
competition, that's when you're able to compare yourself against the
best," he said. "I think it's a good learning experience. I'm not
close-minded. I apply all the beliefs to my life and try to be a
better person."</TE>
<TE>   There are teenagers who'd gladly skip school for a day at the
beach, a day at the mall, a day at the movies, a day at the gym.</TE>
<TE>   Schaen doesn't mind a day off, but he never rests.</TE>
<TE>   "I love school, I love being smart," he said.</TE>

<LD>AT PITTSBURGH</LD>
<LD>   California vs. Pittsburgh: Cal could overwhelm its opponent with
superior depth or fall victim to the heroics of the opposing point
guard. Brandin Knight shook off thigh and finger injuries to get 17
points, nine assists and five steals in Pitt's first-round victory
over Central Connecticut State. "He looks like he is in pretty good
playing condition," Cal Coach Ben Braun said. "The things he does are
really hard to play against." Knight and guard Julius Page are potent
three-point threats. Cal has an advantage inside. Center Solomon
Hughes and forward Jamal Sampson, both 6 feet 11, denied Penn shots
from the paint in Cal's 82-75 first-round victory. Pitt starting
center Toree Morris played only four minutes Friday, giving way to
6-7 freshman Chevon Troutman. "Chev has demonstrated in practice and
in games that he is ready to perform well," Coach Ben Howland said.
Cal uses a nine-player rotation. Lately, forward Joe Shipp and guard
Brian Wethers have taken the key shots. In three postseason games,
including two in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament, Shipp has
averaged 21 points and Wethers 17.3. Braun faced Pittsburgh once
before in the NCAA tournament, in 1988 as coach of Eastern Michigan.
Pitt won, 108-90.</LD>

<DH>Tennis: Old pros Sampras, Martin can't handle wind or
younger foes Hewitt, Henman in listless semifinal losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>A couple of old golfing buddies, Pete Sampras and Todd Martin, left
their tennis games blowing in the wind Saturday, meaning they can
spend today on the course instead of the court.</LD>
<LD>   On a day the real Windy City was located here, some 2,000 miles
southwest of Chicago, and the event known now as the Pacific Life
Open would have been best served with a telecast on the Weather
Channel instead of ESPN, Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and Tim Henman
of England wrecked today's all-American final.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, ranked No. 1 in the world and seeded No. 1 here, beat a
listless Sampras, 6-2, 6-4, defeating for the fourth time in a row
the former top-ranked player in the world and the the player with the
most Grand Slam victories in history. Only three other
players--Michael Chang, Wayne Ferreira and Richard Krajicek, have
done that.</LD>
<TE>   The last time Sampras, 30, beat the 21-year-old from Adelaide was
in the semifinals of the 2000 U.S. Open. Since Hewitt beat Sampras in
the opening set of last year's U.S. Open final, en route to a 7-6
(4), 6-1, 6-1 victory, Sampras has won only eight games in four sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the way he is playing," Sampras said, "he's playing some
of the best tennis in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Henman, 11th in the world in the tennis entry system and a
27-year-old veteran with nearly $7 million in prize money, took out
Martin, 31, in a similarly listless match, 6-3, 6-3. Martin, twice a
Grand Slam event finalist and a force on the tour since 1992, has
slipped all the way to 64th in the entry rankings and needed a wild
card to get into the draw.</TE>
<TE>   The mediocre performances of Sampras and Martin were equally
attributable to blustery, swirling, chilling winds that gusted
through the desert at bursts of up to 40 mph and the smart, angled,
strategic shots from Hewitt and Henman that gusted past their
step-slower, in-the-twilight-of-their-careers opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras called Hewitt the best wind player on the tour and said he
deserved all the credit for handling the adverse conditions so well.
Martin was more succinct.</TE>
<TE>   "Weather, wind and Tim [were the problems]," he said. "Last I
checked, the wind doesn't blow just on one side of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras had no break points against Hewitt and spent much of the
match just struggling to get his service toss to stay in one place
long enough for him to hit the ball. He hit only three aces, one
fewer than the ordinary-serving Hewitt, who attacks from the
baseline, not the net, as Sampras does. Sampras also made 30 unforced
errors to Hewitt's 14; Hewitt was hitting 28 winners to Sampras' 18.</TE>
<TE>   "My game in the wind is just a bit vulnerable," said Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, a bulldog at 5 feet 11 and 150 pounds, is a young Andre
Agassi without the charisma. The recently retired Pat Rafter,
Hewitt's Australian Davis Cup and Olympic teammate, as well as an
opponent on the tour for the last several years, once called Hewitt
"a feisty little bugger." In Australia, that is a high compliment.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt agreed with Sampras that the conditions were awful, adding
that the worst part was the "gold crap" blowing in the players'
faces. In the United States, "gold crap" is sand.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt said he dealt with the conditions by playing the
percentages, by being a bit more patient. When he was told that
Sampras called him the best wind player on the tour, Hewitt laughed
and said, "Maybe I should hope for a hurricane tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Odds are, he won't need it. Henman is 0-7 against No. 1-ranked
players. He also is 0-3 against Hewitt, and that includes a
grass-court final last summer at the Queen's Club event just before
Wimbledon. Grass is Henman's best surface, as well as his heritage,
and if the baseline-banging Hewitt can handle Henman on grass, the
medium-slow hard courts of the Indian Wells Tennis Garden should be a
real comfort zone for the Australian.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Life Open is one of nine Masters Series events on the
men's tour, with a status just below the four Grand Slam events.
Hewitt, who can pocket $392,000 with a win today--second place is
worth $206,000--has never won a Masters Series event. He made it to
the final at Stuttgart, Germany, in 2000, but lost a tough
five-setter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I am a better player than that now," Hewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Henman would agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty impressive, watching him in the locker room
beforehand," said Henman, who said he probably wouldn't serve and
volley as much as Sampras did Saturday, because when Hewitt gets a
target at the net, he is even more difficult to beat. "I'm going to
relish the challenge. I've got nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Neither does the men's tournament, which has endured the loss of
its two superstars--Sampras and first-round loser Andre Agassi--the
worst weather in the history of the event since the wind blew in
Wednesday, and even what was perhaps a tennis first when a 25-foot,
200-pound courtside signboard blew over in the middle of the
Sampras-Hewitt match. Despite the loud bang, the two played on until
Hewitt lost the point and then complained to the umpire that the
point should have been stopped and replayed.</TE>
<TE>   "He missed, then he complained about it afterward," Sampras said.
"That wasn't too cool."</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, everything else was for Hewitt, whose one-sided
victory over Sampras was the best example all week of how to deal
with this desert's storm.</TE>

<LD>KEYS TO THE GAME</LD>
<LD>   STYLE OF PLAY: Fundamentally sound Cincinnati plays excellent
man-to-man defense and forces turnovers that lead to baskets in
transition. The Bearcat half-court offense often is nothing more than
point guard Steve Logan shooting or creating a shot for a teammate.
UCLA brings two distinct styles, depending on the lineup. The
starters are older, slower, shoot well from the perimeter and are
best served playing a matchup zone defense. The reserves are more
athletic, press well and sometimes have difficulty scoring.</LD>
<LD>   MATCHUP TO WATCH: Logan vs. a cast of Bruins. The Bearcat
All-American point guard averages 22 points and ended a shooting
slump in the first-round victory over Boston University by scoring 27
points with 10-of-15 shooting. UCLA freshman point guard Cedric
Bozeman will have difficulty staying with Logan, and reserve Ryan
Walcott will spend time chasing him as well. But the key might be
senior Rico Hines, the Bruins' best perimeter defender, who could
shadow Logan in a box-and-one or diamond-and-one zone alignment.</LD>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES: In the last two months, the Bruins displayed no
ability to use an inspiring victory as a springboard to a winning
streak. So their first-round romp over Mississippi could easily be
followed by a poor performance. Cincinnati has won five in a row
since a loss at Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   MAGIC NUMBERS: UCLA hasn't lost in the second round in nine years.
Cincinnati lost in the second round every year from 1997 through
2000.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: It's wishful thinking for UCLA to believe Bob
Huggins-coached Cincinnati will bring anything less than its best
effort. Logan can't be stopped, but slowing him will be crucial. As
for the Bruins, their task is to finish a weekend 2-0, something they
haven't done since January.</TE>

<LD>TODAY AT DALLAS</LD>
<LD>   Xavier vs. Oklahoma: Coach Kelvin Sampson didn't want the Sooners
to forget anything about their first-round loss to Indiana State last
year, so he showed them lowlights from that game before the Big 12
tournament. Oklahoma hasn't lost since, upsetting Kansas in the Big
12 final and beating a chippy Illinois Chicago team in the first
round. Xavier had to scramble to make it to the second round after
falling behind by 12 in the first half against Hawaii. But the
seventh-seeded Musketeers roared back to win, 70-58. Guard Romain
Sato was one of Xavier's stars against Hawaii, with an 18-point,
10-rebound game. But the battle in the second-round game could be
inside, between David West, Xavier's 6-foot-8 power forward, and
Aaron McGhee, the 6-8 power forward for Oklahoma who has been
impressive late in the season and had 26 points and 12 rebounds in
the first-round game. If second-seeded Oklahoma advances to San Jose,
it will be the Sooners' second trip in four years. (They went with a
team that included Eduardo Najera in 1999.) That would dispel a lot
of the complaints about Sampson's frequent first-round exits. Xavier
reached the Sweet 16 in 1990.</LD>

<HD>Westchester Is Stating Its Case</HD>
<DH>Boys' basketball: Comets survive near-disastrous fourth
quarter to defeat Long Beach Poly, 66-60, and advance to state
Division I championship game.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Comets are still streaking toward Sacramento--barely.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly dissipating during a near-disastrous fourth-quarter
stretch in which it lost a 13-point lead, Westchester High pulled
itself together over the last three minutes for a 66-60 victory over
Long Beach Poly in the Southern California Regional Division I boys'
basketball championship game Saturday night at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Brandon Heath's three-point basket from the corner with 1:40 to
play put the top-seeded Comets (31-2) back ahead for good after the
second-seeded Jackrabbits (30-4) used a 14-0 run to take a 57-56
lead.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt I had to hit that shot because I had just turned the ball
over twice," said Heath, who capped the victory with a breakaway
dunk. "I needed to make up for it."</TE>
<TE>   Westchester will play Oakland Tech, a 65-61 overtime winner over
Concord De La Salle in the Northern California Regional final, for
the state title at 8 p.m. Saturday at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Rivers, who finished with a career-best 25 points, scored
nine consecutive points to open Poly's late push after the Comets had
taken a seemingly insurmountable 56-43 lead early in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After Rivers made a three-pointer to cut Westchester's lead to
56-52, Reggie Butler scored on a layup and Mike Roche completed a
three-point play to put the Jackrabbits ahead for the first time
since they led, 11-10, in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But after Heath's three-pointer, Trevor Ariza made a free throw
and Ashanti Cook scored on a memorable shake-and-bake drive to the
basket to give Westchester a 62-57 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Poly's Bobby Jones sank a three-pointer from the wing to make it
62-60, but Hassan Adams hit two free throws and Ariza swatted away a
shot by Rivers to put the game away.</TE>
<TE>   "This team hasn't had a lot of close games," Westchester Coach Ed
Azzam said, "but in the close games we have shown a lot of
character."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Bowman and Heath each had 17 points and Adams scored 13
for the Comets, who are seeking their second state title after
winning in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Jones scored 12 points and Butler had 10 for Poly, which could not
establish superiority inside with its three 6-foot-7 players.</TE>
<TE>   Marcedes Lewis, a UCLA-bound tight end who had been a key
component of the Jackrabbits' march to the final, scored only two
points.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis fouled out with more than four minutes remaining in the
game.</TE>
