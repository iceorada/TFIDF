<HD>Lewinsky on Sunday TV? Italians are scandalized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Italian television usually loves sex and scandal, but putting Monica
Lewinsky on daytime TV on a Sunday close to Christmas was apparently
too much for some.</LD>
<LD>   So it was that the former White House intern, who hit the
headlines in 1998 over her affair with former President Clinton, came
to Italy all dressed up for a TV party -- with no place to go.</LD>
<LD>   Lewinsky was to have been the star guest on "Domenica In" (Sunday
In), a talk show that goes on for about five hours and offers a mix
of dancing, sport and interviews with everyone from priests to pop
stars.</LD>
<TE>   But some politicians were outraged that state broadcaster RAI,
which is funded by public money, planned to pay Lewinsky's expenses
for an interview on a Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   RAI President Antonio Baldassarre expressed concern, and network
executives yanked Lewinsky off the show late Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Memoir is author's hideaway</HD>

<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My life could have been otherwise but it wasn't," Jim Harrison
writes in his disjointed memoir of an author's life, "Off to the
Side," employing the trademark take-it-or-leave-it manner he used in
"The Road Home" and "Legends of the Fall" and declining to draw
specific conclusions about the paths he traveled.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison writes of his days as an emerging writer living a
hardscrabble life, then coming into his own as an iconic American
heartland novelist and poet; later, he writes of his erratic years as
a Hollywood screenwriter hanging out with Jack Nicholson and other
entertainment bigwigs, feasting with Orson Welles and making deals
with studios; and finally, of the wisdom of his later days, his
ability to see the natural world mystically, his claim of
shape-shifting into a wolf one night and the fundamental peace he
taps via rural settings.</LD>
<LD>   In the midst of this autobiographical arc, he arranges a cluster
of essays on his seven favorite obsessions -- alcohol, going to strip
clubs, hunting and fishing, his own private religion, France, taking
road trips and our place in the natural world -- topics on which he
waxes poetic.</LD>
<TE>   Sentence by sentence, the writing is stunning, though the
disparate topics and details of his life story are not addressed in a
clear chronological or thematic way but appear somewhat randomly, as
if Harrison didn't wish to impose anything as constricting as order
on them. The result, unfortunately, is an uneven narrative that, even
with his dazzling metaphors and gorgeously layered sentences, adds up
to less than the sum of it parts.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison named the book as he did because he believes "a writer is
always a stowaway. Hidden, and well off to the side." Such, he tells
us, is the "designated and comfortable position for a writer." Yet
here he shows no shyness in taking center stage, going on about his
views on every little thing.</TE>
<TE>   True, a memoir must concern itself with the life lived, and
Harrison has much to offer in the many existences he's crammed into
one: poet, contractor, gourmand, fisherman, hunter, professor,
busboy, bohemian, elbow-rubber of the Hollywood elite, drug user,
drunkard, novelist, husband and father.</TE>
<TE>   In reporting those lives, however, he explores the intangible
concepts of life but maintains an arm's-length distance from the
details that have made up his existence.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Harrison writes of his propensity for melancholy and
refers to seeing the same therapist over many decades: "I have
clocked seven depressions in my life that might qualify as 'clinical'
beginning at the age of 14. There is the obvious conclusion that in
each case I was behaving in a way I shouldn't preceding the
depression, living an outward life my inward being couldn't accept,
reaching a level of raw perception that my current life couldn't
accommodate." How did those depressions manifest themselves and
affect the writing? In what way had he been behaving preceding them
that would allow him to draw such conclusions? The specifics he
offers to answer such questions are scant. Rather than creating vivid
scenes and opening the door for readers to enter, Harrison mostly
reports to us: I did this, then I did that, next I did the following
and this is what I think about it all. Writing of the natural world,
he's eloquent; detailing Hollywood roguishness, he's explicit; but on
the inner life of his own existence, he's vague. Even when the
actions of the story are commanding, the narrative remains an
intellectual exercise rather than a visceral evocation.</TE>
<TE>   The blinding of Harrison's left eye, for example, a traumatic
event that occurred when he was 7, is told in two concise sentences,
but fully 60 pages are devoted to his screenwriting bad-boy antics
and the name-brand stars he drank and partied with. (Though he refers
to the blinding and its consequences on and off throughout the
narrative, there's no greater depth to those references than in the
initial two sentences.)</TE>
<TE>   Were Harrison a less talented writer, less would be asked of him.
He can sweep a reader off her feet with his wordplay, even if he is
just describing the weather: "It did not so much begin to rain as the
air quite suddenly became full of water. Given the circumstances the
rain could not help but be a baptism."</TE>
<TE>   In writing about himself, Harrison has managed to keep his inner
self so "off to the side" that the main character remains ultimately
illusive. Characterizing objects of devotion he's culled from the
natural world, he writes, "I'm emotionally not far from the
broken-hearted little old lady fingering her rosary beads, though my
liturgical words are those of a rarer bird." Such sentences whet the
reader's appetite, create a longing for a more detailed map of the
writer's interior world. The hunger he inspires with his poetic
narration, though, is never fully sated.</TE>

<HD>Diversity coalition is now under fire</HD>
<DH>Group formed to press for more of a minority presence in
prime-time TV finds its credibility questioned, even from within its
own ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, National Latino Media Council Chairman
Esteban Torres, American Indians in Film &amp; Television President Sonny
Skyhawk and leaders of the Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
launched a campaign in early 2000 to pressure the four major networks
to increase cultural diversity in their prime-time lineups. They
announced at a press conference that executives at ABC, CBS, NBC and
Fox were signing agreements promising to increase minority
representation in front of and behind the camera.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition members claimed a major victory and vowed to keep
the heat on the networks with regular progress reports.</LD>
<LD>   But as the third anniversary of those agreements approaches, it is
the Multi-Ethnic Media Coalition that has come under fire, from
inside and outside its ranks.</LD>
<TE>   Two of the four networks -- NBC and Fox -- have bluntly challenged
the group's credibility, calling it misguided, unwieldy and
unfocused. And even Mfume, its most influential member, is
questioning the coalition's effectiveness with the networks,
suggesting that the group has lost direction. While he remains
supportive of the coalition, Mfume has remained relatively quiet in
the last few years since launching and spearheading the group.</TE>
<TE>   He and other industry observers maintain that the strength of the
coalition has been diluted by the addition of several other smaller
minority groups, as well as agendas not directly tied to the common
goal of increasing diversity on television of all minorities. Mfume
said he is seriously considering taking on more of a leadership role.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly believe in the concept of the coalition," Mfume said
in a recent interview. "There is definitely strength in numbers. But
the primary function of the coalition does not seem to be directed
toward civil rights. The original group of organizations has been
expanded. Things seem to have moved in another direction."</TE>
<TE>   Adding that he felt the networks were indeed making some progress
but were still moving too slowly in implementing change, Mfume said,
"Life is too short, and the need for change is too great. What's
happening with the coalition may be sending a more confusing message
to the networks when we really need to be clear in our mission. I'm
not saying that the NAACP is not supportive of the coalition, but we
really need to take it to another level."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the coalition, however, insist they remain as potent a
force as ever -- even without Mfume's involvement -- and that most of
the criticisms against them are in response to less-than-satisfactory
grades in "report cards" issued last July to the networks assessing
their progress on the agreements.</TE>
<TE>   In those reports, Fox overall received the highest grade -- a C.
ABC earned a C-, NBC received a D+ and CBS a D-. The NAACP did not
participate in the report cards.</TE>
<TE>   The furor over the coalition comes after a recent round of
discussions between the coalition and network heads. Mfume did not
attend those meetings, and network honchos say the coalition sorely
misses his leadership and vision.</TE>
<TE>   Fox executives blasted the coalition, saying that their talk with
group leaders last November was marred by frequent criticisms from
representatives of other organizations whom the coalition invited,
including a psychologist and members of a Mexican grocers'
association. They said attendees griped more about specific casting
choices of Latinos in front of the camera, as opposed to overall
diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox Broadcasting supports the goals laid out three years ago in
the memorandums of understanding," network executives said in a
statement. "Since then, we have been addressing and adhering to the
principles of those agreements. However, as we move forward, we have
to wonder about the coalition's direction, as it appears the groups'
various constituencies are more concerned with their individual
agendas than the greater good of the whole. Regardless, Fox will
continue to remain the leader in diversity both in front of and
behind the camera."</TE>
<TE>   Top NBC executives also confronted the coalition, saying the
leaders had been unfair in giving NBC a D+ while giving little credit
to what they called the significant measures to increase diversity.</TE>
<TE>   They called the low grade simplistic and misleading.</TE>
<TE>   CBS was less critical of the coalition. CBS diversity head Josie
Thomas said in a statement: "The ongoing dialogue with the coalition
has at times been challenging, but throughout this process, our
conversations -- some as recent as last week -- have been productive
concerning CBS' progress to date, as well as the challenges still
before us as we strive to meet our ambitious diversity goals."</TE>
<TE>   And ABC network President Alex Wallau praised his recent
discussions with the coalition: "Our relationship has been
productive, and our last meeting was the most successful we've had."</TE>
<TE>   The National Latino Media Council's Torres, who has taken over as
head of the coalition, acknowledged that other groups that are
"affiliates" of the core coalition groups have joined the meetings,
and that their members are "vocal."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the criticisms by the networks were more a result of
executives being "upset over the grading process. They haven't made
the grade, but it's unconscionable that they received poor grades.
That's why they say the coalition is a farce."</TE>
<TE>   Torres added, "They say they have made an effort to change, but
their progress is slow, and their data reporting is not up to par. We
sometimes can't get numbers from them."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition,
which is part of the National Latino Media Council, added, "The
networks can be as critical of us as they want to. The question is,
are they going to have to change? The answer is, you betcha."</TE>
<TE>   As for Mfume's concerns, Torres said, "I would like to see Kweisi
more in the fold of participating with us. His absence at these
meetings is not good. He's opted in some ways to act independent of
the coalition, and making his own decisions. We should all work
together, and work together to enhance our role."</TE>
<TE>   Mfume, who said the NAACP plans to issue its own progress report
on the agreements early next year, said he will talk to the coalition
leaders about taking more of an active role.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mfume: "There's just too much work to do, and too much time
has passed."</TE>

<HD>Where amateurs perfect their pitch</HD>
<DH>In an act of self-imposed 'community service,' two ICM
executives conduct free sessions to advise and mold would-be
screenwriters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As executive story editor for the huge talent agency ICM, Christopher
Lockhart reads 1,000 scripts a year for a stable of stars like Mel
Gibson and Denzel Washington. The agency's senior story analyst, Jack
d'Annibale, combs through material for A-listers who include Cameron
Diaz and Jodie Foster.</LD>
<LD>   But the duo has been spending Saturdays this fall with a bunch of
nobodies at the Beverly Hills Public Library, performing what they
describe as their own version of "community service," a phrase not
commonly uttered in the same sentence as the words "Hollywood
executive."</LD>
<LD>   The earnest scriptwriters come to the second-floor room of the
library from as far away as the Bay Area. They range in age from 25
to 80, and they show up wearing high heels or bare feet or Hawaiian
shirts.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday, the last in a series of sessions before the
workshops resume in the spring, participants had two minutes each to
pitch their script to a panel of four movie executives. (Lockhart and
D'Annibale admit they roped in the industry-weary panel by promising
a rare, unfiltered view of the world outside Tinseltown's bubble.)</TE>
<TE>   Soon the concepts were flying high.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'Stand by Me' meets 'Deliverance' in a Mexican whorehouse,"
offered Johnny Will Young.</TE>
<TE>   "Picture 'A League of Their Own' meets 'Yentl,' " said Steve
Mazzucchi.</TE>
<TE>   " 'The Omen' meets 'Frequency,' " proposed Raymond Boncato.</TE>
<TE>   " 'The Odd Couple' in a 'Fargo' setting," pitched Fay Hall.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Schindler's List' and 'Cider House Rules,' set in China in
1980," said Jin Young.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'Working Girl' meets 'Big,' but in reverse," suggested Carol
Schlanger.</TE>
<TE>   "This is 'Indiana Jones' for nerds," said Brian Diamond.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, there is a chance that these workshops will enable
Lockhart, 39, and D'Annibale, 30, to discover fresh talent in a
region teeming with an estimated 100,000 published and aspiring
screenwriters (many of them veterans of Hollywood's thriving seminar
scene).</TE>
<TE>   But Lockhart and D'Annibale insist their Saturday outreach is not
a cover for extracurricular recruiting; their boss, ICM head Jeff
Berg, didn't even know they had launched the workshop.</TE>
<TE>   And in fact, on this Saturday in November the gathering felt more
like an extension class than a hothouse for Hollywood's Next Big
Thing.</TE>
<TE>   The room was bare except for chairs, one table with two packages
of store-bought cookies and a digital camera on a tripod that
Lockhart's wife was using to shoot the pitches so he and D'Annibale
could review them before e-mailing each participant a critique.</TE>
<TE>   Some found it daunting to stand up in front of talent executives
who ordinarily wouldn't take their phone calls. Renee Cooper paused
before beginning her pitch. She handed one of the judges a slip of
paper with a name and a number written on it.</TE>
<TE>   "If this kills me," she said, gesturing to the stage, "please,
call my brother."</TE>
<TE>   Three finalists were chosen by the judges, and then the class
("American Idol"-style) voted for their favorite -- a 45-year-old
receptionist named Erica Clethen. Wearing an oversized cotton sweater
and faded jeans with a heart-shaped patch sewn onto the left knee,
she succinctly pitched a comedy about an ambitious studio musician
who fakes his own death so that he can achieve "posthumous" fame by
touring the country imitating himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are that I'm not supposed to meet people like Chris and
Jack," she said afterward, half giddy, half flustered. "I'm not so
sure the script is all that great, but I think it's a great story
idea. I've been practicing my Emmy Award speech since I was a kid --
Emmy, not Oscar. My heart is in TV."</TE>
<TE>   Clethen's reward: a story meeting over dinner in Beverly Hills
with D'Annibale and Lockhart. The downside, they joked, is that
they're going to Souplantation.</TE>
<TE>   On this Saturday, Lockhart and D'Annibale also raffled off two
prizes: an in-person story meeting and a phone call with D'Annibale.
(Don't scoff: In the world of Hollywood wannabes, a few minutes with
a story reader at ICM -- whether it's on the phone, at a party, in
the ATM line -- is a windfall of luck, promise and karma.)</TE>
<TE>   In between pitches and raffles, Lockhart, who is tall and lanky
with a New York lilt that sounds something like Regis Philbin,
enthusiastically offered advice.</TE>
<TE>   "Boil it down! Boil it down!" he urged.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't describe your script. Pitch it," said D'Annibale.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the two men lamented the high-priced workshops
that seem to promise a formula for success. (A writer himself,
D'Annibale has a manager and aspirations of writing his own great
screenplay.)</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who hold workshops and charge $500 and
don't know what they're talking about," Lockhart said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart and D'Annibale plan to hold a second free set of
workshops beginning in March, although they're currently rooting
around town for a new space since the Beverly Hills Public Library
may not be available to them. Lockhart promises he won't begin
charging admission, despite peer pressure to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   "Even my shrink asked me why we weren't charging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The workshop began last summer, when Lockhart posted a few notes
on Internet message boards for scriptwriters. He anticipated, at
most, two dozen or so writers. Nearly 50 showed up for the first
session on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   They placed one student script in the reference section of the
Beverly Hills Library, with the naive notion that this tidy group of
scriptwriters would read it in the library and take notes to prepare
for the next week's discussion and critique.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lockhart was contacted by Jacinthe Dessureault, a
stay-at-home mom in Fremont who saw his message on the Internet and
offered to post his scripts on her new Web site, www.twoadverbs.com.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to build a small community of writers. I wanted a
serious and professional community," Dessureault said. With the
scripts on Dessureault's Web site, writers from outside Beverly Hills
could study the next week's script from their home.</TE>
<TE>   The classes grew progressively larger, with one meeting early last
month drawing about 100 participants.</TE>
<TE>   Each meeting focused on a different student script. One week, for
example, they would pull apart a workshop participant's drama; the
next week it was a thriller on the chopping block; and the next, a
martial arts action story.</TE>
<TE>   While the potential payoff for Lockhart and D'Annibale's altruism
is discovering a diamond-in-the-rough prodigy, the only success story
to come out of their workshop so far signed with a competitor,
Creative Artists Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ferrari, a 38-year-old network censor at the WB, had begun
writing a dramatic screenplay in September, just as the workshop got
underway. In October, Lockhart offered to read the script, "The Saint
of Lorraine," about a suicidal priest who struggles to save his soul
and a bankrupt parish by leading a high school wrestling team to the
Ohio state championships.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Lockhart's who is a talent manager brokered an
introduction between Ferrari and a CAA agent two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrari, who has spent thousands of dollars on courses, sees no
irony in the fact that it was this free workshop that landed him a
deal. "You gotta have contact with the people who can do something,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing Ferrari's good fortune as latecomers drifted in for the
Saturday session, Lockhart told the class, "That was an unexpected
byproduct, but obviously a good one."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get him in the parking lot!" shouted back one workshop
member, Paul Douglas.</TE>

<HD>A heavenly message of Christmas hope</HD>
<DH>A larger space lets SCR add some razzle-dazzle to the
holiday favorite 'La Posada Magica.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its premiere in 1994, Octavio Solis' musical Christmas play,
"La Posada Magica," has been a popular perennial on South Coast
Repertory's Second Stage in the newly expanded Folino Theatre Center.
This year, for the first time, "Magica" is being done on the Julianne
Argyros Stage, SCR's new theater, a blissfully commodious space in
which the play takes on new depth and scope.</LD>
<LD>   On the boards of the cozy but cramped Second Stage, the show was
sweetly engaging. Now, there's more razzle-dazzle in the mix, thanks
largely to the technical innovations of Christopher Acebo's ingenious
new scenic design. In a particularly elegant moment, hidden doors
behind an upstage scrim open in succession to reveal a heavenly
emissary who delivers a buoyant message of Christmas hope -- just one
of the striking touches in this newly expanded production.</LD>
<LD>   Costume designer Shigeru Yaji, lighting designer Lonnie Alcaraz
and choreographer Linda Kostalik, who have been on board the
production for years, ingeniously augment their efforts to fit the
confines of the new facility. Yaji's costumes, which range from the
sedate to the no-holds-barred glitzy, are particularly vivid.</LD>
<TE>   In her third season as director, Diane Rodriguez keeps the action
as simple as Solis' story -- a plus, if you're imbued with the spirit
of the season and looking for a way to reconnect with the meaning of
Christmas. However, those interested in more sophisticated holiday
fare might find the proceedings overly broad and episodic.</TE>
<TE>   The show was inspired by the Latin American tradition of Las
Posadas -- literally, "the lodgings" -- community processions
reenacting Mary and Joseph's search for shelter on the eve of
Christ's birth. Solis' alternately cheeky and reverent version
revolves around the character of Gracie (Tiffany Ellen Solano), an
embittered young girl so devastated by the recent death of her infant
brother that she deliberately sabotages the ceremony. Naturally, the
magic of Christmas ultimately affirms Gracie's faith.</TE>
<TE>   It's Solano's fourth season in the role. Many in the cast are
veterans of past productions. In fact, Crissy Guerrero, who plays
Mariluz in the present production, appeared as Gracie from 1995-98.
The cast shows the ease of long association, and a family atmosphere
prevails on stage and off. Marcos Loya's original music, performed to
the sprightly on-stage accompaniment of Loya and Lorenzo Martinez,
remains a highlight of this animated and unabashedly sentimental
entertainment.</TE>

<KH>THE BIG PICTURE PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</KH>
<HD>The monster in 'Max'</HD>
<DH>A new film about Hitler's days as a painter provokes awe
and anger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When "Max" debuted at the Toronto Film Festival this fall, many of us
left the screening on a celluloid high, as if we'd been given a "Pulp
Fiction"-sized shot of intellectual adrenaline. As People magazine
critic Leah Rozen, who was also at the screening, put it: "It was so
daring and theoretically assured that it was all I wanted to talk
about for the rest of the night. How many movies can you say that
about these days?"</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, a sizable contingent of people stormed out
before the film was finished, grumbling epithets or glaring at their
friends who had the nerve to stay. The film even provoked something
of a family feud: My wife volunteered to make a home-cooked meal for
her fellow Dutchman, "Max" writer-director Menno Meyjes, so I could
interview him during a recent trip to L.A. But after watching the
movie the night before Meyjes came to dinner, she icily announced,
"You can have him to dinner, but you can't stop me from poisoning
him."</LD>
<TE>   Let's just say "Max" rouses strong reaction. People regularly
complain that Hollywood movies are unbearably bland and escapist, but
when they see "Max" (which opens here Dec. 27), they may say, "Wait a
minute, we didn't want something that provocative!" Set in
war-shattered 1918 Germany, the film chronicles an unlikely
friendship between two World War I veterans, an urbane Jewish art
dealer and a struggling young painter named ... Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Starring John Cusack as the fictional Max Rothman and Australian
actor Noah Taylor as Hitler, the film dares to portray Hitler as a
complex character -- part crafty, self-absorbed artist, part
dangerously self-pitying con man. Meyjes, a 48-year-old first-time
director best known for adapting "The Color Purple" for Steven
Spielberg, says he was inspired by a quote from Hitler's architect,
Albert Speer, who wrote, "If you want to understand Hitler, you have
to understand he was an artist first."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers have always been drawn to artists, whose audacious,
often self-destructive lives are inherently filled with drama. Meyjes
can still remember, as a boy, seeing Salvador Dali strutting around
in a gold lame suit at the opening of an art show in Rotterdam,
"looking like Elvis, only smarter." This fall alone we've already
seen movies about pop artists as divergent as Frida Kahlo and Eminem
as well as "Adaptation," the self-referential saga of screenwriter
Charlie Kaufman's attempts to re-imagine another artist's work. Still
to come are "The Pianist," the story of a real-life Jewish musician
in Nazi-era Poland, and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," an account
of "Gong Show" creator Chuck Barris' efforts to reinvent himself as a
CIA hit man.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Chuck Barris is one thing, Hitler another. Hollywood
has a long-standing love affair with serial killers, but Hitler is
one murderer who remains beyond the pale. Fifty years ago Charlie
Chaplin slyly lampooned the Fuhrer in "The Great Dictator," even
though virtually every Jewish studio mogul in Hollywood pleaded with
him not to make the movie. Ernst Lubitsch made fun of Hitler in his
1942 film, "To Be or Not to Be," which cast Jack Benny and Carole
Lombard as a Polish actor-and-actress team who disguise themselves as
Nazis to strike a blow against the evil Third Reich. And, of course,
Mel Brooks had great merriment having actors audition to play Hitler
for the intentionally bad musical "Springtime for Hitler" in the
original 1968 version of "The Producers."</TE>
<TE>   But seeing Hitler as a figure of fun is one thing; seeing him
portrayed on stage or screen as a dramatic character is something
else. George Steiner got glowing reviews for his Hitler novel, "The
Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.," but when it was transformed into a
London stage production in 1982, the theater was surrounded by
protesters. Even Steiner acknowledged that the first time he heard an
actor speaking in Hitler's voice, "it scared the hell out of me."</TE>
<TE>   The act of acting out Hitler remains a potent taboo. No one
complained when British historian Ian Kershaw published his epic
study of the dictator, "Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris." But when CBS
announced plans to air a four-hour miniseries based on the book next
year, many people were appalled, fearing that focusing on a young
Hitler before he murdered 6 million Jews would unwittingly turn him
into a sympathetic character.</TE>
<TE>   "Why the need or desire to make this monster human?" complained
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League. "Why
trivialize the judgment of history by focusing on his childhood and
adolescence?" Historians Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, who
protested that series, have also attacked "Max," saying that by
shifting the focus to Hitler as a rejected artist, "now the story is
about the personal pain Hitler endured and not the murder he
unleashed across the continent."</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect, these critics should see what they're
criticizing before they get into a lather. "Max" is a movie about
ideas and their consequences. The film's dramatic conceit is rooted
in historical context; some scholars believe that if Hitler had been
admitted to art school in Vienna, where he was rejected twice, he
would not have embarked on the Final Solution. And while Meyjes' film
makes a monster human, it's in the service of illuminating an enigma:
By making him human we have an opportunity to understand what turned
him into a monster, something Hitler scholars have wrestled with for
ages.</TE>
<TE>   "If you feel, 'How dare we make Hitler a human being?' I'd say,
'How dare we not?' " argues Cusack, who's a producer on the film. "It
would be nice to think that our monsters came down from a pink cloud
and disappeared into fiery dust. But Hitler is real and it's not
responsible to portray history or complicated ideas in a simple
black-and-white perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Crediting Cusack</TE>
<TE>   Meyjes is still amazed that "Max," which is being distributed in
the U.S. by Lions Gate, even got made. He gives the lion's share of
credit to Cusack, who did the film for a fraction of his regular fee
and, when the initial funding fell through, told his agents that he
wouldn't take another job until they helped find new financing for
the film. "I think some of our distributors have been talked out of
suicide attempts," says Meyjes. "Even I sometimes think, 'What have I
done?' "</TE>
<TE>   The movie's central theme is rooted in Meyjes' lifelong passion
for art. He left Holland as a teenager in the 1970s, with his parents
expecting that he would join the Dutch foreign service. Instead
Meyjes went to the San Francisco Art Institute, where he learned
English by copying Hemingway stories. His father took a dim view of
his artistic aspirations, cutting him off financially after informing
him that "you have lunch with artists, you don't become one."</TE>
<TE>   Meyjes has always been fascinated by the artistic personality,
which led to his intertwining of the two main characters in "Max,"
men both under the spell, in very different ways, of modern art. It's
unnerving to watch Max Rothman's reaction when he first meets Hitler,
whom he sees not as a genocidal madman but an embittered loser who's
all too similar to the other angry, self-absorbed young artists he's
met.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most horrible thing," says Meyjes (who, if you're
interested, is Protestant). "Max likes Hitler! They're kindred
spirits, both scarred by this horrible war that's just ended. Max
feels he understands him. He's trying to bring him around to the
light: Come with me, get out of politics, go meet a girl and get a
drunk and fall in love with life."</TE>
<TE>   What disturbs people about "Max" is that with Hitler portrayed as
an aspiring artist, moviegoers could view him as an innocent, as
someone whose hideous sins are somehow understandable. But for Meyjes
to see Hitler as an artist is no more of a stretch than for Nazi
hunter Simon Wiesenthal to blame Hitler's rabid anti-Semitism on his
being infected with syphilis by a Jewish prostitute. They are both
explanations. Hitler often defined himself as an artist, in both the
deliberately artistic design of his Nuremberg rallies as well as the
totalitarian architectural visions he collaborated on with Speer. As
Ron Rosenbaum writes in "Explaining Hitler," many Hitler watchers,
beginning with Thomas Mann, believe that "the heart of Hitler's
appeal to the German people was his presentation of himself as a
myth-making artist rather than as a politician."</TE>
<TE>   For me, the most poignant part of the film is Meyjes' portrait of
Rothman, a man who despite having lost an arm in the war, effectively
wrecking his own artistic ambitions, remains intoxicated by the
possibilities of modern art. "I was fascinated by Max's casual
compassion -- he's the classic liberal," says Meyjes. "He knows
Hitler is dangerous, but he thinks: If he only had some of my
advantages, surely he wouldn't feel so bitter and angry.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this film bothers some people because they think of art
as an exalted occupation, so the notion that Hitler could ever be an
artist gives him too much credit. But in this movie, Hitler is full
of emotional cowardice and envy and relentless self-pity. They are
small sins, but it's the small sins that add up."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Max is the true innocent. He keeps trying to
interpret what Hitler says through the context of art, imagining him
as a mad, reverse futurist. "But how can you blame him?" says Meyjes.
"Who in 1918 would look some at some guy who's sleeping in doorways
and ever believe that someday he's going to set the world on fire?"</TE>
<TE>   "Max" shows us more of the ugly young Fuhrer than many moviegoers
will be comfortable watching, but it's the films that make us the
most uncomfortable that often stay with us the longest.</TE>

<HD>Ensemble revives an a cappella tradition</HD>
<DH>Quintet spreads holiday joy in a colorful concert that
recalls the Mel-Tones and Manhattan Transfer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mention a cappella vocal groups, and the first thing that probably
comes to mind is the doo-wop ensembles of the '50s and beyond. But
jazz has a long tradition of vocalized harmonies as well. Sometimes
with, sometimes without instrumental accompaniment, it reaches from
the Boswell Sisters and the Mills Brothers through Mel Torme's
Mel-Tones; Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross; and the Manhattan Transfer.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, it's not a tradition that gets aired in public with
much frequency these days, so it's always a pleasure when the holiday
season rolls around and Inner Voices presents its annual Christmas a
cappella show at the Jazz Bakery. On Sunday afternoon, the superb
five-voice ensemble -- Morgan Ames, Shelby Flint, Melissa Mackay,
Julie Delgado and Michael Mishaw -- offered a lengthy program of
unusual holiday material, climaxed by a sing-along segment of
caroling with the near-capacity audience.</LD>
<LD>   With resumes that encompass virtually every area of the music
business, the members of Inner Voices are capable of singing almost
anything placed in front them, and the program took the quintet
through a colorfully eclectic array of music.</LD>
<TE>   Among the many high points: the lovely harmonies on "Jinglette
Bells" and Oliver Nelson's "A Child Is Born," Mackay's sweetly
poignant rendering of "I'll Be Home for Christmas," the soulful
singing of Flint and guest Jim Gilstrap on Charles Brown's "Please
Come Home for Christmas" and the witty sendup (complete with Don Ho
impression by Mishaw) of "A Hawaiian Christmas Song."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tortoise Network (TTN) recently caught up with Gopherus
agassizii, California's state reptile. Catching up wasn't hard since
this desert tortoise only moves about 20 feet per minute. Read
carefully as the TTN reporter shares his exclusive interview with
you.</LD>
<LD>   TTN: Gopherus is a very unusual first name. How did you come by
it?</LD>
<LD>   Gopherus: It's actually my genus; it means "burrowing." I got that
name because I have claws for digging and flattened forelimbs for
shoveling dirt. One of my greatest talents is burrowing to escape
temperature extremes.</LD>
<TE>   TTN: What's the difference between a tortoise and a turtle?</TE>
<TE>   Gopherus: A tortoise is a turtle that strictly lives on land.</TE>
<TE>   TTN: Where is your home?</TE>
<TE>   Gopherus: Desert areas in the western parts of North America. I
love roaming the dry plains and rocky hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   TTN: How do you survive in the desert?</TE>
<TE>   Gopherus: I avoid very hot and very cold temperatures by staying
underground. I get most of my water by eating succulent desert
plants. When I drink after a rain, I can store up to a cup of water
in my bladder.</TE>
<TE>   TTN: Where can your fans find out more about you?</TE>
<TE>   Gopherus: I will be at the Palm Springs Desert Museum's Desert
Tortoise exhibition through Oct. 12. Please come down and meet me.

<DH>Best picture award from New York Film Critics Circle adds
to '50s melodrama's accolades.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Far From Heaven," Todd Haynes' lush '50s-style melodrama, was voted
best picture of the year Monday by the New York Film Critics Circle,
which also handed the film four other awards.</LD>
<LD>   Haynes was honored as best director, Dennis Quaid and Patricia
Clarkson won best supporting actor and actress, and Edward Lachman
was chosen best cinematographer.</LD>
<LD>   "Heaven," which has taken several awards in the past two weeks,
joins "About Schmidt" and "Adaptation" as early award season
favorites. Among actors, Julianne Moore, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack
Nicholson and Chris Cooper have emerged as early front-runners.
Charlie Kaufman (and his imaginary brother Donald) dominate
screenwriting awards so far. The race will heat up considerably
Thursday when Golden Globe nominations are announced in Beverly
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   The New York critics voted Day-Lewis best actor for his role as a
brutal gang leader in Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York."
Day-Lewis shared best actor honors Saturday with Jack Nicholson
("About Schmidt") when the L.A. Film Critics Assn. announced their
2002 favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Day-Lewis has been popular with the 37-member New York group that
consists of critics from daily and weekly newspapers and magazines.
He previously won best supporting actor from the New York critics for
1986's "My Beautiful Laundrette" and best actor for 1989's "My Left
Foot."</TE>
<TE>   In a somewhat surprising move, Diane Lane was chosen as best
actress for her role as a wife and mother who embarks on an illicit
affair with a Frenchman in Adrian Lyne's erotic drama "Unfaithful."
Both the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures and the L.A.
Film Critics picked Moore for "Far From Heaven" and "The Hours" in
this category.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman (who is actually a figment of
Charlie's imagination but who nevertheless officially shares credit)
won for best screenplay for the dark comedy "Adaptation." Kaufman
previously was named the Board of Review's screenwriter of the year
for a trio of films that included "Adaptation." Alfonso Cuaron's sexy
Mexican coming-of-age comedy "Y tu Mama Tambien," took best foreign
film honors.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the L.A. critics' group picked "About Schmidt" as
best film of 2002; "Far From Heaven" was its runner-up. The Board of
Review chose "The Hours" as its best.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." was chosen by the New
York critics' group as best of the year; Steven Soderbergh's
"Traffic" was the best film winner in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Other honorees of the New York group included:</TE>
<TE>   Best first film: "Roger Dodger."</TE>
<TE>   Best animated film: Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away."</TE>
<TE>   Best nonfiction film: "Standing in the Shadows of Motown."</TE>
<TE>   Special award: restoration of "Metropolis" by Kino International.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Society of Film Critics on Sunday selected as its best
film Roman Polanski's Holocaust drama "The Pianist," also honoring
the director and Adrien Brody as best actor.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston group's best-actress choice was Maggie Gyllenhaal for
"Secretary." Supporting actor was Alan Arkin for "Thirteen
Conversations About One Thing," and Toni Collette was the supporting
actress choice for "About a Boy." The Kaufmans won Boston's
screenplay award for "Adaptation."</TE>

<HD>ABC's 'Dinotopia' is a thing of the past</HD>
<DH>The dinosaur fantasy series is the last of the network's
four new dramas to be canceled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC, in the throes of trying to rebuild its prime-time lineup, has
completed a dubious sweep of its fledgling dramatic series by
canceling the dinosaur fantasy "Dinotopia" -- meaning all four of
this fall's new dramas became extinct before 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "Dinotopia," which didn't premiere until Thanksgiving, will have
its final telecast Dec. 26, after drawing dismal ratings (about 5
million viewers a week, based on Nielsen estimates) opposite
"Friends" on NBC and "Survivor" on CBS. ABC, set to air several
college football bowl games in prime time New Year's week, is
expected to run movies to fill the 8 to 10 p.m. window Thursdays as a
stop-gap measure starting in January.</LD>
<LD>   With its cancellation, "Dinotopia" -- which made its debut with a
splashy miniseries last spring -- joins ABC's "Push, Nevada," "That
Was Then" and "MDs" on the new series scrap heap.</LD>
<TE>   ABC has enjoyed some success this season with its comedies,
ordering additional episodes of the new Tuesday sitcoms "8 Simple
Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter," "Life With Bonnie" and "Less
Than Perfect." A second edition of "The Bachelor" also attracted
sizable audiences, helping the network finish second among the young
adults sought by advertisers for the November rating sweeps. ABC
finished third overall, behind CBS and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the failure of its dramatic roster has left ABC with a
number of holes to plug in addition to the seasonal end of "Monday
Night Football." As a result, much will be riding on a second wave of
new programs in January, including the action-adventure "Veritas" and
"Miracles," about investigators of unexplained phenomena, which will
bookend a relocated "The Practice" on Mondays beginning Jan. 27.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a version of "Dragnet," starring "Married ... With
Children's" Ed O'Neill, replaces "The Practice" Sundays. The network
hopes to use the vast audience expected for Super Bowl XXXVII to
promote the lineup changes.</TE>
<TE>   ABC isn't the only network with gaps to fill. Twelve of 31 new
programs on six networks have now been canceled, including the Fox
dramas "Girls Club" and "Firefly," as well as CBS' "Robbery Homicide
Division" and comedy "Bram and Alice."</TE>

<HD>Playboy's new digs: Not a smoking jacket in sight</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the difference between a Kia and a Mercedes, between veal
Milanese and a double cheeseburger, between a posh apartment building
and a rivet and hardware supplier. This summer, Playboy Enterprises
abandoned its longtime Beverly Hills offices for space in the new
Media Center in Glassell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Now, instead of the leafy avenues of Maple and Alden drives and
Beverly Boulevard, staffers are facing down a stretch of San Fernando
Road that runs along railroad tracks in the shadow of three freeways
and bristles with razor wire and those monster balloon creatures that
mark auto auctions. There is a very nice Ralphs just beside the Media
Center and the L.A. Bureau of Sanitation is a fellow lessee, so no
doubt the holiday party scene will be a blast, but taken together,
it's not exactly a silk-smoking-jacket type of place.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't imagine we'll be seeing much of Hef," says Steven
Randall, the West Coast editor for Playboy magazine. For a few months
it seemed the magazine and a few other small departments would be
allowed to remain 90210 -- when the company moved out of its longtime
digs on Beverly, a small office remained on Wilshire Boulevard -- but
now, come January, Randall says, they're all schlepping it over to
San Fernando Road.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm trying to keep an open mind," Randall says, "although I
haven't figured out how I'm going to do the lunch thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Boulevard address, a sleek rose-colored building with
a Mercedes dealership on the ground floor, was steps away from the
heart of Beverly Hills and had the perennially acclaimed restaurant
Maple Drive in its backyard. Close by the pale, squat complex on
Media Drive, there are a Kia dealership, several great burger stands
and a Mickey Ds. None of which is reassuring to Randall, who is still
trying to figure out how you even get there from the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only been there once," Randall says. "I'm choosing to stay
in denial."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the move was not about the magazine, at least not
directly. The publication's main offices, along with parent company
Playboy Enterprises, are in Chicago. Although the Playboy mansion in
Holmby Hills has made the brand seem like a local enterprise, Randall
is the only full-time magazine staff member in Los Angeles. It's been
many years since the "gentlemen's magazine" that Hugh Hefner founded
almost 50 years ago was the biggest entry on the corporate
spreadsheet.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, as attempts to mark territory on cable and the
Internet met with limited success or outright failure, Playboy
Enterprises has been steadily losing money. Likewise, the magazine's
circulation is almost half of what it was during its heyday in the
mid-'70s. Although with a readership of 3.1 million, it remains the
biggest "gentlemen's" magazine on the market; upstart Maxim, at 2.5
million, is not far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Chief Executive Christie Hefner decided it was time to
shake off the "gentleman" yoke and go hard-core. Since then the
company has acquired six cable stations, which run sexually explicit
features and pay-per-view porn.</TE>
<TE>   Making pornographic movies requires a bit of space, hence the move
to Glassell Park, where rents are low and a new production and
soundstage facility is nearby. While it isn't technically the San
Fernando Valley, ground zero for the pornographic film industry, it's
certainly Valley-adjacent.</TE>
<TE>   There is something symbolic in Playboy employees having to trade
lunch at the napkin-snapping Maple Drive for counter condiments at
Patras hamburger stand.</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception, Playboy magazine has billed itself as
something other than pornography; important writers appeared in its
pages and everyone who subscribed famously did so "for the articles."</TE>
<TE>   For a few years, Hefner was a social revolutionary, although with
hindsight it's difficult to argue that the idea of a male living
almost solely for pleasure was an evolutionary advancement; if he
didn't invent soft porn, he did give it new respectability. Playboy
moved those pictures of naked ladies from beneath the mattresses and
the toolbox and onto the living room coffee table. Far from embodying
the syphilitic image of a pornographer, Hefner became an icon of the
sexual revolution, his mansion a soundstage for celebrity bacchanals
and quasi-political gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on the pornography industry, by feminists and religious
leaders alike, rarely were aimed at Playboy, which mainstream America
seemed content to keep in a niche of its own. A gentleman's magazine.
Even as his business floundered in recent years, Hefner has remained
a touchstone of cultural analysis; the media cannot get enough of the
pajamaed septuagenarian surrounded by young women in various stages
of cosmetic surgery.</TE>
<TE>   So what will happen to the Playboy image now that it's less about
sexual sophistication and more about coldblooded fornication?</TE>
<TE>   The bunny profile has meant less and less over the years as the
clubs across the country closed, as the magazine lost much of its
literary pedigree and the sexual revolution moved into new territory.</TE>
<TE>   For all his photo-ops, Hefner is something of a quaint figure, a
piece of cultural kitsch with his arm candy and silk pajamas. And
he's kept his distance from the new image, figuratively and
literally. No, the staffers stopping in at Ralphs to get a decent cup
of coffee probably won't see a lot of Hef. Because if it's hard to
get to San Fernando Road from Beverly Hills, it's virtually
impossible to get there from Holmby Hills.</TE>

<CX>   Playboy -- The L.A. Centric column in Tuesday's Calendar misspelled
Stephen Randall's first name as Steven. The column also misidentified
him as the West Coast editor of Playboy magazine; Randall's title is

<HD>A 'Medea' for the ages</HD>
<DH>Actress Fiona Shaw brings modern power to the play at a
time when the Greek tragedies appear to be increasingly relevant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles McNulty</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For an actress with dreams of a Tony award, a tragedy from 431 BC
might just provide the winning role she's been looking for.</LD>
<LD>   "Medea," Euripides' proto-feminist potboiler about a woman who
murders her children to exact revenge on her faithless husband, has
landed theater's top acting honor for three actresses: Judith
Anderson (1948), Zoe Caldwell (1982) and Diana Rigg (1994). And if
early indications hold true, a fourth name may soon be added.</LD>
<LD>   Reprising her internationally acclaimed portrayal of Medea on
Broadway, Irish actress Fiona Shaw has gone from success to success
playing the disturbing heroine of Euripides' masterpiece. Curiously,
her performance comes during a fall season when numerous other Greek
plays have appeared on New York stages, including Sophocles'
"Antigone" and a trio of rarely revived works by Euripides.</LD>
<TE>   The classics, if you'll pardon the paradox, have apparently come
roaring back into vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Shaw's longtime collaborator, Deborah Warner, the
Abbey Theatre's "Medea" made its New York debut at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in October after receiving glowing notices in Dublin
and London. The plan was for a U.S. tour that included Boston,
Washington, Ann Arbor, Mich., and Berkeley, followed by a two-week
engagement at the Theatre National de Chaillot in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   But after the raves were confirmed by the notoriously hard-boiled
New York drama critics, the producers decided to reschedule the Paris
dates in favor of a limited New York run of 84 performances at the
Brooks Atkinson Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the play "the most essential ticket of this theater
season," Ben Brantley of the New York Times lavishly praised Shaw and
Warner for creating "one of the most human Medeas ever." The
sentiment was shared by Charles Isherwood of Variety, who wrote,
"Fiona Shaw's towering performance in the title role makes it clear
that Medea is a contemporary human being, too, a painfully real if
rarely reasonable woman."</TE>
<TE>   From the 21st century costumes and manners to Kenneth McLeish's
idiomatically relaxed translation, the production narrows the gap
between the ancient world and the present. Even the setting is
super-modern, a glass-enclosed home with a wading pool that could
pass for a wing of a Beverly Hills health club.</TE>
<TE>   Risky investment</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinarily accessible to today's audience and to
younger people in general," says producer Roger Berlind, who was
drawn into the admittedly risky investment by the fresh energy of the
staging and cast.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a figure-hugging summer dress, light cardigan and dark
sunglasses, Shaw's Medea is anything but a relic from the annals of
Greek mythology. A foreigner from the East eyed suspiciously by her
Greek neighbors, she treats her public exchanges -- be they with
political dignitaries, her shameless husband, Jason, or a chorus of
Corinthian housewives -- as though they were carefully calibrated
press conferences.</TE>
<TE>   If Jason -- played by the gleaming Jonathan Cake as a
self-absorbed GQ cover boy -- thinks he can dump her into a life of
exile after she's committed foul crimes (including butchering her
brother) to make his reputation, well, he's got another think coming.
Can he really believe she's going to passively accept his
opportunistic marriage to the Princess of Corinth? Not for nothing is
Medea an expert in poisons.</TE>
<TE>   The crisp characterizations of this production are in keeping with
the way the playwright himself re-imagined his culture's most famous
myths. Euripides' down-and-dirty approach, more realistic than that
of Aeschylus or Sophocles, is perhaps what makes his work so
peculiarly akin to our modern sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   But what gives his plays their uncanny immediacy is the way they
combine surprising familiarity with a timeless honesty that has the
effect of a cold-water splash in the face.</TE>
<TE>   With its long speeches powerfully articulating the tribulations of
womanhood, "Medea" has been often heralded as a pre-feminist revenge
play. Warner and Shaw's demythologizing treatment focuses attention
on the ceaseless battle between men and women, invoking at times the
brawling spouses of August Strindberg and Edward Albee. To drive home
the point that there's no easy escape from the circuit of marital
suffering, the production denies Medea her magic chariot at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "As there are no stage directions in Greek drama, there's no
reason to take literally the chariot at the end," Warner says in
defense of her nontraditional interpretation. "But more important, it
would be unseemly to have Medea fleeing the bloody scene triumphant."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the desolate, everybody-loses ending underscores the
way dehumanizing treatment can provoke dehumanizing acts of violence
in turn, a quintessential Euripidean theme all too evident in our
daily headlines of suicide bombings and military reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   Medea is a victim who becomes an elemental force of vengeance, a
woman who forfeits her humanity for vindictive satisfactions. Writing
in a war-torn age, Euripides knew that the world couldn't be neatly
divided between the innocent and the guilty and that hidden within
unjust suffering is a powder keg of potentially catastrophic
consequences ready to explode if not properly redressed.</TE>
<TE>   "What's so fascinating is the way Euripides brings us so close
into the interior of Medea's experience," says Warner. "While we
can't approve her shocking acts, we understand the journey that
brought her there."</TE>
<TE>   There is no better sign of a playwright's continued ability to
speak to an audience than revivals of his work. Last month in New
York, three hip downtown theaters were showcasing plays by Euripides:
"The Phoenician Women" at the Ohio, "Iphigenia in Tauris" at HERE and
an adaptation of "The Bacchae" called "Bacchus" at the Metropolitan
Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Challenging audiences</TE>
<TE>   Produced on shoestring budgets by emerging theater artists, the
productions were testaments to the power of a writer unafraid to
challenge an audience with story lines that critique as well as
entertain.</TE>
<TE>   Whether laying bare the necessity of religious irrationality
within our smugly rational society ("Bacchus") or the spiraling havoc
of familial revenge ("The Phoenician Women"), the plays probe deeply
into the often violent mystery of humanity's inner workings. Even a
relatively larkish play like "Iphigenia in Tauris" conjures a
poignant fantasy in which the sacrifices of war are, at least for
Orestes and his supposedly slain sister Iphigenia, miraculously
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Though revivals of Euripides are more common in smaller venues,
Greek drama has a successful track record on Broadway. The Almeida
Theatre Company's 1994 "Medea" not only nabbed a Tony for its star
but did such solid business during its 12-week run that one of the
producers placed an ad in Theater Week thanking Rigg for "making the
oldest play on Broadway the hottest ticket in town."</TE>
<TE>   David Leveaux's 1999 Broadway production of Sophocles "Electra,"
starring Zoe Wanamaker, not only was nominated for multiple Tonys but
also was extended for a total run of 116 performances.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there's still a hunger for substantive drama. At a time
of terror alerts and talk of war, an exclusive diet of insular
domestic comedies just isn't satisfying. If the New York fall season
is any gauge, reflection may be gaining on mindless laughter as a
box-office draw.</TE>
<TE>   Even Al Pacino has caught the Greek bug. He's been working at the
Actors Studio in New York with director Estelle Parsons and costar
Dianne Wiest on "Oedipus Rex," which he plans to perform in repertory
with Oscar Wilde's "Salome" at the Daryl Roth Theater once the
current show, "De La Guarda," completes its run.</TE>
<TE>   "We started on this project two years when no one was doing the
classics," says Parsons. "Now they're all the rage. But the moment is
obviously well suited when you consider what's going on in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   More evidence of the trend's timeliness can be found in a
critically celebrated production of Sophocles' "Antigone," which was
brought to Manhattan's City Center for a brief run in October by the
National Theater of Greece. Performed in modern Greek with English
supertitles, the play, through its rubble-strewn staging, offered
startling images of a civilization morally shattered by civil strife
and bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   The story of a woman sentenced to death for burying the corpse of
her political outlaw brother, "Antigone" examines whether public
security should ever be allowed to trump private rights. Given such
richly talented actors as Lydia Koniordou and Sophoclis Peppas, who
played the at-loggerheads Antigone and Creon, there was no need to
point out the current pertinence of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Like Euripides' "Medea," Sophocles' tragedy contains a wisdom that
is untethered to current events. Meaning resides in action and
character, not in topicality. So, the undying truth of these plays
lends itself to any age with the courage to travel deeper into its
own soul. "I would go so far as to say that the Greeks may be our
only salvation," says Warner. "Where else can you explore in relative
safety our moral and philosophical extremes?"</TE>

<HD>'Plaid Tidings' is a holiday delight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Considerable festive energy bedecks "Plaid Tidings" in its limited
engagement at the Pasadena Playhouse. Writer-director Stuart Ross'
updated holiday edition of his phenomenally successful "Forever
Plaid" revue is enormously entertaining feel-good fare.</LD>
<LD>   The essential, glorified theme-park premise is unchanged: four
prematurely deceased Eisenhower-era crooners achieving their dream
gig for one performance only. "Plaid Tidings," however, significantly
expands upon the original model, its self-contained ethos of sunny
homage augmented with flashes of pathos and larger point.</LD>
<LD>   It opens in Latin, which baffles ringleader Frankie (John-Michael
Flate), clownish Sparky (Larry Raben), timid Jinx (Paul Binotto) and
worrywart Smudge (David Engel), as does the question of what elicited
their return. Their immediate response is a spine-tingling reading of
"Stranger in Paradise" that sets forth the evening's tone of
full-throated Four Freshmen frenzy.</LD>
<TE>   This quest for harmonic convergence shapes Act 1. Act 2 climaxes
with the holiday television special that might have transpired, had
fate and a busload of Catholic schoolgirls not intervened.</TE>
<TE>   Ross' staging is assured, the choreography richly detailed and the
extended sequences little tours de force. Highlights include a shrewd
Plaid back story recap to "Holiday for Strings," their live backup
vocals for a video-projected Perry Como and an uproarious history of
the Ed Sullivan Show crammed into three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The designs of Neil Peter Jampolis (set), Debra Stein (costumes),
Jane Reisman (lighting) and Frederick W. Boot (sound) merge sendup
and sentiment to glossy effect. Musical director David Snyder is
superb at the keyboard, and John Smith supplies bass underpinnings.</TE>
<TE>   Most critically, the inspired quartet invests James Raitt, Brad
Ellis and Raymond Berg's vivid arrangements with celestial vocal
cohesion and exceptional interactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Raben's lilting baritone and ace timing form an invaluable pivot
point. Engel is as ever prodigiously talented, delivering a
heart-piercing "Merry Christmas" and stopping the show cold with his
Bill Irwin-meets-Gene Kelly version of "Let It Snow."</TE>
<TE>   Flate's winning, amber-voiced Frankie is supreme in his Act 2
expose of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." Binotto's Jinx combines a
straight-faced approach recalling the young Eddie Bracken with a
soaring tenor of classical potential.</TE>
<TE>   In a season abounding with quality holiday offerings, "Plaid
Tidings" perches high atop the theatrical tree, and faithful friends
of the franchise should secure reservations now.</TE>

<DH>A party in honor of collector and Andy Warhol pal Richard
Weisman and his new book, 'From Picasso to Pop,' attracts a who's who
of the '80s art world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A young Muhammad Ali stared over the shoulder of the evening's guest
of honor, art collector Richard Weisman, his come-and-get-me stance
amped by Andy Warhol and warmly lit inside Cheryl Tiegs' high-beamed,
woody living room. Cans of Campbell's soup were positioned throughout
the house in homage to the artist.</LD>
<LD>   A white-bearded Ed Ruscha lumbered around in a long black coat
carrying a giant red martini, resembling a slim, smartly dressed
Santa Claus. Tiegs' ex-husband Tony Peck (No. 3) was there, seemingly
enthralled by Vidal Sassoon. Another of Tiegs' ex-husbands, Rod
Stryker (No. 4), was definitely not in attendance, having filed suit
against her earlier that day in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming
she failed to turn over $20,000 their twin 2-year-old sons earned for
posing with her on the cover of More magazine.</LD>
<LD>   At the Wednesday night party, however, Tiegs' most pressing
concern was the valet. Poor planning meant everyone was forced to
hike down the steep driveway to her house. Jackie Collins and Lorna
Luft swept in out of breath. "I said to Jackie, 'Oh shut up and take
your shoes off!' " Luft told Tiegs. George Schlatter, best known for
producing the bi-annual Carousel of Hope Ball and the classic
sketch-comedy show, "Laugh-In," complained comically: "I sent out for
some ropes and a Sherpa! We don't ski down anything that steep!"</LD>
<TE>   Tiegs managed the glitch gracefully. As guests examined the Warhol
portrait of her hanging near the fireplace, she swanned over to her
stereo to turn up the volume on the BeeGees' "Stayin' Alive."
Priscilla Presley and Jacqueline Bisset completed the tableau, at
least according to one observer. "It's like a who's who of the '80s
art world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The party was held to celebrate Weisman's new book, "From Picasso
to Pop: The Richard Weisman Collection." Proceeds from the evening's
book sales went to one of Tiegs' favorite charities: Cedars-Sinai's
Community Outreach Assistance for Children's Health (COACH), which
provides free medical services to underprivileged families. Tiegs and
Weisman met in the early '80s, at a time when, she recalled, she was
dating the "breathtakingly gorgeous" tennis player Vitas Gerulaitis,
and the three of them attended lots of matches together. They also
"used to go out with Andy a lot," she said. Weisman "kind of
introduced me to the art world."</TE>
<TE>   Weisman is the son of the late Marcia Weisman, who helped teach
Los Angeles about contemporary art, most notably by securing the
downtown Grand Avenue site for MOCA. He is also the nephew of Norton
Simon, whose name graces the renowned Pasadena museum.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had over 500 people come and tell me that my mother started
them collecting," said Weisman. "My book is basically being done to
show mine."</TE>
<TE>   As Irving Blum approached the book-signing table, Weisman boasted
of being an early collector of Roy Lichtenstein. "People were saying
to me, 'You honestly didn't pay thousands of dollars for that
cartoon, did you?' " he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't pay nearly enough for it," quipped Blum, director and
later co-owner of the legendary Ferus Gallery, who sold Weisman his
first Lichtenstein.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, by the lushly landscaped pool, over the sound of a
rushing (artificial) waterfall, artist Chuck Arnoldi's wife, author
Katie Arnoldi, talked about the forthcoming film based on her 2001
bestseller "Chemical Pink," a Pygmalion story set in the world of
women's body building. "We are about to be in pre-production," she
said. "It's so exciting!"</TE>
<TE>   Two hours into the evening, Tiegs was second-guessing her own art
collection. Gagosian Gallery director Roger Shapazian had
congratulated her on positioning her Ross Bleckner above her bedroom
mantel ("The door was open. I hope you don't mind").</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost wanting to sell the Bleckner for a Miro," she said,
looking grave. "... But maybe the Miro is too strong."</TE>
<TE>   "The Ross Bleckner is so mysterious," said Shapazian. "This is the
atmosphere of this house -- intuitive. Things here are close to the
source of creation."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps profundity is in the eye of the beholder.</TE>

<LD>Prison time: An Illinois man was sentenced to five years in prison
last week in Louisiana on charges stemming from the 2001 auto
accident that killed Los Angeles rock musician Bianca Halstead,
leader of the band Betty Blowtorch. Brian McAllister, 34, pleaded
guilty in September to charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular
negligent injury.</LD>
<LD>   Ditto: Will Smith successfully played a con man in "Six Degrees of
Separation" but Carlos Lomax of Duquesne, Pa., didn't fare as well in
real life. He's been sentenced to 37 months in federal prison after
pleading guilty to racking up nearly $33,000 on credit cards while
using Smith's identity.</LD>
<LD>   A future in TV?: Based on preliminary Nielsen estimates Monday,
last weekend's edition of "Saturday Night Live," hosted by former
Vice President Al Gore, drew the NBC show's largest ratings since
Britney Spears hosted in February.</LD>

<HD>Malaysia puts brakes on Pitt's ads</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Pitt is sought after for magazine covers and posters worldwide,
but the Malaysian government believes the Hollywood star's appearance
in a recent series of car advertisements there was "an insult to
Asians."</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin said Monday that ads
featuring models and personalities who don't look Asian would "plant
a sense of inferiority among Asians," the national news agency
Bernama reported.</LD>
<LD>   "Why must we use their faces in our advertisements?" Zainuddin was
quoted as saying. "Aren't our own people handsome enough?"</LD>
<TE>   Zainuddin said the government recently pulled the plug on
advertisements for Toyota Altis cars featuring Pitt. The campaign ran
for at least several weeks in mid-2002 in newspapers and on
television in Malaysia and many other Asian countries. "We canceled
the ads because they were considered an insult to Asians," he said.</TE>

<HD>AFI lists 10 best films, TV shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Film Institute has honored Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of
New York" and Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"
as two of the 10 best movies of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The list included "About Schmidt," starring Jack Nicholson; "The
Hours," which stars Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman;
the Hugh Grant comedy "About a Boy"; and the musical "Chicago,"
starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere.
Rounding off the list were "Adaptation," "Antwone Fisher," "The Quiet
American" and "Frida."</LD>
<LD>   The institute decided to forgo an award ceremony and issue a list
of the Top 10 movies Monday after a disappointing broadcast last year
that garnered low ratings and attracted few celebrities. This year's
list was issued alphabetically.</LD>
<TE>   The AFI also honored 10 TV shows: the series "The Simpsons,"
"Everybody Loves Raymond," "The Sopranos," "Six Feet Under, "The West
Wing," "Boomtown" and "Gilmore Girls," and the cable TV movies "Door
to Door," "The Gathering Storm" and "The Believer."</TE>
<TE>   Selections were made by two 13-member committees -- one each for
movies and television -- which included AFI trustees, industry
professionals, film and TV scholars, and critics.</TE>

<LD>Grandpa and Grandma came out of the house with lots of tall aunts and
uncles. Everybody wore a happy smile.</LD>
<LD>   A big cousin named Wally pulled Jack from the car and plopped him
down in the snow. "Look who's here," he said. "It's Jack."</LD>
<LD>   Jack was glad they remembered him. He was the youngest of all the
Christmas Cousins. He thought they might forget who he was.</LD>
<TE>   Everybody talked at once. Everybody hugged everybody else. Tarzan
barked. The old gray horse put his head over the corral fence and
blew out his breath in a steamy mist. The cows stood hunched in a
chilly circle, watching.</TE>
<TE>   Jack and the other smaller cousins searched for one another
through the forest of legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack," said a small cousin named Jane. "What's your special gift
this year?"</TE>
<TE>   Jack put on a mysterious smile. "It's a secret," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jane giggled. Jack giggled too. But he was worried. His gift was a
secret, all right. It was a secret even from him.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he would have to sing "Away in a Manger" again this year the
way he did last Christmas. But nobody ever gave exactly the same gift
twice. Maybe the other cousins would think he was still a baby if he
couldn't think of a new special gift.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinner's ready," Grandma said. "We'll all help unload your car,
then we'll eat."</TE>
<TE>   All the aunts and uncles and cousins helped Jack's family unload
the car. There were sleeping bags to be taken in because they were
sleeping over that night.</TE>
<TE>   There were cakes and candied sweet potatoes and sticky popcorn
balls Mom had made. There were Christmas presents and clothes and
snow boots and even Jack's teddy bear to be carried into the house.</TE>
<TE>   But nowhere was there even a clue as to what Jack could give as
his special gift.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: The cousins sit down to their Christmas Eve dinner.
Will Jack think of a gift in time?</TE>

<HD>Playing host at the holidays: You're either kind or crazy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>You agreed to have house guests over the holidays. What were you
thinking?</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great act of mercy and love to have people stay this time
of year," says manners expert Letitia Baldrige. "The holidays are
fraught with stress, everyone is sick with the flu."</LD>
<LD>   Baldrige knows what can go wrong. She once had guests who came a
day late, which wouldn't have mattered so much except that she was
throwing a large party in their honor. When they didn't show up, she
called to see where they were.</LD>
<TE>   "They were just sitting down to a macaroni dinner," she recalls.
"And they were a 1 1/2-hour plane ride away."</TE>
<TE>   Double-check exactly when your guests are coming and, just as
important, when they're leaving. Although talking about the end of
the visit before it begins may seem awkward, you'll feel better if
you know.</TE>
<TE>   Be sure to tell your guests what you're planning (a cocktail
party, a trip to the skating rink) so they can pack appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   If visitors are flying in, a considerate host will offer to pick
them up; a considerate guest will make sure that is convenient for
the host.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing people never realize is that we're not next door to
Dulles. That's crucial," says Joy Munster, a psychiatric nurse who
lives in Guilford, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Munster's latest house guest was a cello player who practiced at
odd hours. He was also a vegetarian, which he didn't tell her until
half an hour before she was about to serve an elaborate chicken
cacciatore dinner.</TE>
<TE>   You should be willing to accommodate your guests if you love them,
says Peggy Post of the Emily Post Institute in Burlington, Vt., by
not serving meat at a family dinner, or keeping your cat in another
part of the house. But most hosts have a few things they aren't
willing to compromise over. Maybe you don't allow smoking in your
home, or aren't comfortable with unmarried couples in the same
bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Make the guest room inviting, says Post, with flowers, an extra
pillow, a bathroom glass. "Make them feel at home by saying, 'Please
help yourself to anything in the fridge.' Try to anticipate what they
need. If they get up early, show them where the coffee is."</TE>

<HD>Messiaen's mystical, complex music is reverberating again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Olivier Messiaen died in 1992 at age 83, there was no doubt that
he was a major figure of 20th century music, a great French composer
and an important link between Ravel and Pierre Boulez. But great and
important are one thing, popular is another.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years ago, Messiaen had only one work that could be said to
have entered even the fringe standard repertory -- "Quartet for the
End of Time," which he had written in a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp in
1941. A couple of other pieces -- the "Turangalila" Symphony and the
piano cycle, "Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant Jesus" (Twenty Gazes Upon
the Infant Jesus) -- were on the fringe of the fringe, accessible and
impressive, though too massive and demanding to ever be anything but
special-occasion works.</LD>
<TE>   For all the fanaticism Messiaen inspired in his devotees, for all
the stellar performers who care deeply for his music, he had such a
perplexing collection of unfashionable proclivities that he seemed,
at the time of his death, ever destined to be a glorious outsider.
Messiaen's is a music absorbed in mystical Catholicism and invaded by
incessant bird song, doused in garish instrumental colors, sweetened
with sometimes lurid harmonies, all of it tangled up in obscure,
complex Indian rhythmics. Listening to the reed warbler carry on for
half an hour in one of the 13 parts of the piano cycle, "Catalog of
the Birds," is enough to drive some audiences -- and pianists -- to
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   And yet on the 10th anniversary of Messiaen's death, he really has
arrived. The San Francisco Opera's gripping American premiere of the
composer's only opera, "Saint Francois d'Assise" -- generally
dismissed at its 1983 premiere in Paris as a meditative, unoperatic
five-hour self-indulgence -- proved the American operatic event of
the year. The San Francisco company also organized a Bay Area-wide
Messiaen festival that proved so successful it turned away audiences
for a concert at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and filled a
large hall for a Messiaen symposium at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a climate of severe cutbacks at the major record labels,
Deutsche Grammophon refuses to kick its Messiaen habit. It has just
released a six-CD set of the composer's complete organ music in very
fine performances by Oliver Latry, stunningly recorded at Notre Dame.
And this comes on the heels of Myung-Whun Chung's spectacular account
on two CDs of "The Transfiguration of Our Lord Jesus Christ," with
the Orchestra and Chorus of Radio France. Next month DG will release
yet another Chung-led two-CD set from Radio France, this time of
"From the Canyons to the Stars," the result of the composer's
spiritually intense, bird-happy visit to Bryce Canyon in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   For Messiaen, music was a grand event intended to express his
Faith (something he always capitalized) and his reverence for Nature
(also capped). And part of the attraction to this work is its sheer
scale -- sonic and temporal. But under even the best of circumstances
these big pieces are too labor extensive and expensive to be played
or recorded very often.</TE>
<TE>   If Messiaen's music is to fully enter the mainstream, it needs
musical advocates at the grass-roots level. And that has begun to
happen. In Los Angeles alone last week there happened to be two
performances of "Quartet for the End of Time," one by New York New
Music, an ensemble that played in the Monday Evening Concerts series
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The other was by local
musicians, as part of a modest weekend Messiaen Festival at First
Presbyterian Church in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   That festival could be viewed as a microcosm of how and why
Messiaen has taken hold. It was organized not by a music professional
but by an enthusiast, Patrick Scott, an administrator with LA's BEST
After School Enrichment Program. The small church is highly resonant,
which was great for the massed sonorities in an early organ piece
strongly played by Mark Hilt, the festival's music director and the
church's organist.</TE>
<TE>   In the "Quartet for the End of Time" -- with violinist Robin
Lorentz, clarinetist Marty Walker, cellist Roger Lebow and pianist
Vicky Ray -- there was a lot of lingering echo. Yet these players,
members of the California EAR Unit and Xtet, are specialists in new
music, and they brought an intriguing West Coast sensibility to
Messiaen's hallucinatory apocalyptic visions. The third movement,
"Abyss of the Birds," is a plangent clarinet solo, and Walker used
the church's reverberations to make his tone sound disembodied,
timeless.</TE>
<TE>   Then for two hours on Sunday afternoon, Mark Robson played the
"Vingt Regards." It was an exceptional, world-class performance,
deeply committed and massively virtuosic. This work, written in 1944,
shortly after Messiaen was released from the Nazi prison camp, is on
one level the ultimate Christmas piece, an adoring vision of the
infant Jesus. But as in all of Messiaen, it is full of other, often
contradictory things. It has huge philosophical concerns, Hindu
rhythms, Greek modes and meters, and some of the most voluptuous,
downright erotic sonorities in all of the piano literature.</TE>
<TE>   Before the performance, Scott told the audience that he hoped some
day to see Messiaen elevated beyond being merely a musician. "In
attempting to find a way to reveal theological concepts through
sound," Scott said, Messiaen "transcends religious denomination and
touches on a universal sense of spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   This is a particularly good time of the year for Messiaen's music
and his message -- no one loved Christmas more than he.</TE>
<TE>   And by the way, if you want an indication of just how widespread
Messiaen interest has become, one of the benefactors of the festival
was Matt Groening, creator of the "The Simpsons."</TE>

<LD>In his poem "Anthem for Doomed Youth," World War I poet and British
infantry officer Wilfred Owen ponders the slaughter on the Western
Front:</LD>
<LD>   What passing bells for these who die like cattle?</LD>
<LD>   Only the monstrous anger of the guns.</LD>
<TE>   A top-notch History Channel documentary that airs tonight at 8,
"The Christmas Truce" tells of an extraordinary moment in December
1914 when the monstrous anger ceased briefly and deadly enemies came
together amid the blood-soaked and corpse-strewn battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   The war was only five months old and already bogged in the horrors
of trench-warfare stalemate when British and German soldiers along a
portion of the front stopped fighting on Christmas Eve. In their
trenches just hundreds of yards apart, they began singing.</TE>
<TE>   "In some places, there were even instances when both sides along
No Man's Land were singing the same hymn or carol, in different
languages at the same moment," said Yale historian Patrick Keefe.</TE>
<TE>   A German soldier approached the enemy lines with a small Christmas
tree. British Tommies responded. Slowly in stretches along the
600-mile front from the North Sea to Switzerland, the two sides were
enjoying a weary timeout.</TE>
<TE>   With historic photos, re-creations and a smattering of historians
and archivists, "Truce" provides a detailed and moving account of the
cease-fire that lasted just hours in some places, days in others, and
was ignored altogether in some stretches where the killing continued
apace.</TE>
<TE>   Officers on both sides were appalled at the truce and threatened
punishment, even execution if their troops did not return to the
trenches. In defiance, a soccer game broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "All those young boys, they were not made to kill each other,"
said Annette Linthout, a guide at a museum at Ypres, Belgium. "They
were afraid of each other."</TE>
<TE>   "Truce" is strongest in its evocation of war in the trenches: the
cold, the fog, knee-deep water, trench foot that turned to gangrene.
It is soggiest when trying to fit the story into some Big Picture
meaning as a 20th century turning point.</TE>

<HD>Feeling blue? Tuck some rainbows into your wallet</HD>
<DH>The U.S. plans to add color to its currency. Maybe the new
bills will help put the economy in the pink too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Tschorn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say goodbye to "greenbacks" and wave as "cabbage" disappears into the
graveyard of popular slang. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has
announced that U.S. currency will soon be getting a touch of color.</LD>
<LD>   According to published reports, the bills will remain green and
black, but "color tints will be added in the neutral areas of the
note." And although that sounds like something right up movie
colorist Ted Turner's alley, it seems the process should be more
democratic than that.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the bureau could follow the path of democracy -- and the
Mars Co. -- and put it to the people. But that raises a troubling
point. If the candy maker's M&amp;M color contest over the summer proves
one thing, it's that Americans have a penchant for purple, which won
clean hands down. (There is no indication that losers pink and aqua
intend to challenge the Florida results).</LD>
<TE>   So at the risk of winding up with cash that looks like Barney the
dinosaur, here are some alternatives to ponder.</TE>
<TE>   Glow-in-the-dark green</TE>
<TE>   How many times have you accidentally over-tipped while scrounging
for cash in a dark taxi or nightclub? Why not coat our cash in
easy-to-see phosphorescence? The upside is that every rich guy on the
dance floor will resemble an over-sized lightning bug with a glowing
green wallet (and, like the lightning bug, will no doubt attract his
fair share of mates.) The downside is that your wallet will become
the equivalent of a neon arrow pointing out your cash to potential
muggers.</TE>
<TE>   Burberry plaid</TE>
<TE>   From hats to baby carriages, cufflinks to shopping bags, it's only
a matter of time before this ubiquitous pattern finishes its creep
into every corner of our cultural consciousness, so why not just give
in? The upside is that money and style already go hand in hand, and
what accessorizes a Burberry wallet better than Burberry bucks? The
downside is that, with Burberry knock-offs about as common as the
real thing, the money might be far too easy to counterfeit.</TE>
<TE>   Camouflage</TE>
<TE>   What more patriotic way to hide your wealth than with genuine U.S.
military-style camo-cash? Because currency is already black and
green, this would only require adding brown to the mix and making the
splotchy camouflage design. This would no doubt be a popular choice
for hunters and soldiers of fortune. The downside? It's hard to spend
what you can't see.</TE>
<TE>   Threat-Level Yellow</TE>
<TE>   Why not simply implant our cash with microchips that change the
hue of money based on the color-coded threat level issued by the
Department of Homeland Security? The pro: You'll know right away if
something big is happening. Con: Unless you're broke.</TE>
<TE>   County Orange</TE>
<TE>   You can't miss all those burly workers leaning on their shovels by
the side of the road during your morning commute. Why? Because
they're wearing that flashy shade of "county orange" popularized by
inmates. Never again will you mistakenly think you're out of money as
an errant 20-dollar bill lounges in the cool hinterlands of your
purse. On the downside, your teenager will never mistakenly think
you're out of cash as he rummages around the cool hinterlands of your
purse.</TE>
<TE>   Assorted</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Treasury Department should follow the lead of the folks
over at the U.S. Mint and issue a limited-edition color for each of
the U.S. states. Can't you imagine your wallet bursting with the
sunny oranges of California or Florida? Or what about the rusty reds
of Arizona's money, conjuring up images of the Grand Canyon in your
pocket? What better way to jump-start this country's personal savings
program than with a 50-state banknote collection in full Technicolor?</TE>

<HD>A donation? ... Gee ... thanks</HD>
<DH>Even if they have everything, recipients just might be
offended by that charitable gift.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>The question for many is not whether 'tis better to give than to
receive -- but whether it's better to donate to a charity than to buy
gifts for all the usual well-fed suspects on their list.</LD>
<LD>   More than any other holiday, Christmas makes us aware of those
less fortunate than we are. Starving children, people awaiting cures
for disease, animals abused, the environment endangered, and so on.
What better way to celebrate than to send money where it is so
desperately needed, instead of hunting for those cute, but often
frivolous, Christmas knicks and knacks.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, but it's not that simple, as a couple in Thousand Oaks
recently realized when they hosted about 60 friends at a holiday
bash. All the guests brought gifts, except for one couple who showed
up with a card that said they'd donated to a charity in honor of the
couple.</LD>
<TE>   "We were offended by that," says the hostess, who didn't want her
name used. "Of course, we'll never tell them how we felt. We sent a
gushing thank-you note. But the truth is, these people can afford to
contribute to charity whenever they want. They could easily have also
taken time to buy a little token gift for us, since we are their
close friends. What they did was somewhat pompous, too impersonal --
we felt as if they didn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Informal chats with Christmas givers and receivers reveal that
most think they know exactly when a charitable donation is, or is
not, appropriate in place of a gift. But once they start talking
about it, many realize they really haven't a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Some start out by saying that affluent people don't really want or
need gifts that just add clutter to their lives. They'd probably
rather have donations to good causes made in their names. But Rose
Burton, who donates her time to charities in New York, says she
changed her mind about all that just this month when she received a
party invitation from a "woman who probably has more money than the
U.S. Mint."</TE>
<TE>   When Burton called to RSVP, the heiress' twentysomething daughter
answered. "Do you think I should bring a gift or donate to a charity
in your mother's name?" Burton asked. "Oh, please bring a gift," the
daughter said with surprising passion. "My mother loves nothing more
than ripping off the paper and seeing what's inside."</TE>
<TE>   Realtor Myra Preston recently led a visitor into her San Fernando
Valley dining room, which was laden with what she calls "generic
gifts." Baskets with wine and cheese; boxes, tins and jars of candles
and preserves; cookies and candy.</TE>
<TE>   Preston's sister died of breast cancer, her mother of heart
disease and her father of kidney failure -- all diseases for which
researchers have yet to find cures. She says she donates to all those
medical causes during the year, but at Christmas, "it's all about
those who are still here, my family and friends There's something
heartwarming about giving a pretty basket filled with goodies. It's
just a token of affection, no big deal. But I think it makes people
feel good to receive it -- and it makes me feel good to give it."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Gethers, a New York-based screenwriter and author, says he
used to pursue a similar gift-giving scenario every year. "Then I
woke up one morning and realized I just don't want people giving me
gifts I don't really need -- and I don't want to buy one more scarf
for a friend who doesn't need it. I feel that when the economy is
tanking and people are really needy, I shouldn't waste any money if I
can possibly help it. I felt the urge to actually do something better
this year."</TE>
<TE>   Gethers called all the people with whom he usually exchanges
presents -- about 30 friends and family members. "I told them I
wasn't doing it this year, that I planned instead to donate to two
places -- Meals on Wheels and a New York charity called Epiphany,"
which assigns each volunteer a Christmas list for a needy family. The
volunteers deliver their gifts to the families at a gathering at a
local community center. Gethers says he was given a family of four to
shop for. "I really liked going out and buying clothes for these
kids, trying to figure out what each of them would want to wear...."</TE>
<TE>   When she hears about the New York program, real estate agent
Preston says she'd be interested in doing something like that here.
"But I don't think it should be an either-or kind of deal. I think
most people with halfway decent incomes can afford to do a little of
both things -- they can be thoughtful of their friends and charitable
too."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The bear market of the last three years has had a dramatic effect on
older Americans, forcing many to cut their spending and others to
come out of retirement to earn a paycheck, according to a new survey.</LD>
<LD>   Three-quarters of the 50- to 70-year-old investors surveyed had
lost money in the stock market, according to the survey released
today by AARP, formerly known as the American Assn. of Retired
Persons.</LD>
<LD>   The majority of those surveyed said they had lost one-quarter or
less of the value of their investments in the market downturn --
considerably better than the performance of benchmark stock indexes
such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which is down 40% from its March
2000 peak.</LD>
<TE>   Still, about 18% of respondents said the value of their
investments had plunged by 50% or more.</TE>
<TE>   Survey respondents said they are reacting to the market losses by
either spending less or working longer. Specifically:</TE>
<TE>   * 59% will budget more carefully.</TE>
<TE>   * 34% will take fewer vacations.</TE>
<TE>   * 30% postponed major purchases.</TE>
<TE>   * 20% delayed retirement.</TE>
<TE>   * 3% of retirees went back to work after the market started to
slide in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * 12% of current retirees think they may have to go back to work
at some point in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, about one-third of the respondents who described
themselves as retired were still working either full or part time,
according to AARP.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, which sampled 1,013 individuals over the phone, was
conducted in November and early December by International
Communications Research. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Big Overruns Plague Spy Satellite Program</HD>
<DH>Technical problems and cost run-up could lead to
restructuring of Boeing's contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new generation of spy satellites being developed by Boeing Co. is
under intense scrutiny from Congress, which has raised concerns that
the supersecret program faces significant cost overruns and delays,
Capitol Hill sources said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The potential problems with the nation's largest intelligence
project, most of it under development at Boeing facilities in Seal
Beach and El Segundo, could lead Congress to call for a major
restructuring of the effort, a source familiar with the discussions
said. The satellite project has been estimated to cost more than $25
billion over the next two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the overruns, which could hit $600 million to $900 million
in 2003 alone, are unlikely to force Congress to cancel the program
or to seek another contractor to handle the work, a congressional
source said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're extremely concerned about where it is going, particularly
from a cost perspective," the source said. "But it's not a
showstopper. It's too late for that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Boeing beat out Lockheed Martin Co. to develop the spy
satellites, primarily because it promised to deliver the satellites
with a radical new design. The contract represented a stunning blow
to Lockheed, which had been building spy satellites for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The project, known as Future Imagery Architecture, calls for
creating a constellation of satellites equipped with powerful
telescopes and radar to gather clear and frequent images of enemy
troops in darkness or through cloud cover.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's work is being overseen by the Pentagon's National
Reconnaissance Office, which operates satellites that take pictures
of military compounds around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the work is centered at half a dozen facilities in
Southern California. Boeing's partners include Raytheon Co., Harris
Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the project's top-secret status, it's unknown how many
people are working on the program, although analysts believe that it
involves more than 5,000 engineers and possibly an additional 5,000
local support personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually everything about the spy program -- its dollar amount,
the number of satellites to be built and the capabilities of the
craft -- is secret. Even the duration of the contract is classified.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials and industry analysts say in general terms that
the program has been plagued by technical troubles, mainly because of
the sheer complexity of developing the system and because the
Pentagon asked for additional capabilities after last year's
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that there are two main problems," said Loren
Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a military think
tank. "Boeing bid quite aggressively on the satellite contract and is
having difficulty with execution, and the government underestimated
the complexity of its own requirements."</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that the satellites may not be ready for deployment
until 2008, or two years behind schedule, and the total cost of the
system could nearly double to $17 billion by 2010 from an initial
projection of $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, said Thompson, "the Pentagon is over a barrel. It
doesn't have the time to start over because existing satellites are
getting old."</TE>
<TE>   Marco A. Caceres, a senior space analyst for Teal Group, an
aerospace research firm, said the Pentagon has been looking to launch
new satellites that not only would be a fraction of cost and size of
the current generation but also have more capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not only trying to develop new stuff but trying to put it
in a smaller spacecraft," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The half-dozen U.S. spy satellites orbiting the Earth cost $1
billion to $1.5 billion each, according to Caceres.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Boeing and the Pentagon would not talk about the
satellite program, citing its classified nature.</TE>
<TE>   But James Albaugh, president of Boeing's Integrated Defense
Systems unit, which is overseeing development of the satellite
network, said in April that the program was on schedule and within
budget.</TE>
<TE>   The program passed a preliminary design review this year.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's shares rose 52 cents to $31.92 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Callaway Golf Fires KPMG as Auditor</HD>
<DH>Deloitte is in as the company tries to decide how to apply
reserves of $17million to its books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Callaway Golf Co. disclosed Monday that it fired auditor KPMG because
of a dispute over when $17 million in warranty reserves should be
added to the firm's bottom line.</LD>
<LD>   In a conference call with analysts, officials from the Carlsbad,
Calif., golf club manufacturer confirmed that the disagreement would
delay their filing of the company's third-quarter report with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, possibly until February.</LD>
<LD>   The postponement will allow the newly hired auditors, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, time to sort out the matter.</LD>
<TE>   Bud Leedom, an analyst from Wells Fargo Securities in San Diego,
called the wrangling over the reserves and the quarterly report more
of a "vexing issue" than a problem for Callaway. "I have my eye on
it, but it's not alarming to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute arises over the amount Callaway budgeted to pay for
warranty repairs or replacements of its Biggest Big Bertha driver,
which was introduced in 1997 and had problems with its titanium
shafts.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Callaway improved the club's design and strength,
Leedom said. In addition, company officials said Monday that better
record-keeping revealed fewer returns than expected, meaning that
Callaway paid $17 million less for repairs than it had allotted..</TE>
<TE>   The rub came in choosing when to report the change.</TE>
<TE>   "In this particular case, unlike a lot of other companies, we've
understated our earnings in a prior period," said Brad Holiday,
Callaway's chief financial officer. "I guess we're guilty of being
too conservative."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials want to claim the full amount for the third
quarter, arguing that the $17 million, although not part of
operational earnings, constituted a "change in estimate," Holiday
said. Thus, the firm included it in figuring its third-quarter
results showing $160 million in revenue and earnings of 19 cents a
share -- 16 cents of that coming from the reclaimed warranty
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   But KPMG, which was hired in March, regarded the matter as an
error, and advised the firm to restate earnings going further back,
Holiday said.</TE>
<TE>   When neither side budged, and the company missed its Nov. 14
deadline for its quarterly report, Callaway's audit committee and
board voted to dismiss KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   A KPMG spokesman declined to comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by brisk sales of their new Big Bertha II drivers, Callaway
officials also said Monday that they expect to do better than
forecast in 2002. They said revenue should reach $790 million, rather
than the $750 million projected, and earnings would reach 96 cents to
$1 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, however, they estimated revenue would remain flat and
earnings would dip to 88 cents a share -- about 7 cents below the
consensus, said analyst Leedom.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway reported the dismissal of KPMG after the markets closed
Monday. In regular trading, its shares fell 27 cents, or 2.2%, to
$11.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. But they rose in after-market
trading to $12.30.</TE>

<HD>Doctors Awarded $156 Million From Norcal Mutual</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ron White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County Superior Court jury awarded $156 million in
damages Monday to approximately 700 doctors in a case against San
Francisco-based Norcal Mutual Insurance Co., according to an attorney
for the physicians.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyer Larry Feldman said that the 700 doctors banded together in
1981 to form the Physicians Interindemnity Trust. PIT acted as a
malpractice insurance company for the doctors, who split actual
losses from such cases among themselves.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Feldman said, Norcal offered to take the doctors on as
members.</LD>
<TE>   The insurance company said it would use the premiums it earned to
form a trust to pay medical malpractice claims that had been handled
by PIT.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors accepted, Feldman said, but the trust went into
receivership three months later in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   That left the doctors with $56 million in unpaid medical
malpractice claims. The doctors sued Norcal and won their case
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Norcal representatives and attorneys could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<HD>Videotape From '97 Enron Party Jokes About Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years before Enron Corp. collapsed in a big accounting scandal,
an executive joked at a party about making "a kazillion dollars"
through something he humorously dubbed "hypothetical future value
accounting," the Houston Chronicle reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Videotaped jokes by some former Enron executives at a January 1997
party bear ironic parallels to events that helped bring down the
energy conglomerate, the newspaper said.</LD>
<LD>   The videotape, of a going-away party for former Enron President
Rich Kinder, features nearly half an hour of absurd skits, songs and
testimonials by executives and prominent citizens -- including
President Bush, the newspaper reported.</LD>
<TE>   Enron, which two years ago ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500, filed
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, 2001, haunted by shady accounting,
hidden debt and inflated profit. Stock that had traded at $90 in
August 2000 plummeted to pennies. Thousands of people were laid off.</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle did not identify the source of the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   At the party, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush pleaded with Kinder:
"Don't leave Texas. You're too good a man." And his father, former
President Bush, told Kinder, "You have been fantastic to the Bush
family. I don't think anybody did more than you did to support
George."</TE>
<TE>   In one skit, former administrative executive Peggy Menchaca played
the part of Kinder receiving a budget report from then-President
Jeffrey K. Skilling, who played himself.</TE>
<TE>   When the pretend Kinder expressed doubt that Skilling could pull
off 600% revenue growth for the next year, Skilling described how it
could be done.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to move from mark-to-market accounting to something I
call HFV, or hypothetical future value accounting," Skilling joked as
he read from a script. "If we do that, we can add a kazillion dollars
to the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling abruptly resigned from Enron in August 2001 before news
of its troubles surfaced, and has professed ignorance about much of
what went on under his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Three Enron workers have pleaded guilty to charges including fraud
and false tax returns, and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow has been indicted on 78 charges.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Richard Causey, the former chief accounting officer,
referred jokingly to a practice that is frowned upon by securities
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on the job for a week managing earnings, and it's
easier than I thought it would be," Causey said. "I can't even count
fast enough with the earnings rolling in."</TE>

<HD>Kids' Retailer FAO Reports Loss</HD>
<DH>The company blames a $23.7-million third-quarter loss in
part on sagging sales. It is expected to end the year in the red.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parent firm of children's specialty retailers FAO Schwarz, Zany
Brainy and Right Start posted a $23.7-million third-quarter loss
Monday, more than double the loss from a year ago and ensuring that
the company will end the year in the red.</LD>
<LD>   FAO Inc., the successor company to Calabasas-based Right Start,
blamed the loss in part on sagging sales at stores open at least a
year.</LD>
<LD>   "The sales environment was just more difficult than we had
expected," said Jerry Welch, president and chief executive. He said
that "even assuming a solid fourth quarter," the company would face a
loss for the year.</LD>
<TE>   "They've got some very serious challenges ahead of them," said
Sean McGowan, managing director with Gerard Klauer Mattison, who does
not cover FAO but is an expert on the industry. "They need to
conserve cash, work out a new plan with their lenders and vendors and
try to get through a tough year. This is a tough climate to be
executing in, but on the other hand, they have strong brands, and
that works in their favor."</TE>
<TE>   The company's loss contrasts with a $9.9-million loss for the
year-ago quarter. Sales for the chain, which has 27 stores in
Southern California, increased 52.3% in the quarter to $89.3 million,
largely because of acquisitions. But sales at stores open at least a
year declined, ranging from an 8% drop for Right Start to a 25% dive
for Zany Brainy shops.</TE>
<TE>   The stock rose 26 cents to $1.91 on Nasdaq. Earnings were released
after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   Right Start acquired Zany Brainy last year and later moved its
corporate headquarters to Zany Brainy's offices in King of Prussia,
Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The company acquired FAO Schwarz in January, adapting that
well-known name for its corporate moniker.</TE>
<TE>   FAO shares hit a 52-week low Friday on reports that at least two
large suppliers halted shipments in the midst of the busy holiday
season because they had not been paid for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives said Monday that store shelves were stocked and
that vendors were being paid. Top suppliers are owed a combined $9
million to $10 million, said Raymond Springer, the company's chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our suppliers have not been refusing to ship to us," CEO Welch
told analysts Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Springer said that restrictions by some of the firm's key
lenders need to be eased if the firm is to deal with its liquidity
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Welch said the company planned to bring in an investment bank next
year to help it raise funds. The company also said it planned to
close some underperforming stores next year.</TE>

<HD>EPA Widens Rules for U.S. Farms</HD>
<DH>Calif. officials worry they will have difficulty enforcing
the new animal waste measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren and Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday issued what it
described as important new rules preventing manure from livestock
operations from polluting waterways. But a top California regulator
dismissed the federal effort as a weak attempt to address the growing
problem of farm animal waste.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new EPA plan -- which is less stringent than one
proposed earlier by the Clinton administration -- the number of U.S.
farms that will be required to get special permits for disposing of
waste from cows, pigs and chickens will triple. But most states,
including California, are likely to find themselves struggling with
the red tape generated by the rules.</LD>
<LD>   In California, the rules will be overseen by a network of regional
water quality control boards, which are understaffed as is.</LD>
<TE>   For example, in the Central Valley, where 1,700 of the state's
2,200 dairy farms are located, there are only a few inspectors
checking farms, in part because of state budget cuts. Under Monday's
rules, these inspectors now will have to prepare permits and review
paperwork for an additional 1,000 dairies.</TE>
<TE>   John Menke, an environmental specialist with the state Water
Resources Control Board, said the new rules may hurt efforts to crack
down on polluters in California's $4.6-billion dairy industry, the
biggest agricultural business in the state. California waste
regulations already prohibit discharge from large animal operations.</TE>
<TE>   "All this means is that instead of staff out looking for violators
they will be in the office drafting permits," he said. "It doesn't
help us.... We don't need permits to take enforcement action."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture has become the biggest polluter of U.S. waterways, and
these new rules, when in full force, are expected to reduce by 25%
the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus -- two of the major pollutants
released by the 15,500 largest livestock operations, EPA officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Too much of these elements can cause excessive plant growth that
kills fish and ruins waterways for swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Animal waste generated by concentrated feeding operations poses a
real threat to the health of American waters," said EPA Administrator
Christie Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a major step toward making America's waters cleaner and
purer by placing new controls on manure and animal waste water
generated by large livestock operations."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA announcement was the latest of several environmental
actions by the Bush administration in recent weeks that were welcomed
by industry and disparaged by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was forced to produce the initiative in response to a
lawsuit by consumer watchdog group Public Citizen and the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental
organization that was alarmed by the government's failure to crack
down on the escalating pollutants flowing from massive factory-type
livestock operations.</TE>
<TE>   Although tougher than current law, the new rules are significantly
scaled back from a Clinton administration proposal to tackle the same
problem. The Clinton rules would have forced big corporate food
producers to share responsibility for the cleanup with the farmers
who supply them.</TE>
<TE>   "States can go further if they choose," Whitman said. "But our
objective is not to put the family farmer out of business."</TE>
<TE>   In California last year, a state Assembly bill sought to raise
fees to pay for more staff for state water agencies. But opposition
from dairy and other farm interests helped defeat the measure.</TE>
<TE>   With many dairies in California expanding the number of cows they
milk, water quality officials worry that "lagoons" created to collect
farm waste will overflow and dairies won't have enough crop land to
spread their manure, which could lead to ground-water contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Dairy industry officials had hoped to convince the EPA that they
could regulate themselves using a self-certification process. But the
EPA decided to require the largest U.S. farms to get disposal
permits.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials and state regulators acknowledge that catching
violators still will be difficult because they would have to be
caught in the act of pumping manure into public waterways or ignoring
overflowing "lagoons" on their farms.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, most California farm groups said they still were
analyzing the 400 pages of rules to see how difficult it would be to
comply. But Paul Martin, of Western United Dairymen, said he was
confident most dairy operations were behaving responsibly and
complying with the even more rigorous state laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe our modern dairy operations will have no problem
complying with this law," Martin said. "Most dairies will have to get
a permit." But, he said, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality
Control Board was going to impose permitting for all dairy operations
anyway. "No dairy is going to be exempt from environmental
stewardship."</TE>
<TE>   Funds from the federal farm bill will be available to help
producers pay for the cost of meeting the new regulations. Congress
increased funding to help farmers reduce pollution from their
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "There is going to be a lot more investment on dairy farms in
terms of time and monitoring and paperwork," said Nathan DeBoom,
chief of staff for the Milk Producers Council in San Bernardino
County.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists bridled at the notion of taxpayers covering the
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should taxpayers have to pay for the mess" the producers
make, said Ken Midkiff, director of the Sierra Club's Factory Farm
Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The administration estimated that the initiative would cost $335
million a year. It did not estimate how much would be covered by
federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also complained that the administration did
nothing to regulate air pollutants from livestock operations. A
report by the National Academy of Sciences released last week pointed
to agribusiness as a significant contributor to air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Joseph Martyak said the administration would study
the academy's report and consider whether air emissions from
concentrated feeding lots need to be regulated.</TE>

<HD>Are Online Players Game for More Titles?</HD>
<DH>The explosion of new content could saturate the market --
or attract new participants</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there such a thing as too much fun on the Internet?</LD>
<LD>   Today's debut of "The Sims Online" will help the $12-billion game
industry answer that question. Based on the hit series from
Electronic Arts Inc., it promises to be one of the most popular
online multiplayer games in the relatively short history of the
genre.</LD>
<LD>   Yet analysts are fretting that the red-hot market for online games
is quickly becoming saturated. A slew of upcoming titles is
threatening to overwhelm a relatively small pool of game junkies who
may not have enough hours in the day to play them.</LD>
<TE>   "There are way more products being launched than the market can
support," said David Cole, president of San Diego-based DFC
Intelligence, a market research firm specializing in games. "They're
all going to just sabotage each other's market share."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, video game makers can be forgiven for trying to grab a
piece of the multimillion-dollar success of Internet games such as
"EverQuest" and "Ultima Online." In the rubble of dot-com ventures,
games stand out as one of the few successes.</TE>
<TE>   A number of games have developed a loyal following among serious
players, who pay $10 a month for access to the fantastical online
worlds of trolls and elves. "EverQuest," which debuted in 1999,
generates more than $4 million a month for Sony Online Entertainment,
a division of Sony Corp. based in San Diego and Austin, Texas.
"Ultima Online" brings in $2.2 million a month for Redwood City,
Calif.-based Electronic Arts.</TE>
<TE>   But what they may have failed to take into account is that there
are only about 1 million online players. Compared with the 35 million
households with a Sony PlayStation game console, the community of
online gamers is downright tiny.</TE>
<TE>   What they lack in number, however, they make up for in fidelity.
Online gamers typically maintain their accounts for years, dutifully
paying their fees.</TE>
<TE>   "The business model is very attractive," said Gordon Walton,
executive producer of "The Sims Online." "These games tend to be
annuities. And the successful games will have five- to 10-year runs."</TE>
<TE>   In a hit-driven industry, a monthly revenue stream like that is
much welcomed, and such predictable profitability has attracted new
entrants to the market this year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "The Sims Online," EA introduced "Earth &amp; Beyond" this
fall. Walt Disney Co. launched "Toontown" last month, and Microsoft
Corp. debuted "Asheron's Call 2."</TE>
<TE>   In the next two years, more than a dozen additional titles are
expected to go online, including "Galaxies," a game from LucasArts
Entertainment Co. based on the "Star Wars" universe.</TE>
<TE>   In a market defined by a mere half-dozen titles, this constitutes
an explosion of new content.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is whether the large number of new games will
cannibalize the same audience, or whether they will attract new
players and grow the market," said Sam Parker, an editor at GameSpot,
an online game news and reviews site.</TE>
<TE>   But for devoted fans, the issue isn't money as much as time. It's
not unusual for addicted players to devote as many as 20 hours a week
to one game. At that rate, the number of hours required to play two
games amounts to a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   Makers of "The Sims Online" say their title should do well because
it's bound to draw from more than the pool of traditional online
gamers. The game hopes to attract players from among the 9 million
people who already are fans of the original PC version of "The Sims."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many fans of "The Sims" wouldn't consider themselves
gamers at all, Parker said. Unlike shoot-'em-up fantasy games, "The
Sims" attempts to simulate real life. Players control individual
characters who build houses, land jobs, get married and even have
children.</TE>
<TE>   Whether these casual players will latch on to the online model is
something many industry analysts will monitor closely.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first truly mass-market title to debut," said Edward
Williams, an industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New
York. "The performance of this game is key to whether this market
will succeed."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TV Guide announced Monday that it has tapped J. Scott Crystal as
executive vice president and publisher of TV Guide Publishing Group,
the largest-circulation weekly magazine in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Filling a position that has been vacant for more than a year,
Crystal, 46, will oversee advertising sales and marketing teams for
TV Guide's print publications and online platform. He was most
recently president and chief executive of Gruner &amp; Jahr USA
Publishing's business magazine group.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment comes as TV Guide's Pasadena-based parent,
Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., struggles to turn around the
magazine after several years of neglect.</LD>
<TE>   TV Guide this year hired John Loughlin to fill a new position
overseeing the magazine group, and the company is searching for a new
editor in chief after the resignation of Steven Reddicliffe last
month.</TE>
<TE>   The search for an editor probably will be completed by February,
Loughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide and sells on-screen
television program guides, closed up 16 cents at $3.28 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company is under a federal investigation of accounting
practices and has lost more than 80% of its stock value this year,
forcing News Corp. to write down about $6 billion of its investment
in the company.</TE>

<HD>Red Cross Settles Lawsuit With Blood Products Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HemaCare Corp., a Woodland Hills company that provides blood products
and services to medical facilities, said Monday it settled its
lawsuit that accused the American Red Cross of trying to monopolize
the blood supply market.</LD>
<LD>   HemaCare's lawsuit against the Red Cross, filed in federal court
in Los Angeles in 2000, alleged that the humanitarian organization
was bundling its blood product offerings to customers, and charging
higher prices for blood platelets, in exchange for getting a lower
price for the most commonly used blood product, red blood cells.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, HemaCare contended it could not compete, even though
its own price for platelets was lower than that of the Red Cross.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, the Red Cross "agreed not to bundle
blood-related products and services in New England or the Carolinas"
in violation of antitrust laws, HemaCare said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that this issue has been resolved to everyone's
satisfaction. We look forward to continuing our practice of providing
a safe and available blood supply nationwide," Allan Ross, senior
vice president and chief operating officer of American Red Cross
Biomedical Services, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross admitted no wrongdoing in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement did not involve any money, said HemaCare
spokeswoman JoAnn Stover.</TE>
<TE>   HemaCare's stock climbed 4 cents a share Monday and closed at 49
cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>Debt Repayment Is in Doubt After Filing by Hospital</HD>
<DH>Granada Hills facility had obtained almost $19 million in
municipal bond financing from National Century.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Walters</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bankruptcy filing by a Los Angeles hospital that relied on
financing from National Century Financial Enterprises Inc. leaves
future payments on almost $19 million in municipal debt in doubt, a
trustee for bondholders said.</LD>
<LD>   Granada Hills Community Hospital, which borrowed from National
Century this year, filed for bankruptcy protection Nov. 26, and
monthly principal and interest payments haven't been met since
September, a Dec. 2 notice to investors from U.S. Bank said.</LD>
<LD>   The notice said U.S. Bank "can give no assurances" on the timing
or amount of future payments to bondholders or whether the hospital,
which remains open, will be able to continue operating.</LD>
<TE>   The Granada Hills hospital, a 129-bed facility, is one of several
health-care providers that lost money when Dublin, Ohio-based
National Century filed for bankruptcy protection last month. National
Century bought unpaid bills from health-care providers and packaged
them for sale as bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit foundation that owns the Granada Hills hospital said
its bankruptcy filing was linked to a filing by Doctors Community
Healthcare Corp., a privately held Scottsdale, Ariz., company that
managed the facility, according to U.S. Bank. Five units of Doctors
Community -- two hospitals in Washington, one in Chicago and two
others in Southern California -- also filed for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The Granada Hills hospital borrowed from National Century as part
of a plan to boost cash reserves. The San Bernardino Associated
Communities Financing Authority sold $18.7 million in municipal bonds
for the hospital in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals that sought help from National Century "really needed an
infusion of cash," said Craig Kornett, an analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Selling receivables was "one of the last avenues they'd look at."
Fitch this month reviewed nonprofit hospitals it rated and concluded
their use of National Century was "extremely limited, if not
nonexistent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's in May 2001 cut the credit rating on the Granada
Hills bonds to D after a principal payment was missed. S&amp;P withdrew
the rating last month, citing a lack of timely financial data.</TE>
<TE>   A bond reserve fund backing the debt was fully funded at $1.57
million before a draw of about $5,000 was needed to make the November
interest payment, U.S. Bank said previously.</TE>

<HD>NYSE to Delist Kmart Stock; Retailer Delays Third-Quarter
Filing</HD>
<DH>Shares of the company, which is operating under Chapter 11,
have been below $1 a share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alexandra R. Moses</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange will suspend trading of Kmart Corp.
common stock, leading to the company's delisting, the retailer said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange told Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Court protection Jan. 22, that it would suspend trading of company
shares before the market opens Thursday. After that, it will begin
delisting proceedings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart said July 10 that it was notified by the NYSE that its stock
could be subject to a trading suspension and delisting within the
following six months.</LD>
<TE>   The NYSE's criteria for continued listing include that a company's
stock trade at a minimum average share price of $1 over a 30-day
period. Kmart shares fell below $1 in June.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed up a penny Monday at 58 cents, before the
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said the shares would begin trading in the over-the-counter
Bulletin Board market starting Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company warned shareholders that the stock may have
no value if and when the company emerges from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Kmart said it would delay its third-quarter earnings
filing because it needed more time to prepare its financial
statements. The earnings were to have been filed by the end of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said it would file third-quarter earnings by Dec. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer announced earlier this month that it would have to
restate earnings from the first two quarters of this year and for
previous years after problems were discovered as part of the
company's review of its accounting practices.</TE>

<HD>Markets Stage Broad Rebound</HD>
<DH>Despite a surge in crude oil and gold prices, Wall Street
shows resilience as investors snap up stocks hit by two weeks of
selling.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil prices surged above $30 a barrel Monday and gold hit a
five-year high, but the action in those markets couldn't keep Wall
Street down.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials gained 193.69 points, or 2.3%, to 8,627.40, as
buyers jumped in to take advantage of share prices hit by two weeks
of sustained selling.</LD>
<LD>   The stock market's rally was broadly based, with winners
outnumbering losers by 23 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
21 to 13 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index rose 37.91 points, or 2.8%, to
1,400.33.</TE>
<TE>   Investors had been chiseling away at stocks in the previous two
weeks to take profits from the dramatic rally of October and early
November, when the market was rebounding from five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   A new threat to the equity market's health developed last week as
oil prices began to rise sharply on concerns about supplies from
strife-torn Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, near-term crude futures in New York leaped $1.66 to
$30.10 a barrel, the highest price since Oct. 2, as a general strike
by workers in Venezuela entered its 16th day.</TE>
<TE>   The unexpectedly long protest aimed at forcing President Hugo
Chavez to resign compounded fears of an oil supply squeeze during the
Northern Hemisphere winter -- concerns already heightened by possible
military conflict in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Up to this point, the market seems to have been far too relaxed
about the loss of so much crude oil at a time when inventories are
already well below prudent levels," said Paul Horsnell of investment
bank J.P. Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan army commandos Sunday stormed an oil tanker and
arrested its striking crew as Chavez tried to break the strike, which
has paralyzed the nation's exports.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 oil tankers were waiting anchored off Venezuelan
ports Monday. The nation, which normally supplies 14% of U.S. oil
imports, is pumping one-sixth of its normal volume.</TE>
<TE>   In other commodity trading, gold continued its rally of the last
two weeks. Near-term futures in New York added $3.80 to $337 an
ounce, a five-year high.</TE>
<TE>   Gold has benefited lately as stocks have pulled back and as the
dollar has weakened against the euro and the yen. But Monday, the
euro eased slightly against the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's resilience Monday in the face of oil's strength may
have been rooted in part in comments by Lehman Bros. and Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. Both firms advised European clients to increase the
amount of U.S. shares they own, citing expectations that U.S.
corporate profit growth in 2003 would exceed European profit growth.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Oppenheimer, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs,
said European companies have done less to pare costs, and
policymakers have been slower to cut interest rates, than their U.S.
counterparts, according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   But European equity markets rallied as well Monday. The German
market jumped 4.2% and the French market gained 3.2%.</TE>
<TE>   As stocks advanced, U.S. Treasury bond prices fell and yields
rose. The 10-year T-note ended at 4.15%, up from 4.07% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Bank and brokerage stocks were strong. Citigroup surged $1.48 to
$37.48, Bank of America gained $2.03 to $70.28 and Merrill Lynch was
up $1.12 to $40.97.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks got a lift as crude oil rallied. BP jumped $1.48
to $40.75, Valero Energy gained $1.90 to $37.06 and Occidental
Petroleum was up 85 cents to $29.10.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug giant Pfizer rose 55 cents to $31.05 after raising its
quarterly cash dividend 15%. Eli Lilly added 38 cents to $64.85. Just
as the market closed Monday, Lilly said it would raise its dividend
8%.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Broadcom jumped 88 cents to $17.11, Qlogic
rallied $1.44 to $38.37 and Computer Sciences surged $1.93 to $34.84.</TE>
<TE>   But Vitesse Semiconductor fell 4 cents to $2.38 and Conexant was
off 2 cents to $1.63. They are among 15 stocks that Nasdaq plans to
drop from the Nasdaq 100 index, that market announced Friday.</TE>

<HD>House Members Urge SEC to Approve Fund Disclosure Rule</HD>
<DH>Reps. Oxley and Baker back a proposal that the industry
says would 'politicize' proxy voting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission should approve a proposal to
make mutual fund companies such as Fidelity Investments disclose
their votes in corporate proxy contests, two senior Republican House
members said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Mutual funds belong to the shareholders who fund them, and those
shareholders deserve to know how their voting rights are being used,"
Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) and Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.) said
in a letter to the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   Oxley chairs the House Financial Services Committee and Baker the
Capital Markets Subcommittee -- the House panels that oversee the
SEC.</LD>
<TE>   The rule proposal, opposed by the $6.2-trillion mutual fund
industry, has been endorsed by 7,500 individual investors. New York
Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer voiced support for the plan last week.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, issued for public comment in September, was pushed
by outgoing SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt after accounting scandals at
Enron Corp. and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Making mutual fund voting transparent will strengthen investor
confidence by providing another powerful tool to promote corporate
accountability and responsibility," Oxley said.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual funds control about 20% of the publicly traded stock in the
U.S., according to industry data. Many proxy contests involve
executive compensation, stock options, the election of board members
and the level of board independence.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the Oxley-Baker
letter, which is among several trickling in after the Dec. 6 deadline
for comment. The SEC in coming months will decide whether to adopt
the proposal or make changes.</TE>
<TE>   The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group, has
said the SEC plan would "politicize" fund managers' proxy voting
decisions. The group's president, Matthew Fink, sought to clarify the
industry's position Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The mutual fund industry strongly supports most of the specific
new proxy voting responsibilities proposed by the SEC," he said. Fink
said, though, that "requiring mutual funds to report on hundreds of
thousands of individual proxy votes twice each year, often with
lengthy individual explanations, will undermine rather than enhance
the ability of mutual funds" to strengthen corporate accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Many fund companies, including Fidelity and the Vanguard Group,
the two largest, have opposed the SEC proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, under then-Chairman Pitt, initiated another mutual fund
disclosure proposal that was issued for public comment last week.
This plan, which also is opposed by many fund companies, would make
funds disclose their holdings every quarter instead of twice a year.</TE>

<HD>Planet Hollywood Ready for Another Comeback</HD>
<DH>The theme-restaurant chain will emerge from bankruptcy for
the second time in two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Planet Hollywood International Inc. on Monday won approval to emerge
from bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years and began
focusing on regaining its stature in a battered theme-restaurant
industry that peaked in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Briskman approved Planet Hollywood's
reorganization plan, despite concerns from businesses that claim they
are still owed money, state and local governments that are owed back
taxes and a New York landlord with which the company has a lease
dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The reorganized movie-themed restaurant and retail store will be
privately held. It went public in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Orlando, Fla.-based Planet Hollywood plans to focus on sales at
its 10 remaining restaurants in tourist destinations such as Orlando,
Hawaii, Las Vegas, Minnesota's Mall of America, New York, London,
Paris, Disneyland Paris, Atlantic City, N.J., and Myrtle Beach, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   President and Chief Executive Robert Earl will remain in charge of
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Planet Hollywood and its franchises and licensees
had 95 restaurants in 31 countries. The company emerged from its
first bankruptcy in 2000 with 22 restaurants. But Planet Hollywood
filed for bankruptcy protection again last year, claiming that the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and decline in tourism had hurt sales.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganized Planet Hollywood will change how it compensates
its celebrity endorsers, offering only expense payments instead of
issuing shares of company stock. Under the company's leases, each
Planet Hollywood restaurant must have six appearances a year from a
movie star.</TE>

<HD>Cumulus Considers 'In-House' Liaison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio station chain Cumulus Media Inc. is considering hiring an
independent record promoter as an "in-house" liaison to record
labels, a move that critics say smacks of payola.</LD>
<LD>   Cumulus plans to name John Kilgo, a veteran of independent
promotion firm Jeff McClusky &amp; Associates, as its director of label
relations, sources said. The move would make Kilgo the gatekeeper for
Cumulus' pop music stations.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative is sending a shudder through the major labels,
which say such an arrangement appears to run afoul of federal
anti-payola laws that prohibit broadcasters from accepting money in
exchange for song airplay without disclosing it.</LD>
<TE>   To sidestep the law, an independent promoter can pay an annual fee
to a radio station for the exclusive right to pitch songs to
programmers. The promoter then collects a fee from record labels for
each song added to the station's playlist.</TE>
<TE>   Cumulus has had a contract with McClusky's firm but plans to let
it lapse at year's end and designate Kilgo as the labels' contact.
Cumulus officials said late Monday that they had not finalized their
decision and that Kilgo could still end up as an outside contractor
with an arms'-length relationship to the radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Record executives said Monday that they believed it would be
against the law for an "in-house" Cumulus employee to bill them for
each song. But Cumulus Executive Vice President John Dickey said the
plan "stays well within the confines of how these relationships have
been set up. It really is going to allow us to maximize our
relationships with the labels."</TE>

<HD>Rawlings Accepts K2 Bid; Top Shareholder Doesn't</HD>
<DH>Daniel Gilbert opposes $84-million stock deal for baseball
brand, says his cash offer is better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An angry shareholder is already calling "foul" over Los Angeles-based
K2 Inc.'s announcement Monday that it will buy baseball equipment
manufacturer Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. for $84 million in stock.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which also includes the assumption of about $40 million
in Rawlings debt, would be the first for K2's new chief executive,
Richard Heckmann. He has an aggressive plan to turn the ski and
snowboard maker into a major sporting goods company by acquiring
other name brands.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Heckmann faces opposition from Rawlings' biggest shareholder,
Daniel Gilbert, who recently made an all-cash bid for the company at
$8.50 a share, or about $69.1 million. Gilbert owns 15% of Rawlings'
stock.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not going to vote for this, and I don't think a lot of other
shareholders are going to go for it," said Gilbert, who is chairman
of Livonia, Mich.-based Quicken Loans Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "My deal was all cash, and we could have been closed in just a
couple of weeks," Gilbert added.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann, however, believes that Gilbert's offer is nothing more
than a swing and a miss.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings shares, he noted, jumped 9% on Monday to $8.93 on Nasdaq.
More than 400,000 shares traded hands, about 15 times their average
daily volume.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who thought our deal was bad could have gotten out today,
for cash, and made nearly 50 cents more than what Mr. Gilbert is
offering," Heckmann said. "The market has already spoken and has said
our bid is better."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, some think that both deals may be overvalued. An
executive at a rival sporting goods company says he believes that
K2's and Gilbert's offers are too high, given Rawlings' lackluster
financial performance in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings' chairman and chief executive, Stephen O'Hara, said the
board of the 115-year-old company decided to accept the K2 offer at a
meeting Sunday night because it agreed with Heckmann's vision of
creating a large, all-season sporting goods concern.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal was for how you would create a growth vehicle rather
than how many expenses you can eliminate," O'Hara said.</TE>
<TE>   One question is whether Robert S. Prather Jr., who owns 10.3% of
Rawlings, will vote against the deal. Prather, a former board member,
is the second-largest shareholder and previously has gone up against
Rawlings' management. He is the CEO of Bull Run Corp., an Atlanta
holding company that failed in an earlier attempt to acquire
Rawlings. Prather did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Management owns about 7% of Rawlings shares.</TE>
<TE>   For Heckmann, who became chief executive of K2 in October, a
Rawlings acquisition would be the first piece of an ambitious plan to
transform K2 into a Fortune 500 sporting goods maker by buying
multiple brands. He pursued the same strategy when he was head of
water company USFilter, building it from a small business into a
behemoth that was sold to French conglomerate Vivendi Universal for
$6.2 billion in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Besides skis, K2 also sells Ride and Morrow snowboards, bicycles,
inline skates and the popular Shakespeare line of fishing gear.</TE>
<TE>   "Rawlings is a No. 1 brand that adds to our No. 1 brands in other
sports that are marketed to the same retailers," Heckmann said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is confident that at least 51% of Rawlings shareholders
will approve the deal, which would close in March.</TE>
<TE>   But Gilbert, a lifelong baseball fan, is undeterred, saying the
battle for Rawlings is "only in the early innings."</TE>
<TE>   He maintained that shareholders would be better off with less
money in cash rather than the stock transaction, which he said may
end up being worth about $72 million in stock by the time the deal
closes.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the agreement, Rawlings shareholders would receive
0.95 of a K2 share for each share they own. That number can change
based on the average price of K2 stock during a 15-trading-day period
that ends two business days before the close of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   K2's shares fell 4% on Monday to $9.48 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   K2 and Rawlings have suffered from falling revenue in recent
years. Rawlings earned $3.4 million on sales of $173.7 million in its
2002 fiscal year. It has not seen any meaningful increase in sales
since 1998, and the company lost a combined $16 million in 1999 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert blames Rawlings' problems on "poor management and a lack
of capital."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no good consumer-marketing effort, no effort at selling
goods over the Internet, there is little global presence and no
public relations effort, even though this is the most recognizable
brand in baseball," Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   He also questioned K2's financial strength. K2 lost $7.7 million
on sales of $595 million in its latest fiscal year, though it swung
to a profit in its most recent quarter.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Firms Suffer a Blow in ReplayTV Case</HD>

<LD>The federal judge presiding over Hollywood's lawsuit against
Sonicblue Inc.'s ReplayTV, a commercial-skipping video recorder, has
rejected a novel attempt by the entertainment companies to withhold
key documents from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the EFF, an advocacy group that promotes civil
liberties online, represent five ReplayTV users who say they have the
right to skip commercials and send shows to other viewers.</LD>
<LD>   The major Hollywood studios and TV networks tried to withhold
internal documents about their lobbying efforts and finances from the
EFF. They argued that the documents would be used to aid the EFF's
own lobbying efforts, even if the court barred public disclosures.</LD>
<TE>   But Friday, U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper in Los
Angeles ordered the companies to hand over the documents.</TE>
<TE>   If the studios had prevailed, EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn said,
it could have made it harder for the group to provide free legal
services in battles affecting consumers' rights on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rauchberg, an attorney for five studios and NBC, said his
clients simply had been trying to "level the playing field so that
EFF did not have unfair advantages" when lobbying.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles jury cleared Isuzu Motors Ltd. on Monday of
responsibility for a rollover wreck in which the driver of one of its
Rodeo sport utility vehicles lost an arm.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred on the night of Jan. 2, 1999, in Imperial
County, as Elpidia Medel Toledo was returning home to Santa Barbara
from a visit to Mexicali.</LD>
<LD>   According to testimony in the case, Toledo was traveling about 65
mph when she swerved to avoid an animal on the road, causing the SUV
to flip over.</LD>
<TE>   Her lawyer contended that the Rodeo was dangerously unstable and
had a weak roof, while Isuzu lawyers blamed Toledo's injuries on
driver error.</TE>
<TE>   After deliberating for half a day, the jury in Los Angeles
Superior Court rejected the defective product claim by a 10-2 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased that the jury decided it this way," said Vince
Galvin, a lawyer for Isuzu and its Cerritos-based U.S. distributor,
American Isuzu Motors Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed for my client," said Toledo's lawyer, Michael
Piuze.</TE>
<TE>   "I am also disappointed for the safety of all of the people out
there who don't know how unsafe these vehicles are."</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $14 billion in three-month bills at a

billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.26%, up from
1.25%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 1.21% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,969.70, and 1.28% for a six-month bill selling for $9,936.30.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, dipped to 1.47% last
week from 1.53% the previous week.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. expects no-interest loans to cut the U.S. auto
industry's sales next year by as many as 400,000 vehicles, because
the incentives coaxed some motorists to buy cars and trucks earlier
than they intended.</LD>
<LD>   The loans, introduced by automakers to spur sales after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, prompted about 1 million drivers to buy before
they would have or make purchases that they otherwise wouldn't have
made, said Paul Ballew, General Motors' director of market and
industry analysis.</LD>

<HD>US Search.com, First American Unit Will Merge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A collapsed Southland dot-com stock found a new backer Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based US Search.com Inc., which provides employee
screening services and finds long-lost relatives for consumers, said
it agreed to be merged into a new firm to be formed with a unit of
title insurance giant First American Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The deal would create a bigger player in the sleuthing business,
which has gotten a boost as more companies have sought to screen
workers' backgrounds since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Ana-based First American said it would combine its screening
information group with US Search.com, creating First Advantage Corp.</TE>
<TE>   First American would own 80% of the new company. US Search.com's
shareholders would own the rest, if they agree to swap their shares
for new stock. The business, with expected annual revenue of about
$160 million to start, will apply for a listing on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   First American wouldn't issue stock as part of the deal but
expects to inject capital into the firm, said Chief Financial Officer
Thomas A. Klemens.</TE>
<TE>   For US Search.com, the deal would provide a parent with deep
pockets. First American is expected to have revenue of about $4.4
billion this year, most of it from title services.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, First American also has been building its
screening information business, which the company expects to help it
offset some of the cyclical nature of the real estate business,
Klemens said.</TE>
<TE>   First American sees potential to cross-sell products, including
consumer credit reports, to US Search.com clients, he said. US
Search.com has ranked third in visitors among directory and
local-guide sites, according to Nielsen/NetRatings.</TE>
<TE>   US Search.com hasn't been profitable since it went public in 1999,
but sales have risen sharply in recent quarters. Third-quarter sales
were $8.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time noncash charges in the quarter, the company
said its loss narrowed to $765,000, or 1 cent a share, from $2.7
million, or 15 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear what the new First Advantage shares might be worth,
but Klemens said the firm "will be profitable from the get-go." He
said First American conservatively expects the business to add 2
cents a share to the parent's earnings in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   US Search.com Chief Executive Brent Cohen would be president of
the new firm. John W. Long, head of First American's screening unit,
would be CEO.</TE>
<TE>   First Advantage would be headquartered in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
where First American's unit now is based. But Cohen said he would
remain in Los Angeles, and that there were no plans to relocate the
110 employees in the L.A. office.</TE>
<TE>   US Search.com shares closed unchanged at 79 cents on Nasdaq. First
American shares rose 37 cents to $22.37 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>United Asks Its Unions to Accept Bigger Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines asked its unions to accept labor cost cuts totaling
$2.4 billion as it seeks to reorganize in Bankruptcy Court, according
to unions representing flight attendants and mechanics.</LD>
<LD>   The request from UAL Corp.'s United is more than twice the $945
million in pay and benefit concessions the world's second-largest
carrier sought before filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors
on Dec. 9.</LD>
<LD>   United, which has some of the highest costs in the industry, is
trying to reduce expenses to emerge from bankruptcy protection within
18 months. Unions must act on the proposals by mid-February to
satisfy terms for $1.5 billion in bankruptcy financing, the United
Assn. of Flight Attendants told members in a message posted on its
Web site.</LD>
<TE>   The machinists union, which represents United mechanics, cleaning
workers and baggage handlers, was "incredulous" after seeing the
proposals, said Scotty Ford, president of the mechanics' district.
"We're discussing strategy with our financial and legal advisors."</TE>
<TE>   The company began making presentations to union leaders on the
proposals last week and won't comment on the details, United
spokesman Rich Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously negotiated wage and benefit reductions weren't enough
to help the airline win approval for a $1.8-billion U.S. loan
guarantee request. A federal board decided not to provide government
backing, saying United's financial plan was unsound.</TE>
<TE>   UAL shares declined 25 cents to $1.50 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. The shares, which are about 55% owned by employees, have
dropped 89% this year.</TE>

<HD>Jobless Benefit Costs to Increase</HD>
<DH>State's 'flexible funding' system requires firms to pay
higher premiums when need is greatest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in seven years, most businesses in California will
pay more in unemployment insurance premiums in 2003 as the state's
weak economy has put a strain on the employer-funded program that
offers benefits to jobless workers.</LD>
<LD>   Although the rate hikes are modest, with most employers paying an
additional $21 per worker next year, the increase comes at a time
when companies already are struggling with soaring costs for workers'
compensation, health insurance and electricity and are facing higher
taxes and fees to plug the state's mammoth budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   "It's another nail in the coffin of profitability," said Martyn
Hopper, state director of the National Federation of Independent
Business, which has 38,000 members in California, mostly small
employers. "The timing couldn't be worse."</LD>
<TE>   Over the last year, the state's unemployment trust fund has
declined 23% to $4.3 billion, according to the state Employment
Development Department. Under a formula in state law, employer
premium rates are automatically adjusted each year based on the total
amount of benefits paid out to jobless workers.</TE>
<TE>   That figure has risen sharply over the last year and half as
California's unemployment rate has jumped from a pre-recession low of
4.7% in early 2001 to 6.4% last month. More than 1.1 million
Californians are unemployed; about half of them are receiving
benefits. A slow job market means most are staying jobless longer,
putting further stress on the state's resources.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say it's unfortunate that California, like some other
states, has created a system that hits employers hardest precisely
when the economy is at its worst. Known as "flexible funding," it
results in employers paying the lowest rates in boom years when
unemployment is scant and there are few demands on the trust fund.
The flip side is that firms have to pony up during recessions and pay
higher rates to keep up with rising claims.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't tax as much as they should during the booms, so they
have to raise taxes during the bust," said economist Jeffrey Wenger,
an expert on unemployment insurance at the Washington-based Economic
Policy Institute. "They really put themselves in a pickle when times
are hardest."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a rising number of unemployed workers, California's
system also is being strained by higher benefits. In 2002, maximum
benefits increased to $330 a week from $230 a week. Next year the top
weekly benefit will increase to $370 for a maximum of 26 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Employers foot 100% of the cost of unemployment insurance from a
tax on the first $7,000 of an employee's wages. Under the current
rate structure, companies with the best claims histories pay $49 per
employee annually. Next year, that figure will increase to $63 -- a
29% jump. Increases will ripple across the rate schedule. The top
premium of $378 per employee won't increase, but more companies will
have to pay it.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary staffing firms, which employ thousands of workers, will
be among those whose profits are hit hardest.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly has an impact on our margins," said Darin Meadows,
area manager for Manpower Inc., which employs more than 6,000 in the
Los Angeles area.</TE>

<HD>FDA News Boosts VaxGen Shares 21%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VaxGen Inc. said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration has
agreed to an accelerated review of its experimental HIV vaccine --
news that sent the company's shares up 21%.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a significant positive for VaxGen.... Once the
applications are filed, the FDA can make a decision in fairly short
order," said Anna Kazanchyan, an analyst at Investec Inc., which does
not have a banking relationship with VaxGen.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, VaxGen said its shares had come under pressure after an
article in the journal Nature questioned the effectiveness of its
AIDSVAX vaccine.</LD>
<TE>   The article said the HIV protein targeted by the vaccine is
invulnerable to antibodies because it can change shape.</TE>
<TE>   VaxGen spokesman Lance Ignon said that the experiment detailed in
the article used artificial antibodies against an artificial virus
and that the results cannot be compared with what happens with a
natural HIV infection.</TE>
<TE>   VaxGen is testing the vaccine for preventing HIV infection in a
pivotal-stage, or Phase III, trial in 5,400 people in the United
States, Canada, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Brisbane, Calif., firm rose $2.72 to $15.73 in
Nasdaq trading, gaining back much of the 32% drop suffered last week.
They had reached as high as $16.60 during the session.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expected to announce preliminary trial results
in the first quarter of 2003. Another pivotal-stage trial of a
vaccine version designed to fight HIV subtypes prevalent in Southeast
Asia is being conducted in Thailand, and those results are expected
in the second half of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the FDA's fast-track program for drugs that treat
life-threatening conditions, the agency must notify the company of
the acceptance of the marketing application within 45 days of filing
and must take regulatory action within six months, compared with one
to two years for other applications.</TE>

<HD>Hedge Fund Urges Stilwell to Curb Pay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Paton</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hedge fund family that holds a large stake in Stilwell Financial
Inc. on Monday urged the company -- operator of the Janus mutual fund
family -- to rein in compensation for employees and reconsider
selling its stake in DST Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to senior management, Boston-based Highfields Capital,
now the second-biggest shareholder of Stilwell stock with 8% of the
shares, made public for the first time its concerns about the
company's reorganization plans.</LD>
<LD>   Stilwell is in the process of merging its operations under the
roof of its Janus mutual fund unit. The company also has said it
would review compensation and bonuses and look at selling its 33%
stake in DST Systems, a provider of investment management services.</LD>
<TE>   Stilwell has said it could use the proceeds from a sale of the DST
stake to cut its debt.</TE>
<TE>   But Highfields told Stilwell that it did not believe the company's
debt level was "excessive," and called on management to take its time
in deciding what to do with DST.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Highfields also called for "compensation restructuring."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Highfields said the company had taken "steps in the right
direction."</TE>

<HD>Budget Cuts Forced CSU to Increase Student Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles B. Reed</AU>
<BD>Charles Reed is chancellor of the 23-campus California
State University system.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite student protests, the California State University's Board of
Trustees approved a $72 fee increase Monday that will take effect
with the winter term. Raising fees is never an easy decision, but in
tough times like these, it was the right thing for the CSU system to
do.</LD>
<LD>   Here's why: The 400,000-student university system began this
academic year with $43 million in cuts and $22.8 million in unfunded
cost increases for health benefit premiums and salaries. Gov. Gray
Davis has proposed $59.6 million in permanent reductions for CSU.
Altogether, the system faces a staggering $125 million in reductions
in its general fund budget for the current year.</LD>
<LD>   The state university system, and other institutions that rely on
Sacramento for funding, has done its best to prepare for these
difficult budget times. The University of California also voted
Monday to increase fees.</LD>
<TE>   But an enrollment boom has brought an additional 87,000 new
students into the CSU system over the last eight years and 100,000
more are expected before the end of the decade. In this academic
year, it is serving 8,000 more full-time equivalent students than
were funded.</TE>
<TE>   According to the College Board, four-year public institutions
across the country are charging an average of $4,081 in tuition and
fees for the current academic year, an increase of 9.6% over last
year.</TE>
<TE>   That follows a 7.7% increase for the year before.</TE>
<TE>   In California, however, rather than allowing fees to rise
gradually to meet the increasing costs of providing quality higher
education, the state has subsidized the cost of student fees and
exacerbated the situation.</TE>
<TE>   CSU fees have not increased since 1994. In fact, they are 10%
lower than five years ago. Even with the $72-per-semester increase,
the annual state university fee would be only $1,572, which is less
than half the national average.</TE>
<TE>   For many, maintaining low student fees has been synonymous with a
commitment to providing access to higher education. Yet low fees can
also reduce access if the total available revenue supports a
decreasing number of classes. At a time when California's economy
needs well-educated graduates more than ever, the state should be
focused on increasing higher educational opportunities, not limiting
them.</TE>
<TE>   A fee increase, though never desirable, represents the best chance
CSU has to continue providing a full range of opportunities for its
406,000 students this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some may argue that CSU has acted precipitously by raising fees
before the Legislature has finalized the budget. But given current
budget realities, it represents the most responsible course of
action. To wait would be to guarantee that the university would have
to take even more painful steps in the future.</TE>

<HD>Lott's Love Affair With Racism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did Trent Lott's mother, who once publicly recommended that a bullet
be put through the head of a local editor who supported integration,
raise the future senator to be a bigot? Or was it his favorite uncle,
Arnie Watson, a leader of the White Citizens Council -- a more
respectable version of the Ku Klux Klan -- who inspired the senator's
lifelong love affair with race hate?</LD>
<LD>   Other white Southerners, such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton,
managed a bold break with the evil ways of their elders, but not
Lott. After a week of meandering apologia, the best the Senate
Republican leader could muster for his recent, but not first,
celebration of Strom Thurmond as a representative of the good old
days of segregation is that he -- Lott -- is a hapless product of the
prevailing racism of his youth: "I grew up in an environment that
condoned policies and views that we now know were wrong."</LD>
<LD>   Now know were wrong? "Now," as in last week, when Lott was roundly
denounced, even by the president, for views he'd held all his life?
Or is it "now" as in this week, when a Republican rival is publicly
gunning for his job as Senate majority leader? Or "now" as in his
keynote address in 1992 to the neo-segregationist Council of
Conservative Citizens, in which he was quoted as saying: "The people
in this room stand for the right principles and the right
philosophy."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, race-baiting, though generally more subtle than Lott's
embrace of Thurmond's 1948 campaign for a segregated nation, is what
gave the GOP dominance in the Deep South, and Lott has long been one
of its main practitioners. The so-called Southern strategy, given its
fullest support by Richard Nixon three decades ago, successfully
aimed at recruiting the white racist Dixiecrats who had been
uncomfortable with the Democratic Party since President Truman's 1947
order to desegregate the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   When Lyndon Johnson pushed through the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the
Republicans turned their backs on Lincoln and pro-civil rights
Republican moderates like Dwight Eisenhower and became the refuge of
eternally aggrieved Southern racists.</TE>
<TE>   Lott was one of those recruits, leaving his job as top aide to a
retiring segregationist Democrat and running with his mentor's
support and money as a Republican, on Nixon's coattails, in 1972. In
the Senate, Lott outdid Thurmond himself when it came to being a
racial reactionary, opposing establishment of a Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday and extension of the Voting Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   Lott is above all else a politician, and his playing the race
card, while periodically impolitic, has been the consistent subtext
of Republican campaigns for decades, even in national races. Recall
Lee Atwater's use of the Willie Horton scare endorsed by the elder
George Bush in his winning campaign against Michael Dukakis or the
intimidating attacks on black voting in Florida and elsewhere in the
2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps with President Bush's belated but forthright condemnation
of Lott, this vicious opportunism will be abandoned and the GOP again
will become the party of Eisenhower, who used federal troops to
enforce school desegregation.</TE>
<TE>   It is interesting to note that prominent African American
Republicans Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice have ignored Lott's
appeals for support in his current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   What Republicans must realize is that despite Lott's various stabs
at apology, what he will not concede is that racism -- real,
powerful, cancerous -- continues to haunt the nation and that the
destruction of the black family, in particular, is the direct
consequence of an organized system of slavery and segregation that
aimed at destroying not only equal opportunity but the very humanity
of black people.</TE>
<TE>   Though nearly every group of immigrants to the United States has
been discriminated against to some extent, none arrived en masse in
shackles as African Americans did. Nor was any other group kept in
the bondage of legal segregation for an additional century.</TE>
<TE>   Racial prejudice continues to be the United States' Achilles heel,
yet there has been an increasing denial of the obligation to make
good on its enduring debt to black people. Even the mildest
affirmative action programs are under attack. Perhaps, thanks to
Lott's most recent indiscretion, we may begin to more seriously
confront the ongoing duty to right racism.</TE>

<HD>Europe Is Courted by an Islamic Wolf in Secular Clothing</HD>
<DH>Turkish party leader espouses democracy but his past and
plans speak otherwise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amir Taheri</AU>
<BD>Amir Taheri is the author of "The Cauldron: The Middle
East Behind the Headlines" (Hutchinson, 1995). E-mail:
taheri@benadorassociates.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He has a long history of Islamist militancy, for which he has spent
time in jail, and he is still banned from public office because of
it. And yet Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of Turkey's Justice and
Development Party, has been touring the U.S. and Europe to portray
his movement as "a branch of the Western democratic tree."</LD>
<LD>   "We are the true secularists," he told a group of journalists in
Paris.</LD>
<LD>   What is going on? For almost eight decades, Turkey has proudly
described itself as the first secular state in Islam, thus drawing
fire from fundamentalists. And now we have Erdogan telling us that
the Turkish state is not secular; it needs his party to make it so.
What could he mean?</LD>
<TE>   In 1924, Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic, set
up a Bureau of Islamic Affairs to assume some of the abolished
caliphate's functions. The bureau has assets worth billions of
dollars. It controls thousands of endowment properties, from
apartment blocks in Istanbul to farms in Anatolia. It also owns about
80,000 mosques and builds an additional 1,500 each year. It employs
almost 100,000 people, including 45,000 imam-khatibs who lead prayers
at mosques and deliver religious sermons. A 100-man team of writers
produces sermons that are approved by the authorities before
delivery.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau is the only authority in Turkey allowed to issue
fatwas, or religious edicts, and is in charge of censuring
publications that might stray from the official path in matters
concerning Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "In Germany, the government does not dictate what is said in
church on Sundays," Erdogan says. "In Britain, girls can go to
university wearing an Islamic hijab," the nun-like head covering that
has become the symbol of militancy since the 1970s. "In Turkey,
however, speaking of Islam in your own way could land you in jail.
And girls can certainly not enter universities or government offices
wearing the hijab."</TE>
<TE>   The new Justice and Development government, headed by Prime
Minister Abdullah Gul, has promised a series of constitutional
amendments to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Yet opponents of the party claim that Erdogan and Gul are playing
the European card in a diabolical game aimed at removing barriers
erected against radical Islamism over the decades.</TE>
<TE>   The abolition of the Islamic affairs bureau would mean the
transfer of huge assets to private religious groups that could
interpret, promote and use Islam in whatever way they like,
regardless of the interests of the state. Wresting away the control
of state-owned mosques, shrines, holy places and businesses could
provide the party with a strong and permanent presence in virtually
every town and village. It could appoint thousands of its militants
to influential and profitable positions and make sure that its
preachers control all the mosques.</TE>
<TE>   In Erdogan's system, the state and the mosque would be strictly
separate, which would please some Westerners who support a secular
system. But the party could control the mosques through its
appointees and use the religious network to control enough of the
electorate to keep itself in power for years.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan's appearance and discourse are deceptive. He has not grown
a fundamentalist-style beard. And his wife wears a colorful headscarf
rather than a hijab.</TE>
<TE>   But Erdogan is as much caught in his contradictions as are his
opponents because the whole debate about secularism is out of place
in Islam. Secularism is relevant in a Christian context because
Christianity regards the realms of God and of Caesar as distinct.</TE>
<TE>   No such distinction is possible in Islam, in which attempts by
either religion or state to impose itself on the other lead to
discord and disaster.</TE>
<TE>   When Erdogan and Gul say they want to make Turkey "fully
European," they should carefully contemplate what this means. There
may be no diabolical design, but a single political party controlling
the nation's religious assets in the name of separation of mosque and
state could undermine Turkey's multiparty democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The way out must be sought within the Islamic tradition, which
allows civil society to control the mosques and religious endowments
but forbids their use for partisan political purposes.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Must Lose the Psychobabble</HD>

<AU>George Weigel</AU>
<BD>George Weigel, author of "The Courage to Be Catholic:
Crisis, Reform and the Future of the Church" (Basic Books, 2002), is
a senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington
and is doing research in Vatican City.</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Let the healing begin.</LD>
<LD>   This seems to be the consensus Catholic response, ranging from
victims groups to the church hierarchy to the Catholic press. It is
an entirely appropriate sentiment if the question is reconciling the
victims of clergy sexual abuse to the church.</LD>
<LD>   But it is a hopelessly inadequate reaction if the question is
fixing what is broken in the structures of Catholic belief and
practice in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The jargon of the therapeutic culture in which "fixated
ephebophilia" masks the reality of homosexual molestation and
"observe the boundaries" replaces "don't commit grave sin" is part of
the problem, not part of the solution, to a crisis caused by priests
who broke their vows and bishops who failed to lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stripped of secular-therapeutic euphemisms, here is what caused
most cases of clergy sexual abuse and episcopal malfeasance: Unchaste
priests weakened by poor theological instruction and defective
spiritual formation met confused teenagers and young men weakened by
a sex-saturated culture. Then bishops who had absorbed the managerial
and bureaucratic ethos of modern American institutional life reacted
to the sorry results of those encounters as managers rather than
apostles.</TE>
<TE>   Something is manifestly wrong in the Catholic Church when
psychology constantly trumps moral theology in describing what is
going on when a man seduces a teenage boy. And something is
manifestly wrong when the forgiveness that is possible for all
repentant sinners is confused with restoring the sinner to a public
trust.</TE>
<TE>   Very little of the recent commentary has gotten to the sources of
today's Catholic crisis. This crisis did not come from nowhere. It is
the result of a Catholic "ecology" damaged by a culture of dissent
that has persistently promoted "Catholic Lite" views of core beliefs
and institutions.</TE>
<TE>   This culture of dissent views the priesthood as simply another
form of "ministry" rather than a re-presentation of the priesthood of
Christ himself. It misconstrues what it means to be a bishop -- in
the Catholic understanding of things, a teacher, not a
discussion-group moderator whose task is to keep everybody reasonably
happy and "in the conversation." It has contempt for the church's
sexual ethic; indeed, widespread dissent among theologians and
priests from the church's settled teaching about the nobility of
sexual love within marriage helped create a situation in which some
priests gave themselves passes on sexual misbehavior and some bishops
failed to recognize sin for what it was.</TE>
<TE>   Public relations experts may have advised the U.S. bishops that
using the language of "healing" and "respecting boundaries" will help
get a psychobabble-saturated media off the church's case. That seems
unlikely. Beyond tactics, however, it is a desperately wrongheaded
approach to fixing the current fractures in the church, which are
fractures of conviction, commitment and discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics believe the church's "form" was given to it by Christ.
That form includes the leadership of bishops in local churches, so
there can be no Catholic reform without strong, confident bishops,
unafraid to be doctrinally and morally assertive.</TE>
<TE>   Where could bishops who want to be such leaders look for recent
models of effective, systemic institutional reform? How about the
experience of the U.S. Army after Vietnam? The Army was a shambles in
1975, which had something to do with the general cultural implosion
of the 1960s. But the men who rebuilt the Army didn't blame "the
times" for their problems.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, they had the courage to see that failures of leadership,
institutional inertia and a breakdown of the Army's understanding of
its unique mission had created the catastrophe of the early 1970s.
Having gotten the analysis right, genuine reform could follow.</TE>
<TE>   So Catholic bishops, priests and laity must begin talking about
the crisis in their native language, the language of sin, grace and
redemption; good and evil; fidelity and infidelity. Biblical and
theological language must replace psychobabble.</TE>
<TE>   The real issues in the Catholic crisis that now seems certain to
spill over into 2003 are, have been and will continue to be issues of
fidelity and infidelity. Those issues won't be successfully addressed
until the church reclaims its own vocabulary.</TE>

<LD>A few years ago, a massive national poll produced a ranking of the
20th century's top news stories. First was the atomic bombing of
Japan. Second was the Pearl Harbor attack. Third was the moon
landing. Little noticed at the time and since was that none of the
top three could have happened without No. 4: the invention of the
airplane. This morning, as quiet as an uninhabited sand dune, the
nation begins its official yearlong centennial marking of the first
flight by two bicycle makers, the Wright brothers from Dayton, Ohio,
on Dec. 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Humanity's first four recognized controlled flights (not counting
the Icarus fiasco) were unpublicized by intent because Orville and
Wilbur hadn't received their airplane patents yet.</LD>
<LD>   What the pair of unschooled engineers pulled off that day, after
centuries of dreaming and generations of failing, would at first
slowly and then ever more rapidly change life on Earth, its history,
its wars, its lifestyles, technology, research priorities, even the
face of the moon.</LD>
<TE>   Just think what flight has done and allowed. Humanity and its
imaginations soaring in the sky where once only gods resided. The
explorations, adventures and rescues, the surveys, maps, studies and
awesome scenes recorded for others far away. Flight not only altered
marketing -- enabling, say, farmers to sell perishables to distant
customers -- it permitted widespread organ transplants, freed global
travel, tourism and recreation from steam engines and created the
short-term transcontinental and transoceanic commutes now underway
for the holidays. Plus freeway traffic reports.</TE>
<TE>   Aerospace became a powerful global economic engine for technology,
industry and jobs, especially in California. Aviation also created a
pantheon of heroes: Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart to Chuck
Yeager and Neil Armstrong. Not to mention corporate legends whose
stories and mergers are less familiar than their last names --
William Boeing, Donald Douglas, Glenn Curtiss, Glenn Martin, Igor
Sikorsky, Jack Northrop and someone named Alan Loughead, who grew
frustrated with his name's mispronunciations and changed it to
Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   As with all new things in history -- say, for example, the
gunpowder in fireworks -- some conjured ways to use airplanes to kill
and destroy. Others saw in flight a rapid means to rescue the injured
or get food and medicine to victims of disease and disaster.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly 100 years, a few air travelers remain stumped by
overhead luggage bins and seat belt clasps. Some of us with limited
chin-up capabilities may never comprehend how a 747 weighing 747,000
pounds can lift off the ground that way and stay there. And the
recent bankruptcy filing by United Airlines reminds all of the legacy
of economic storms encountered by Braniff, TWA, Pan Am, Eastern,
America West and US Airways.</TE>
<TE>   Except for all that, the earnest poll ranking manned flight as
last century's fourth-most-important story was right on.</TE>

<LD>The last several days have seen Henry A. Kissinger resign from
leading the 9/11 commission, Trent Lott (R-Miss.) imperil his post as
incoming Senate majority leader and former Vice President Al Gore
pull out of politics. A little political tumult is good for the
republic.</LD>
<LD>   The families of the victims of 9/11 may get the honest assessments
they crave from the commission. The GOP may reconsider its
wink-and-nod courtship, as personified by Lott, of "states' rights"
Southern Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   And the Democrats? They could grab the chance to come out of
hiding and take some stands.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone from former NATO Cmdr. Wesley K. Clark to Vermont Gov.
Howard Dean has a better (though still long) shot at the Democratic
presidential nomination. The important question, however, is whether
any of the contenders would give the Bush White House a run for its
money in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's withdrawal, after midterm elections that clobbered the
Democrats, exposes a party that seems downright frightened of
opposing Republicans. The nadir was perhaps Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle's mealy mouthed defense of Lott after Lott made remarks
that the non-Beltway world saw as openly racist. As for Gore's own
recent decision to take traditional Democratic stands on tax cuts and
backing the United Nations on Iraq, they came too late to help him or
his party.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Democratic candidates can start by targeting each other,
and more power to them. Where should the party stand on secret court
proceedings for proclaimed terrorist enemies? For the idea of
monitoring the daily lives of ordinary citizens? Does it make sense,
as President Bush is urging, to give the CIA a largely free hand in
assassinating foreign leaders? Then there's the economy. What is the
Democratic message going to be -- roll back the Bush tax cuts?
Targeted tax cuts for low- and middle-income workers? Health
insurance reforms?</TE>
<TE>   If the Democratic Party doesn't find a way to make itself
relevant, it could be in the political wilderness like the GOP after
Richard Nixon narrowly and bitterly lost to John F. Kennedy in the
1960 election. It took eight years for the party -- and of course
Nixon himself -- to come roaring back.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats' success will depend on their being able to summon
the gumption to challenge the White House, which can only benefit.
One-party government doesn't help any party. Every government, even
one that prefers keeping the focus on terrorism, needs its loyal
opposition.</TE>

<LD>The United States has a good story about democracy, free markets,
individual rights. U.S. embassies should be telling it loudly abroad,
their voices amplified by U.S.-financed broadcasting operations like
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.</LD>
<LD>   The way not to tell it is by surreptitiously putting foreign
journalists on the CIA or the Defense Department payroll. That taints
the information and imperils reputations and lives when the payoffs
become known, as they eventually do. Yet the Pentagon, for the second
time in a little over a year, is reported to be debating secret
propaganda operations in friendly or neutral nations.</LD>
<LD>   In November 2001, the Defense Department established the Office of
Strategic Influence. It supposedly would concentrate on influencing
foreign media to counteract lies spread by hostile governments and
individuals on outlets like Al Jazeera, the newly powerful Middle
Eastern radio and television operation favored by Osama bin Laden for
his statements.</LD>
<TE>   Although Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon
itself would not lie, other officers said the new office also
proposed spreading false information to foreign journalists as a
means of furthering the U.S. war on terrorism. (The CIA agreed in
1977 not to hire U.S. reporters to spy or disguise its operatives as
reporters.) The office shut down in February after waves of
criticism. Clearing out the desks seems not to have erased the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, wartime "disinformation" has a long history, most
notably the successful attempt to convince Nazi Germany that the
D-Day invasion of Europe would start somewhere other than Normandy.
But keeping a tight lid on military operations or feinting about
where they will occur is a far cry from trying in peacetime to
psychologically influence allies and hide the government's role. Even
worse is taking the next step beyond clandestinely paying foreign
journalists to favor the United States: planting outright lies. In
the age of global information, 24-hour newscasts and the Internet,
false stories quickly boomerang to their point of origin.</TE>
<TE>   When foreign journalists are exposed as U.S. agents, suspicion
falls on U.S. reporters in other countries as well. That impedes
their efforts to get untainted information and makes them targets for
radicals eager to kill a U.S. agent.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should tell its story. When the United States
Information Agency was independent, it fought to keep libraries and
information centers open, spreading its message far and wide. The
State Department, always uncomfortable with that independence and
sometimes preferring not to upset host countries, absorbed the USIA
three years ago. Financing libraries overseas, even schools, is fine.
Just identify them as U.S. creations. Tell the American story, the
good and the bad, and depend on the truth to be persuasive.</TE>

<LD>Buried among the Christmas ads in your Dec. 13 paper was the
announcement of President Bush's decree (whoops, executive order) to
hand over our tax dollars to religious organizations to discriminate
and proselytize as government contractors providing social services
-- a.k.a. the "faith-based initiative." It is clearly payback to the
religious right, a major player in the Republican Party. Sounds to me
like our government is promoting religion and is therefore in clear
violation of the separation of church and state.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Mythic Enemy," Opinion, Dec. 15: Father Gregory Boyle states,
"The people of L.A. are less interested in getting angry about gangs
and more determined than ever to see law enforcement choose smarter
strategies in dealing with them."</LD>
<LD>   Wrong. I'm glad the new Los Angeles Police Department chief,
William Bratton, is angry. As for strategy -- political correctness,
community policing and neighborhood chumminess aside -- the only
thing I and the citizens of L.A. are interested in (I'll be as
assumptive as Father Boyle) is results. If Boyle truly wants the new
chief to succeed, perhaps he could convince the gangbangers and the
gang members to wear different uniforms. That would help the police
enforce the law and, more important, ensure nobody's feelings were
getting hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Siegel</LD>

<TE>   Boyle demonstrates that he misses the whole point of the gang
problem when he writes: "If police can understand that their job is
to isolate those gang members who 'bang'...."</TE>
<TE>   Gangs are by definition criminal organizations in their entire
membership. If they aren't at all criminal, then they're not gangs
and should be called by another name. Every gang member should be
kept in jail until he or she renounces gang membership. Bratton and
our representatives should be demanding that Congress amend the RICO
Act in such a way that we can successfully go after the gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kuhn</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The gangs aren't enemies; they are kids living in poverty without
hope. I urge Bratton to hire Boyle as a consultant and bring empathy,
help and caring to these hopeless young people. The whole area should
find and finance programs to keep them off the streets and help them
strive toward a productive future. What we can do is volunteer with
youth centers in our cities. If you don't have time to volunteer,
send a donation.</TE>

intelligence officer, I've tried to prevent misidentifying people as
gang members or associates. Usually a war on gangs produces both
"good" and "bad" arrests. The latter concern me, because of
California's three-strikes laws and harsh sentencing enhancements for
individuals with gang affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   At peril, too, are reformed gang members. Because of old gang
tattoos, many reformed gang members may unfairly be sent back to
prison.</TE>
<TE>   I am not surprised, though, that the community luminaries quoted,
who have the mayor's ear, offer no solution or plan to abate the
collateral damage that normally occurs when police-versus-gang
contacts are analyzed by quantity rather than by quality. The answer
to the gang dilemma is neither with the luminaries nor the
appointment of an LAPD "gang czar." The solution can be found closer
to the people and away from the politics.</TE>

<LD>The decision to offer smallpox vaccine at this time (Dec. 12, 13) is
clearly a wise one. The only effective place to store any vaccine is
within the population. We should not depend upon a delivery system
(especially in an emergency) that must transport, within four days,
smallpox vaccine from its storage depot to qualified personnel for
proper administration to the mass population.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, and in response to the controversy, by vaccinating
the public before an act of terrorism, we will be able to do so
selectively, reducing the risk of vaccinating those who would be at
high risk for complications from the vaccine.</LD>

<TE>   Does anyone know whether the Iraqis, and indeed Saddam Hussein
himself, have been vaccinated against smallpox or have an available
vaccine for their population? For if they have not taken these steps,
then the release of smallpox anywhere in the world is likely to
devastate their population. Epidemics are impossible to contain in
this well-traveled world. If they have not been vaccinated and do not
have a tested vaccine, then the release of smallpox would be stupid
indeed for them -- and raises the question of whether vaccinating our
population is warranted.</TE>

<TE>   Smallpox is much in the news these days. It is interesting to note
that naturally occurring smallpox virus has been eradicated since
1980. This horrible scourge of mankind, which decimated countless
societies in the past, was finally conquered through international
efforts to vaccinate the world's population. Question: What sick,
political minds in this country and in Russia conspired to keep this
pox alive? And to what end, other than to threaten society with
biowarfare no matter how horrific its outcome, and thereby resurrect
an ancient plague?</TE>
<TE>   Why do officials at the United Nations and the World Health
Organization allow this to happen?</TE>

<LD>Thank you for Michael Ramirez's editorial cartoon (Commentary, Dec.
12) demonstrating the self-promoting folly of actors speaking out on
issues such as a possible war with Iraq. While I respect their right
to speak out on their views and use their celebrity to bring
attention to the issue, I do not understand why people pay any
attention to them. Who are we to believe regarding the dangers that
the Iraqi regime presents -- United States, British and other
government intelligence that resulted in a bipartisan bill
authorizing the president to take action against Iraq or actors who
play roles for a living?</LD>
<LD>   Are these the people who should be advising the president on the
balance he strikes between diplomacy and military force? I do not
think so.</LD>

<HD>Physical Education a Weighty Subject</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "26% of Kids Overweight, Study Finds" (Dec. 12), it was quite
disturbing to find out that there are kids in middle school who weigh
over 200 pounds. That's more than I -- a 36-year-old male -- weigh
now.</LD>
<LD>   When I grew up, my school had a physical education class every
day. I think it took an act of God to get excused from P.E. We kids
played kickball, softball and basketball, on blacktop no less. You
learned to take your bumps and bruises or stay on your feet. At home,
after school or on the weekends, unless it was raining or getting
dark, we were outside. Not watching TV, playing video games or
sitting around eating. We were always active.</LD>
<LD>   Now the dialogue with my two boys may go something like this:
"Dad, it's boring outside. Can we watch TV?"</LD>
<TE>   "The sun's out, it's not raining, and it's not dark. What do you
think?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, Dad."</TE>
<TE>   "Good. Go outside."</TE>
<TE>   Healthy habits start at home. It's time to take away the video
games and send your kids outside to play.</TE>
<TE>   Jason L. Williams</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The no-soda approach is a Band-Aid! School districts need to
eliminate the sale of chips and other fat-laden snacks and foods. We
also need to mandate physical education or alternative fitness
programs for every child in our public schools for every term and
eliminate the requirement that they need only two years of P.E. to
graduate from high school.</TE>

<HD>John Crosby, 76; Founder of the Santa Fe Opera Was Called a
Pioneer for Innovative Repertory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Crosby, the visionary founder and former general director of the
Santa Fe Opera, died Sunday at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital in Rancho
Mirage from complications following surgery. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Crosby was the Santa Fe Opera's artistic head and chief conductor
from its founding in 1957 until 2000, when he retired. His last act
as its full-time leader came on Aug. 24 when he led a performance of
Richard Strauss' "Elektra." It was his 171st time on the podium for a
Strauss opera -- Strauss was his favorite composer -- and
approximately his 567th as a conductor for the company he had
founded.</LD>
<LD>   Crosby created not just a company, but a summer opera event. "It
was often said that he made opera bloom in the desert, but saying it
often makes the accomplishment no less remarkable," said Times music
critic Mark Swed. "With Santa Fe Opera, you could say that festival
opera came into its own in America."</LD>
<TE>   "The impact he had on the world of opera is as close to
immeasurable as anything could be," Santa Fe Opera general director
Richard Gaddes said Monday. "He was a pioneer in providing work for
young American singers, in creating an ensemble company, and in
presenting adventurous repertory both contemporary and neglected
classics."</TE>
<TE>   Describing his creation in a 1974 interview, Crosby said: "What I
was after was a festival, a distinguished series of events presented
in a very special way and made possible by long advance and careful
off-season planning."</TE>
<TE>   His vision worked. Over the years, thousands of visitors flocked
to his open-sided theater nestled in a natural bowl of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains in New Mexico's high desert. Santa Fe Opera was
dubbed "the Salzburg of the Southwest," a comparison with Austria's
venerable and influential opera festival.</TE>
<TE>   The first season in Santa Fe was budgeted at $110,000 and included
28 performances of seven operas. The company sold 12,850 tickets,
filling the original 480-seat house over and over. This summer, SFO
sold 73,726 tickets to 37 performances of five operas in its newly
refurbished 2,236-seat house. The budget has grown to $12.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sensible about the box office, Crosby balanced the new, the old
and the neglected. Repertory the first season included Puccini's
fail-safe "Madame Butterfly" -- the inaugural production -- but also
Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" (1951) and a premiere of Marvin
David Levy's "The Tower."</TE>
<TE>   Stravinsky attended the festival's rehearsals, and his presence
gave the company instant international stature.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby would go on to commission or present more than 33 U.S. or
world premieres of operas by living composers such as Benjamin
Britten, Hans Werner Henze, Gian-Carlo Menotti, Heitor Villa-Lobos
and Carlisle Floyd, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby's affection for Strauss was also clear in the programming
of Santa Fe Opera. He staged many of Strauss' works for the first
time in the U.S. "He was largely responsible for interest in Strauss
in this country," Gaddes said.</TE>
<TE>   One important draw for the company was its Santa Fe setting. The
open-air theater, a few miles outside town, had no proscenium and no
curtain. For many years, the house's middle row seats were exposed to
the elements. Patrons there could look up at the stars, but also had
to huddle beneath blankets during cold evenings and -- during sudden
summer showers -- to don raincoats.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when the back of the stage was left open, as a natural
backdrop for the night scene in "Madame Butterfly," for instance, the
audience could see the twinkling lights of Los Alamos in the
distance. Time magazine once called it "one of the handsomest
operatic settings in the Western hemisphere."</TE>
<TE>   John O'Hea Crosby was born in New York City on July 12, 1926. To
treat an asthmatic condition, he was sent to Los Alamos Boys Ranch
School, where he developed an abiding love for New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Crosby played in his Army infantry regiment's
dance band. After the war, he attended Yale University and earned a
bachelor's in music theory and composition, studying under 20th
century composer Paul Hindemith. (Eleven years later, in 1961, Crosby
would bring Hindemith to Santa Fe for the U.S. premiere of his opera
"News of the Day.")</TE>
<TE>   Crosby worked as a Broadway arranger and studied at Columbia
University, where he became interested in opera and decided to make
it the focus of his life. He left New York City for Santa Fe intent
on founding an opera company. He had $200,000 in seed money from his
father, a New York City attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He purchased an old ranch north of Santa Fe and oversaw
construction of the original 450-seat open-air wooden theater. The
following summer, Crosby and his company of 65 members were ready to
present their first season. Crosby had already inaugurated an
apprentice program for singers -- the first in the country -- and
expanded it later to include technical apprentices. Graduates of the
program include such current opera stars as Sherrill Milnes, Samuel
Ramey and Leona Mitchell, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Artists who made their United States debuts at Santa Fe include
soprano Kiri Te Kanawa and tenor Bryn Terfel. But many of the world's
leading opera stars have sung there.</TE>
<TE>   "He was crucial for American opera since he nurtured many of the
great singers. He gave breaks to many musicians, directors and
designers," said Francesca Zambello, a noted international opera
director. "He had the ability to spot talent and guide you to do your
best as an artist. He was an impresario, and we don't have many of
them."</TE>
<TE>   The opera's theater, which had been enlarged in 1958 to seat 700,
was destroyed by fire in 1967. A larger, fireproof theater was
budgeted at $1.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That year my hair turned white," Crosby said. "I believe in
losing money, but lose it on things you want to lose it on. My
approach is simple: Under-staff and work the hell out of everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The opera house was again remade in 1998, fully roofed and the
sides glassed in an award-winning renovation.</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement at the end of the 2000 season, Crosby moved
to Palm Springs. But he remained involved with Santa Fe Opera. He
returned to the podium for Verdi's "La Traviata" last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby was awarded a National Medal of Arts from President George
H.W. Bush in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the Manhattan School of Music from 1976 to
1986 and president of Opera America from 1976 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his brother, James O'Hea Crosby, of Coral
Gables, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Nani Palkhivala, 82; Served as India's Ambassador to U.S.</HD>

<LD>Nani Palkhivala, 82, India's foremost constitutional lawyer and a
vocal champion of human rights who served as ambassador to the United
States in the late 1970s, died of a heart attack Wednesday in Bombay.</LD>
<LD>   Palkhivala had an unusual career. Not only was he preeminent in
constitutional law, but he was also a businessman and a popular
lecturer on India's economy who wrote a classic text on Indian tax
law.</LD>
<LD>   He represented Indira Gandhi after the 1971 election when she was
accused of election fraud by her defeated opponent. Palkhivala took
her case out of principle, even though he had opposed her government.</LD>
<TE>   The High Court of Allahabad ruled against Gandhi in 1975 but
granted a 20-day stay for her to lodge an appeal with the Supreme
Court. Opposition leaders launched a civil disobedience campaign to
force her to step down. When she responded by imposing a state of
emergency, Palkhivala resigned as her attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He was appointed ambassador to the U.S. after Gandhi lost
reelection in 1977 to Morarji Desai. The choice of the well-regarded
human rights advocate was widely seen as a sign that the new Indian
government wanted better relations with the Carter administration.</TE>
<TE>   However, Palkhivala was recalled in 1979 after an embarrassing
incident in which he was photographed helping Lillian Carter,
President Carter's mother, put on a shoe. Many Indians, who regard
shoes as unclean, were shocked.</TE>

<HD>Eli Ginzberg, 91; Economist Advised Eight Presidents</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Ginzberg, 91, a longtime Columbia University economist who wrote
extensively about labor and health care and advised eight U.S.
presidents, died Thursday at his home in New York City. The cause of
death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Ginzberg grew up a few blocks from Columbia, where he taught for
more than 60 years.</LD>
<LD>   The son of an eminent Talmudic scholar, he earned his bachelor's
degree in 1931 and his doctorate in economics in 1934, both from
Columbia. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1935.</LD>
<TE>   In 1939, after spending a year touring 40 states, he published
"The Illusion of Economic Stability," a series of recommendations on
reforming the regulatory and monetary systems.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, he co-wrote a major study for the Conservation of Human
Resources Project at Columbia's Graduate School of Business that
called for the expansion of the federal role in education.</TE>
<TE>   With his Columbia colleagues, he later wrote a three-volume study
on the problems of the segregated Army called "The Ineffective
Soldier: Lessons for Management and the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, he helped launch the Manpower Demonstration Research
Corp., a nonprofit that assesses domestic social programs such as
welfare.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Ginzberg focused on health-care issues such as the
possible oversupply of doctors and the causes of runaway medical
costs.</TE>

<HD>Zal Yanovsky, 57; Co-Founder of the Lovin' Spoonful</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zal Yanovsky, 57, a guitar player with the 1960s group the Lovin'
Spoonful, died of a heart attack Friday in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Yanovsky founded the band with singer-guitarist John Sebastian.
Seen as America's answer to the Beatles in the mid-1960s, the group
had 10 Top 20 hits in two years, including "Do You Believe in Magic?"
and "Summer in the City."</LD>
<LD>   Yanovsky was the extrovert of the group who "provided the group's
visual identity while his exceptional and underrated guitar playing
was a vital fixture of their overall sound," according to the
Encyclopedia of Popular Music.</LD>
<TE>   He was arrested on a marijuana charge in San Francisco in 1966
with bass player Steve Boone but avoided prosecution when they
incriminated their supplier. The ensuing publicity sparked an outcry
from their fans, who called for a boycott of their records and
concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Yanovsky left the band in 1967. The rest of the group broke up
soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Yanovsky recorded a solo album, "Alive and Well in Argentina," in
1968. He was not involved in revivals of the band in later years and
eventually withdrew from the music business. He moved to Canada,
where he opened a restaurant and bakery.</TE>

<LD>One of Pete Rose's biggest boosters is Rocky Mountain News columnist
Bernie Lincicome, who writes:</LD>
<LD>   "Pete Rose has my vote for the Hall of Fame just as soon as he is
allowed to get it, just as soon as by writing his name on the ballot
it does not immediately combust from the inherent wickedness of the
letters R and O and so forth.</LD>
<LD>   "Rose ... is the living pariah who was the most enjoyable of
baseball companions, a man whose affection for the game was returned
in kind, and Rose's base hits added up to more than anyone before or
anyone next.</LD>
<TE>   "The Hall of Fame will make Rose no better nor worse. But Rose
would make the Hall of Fame more genuine."</TE>
<TE>   More Lincicome: "Eddie Murray, on the other hand, will have to
wait for my vote, although Murray is very likely the best new name on
this year's ballot and a thoroughly unpleasant man. Murray moped his
way through a Hall of Fame career, making no friends I ever knew of."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What do NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach,
Angel hitting coach Mickey Hatcher and Tampa Bay wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson have in common?</TE>
<TE>   Dixie logic: Philadelphia Eagle cornerback Sheldon Brown, who is
from South Carolina, was not prepared for the ice storm that hit the
Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "In South Carolina, nobody goes out in this," Brown told assistant
coach John Harbaugh, who told USA Today Sports Weekly, "Sheldon
thought practice would be called off, like school used to be called
off."</TE>
<TE>   Not in Green Bay: San Francisco 49er Coach Steve Mariucci's recipe
for success in the NFL playoffs: "The three H's: healthy, hot and
home."</TE>
<TE>   Who knows: Do you ever wonder how NBA officials decide between
charging and blocking? Utah Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan has the same
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they got a little bit dizzy trying to figure out which
direction they're going to call," he said after watching his team
lose to Sacramento on four free throws in the final 8.5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Tongue twister: Are you ready for this, John Madden?</TE>
<TE>   Chijokae Onyenegecha, San Francisco City College cornerback, is
considered a hot prospect for the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Roberto: Nearly 30 years after he died in a plane
crash on New Year's Eve, 1972, Roberto Clemente is being remembered
in an exhibit of art and memorabilia in his native Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items on display are a 1994 Liberian coin bearing
Clemente's image, postage stamps from the U.S. and Grenada, and an
early photograph of Clemente wearing No. 39 instead of his more
familiar 21.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: All were J.C. Grid-Wire junior college
All-Americans -- Staubach in 1960 with New Mexico Military, Hatcher
in 1975 as an end at Mesa, Ariz., and Johnson in 1993 at West Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Former Super Bowl coach and TV analyst Bill Parcells
gave USA Today Sports Weekly his take on the hype surrounding Atlanta
Falcon quarterback Michael Vick:</TE>
<TE>   "Can we let him get one [championship] banner up in the gym before
we put him in Canton, please?"</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</LD>
<TE>   What started as a private letter from Martha Burk, chairwoman of
the National Council of Women's Organizations, to Hootie Johnson,
chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, developed into a firestorm.
Much has been reported about Burk's campaign to have a woman admitted
to Augusta, site of the Masters. Opinions have been expressed,
editorials written.</TE>
<TE>   HBO provides a look at who Burk is and what motivates her in the
lead segment on this edition of "Real Sports." And Bryant Gumbel, the
show's host, who doesn't do many interviews, does this one.</TE>
<TE>   Burk tells Gumbel that this is not a personal crusade, that she
went through her board and her membership.</TE>
<TE>   She describes herself as a full-time women's rights advocate. She
grew up in Texas and lived there while she raised her two children.
She says being a stay-at-home mom wasn't enough. That's what
motivated her interest in women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel conducts a balanced interview, presenting both sides of the
argument.</TE>
<TE>   "A club has a right, a legal right, to basically define its
membership as its wishes," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Burk answers, "If Augusta wants to be a private club, it needs to
act like a private club. It cannot have it both ways. They can't say,
'We're just a few old boys on the back nine, but we want the public,
billions of people, into our living room, figuratively.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of Tiger Woods' role, she says, "From day one, we have said that
Tiger Woods should not be required to speak out alone. But Tiger
Woods has a unique opportunity here, more so than the other players
because of who he is. As you know, Augusta for many years had a rule
that all caddies were black men and all players were white men."</TE>
<TE>   Burk takes a shot at CBS, which televises the Masters, calling it
"an anti-woman network." She cites its tolerance of Andy Rooney as an
example.</TE>

<HD>Most Unconvinced on Iraq War</HD>
<DH>Two-thirds believe Bush has failed to make the case an
attack would be justified. Many think weapons are there, but they
want proof.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite a concerted effort by the Bush administration, more than
two-thirds of Americans believe the president has failed to make the
case that a war with Iraq is justified, according to a Los Angeles
Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   The overwhelming majority of respondents -- 90% -- said they do
not doubt that Iraq is developing weapons of mass destruction. But in
the absence of new evidence from U.N. inspectors, 72% of respondents,
including 60% of Republicans, said the president has not provided
enough evidence to justify starting a war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The results underscore the importance of the outcome of U.N. arms
inspections underway in Iraq if the Bush administration expects to
gain clear public support for an attack.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not against [war] if it is necessary," said 59-year-old
Kramer Smith, a preacher, carpenter and registered Republican from
Bloomfield, Iowa, one of a number of respondents who explained their
views in follow-up interviews. "But I think we need to be pretty sure
before we start pulling in the big guns. If they could put their
hands on evidence of real production of weapons of mass destruction,
then I would say go ahead and do it."</TE>
<TE>   The poll also found that support for a possible war appears to be
weakening, with 58% saying they support a ground attack on Iraq. In
an August Times poll, 64% said they would support a ground attack.
Last January, after President Bush first denounced Saddam Hussein in
his State of the Union address, the Times and other polls found
support for military action greater than 70%.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, almost three-quarters of Americans approve of the way
George W. Bush is handling the threat of terrorism in the country,
and nearly three out of five also approve of his handling of the
country's affairs," said Susan Pinkus, who directed The Times poll.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, support is low before a president declares war, but
increases after troops are in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "If he actually does go to war, I suspect people will swing behind
him as they did in the Gulf War," said John Mueller, an expert on war
and public opinion at Ohio State University. "But right now, there
isn't all that much enthusiasm for the war."</TE>
<TE>   That lack of support may stem from the impression that the
president has failed to present enough hard evidence to prove that
Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction and is prepared to use
them. The administration has spent much of the last three months
trying to build a case for war -- internationally at the United
Nations, and domestically during the president's frenetic campaigning
in advance of midterm elections last month.</TE>
<TE>   "How come they can show satellite photos of nuclear sites in Iran
but they can't find the same in Iraq?" asked Nancy Carolan, 52, a
jewelry artist on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. "I don't think
they're justified, but they are just going to do it anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The poll also indicates that Americans do not agree with the
president's argument that any error or omission in the arms
declaration Iraq sent to the United Nations earlier this month is
adequate to justify war.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, 63% of respondents said war would be justified only if
the United Nations finds a pattern of serious violations by Iraq.
Just 22% agreed with the administration's position; 6% said it would
depend on the nature of the omissions; and 9% said they were not sure
or declined to reply.</TE>
<TE>   Almost six in 10 say it is unlikely that the U.N. inspectors will
find Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't doubt that they do" have weapons of mass destruction,
said respondent Victoria Ellison, 57, a Democrat from Burbank. "But I
want to see proof. "</TE>
<TE>   If U.N. inspections fail to turn up evidence of Iraqi weapons
programs, almost half of respondents said they would oppose war. Only
41% would favor war, and 10% said they don't know whether they would
favor or oppose.</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll also suggests Americans are more informed about the
possibility of war with Iraq, with 84% saying they are following the
news closely -- up from 76% in August. Sixty-three percent of
respondents in the recent poll said they feel war is inevitable, 27%
said war may or may not occur, and 4% said they believed war would
not occur.</TE>
<TE>   Respondents also expressed concern that the president may not be
getting balanced information from his advisors. Fifty-one percent of
respondents said they believe Bush's advisors favor going to war; 20%
said the advisors present a balanced view; and 11% said the advisors
are opposed to war. Roughly a fifth said they are not sure whether
Bush's advisors favor or oppose war.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States should launch an attack, 68% of Americans
want it to be only with the support of the international community.
Only 26% said they were willing to support war if the United States
acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not opposed to doing something, but it would have to be in
the right circumstances," said Geoff George, a 20-year-old
independent from Albany, Ore. "I would probably be a little more
supportive if the U.N. and the rest of the world united and we all
decided to do it together. But [if we act] as one nation, I don't
think there would ever be enough evidence for me."</TE>
<TE>   However, at least theoretically, Americans agree with the
administration's argument that sometimes preemptive or preventive war
is justified. Sixty-four percent of respondents, including 49% of
Democrats, believe the United States should reserve the right to
launch a preemptive attack against regimes that threaten the country.
Only 25% said they opposed such a policy, and 11% said they did not
have an opinion on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States does go to war, the decision is likely to
have serious ramifications at home and abroad, respondents said.
Sixty-seven percent said war is likely to increase the threat of
terrorist attacks in the United States; 51% said they feel it would
destabilize the Middle East; and 45% said it will have a negative
effect on the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   They are also concerned about the possibility of military
casualties. Of those who initially said they support a ground attack
against Iraq, 18% said they would do so only if no American soldiers
are killed. However, support falls off gradually as the theoretical
death toll is raised, but 29% said they would support war no matter
what the cost in American lives.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the wake of a war, the vast majority of Americans --
70%, according to the poll -- feel the country has an obligation to
stay and rebuild Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll was conducted Dec. 12 to 15 and interviewed 1,305
adults nationwide. Margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3
percentage points.</TE>

<TE>   How the poll was conducted: The Times Poll contacted 1,305
Americans nationwide by telephone Dec. 12-15. Telephone numbers were
chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers
could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted slightly to
conform with census figures for sex, race, age, education and region.
The margin of sampling error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3
percentage points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors
such as question wording and the order in which questions are
presented.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Women Still Being Persecuted, Activists Report</HD>
<DH>Rights group says the freedoms that flowered in the
Taliban's wake meet with repression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women in Afghanistan face a growing wave of human rights abuses in
the western city of Herat, where talking to strange men can cause
them to be subjected to practices such as chastity examinations,
according to a report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Human Rights Watch said the restrictions imposed on
women in the province of Herat under Gov. Ismail Khan, a former
militia leader, recall the severe dictates of the Islamic
fundamentalist Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   The report said Herat is not the only Afghan region where women
and girls face intimidation. In five other provinces, it said,
schools for girls have been attacked with rockets or set on fire.
Taliban-era restrictions are being imposed by other regional
authorities, who ban music or impose the head-to-toe burka on women,
it said. Female students have reportedly been threatened by armed men
on their way to school.</LD>
<TE>   "While western Afghanistan is perhaps the worst of what's
happening to women and girls, it's hardly unique," said Zama
Coursen-Neff, a coauthor of the report. "There is growing repression
of women and girls in Afghanistan. It's mostly men with guns deciding
what's going to happen with women and girls."</TE>
<TE>   The report found that the rights of women and girls in the city of
Herat improved after the fall of the Taliban, with many returning to
school or jobs. But the advances were met by the social policing of
girls and women.</TE>
<TE>   The Herat government encourages even schoolboys to spy on girls
and women and report "un-Islamic" behavior, such as walking
unaccompanied at night, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   It said Herat police have stopped and questioned women found alone
with men -- even the drivers of taxicabs -- and arrested those who
were not related. Police bring the men to jail but take women to a
hospital for exams to determine whether they have had sex recently
or, if they are single, whether they are virgins, the report said.
Girls deemed improperly veiled have been beaten.</TE>
<TE>   The report called on the United States to halt military and other
assistance to independent leaders such as Khan and to pressure Afghan
regional governments to repeal any decrees that restrict or degrade
women.</TE>
<TE>   It called on international forces to station peacekeepers outside
the capital and for the United Nations to expand human rights
monitoring in provincial Afghanistan. It urged international donors
to support Afghan women's groups.</TE>
<TE>   Coursen-Neff pointed out that the Bush administration cited the
abuse of women in its effort to build support for military action
against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people outside of Afghanistan think Afghan women
have regained many of the rights they lost under the Taliban," she
said. "The international community has not delivered on its promise
to Afghan women."</TE>

<HD>Mbeki Urges ANC to Seek More Changes</HD>
<DH>South Africa's leader tells his party that apartheid left a
legacy of inequity and division.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>STELLENBOSCH, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Dressed in a green and black African National Congress T-shirt,
President Thabo Mbeki addressed 5,000 party faithful Monday, opening
a five-day conference to determine the movement's leadership and
policies through 2007.</LD>
<LD>   In a two-hour speech, Mbeki came across as conciliatory and
managerial, touting the achievements of South Africa's preeminent
political machine and outlining future challenges.</LD>
<LD>   Mbeki said the location of the conference at the University of
Stellenbosch -- the intellectual center of the previous, white
supremacist regime -- sent a powerful message eight years after the
ANC came to power.</LD>
<TE>   "That message says that the people of South Africa have made the
common determination that our country belongs to all who live in it,
black and white," he said. "It says that the people of South Africa,
black and white ... refuse to be enslaved by the divisions and
antagonisms of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Mbeki's speech focused on the need for the ANC to address
the lingering racial inequities of apartheid and the deepening class
divisions since it ended.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulk of our economy, including the land, remains
predominantly white-owned," he said. "Wealth, income, opportunity and
skills continue to be distributed according to racial patterns.
Accordingly, the overwhelming majority of the poor and the
unemployed, even on a per capita basis, are black people."</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki said that state industries like South Africa's
telecommunications, energy and transport sectors need to attract
foreign investment to free up resources for social and infrastructure
development. He said instituting sweeping affirmative action policies
would diversify corporate ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The president also said that recent terrorist acts by white
extremists in South Africa showed the desperation of the nation's
far-right factions and proved that "the forces of extreme racism have
no possibility to capture state power or to play a decisive role in
our national life."</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki denounced corruption within the ranks of the ANC as his
deputy president and onetime rival for leadership, Jacob Zuma, looked
on. Zuma is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes from the
French arms manufacturer Thomson-CSF.</TE>
<TE>   Absent from Mbeki's speech was any major mention of South Africa's
raging HIV epidemic. One out of every 10 South Africans has the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, and although the highest
court has affirmed a constitutional right to antiviral treatment,
Mbeki's administration hasn't formulated a plan to provide infected
people with the appropriate drugs. AIDS was mentioned only once in
his address, when Mbeki pointed out that more black people than white
people have the disease.</TE>
<TE>   For most of his speech, Mbeki stuck close to his script, breaking
off briefly only once -- when former President Nelson Mandela walked
in through a side door and set off a round of singing in Xhosa and
Tswana: "Nelson Mandela, there's no one like you."</TE>

invalidated by low turnout.</LD>
<LD>   Kostunica's party said Serbia's election commission had inflated
voter lists by as many as 835,000 names using names of deceased or
nonexistent people.</LD>
<LD>   Official results show that voter turnout was less than the
required 50% in elections this month and in October.</LD>
<TE>   Kostunica's party also said that turnout had reached 50% and that
Kostunica, who finished first, should be proclaimed the winner. But
the court ruled that the commission had acted appropriately.</TE>

emissions in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   While nearly 100 countries have ratified it, the rejection of the
treaty by the U.S. -- responsible for 36.1% of emissions in 1990 --

<HD>Nuclear Plans May Put Food Aid for N. Korea at Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>North Korea's declared intention to resume its nuclear program has
further jeopardized a critical lifeline to millions of the country's
most impoverished citizens whose survival could depend on
international assistance, diplomats and aid officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously this can't help," commented an Asian-based aid
specialist dealing with the issue, who declined to be named. "We
can't be optimistic."</LD>
<LD>   Another aid official said donor countries were showing reluctance
to pledge new commitments of humanitarian assistance to North Korea
for next year, in part because of the nuclear issue.</LD>
<TE>   Although isolated from much of the world diplomatically, the
hard-line communist country receives desperately needed humanitarian
aid ranging from health and nutritional care to food grain, mainly
through the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Since the World Food Program first began delivering grain and rice
to North Korea in the mid-1990s to ease suffering from years of
famine, the project has grown to become the U.N. agency's biggest
ever. It began this year by targeting 6.4 million people -- about
one-quarter of the country's 24 million people.</TE>
<TE>   However, the project's first shortfall of donations -- one that
began well before the present political crisis -- has forced it to
cut the number of recipients by nearly half since September,
according to Beijing-based World Food Program spokesman Gerald
Bourke.</TE>
<TE>   "These are among the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, including
pregnant women and nursing mothers," Bourke said.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 survey conducted after international aid began to flow
found that nearly two-thirds of the children studied suffered from
chronic malnutrition. While conditions are believed to have improved
since then, the new escalation of tensions could quickly exacerbate
conditions in the country, aid officials say.</TE>
<TE>   As an indicator of the new pressure on North Korea, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang, the North's capital, accused the
United States on Monday of setting "unreasonable conditions" for
continuing its food deliveries and "obstructing humanitarian aid by
every possible means and method, even politicizing it."</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman, unnamed in the report carried by Pyongyang's
official Korean Central News Agency, also said the U.S. move was tied
to the nuclear dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "That's wrong," a senior State Department official said Monday,
adding that President Bush has repeatedly stated that America will
not use food as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The United States this year shipped 155,000 tons of wheat to the
North, making it the single largest contributor to the U.N.'s food
assistance. But earlier this month, the Bush administration for the
first time indicated that it might not respond to appeals for more
aid next year unless Pyongyang allowed more monitoring of aid
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows?" about the 2003 pledge, the State Department official
said. "We don't even have a budget yet."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, warned in June, before the disclosures of
North Korea's uranium enrichment program, that "consideration of
additional food aid to North Korea will depend on verifiable
progress" in expanding access and improving monitoring of food aid
distribution. But officials say North Korean transparency has not
improved.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McCarthy, a frequent visitor to North Korea who consults on
agricultural issues, said, "It is true that the U.S. has faithfully
complied with its commitments to provide aid to North Korea," but the
future is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has ever denied that most of the food aid has gone to
vulnerable populations," McCarthy said. "The U.S. appears ready to
politicize food aid.... At a moment of rising anti-Americanism in
South Korea, the U.S. has decided to put the issue of feeding
vulnerable North Korean children and elderly on the table."</TE>
<TE>   The current nuclear crisis with Pyongyang is virtually impossible
to isolate from attitudes in potential donor countries, aid officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's announcement Thursday that it planned to restart its
nuclear program marked the latest step in the unraveling of a 1994
agreement signed with the United States that at the time seemed to
end a budding nuclear threat. Under that accord, known as the Agreed
Framework, the U.S. offered to provide North Korea two new,
safeguarded nuclear power plants along with shipments of heating oil
to meet its energy needs, if Pyongyang agreed to freeze its own,
potentially bomb-producing, nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Rotterdam on Sunday, former President Bill Clinton
said Pyongyang at the time was planning to use plutonium from its
nuclear plants to produce as many as eight bombs a year and that his
administration had been ready to destroy North Korea's nuclear plants
if it had refused to accept the compromise solution.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Agreed Framework held together for eight years, the
deal was never far from controversy. It suffered a major blow in
October when North Korea suddenly confessed that it was operating a
weapons-oriented uranium enrichment project. The U.S., in
consultation with key allies, including Japan and South Korea,
responded by suspending heating oil shipments. A shipment that was
due to arrive Sunday has been stopped.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to demanding an end to restrictions on the monitoring
of food aid disbursement, the Bush administration has called for
broader distribution across the country as well as a study to
determine the impact of the assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by telephone from Beijing, World Food Program spokesman
Bourke said that U.N. monitors operating in North Korea this year had
been able to increase their visits to distribution sites by about
one-third and to meet for the first time with small groups of aid
recipients to better understand their needs.</TE>
<TE>   In October, more than 6,000 mother-child pairs were checked in the
first nutritional survey in four years, Bourke said. He added that
the results would be available next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant step," he said. "It will help us a lot in
directing our aid."</TE>
<TE>   Whether these measures will be enough to meet U.S. demands in the
present climate is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Bush administration commits the U.S. to sending food
for 2003, last year's suspension of aid from major donor Japan amid
deteriorating bilateral ties with Pyongyang will make it hard to meet
U.N. targets, Bourke said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tokyo on Monday, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe said
Japan had no plans to authorize new food aid shipments.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Food Program recently reported that it is short ... of
food aid, but Japan is not considering anything whatsoever," Abe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Abe indicated that any easing of ties with Pyongyang hinged on the
release of families of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korean
agents during the 1970s.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Exiles Edge Warily Toward Unity</HD>
<DH>Opposition agrees to a new committee that will design a
blueprint for post-Hussein rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In a fragile display of unity, Iraqi opposition groups agreed Monday
to create a joint coordinating committee and a plan to establish
democracy in Iraq if Saddam Hussein falls.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders announced the accord after a sleepless weekend of
negotiations at a two-day conference that brought together more than
320 delegates from Europe, the Middle East and the United States. But
longtime rifts among the Iraqi exiles forced them to continue
negotiations Monday over some of the appointments to the new
committee.</LD>
<LD>   Comprising about 50 members, the committee will try to represent
an array of political parties and independent activists who are
divided by ethnicity, religion, ideology and tragic history. It will
design a blueprint for an eventual transitional government in which
the opposition hopes to play a significant role.</LD>
<TE>   However, it remained unclear how major a role the opposition will
be allowed to play should the United States use force to unseat
Hussein. U.S. officials have floated various plans for a post-Hussein
Iraq, including installing a civilian administrator from outside the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Still, dissidents were enthusiastic about how far they had come.
"We are entering a very sensitive era of our history," said Hamid
Bayati of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a
Shiite Muslim group based in Iran. "We need a strong, powerful
committee, but we need it to be as representative as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The Shiite group generated the toughest conflict at the
conference, according to activists, who said the late-night talks
involved consultations with U.S. government observers and conference
calls to Iran. Shiites, who make up about 60% of Iraq's population,
will get about 16 seats on the committee. But the group clashed with
other Shiites over control of appointments and asked for an
additional 24 hours to come up with the names, activists said.</TE>
<TE>   That delay provoked tensions with the U.S. officials, who have
worked with the supreme council but remain wary of its Iranian ties,
according to accounts by participants. Nonetheless, activists
predicted that the lingering dispute would be resolved by today.</TE>
<TE>   "All the other names have been selected except for the Shiite
seats," said a spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress, or INC, a
coalition of exile groups that has clout with the Pentagon and
Capitol Hill. "It was a very successful conference. You had people
who are supposedly great enemies hugging one another, laughing and
joking."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest achievement was that the event took place at all. The
debate was fierce but the mood festive among delegates in three-piece
suits, Islamic clerical robes or tribal outfits. They spent the
weekend attending public meetings, holding secretive strategy
sessions and roaming a luxury hotel packed with security guards,
journalists, Asian tourists and British party-goers in formal attire.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, infighting delayed the conference several times
despite a growing sense of urgency as the international community's
confrontation with Iraq intensified. Critics said the rival groups'
failure to sit down and talk had become a symbol of their dysfunction
and their distance from the reality of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   It took prodding from the U.S. to bring about the London
gathering, which was organized by the supreme council, the INC, two
Kurdish parties, a constitutional monarchist group and a faction
dominated by political and military defectors. Washington
policymakers regard the unification of anti-Hussein forces outside
Iraq as an important element in making the diplomatic campaign
against the Baghdad regime broad-based and palatable to international
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Leading an observer delegation of U.S. diplomats and defense and
national security officials was Zalmay Khalilzad, President Bush's
special envoy to the Iraqi opposition. Khalilzad worked behind the
scenes but gave a speech Saturday in which he told delegates that it
was time to disprove the "soft bigotry of low expectations" by
showing that Iraqis are ready for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The eyes of the world are on those participating in this
conference at this momentous time," said Khalilzad, who is also a
special envoy to Afghanistan and attended the conference last year in
Germany that laid the framework for the government of Afghan
President Hamid Karzai. "I hope and expect that they will not be
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   The exiles' ambitions depend partly on factors beyond their
control: the U.N. effort to disarm Iraq, a potential U.S. invasion
and wild-card scenarios such as a coup. Although some exiles see
their new committee as the embryo of a transitional government,
others acknowledge Iraq's next leaders might emerge inside the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "What everybody needs to realize is that whatever happens here is
temporary," said Fawzi Hariri of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, one
of two parties that govern a semi-autonomous enclave in northern
Iraq. "The final decision will be made in Iraq at the ballot box."</TE>
<TE>   The conference produced signs of progress. Most participants
endorsed the concept of a federal structure for Iraq, a vital issue
for the Kurds. But others, including the government of neighboring
Turkey, fear that federalism could splinter the nation among Kurds in
the north; the Sunni elite in the center, including Baghdad; and
Shiites in the south.</TE>

<HD>Korean Election Gets Interesting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INCHON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The standoff over North Korean nuclear weapons and a wave of
anti-Americanism have turned what would have been a run-of-the-mill
election in South Korea into one of the country's most important.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean voters go to the polls Thursday to choose a president
to succeed Kim Dae Jung, the Nobel Peace laureate, barred by the
constitution from seeking another five-year term. The leading
contenders are Roh Moo Hyun, 56, a self-educated labor lawyer who is
considered Kim's protege, and former Prime Minister Lee Hoi Chang,
67, the most prominent voice of conservatism in the South Korean
establishment.</LD>
<LD>   Although Roh is anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points ahead, the
candidates have switched places so many times in the topsy-turvy race
and there are so many undecided voters that pollsters are saying it
is too close to call.</LD>
<TE>   Up to a few months ago, the conventional wisdom was that South
Korea's relations with the North would undergo mostly cosmetic
adjustments if the conservatives took power. But the crisis with
North Korea has sharpened the ideological contrasts to where the race
looks like a classic struggle between a left- and a right-of-center
candidate, between a maverick and an elder statesman, between new and
old.</TE>
<TE>   To a certain extent, it is also a referendum on how South Korea
should handle its obstreperous neighbor and the role to be played by
the United States in keeping the peace.</TE>
<TE>   "There are real existential decisions that voters have to make in
this election. The most important of them is how we define our
relationship with the United States," said Kim Kyong Won, a former
South Korean ambassador to Washington and a supporter of the Lee
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Roh promises to continue with Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" of
generous financial aid, cultural and business exchanges and
investment despite the North's avowed intention to continue with its
nuclear program. He unequivocally rejects President Bush's call to
suspend aid until the North shows evidence of compliance, and he is
not much more favorably inclined toward U.S. policy on Iraq or
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Distrust and hatred will only breed more distrust and hatred,"
Roh said last week as his campaign bus whisked him from a rally in
the port city of Inchon to the airport. "We must persuade North Korea
that it must change, that it must work with the rest of the world,
that it must work with the United States and give up its weapons.
There is no other solution."</TE>
<TE>   Brushing aside suggestions that he is anti-American, Roh said: "If
you want to have successful U.S.-Korean relations, it is not a matter
of having a [Korean] president who always says the same thing as the
Americans. If the president thinks rationally, that will be more
helpful in the end."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Lee emphasizes his country's historical alliance with
the United States as the basis for dealing with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship between the United States and Korea is a unique
friendship that has to be maintained," he said during a break between
campaign appearances.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the opposition Grand National Party, Lee was so
narrowly defeated in the 1997 presidential race by Kim that some
early news reports called the race incorrectly. He has spent much of
Kim's term tweaking what he calls the "leftist government" for being
too indulgent with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last five years, we have been catering to North Korea,
being led around by our noses by Pyongyang," Lee said at a news
conference Sunday. Though he has endorsed continued aid to North
Korea and dialogue with the communist state, he backs the Bush
position that such measures should wait until the North backs down on
its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   The resumes of the candidates also mirror their opposing views and
backgrounds. Roh made his name as a human rights lawyer in the 1980s.
Whereas Lee made a well-publicized visit to Washington earlier this
year, giving an appearance that he is the anointed favorite of the
White House, Roh wears as almost a badge of honor the fact that he
has never been to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Roh comes from a poor family and didn't attend college or law
school, passing the bar exam after educating himself. Lee is a
product of South Korea's best schools and a well-heeled family. He is
considered to be more sympathetic to the chaebol, the giant South
Korean conglomerates, such as Samsung and Daewoo.</TE>
<TE>   Breakdowns of the poll show Roh to be the favorite of those in
their 20s and 30s, while older voters prefer Lee by a wide margin.</TE>
<TE>   "Lee Hoi Chang represents stability, and Roh Moo Hyun represents
the aspirations of the future," says Scott Snyder of the Asia
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Since the spring, when the presidential season kicked off in
earnest, there have been many reversals of fortune. At one point, Roh
was as much as 26 points ahead in the polls. But a series of
corruption scandals involving President Kim's sons nearly sank the
ruling Millennium Democratic Party and Roh's candidacy with it. Then
the departure last month of World Cup organizer Chung Mong Jun from
the contest and his endorsement of Roh brought the flagging campaign
fresh energy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the presidential campaign has been buffeted by
each new development in the ongoing standoff with North Korea -- a
familiar phenomenon: It has been so common over the years for such
crises to arise in election seasons that there is a special term, buk
poong, or "northern winds."</TE>
<TE>   The revelation in October that North Korea was trying to secretly
enrich uranium was thought to spell the end of Roh's candidacy
because it was widely assumed that the misdeeds of the North always
benefit conservatives at the polls. But it doesn't seem to be
happening that way.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lee supporters argue that the experienced candidate is
needed in a time of potential crisis, the Roh campaign has been
hammering away at the notion that a Lee victory will mean
confrontation with North Korea and maybe war.</TE>
<TE>   "Lee Hoi Chang is too rigid toward North Korea. The whole thing
could snap. It's too dangerous," said Song Se Taek, a Roh supporter
waving his candidate's trademark yellow balloons at the rally in
Inchon.</TE>
<TE>   Polls suggest that an even bigger influence on the election has
come from the acquittals last month of two GIs who were
court-martialed on charges of negligent homicide after running over
two schoolgirls with a mine-clearing vehicle. The acquittals
unleashed a groundswell of resentment over the role of the 37,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and a movement in favor of
changes in the Status of Forces Agreement with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Lee quickly joined the chorus demanding a personal
apology from Bush over the accident and signed a petition calling for
revisions in the forces agreement -- something Roh refused to sign,
saying it was inappropriate as a candidate -- the resulting
anti-American momentum has worked in favor of Roh.</TE>
<TE>   An American official in Seoul who asked not to be quoted by name
said: "Our position is that we will work with either one of them. A
healthy and strong bilateral relationship is not going to change
regardless of who is elected."</TE>
<TE>   "Neither one of them is an extremist," he added.</TE>

<HD>60 Drown in Liberia as Ferry Sinks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MONROVIA, Liberia</DL>
<LD>At least 60 people drowned and scores more were feared dead after an
overloaded ferry carrying 200 passengers back from a funeral capsized
in Liberia, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "There are many, many bodies," said James Harris, a military
officer who had been helping with the rescue effort. "There is no
time to identify them. They are buried immediately. There's no time
for a funeral or coffins."</LD>
<LD>   Harris said that one of the victims was a diver looking for
survivors and that it was unlikely any more passengers would be found
alive.</LD>
<TE>   The wooden ferry Papa Friends 2000 pitched its passengers into
Lake Piso near the coastal town of Robertsport in northwest Liberia
on Saturday as they returned from the funeral of a popular local
soccer player, Defense Ministry officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Daniel Chea told a news conference late Sunday
that 15 survivors had been pulled from the water.</TE>
<TE>   Chea said nearly 200 people were aboard the vessel. A Defense
Ministry official said Monday that the ferry normally carried fewer
than 100 people.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said the ferry's captain was one of the survivors. He said
the captain had complained that the ferry's outboard motor was not
working properly.</TE>

<HD>Kenya Bombing Suspect Is Said to Have Fled to South Africa</HD>
<DH>Officials deny that man sought in fatal blast has entered
country, whose borders are porous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>STELLENBOSCH, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The search for a man who played a key role in the deadly bombing of a
hotel in Kenya last month has spread to South Africa, investigative
sources say.</LD>
<LD>   Saleh Nabhan, suspected of buying the sport utility vehicle that
destroyed the Paradise hotel near Mombasa, Kenya, told relatives he
wanted to go to South Africa and may have fled here after the Nov. 28
bombing that killed 10 Kenyans and three Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   South African officials deny that Nabhan is in the country, but
U.S. investigators say the Americans are checking. "All the
investigative agencies here are involved in that and looking into the
South African connection," said one U.S. source.</LD>
<TE>   Even before the attack in Kenya, South African and American
intelligence sources  had been discussing the possibility that South
Africa has become a haven for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   An October issue paper published by the American Embassy in
Pretoria noted, "South Africa has well-developed banking,
communications and transportation infrastructures that make it
attractive to domestic and international organized crime."</TE>
<TE>   The report went on to say that South Africa was being used as an
international base for "smuggling drugs, laundering money,
counterfeiting currency, falsifying the origin of goods to avoid
tariffs and promoting corruption and terrorism. If left unchecked,
international organized crime can destabilize the region."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews over the past month, American and South African
officials said they were also concerned that South Africa's porous
borders and its large Muslim communities in the cities of Durban and
Cape Town could create an ideal environment for terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   These sources say that Al Qaeda members could be stopping off in
neighboring countries with lax immigration controls such as Namibia,
Mozambique, Swaziland or Lesotho before slipping into South Africa.
This nation's border with Zimbabwe has become particularly
troublesome, according to a South African newspaper, the Sunday
Independent, which reported that 84% of the people caught without
documents at roadblocks in November were Zimbabweans.</TE>
<TE>   According to one intelligence source, Malay Muslims in South
Africa have for years arranged fictitious marriages for foreign
family members in order to secure citizenship. That source said that
American intelligence officials also have noticed the practice and
are pressing South Africa to crack down on it.</TE>
<TE>   South African Minister of Intelligence Lindiwe Sisulu said that
South Africa has had trouble policing its borders, but she insisted
that is not unusual in a period of increasing migration around the
world. She said that recent legislation that requires all South
Africans to hold identity cards will help keep out terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were to marry South Africans, they would be subjecting
themselves to being photographed ... and go through a legal process
that would pick up any Al Qaeda. So that is not the kind of thing
that they would do," Sisulu said.</TE>
<TE>   Sisulu was confident that even if terrorists attempted to set up
operations in South Africa, intelligence agencies would stamp them
out.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, police here arrested five alleged white nationalists in
connection with a series of bomb blasts in Johannesburg, the black
township of Soweto and a suburb of Pretoria, the nation's capital.
The bombers targeted a mosque, a synagogue and commuter railways.
Those five suspects will join 15 other white extremists on trial for
allegedly conspiring to overthrow the state.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, South African agents broke the back of the militant
Muslim group PAGAD, or People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, after
its members allegedly detonated a dozen bombs in restaurants,
synagogues and government buildings over a two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone interview Monday, Mombasa bombing investigator William
Langat, a deputy commissioner in Kenya's national police force, said
that Nabhan's sister, brother and mother said that the suspect might
be in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother, brother and sister are telling us that [Nabhan] had
told them about three weeks back that he would go to South Africa to
find a job," Langat said. Nabhan was born in Mombasa in 1979, and his
family still lives there.</TE>
<TE>   Langat said the last confirmed sighting of Nabhan was on Dec. 2,
four days after the attack near Mombasa.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not very far from Mombasa, along the coastline, visiting
some relative," Langat said.</TE>

<HD>'No Second Chance' for Baghdad</HD>
<DH>As 10 Security Council members await Iraq's arms report,
Powell says the regime won't be allowed to correct it to avoid an
invasion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>With the U.S. rallying the rest of the Security Council to take a
hard line on what it calls Iraq's continued deception, Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell said Monday that there would be "no second
chance" for Iraq to correct its massive arms declaration and avoid a
military intervention.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the elected 10 members received an edited version of
Iraq's arms declaration today, analysts from the U.S., Britain and
France had already concluded that the weapons inventory is full of
holes. Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix concedes it may leave
unanswered questions.</LD>
<LD>   But while Blix might like to give Iraq a chance to clarify its
report, Washington is taking a much tougher stance, reflecting
frustration in the White House at the prospect that the U.N.
inspection process will be too lengthy and inconclusive. After a week
of intensive analysis, Powell said that U.S. doubts about Iraq's
ability to fully disclose its weapons of mass destruction programs
had proved "well founded."</LD>
<TE>   "We said at the very beginning that we approached it with
skepticism, and the information I have received so far is that that
skepticism is well founded. There are problems with the declaration,"
Powell told a news conference after talks with visiting Japanese
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sharing the problems we see with UNMOVIC and the IAEA, and
we're in discussions with the permanent members of the Security
Council.... Then statements will be forthcoming, I expect, toward the
end of the week," Powell said, using first the initials of the U.N.
inspection commission for Iraq and then those of the International
Atomic Energy Agency.</TE>
<TE>   While Blix has deflected questions about what he thinks should
happen next, saying that he is "just a servant of the Security
Council," council members aside from the U.S. rely heavily on his
recommendations. At a recent news conference, the 74-year-old Swedish
diplomat said cautiously that "we would not exclude that we would ask
them questions" about gaps in the declaration.</TE>
<TE>   But as U.S. intelligence continues to pore over the 11,807 pages
of documents, the White House warned Iraq on Monday that Baghdad
would not have a second chance to correct or add to the list to avoid
military intervention. The Bush administration is planning how and
when to share what it considers key intelligence to smoke out hidden
caches of weapons and the scientists who worked on them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was abundantly plain, from the will of the United
Nations, this was Iraq's last chance to inform the world in an
accurate, complete and full way what weapons of mass destruction they
possessed," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had already had
16 opportunities to fully disclose any nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons and should not have more.</TE>
<TE>   "That was plain to all going into this one last final-chance
process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain are both turning up the heat on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with an Arab newspaper released Monday, Powell
denied that the Bush administration had already made the decision to
go to war as soon as next month. At the same time, he said, the
United States believes the type of rule in Iraq must change.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains our policy to change the regime until such time as the
regime changes itself," Powell told Al Quds al Arabi. "So far, we
cannot be sure that he is cooperating.... He continues to give us
statements that suggest he is not in possession of weapons of mass
destruction when we know he is."</TE>
<TE>   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that "action
should follow" if Baghdad is found to be in material breach of the
latest U.N. resolution on weapons inspections. In September, Blair
said that he had intelligence showing "beyond doubt" that Hussein had
been continuing to produce weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   A thick dossier compiled by British intelligence services and
analysts in September portrayed Iraqi efforts to produce chemical and
biological weapons, develop nuclear arms and extend the range of
ballistic missiles used to deliver them.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's weapons declaration, handed over Dec. 7, apparently
provides few details on materials that were unaccounted for when
weapons inspectors left Iraq in 1998 ahead of a U.S.-British bombing
raid. Although there has been no formal pronouncement from London on
the veracity of the declaration, British officials have been saying
the report "is disappointing and that there are gaps," said a British
diplomat. "But they're still up to their eyeballs in the materials."</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq on Monday, inspectors continued surprise visits to
suspected weapons sites, as nuclear experts in Vienna began to
analyze air, soil and water samples for traces of radioactivity that
could contradict Iraq's assertions it has stopped its nuclear arms
programs. The atomic energy agency said it hopes to have results by
Jan. 27, when the inspectors are to report to the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The members of the inspection team now number more than 100, with
some experts concentrating on alleged biological and chemical weapons
sites and some focusing on Iraq's nuclear sectors. Inspectors
searched at least six Iraqi sites Monday, including a complex near Al
Tuwaitha where Iraqi scientists once worked on a nuclear bomb.</TE>

<CX>   Arms declaration -- In an article in Section A on Tuesday headlined "
'No Second Chance' for Baghdad," a comment made by White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer that Iraq would have "no second chance" to
disclose its weapons inventory to the U.N. was incorrectly attributed
to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Fleischer said that Iraq would
not have a second chance to amend its weapons declaration to avoid
military intervention if U.N. members found it incomplete.</CX>

<HD>U.S. Revises Call for Early Elections in Venezuela to End
Crisis</HD>
<DH>The move is the latest sign of Washington's indecision
regarding Latin American policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The White House on Monday backed off its call for early elections to
end Venezuela's political crisis after coming under fire for seeming
to suggest a solution that violated the nation's constitution.</LD>
<LD>   After issuing a statement Friday urging "early elections" as the
best way to end a strike by opponents of President Hugo Chavez that
has crippled oil production in the United States' third-largest
petroleum supplier, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday
that Washington supports a "referendum" on Chavez's rule as
"anticipated in the Venezuelan Constitution."</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of Chavez began the general strike Dec. 2 by demanding a
nonbinding referendum on his rule in February. Chavez has resisted
that idea, saying the constitution does not allow a binding
referendum until August. It was unclear Monday which date the Bush
administration prefers.</LD>
<TE>   The revised statement was the latest sign of U.S. indecision
regarding policy toward Latin America and how best to handle the
growing political divide between Chavez and his foes, a coalition
that includes unions, businesspeople and opposition politicians. The
top State Department post for Latin America is currently filled only
by an acting director.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a measure of the sensitivity in Latin America that
surrounds the U.S. role in the crisis here. In April, the U.S. seemed
to back a coup that ousted Chavez, even as Latin American leaders
refused to recognize the new government. The coup collapsed after two
days, and Chavez was restored to power by faithful military units and
his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what happens if you don't have high-level political
attention to a situation that needs heavy lifting," said Michael
Shifter, a Latin America expert with the Inter-American Dialogue, a
Washington think tank. "It does a lot of damage when the situation is
so difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez strongly rejected the call for early elections in an
interview with The Times and three other U.S. newspapers Sunday,
saying -- as he has repeatedly -- that such elections are not allowed
by the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said several other Latin American leaders had called him to
voice concern about Friday's statement from the U.S., which seemed to
back opposition demands.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are surprised," Chavez said Sunday. "They tell me,
how is it from Washington they are asking for early elections? They
don't exist."</TE>
<TE>   The opposition, which accuses Chavez of ruining the country, has
hardened its demands and now wants his resignation or early elections
-- not just a referendum -- in the first three months of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Bush administration officials seemed to back that
position when they urged the Venezuelan government to consider the
possibility of amending the constitution to permit a presidential
vote earlier than the one scheduled for 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Shannon, a deputy assistant secretary of State who met this
weekend with top Venezuelan government officials in Caracas, said:
"You could argue that to a certain extent a recall referendum would
be an early election or any referendum would be an early election,
but we came to the conclusion that the situation was sufficiently
grave enough that it was important that the Venezuelans understood
that we thought moving toward early elections was the best way to
resolve this."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, however, Fleischer insisted that the U.S. was not
suggesting changes to the Venezuelan Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's foes dismissed the new statement, saying the White House
apparently had misunderstood the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "Both a presidential resignation and an amendment [allowing early
elections] are constitutional," said Rafael Alfonso, an opposition
negotiator. "There's confusion in these declarations."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Monday, Chavez supporters and opponents clashed several
times in Caracas, the capital. Police had to break up a demonstration
along a major highway with tear gas.</TE>

<HD>Putting a Human Face on 'It'</HD>
<DH>Hollywood is buzzing about the special effects team that
animated Gollum in 'The Lord of the Rings' and the actor who gave him
a soul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter and Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a recent Beverly Hills screening of "The Lord of the Rings: The
Two Towers," members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences walked out of the three-hour epic buzzing about "him."</LD>
<LD>   Not actor Viggo Mortensen, who plays the hunky, sword-wielding
Aragorn. Not Elijah Wood, cast as the diminutive, ring-bearing hero
Frodo. Instead, the chatter focused on Gollum, the wheezing, lisping
wretch who plays Frodo's foil.</LD>
<LD>   What a stunning performance. An Oscar contender. He's just great!</LD>
<TE>   Technically, Gollum is not a "he," but an "it" -- an agglomeration
of 1s and 0s that required six years of research, scores of computer
programmers and countless cycles of processing power to make the
animated amphibious creature as believable as human actors.</TE>
<TE>   The key, though, was a human actor -- a classically trained
Shakespearean stage player named Andy Serkis whose face never appears
on-screen, but nonetheless infuses Gollum with enough sadness and
pain to make him perhaps the most believable computer-generated
character in a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Animated film characters have mingled on-screen with live actors
since Gene Kelly danced with Jerry the Mouse in 1945's "Anchors
Aweigh." And animators long have been able to squeeze a response out
of audiences -- whether it's the tearful death of Bambi's mother or
the fearful rampage of the Tyrannosaurus rex in "Jurassic Park."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite the advances made by powerful computers in animation,
most characters have never felt like anything but special effects
novelties to humans adept at distinguishing life from lifelike.</TE>
<TE>   Gollum's debut in "The Two Towers" marks the strongest marriage to
date of technology and art in moviemaking. Already, Hollywood is
talking about Academy Award nominations both for the team that gave
Gollum life and the actor who gave him a soul.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the difference between John Hurt wearing a latex mask in
'The Elephant Man' and Andy Serkis wearing a pixel mask of Gollum
now?" asked Russell Schwartz, president of domestic marketing for New
Line Cinema, which releases the movie Wednesday. "There's no
difference. They're both human."</TE>
<TE>   Making Gollum believable was the biggest technical and artistic
challenge for Peter Jackson, who directed "The Lord of the Rings"
trilogy. In the J.R.R. Tolkien series on which the movies are based,
Gollum is a central figure, a Hobbit disfigured and driven mad by the
power of the One Ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter's biggest fear, even back in the earliest days, was that
audiences would not think of Gollum as a 'he,' " said Lulu Zezza, a
former production supervisor on the "Lord of the Rings" series.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter thought the success of these movies hinged on Gollum being
real, being believable," she said. "If he missed on Gollum, if he
didn't create the hugely dimensional character that he is in the
books, the movies would fail."</TE>
<TE>   The burden fell to Serkis, known for his leading roles in "King
Lear" and "Macbeth" at London's Royal Court Theater. When he met with
Jackson and co-producer and writer Fran Walsh in London in the late
1990s, the actor thought he was trying out for a voice-over job.</TE>
<TE>   "My thought was, 'Why can't my agent get me up for a decent part?'
" Serkis said.</TE>
<TE>   The job was quickly clarified. Serkis flew to New Zealand and, for
nearly 18 months, joined the rest of the cast in principal
photography. That alone was unusual.</TE>
<TE>   When animated characters appear in movies, they are generally
added after the fact by technicians and artists. A crew member may
read lines or go through the motions to give actors a point of
reference. But for director Jackson, there was never a question of
using someone other than the person cast in the role of Gollum.</TE>
<TE>   That decision added time and money to the project, but Jackson's
reasoning was that stunt people and crew members don't have the same
ability as actors to speak with their bodies and convey emotion
through something as simple as a stare. Serkis' performances during
the original shoot became the foundation of what audiences see on
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Each scene that included Gollum was shot at least twice during
principal photography, when most of the film is shot. The first time
was with Serkis in front of the camera with his fellow actors so they
could create an emotional energy and give key data to the lighting
and animation teams.</TE>
<TE>   On the second round, Serkis stepped off-camera and the scene was
reshot, giving the effects crew a "clean" pass of the scene and space
to put in the digital creature.</TE>
<TE>   As the rest of the cast returned home, Serkis stayed in New
Zealand and donned a motion-capture suit, acting out for the third
time every scene in front of a blank screen.</TE>
<TE>   The suit looks like a wetsuit fitted with dozens of sensors tied
to a computer.</TE>
<TE>   When Serkis moved, an electronic skeleton parroted each motion
precisely.</TE>
<TE>   The monitoring also covered his face, which was dotted like a pox.
Each twitch, smile or grimace was recorded digitally.</TE>
<TE>   During the process Jackson made a decision that threw everything
into chaos: Gollum should resemble Serkis.</TE>
<TE>   The edict came as a shock. Artists at Weta Digital had spent years
laboring over Gollum's look, creating so many statues of the
emaciated being that they filled one room and threatened to spill
into the hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Scrambling to satisfy Jackson, mounds of clay were carved to marry
Serkis' face with the froglike appearance of Gollum. One day, Richard
Taylor, head of the practical effects house Weta Workshop, brought a
sculpture to Jackson for review.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson said the ears were too pointy, Taylor reached for a
bread knife and hacked down the tips. Moments later, Serkis entered
the room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like seeing my father and my son in the same face," Serkis
said. "It was uncanny."</TE>
<TE>   The sculpted body and face were scanned into the computer to
create a three-dimensional map that became the canvas artists used to
link Serkis' recorded expressions to Gollum's face. Serkis' smile
became Gollum's.</TE>
<TE>   Then, it was time to test the system. Serkis and the animators
spent days together in darkened rooms studying a monitor, pretending
they were sitting in stadium seats at the local multiplex. What would
movie-watchers believe? What flaws would they spot?</TE>
<TE>   "In the human brain, we are very sensitive to human faces," said
Henrik Wann Jensen, an assistant professor of computer science at UC
San Diego, who has done extensive research in the process of creating
realistic human skin. The production team relied on Jensen's theories
in part to develop the look of Gollum's skin.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at animals, you can distinguish between a few of
them," Jensen said. "But our brain is encoded to remember hundreds
and hundreds of human faces."</TE>
<TE>   In judging digital characters, one of the first things audiences
look for is emotion, said Rob Coleman, animation director at visual
effects giant Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I believe in the character?" Coleman said. "Is there spark
behind the eyes? Can I feel that this character is thinking?"</TE>
<TE>   To get an audience to answer yes, animators have to re-create a
mind-numbing amount of detail.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk with someone, you can tell whether they're engaged
or distracted," Coleman said. "Just a flicker of muscle and we can
tell whether someone is telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   As for movement, gestures aren't the only things that must be
re-created. Animators also have to duplicate tiny tremors, twitches
and tics.</TE>
<TE>   To make a character believable requires "quick twitchy movements
[that are] not essential to the performance. It's a twist of the
mouth, a flicker of the eyes," said Steve Sullivan, research and
development director at ILM. "They're not essential, but they make
you realize that the character is in an environment and is reacting
to the world beyond the camera."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest tests of this subtlety is seen during Gollum's
three-minute monologue, where the evil creature created by the One
Ring has an impassioned debate with his gentle side -- the being
known as Smeagol. It is a key point in the film, and a scene where
the virtual character literally stands alone in front of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Back and forth, back and forth, the debate rages. At first, it
appears that there are two creatures: The manic Gollum, whose face
crinkles with malevolence, and the gentle Smeagol, whose slow
movements seem weighed with sadness.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the camera pans back, revealing that the two creatures are
actually one. Gollum's eyes widen. His chest heaves.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, he freezes.</TE>
<TE>   For Serkis, the key to making Gollum human was capturing this
sense of stillness -- to convey emotion and movement, while remaining
absolutely motionless.</TE>
<TE>   "On stage, you use movements to build energy and use stillness to
draw the audience in," Serkis said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was on stage [against the blue screen], the same theories
applied as if I was on stage in London."</TE>
<TE>   Animators, though, work in a world of movement. To be still is to
be flat, uninteresting or worse -- clearly fake. One of the hardest
aspects of the role, Serkis said, was thinking like an animator.</TE>
<TE>   "By the end, the animators were more my family than the acting
community," Serkis said.</TE>

<HD>Judge in Runnion Kidnap-Murder Case Is Replaced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new judge was appointed Monday to preside over the trial of a man
accused of kidnapping and murdering 5-year-old Samantha Runnion after
his lawyers accused the original judge of prejudice.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Avila's defense team did not explain the bias claim
filed in court against Superior Court Judge F.P. Briseno. By law,
attorneys are limited to one such request without giving a reason.
"That's a tactical decision I'm not going to discuss," said Assistant
Public Defender Denise Gragg.</LD>
<LD>   Briseno was replaced by Judge William Froeberg.</LD>
<TE>   Avila, 28, of Lake Elsinore, reentered pleas of not guilty to one
count each of murder and kidnapping, and two counts of lewd acts on a
child under 14. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Avila
has waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was ordered to
return to court Friday, when a trial date could be set.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he would continue
to press for a trial within 60 days, while Gragg indicated she needs
more time.</TE>
<TE>   Runnion was kidnapped July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton home. Her body was found the next day on a mountain road
in Riverside County.</TE>

<HD>Analyst: More Taxes, Fewer Cuts Needed</HD>
<DH>Davis plan would hurt education, says official, who spells
out series of ways to raise revenue. She also calls for prison system
reductions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' plan to start closing the state budget gap
unnecessarily spares the prison system, would cause greater harm to
public schools than anticipated and relies too heavily on cuts when
sensible tax hikes should also be considered, according to
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Hill, who heads the Legislature's nonpartisan research arm,
critiqued the plan Monday at the Assembly's opening budget hearing.
She complimented the governor for taking an "important first step" in
addressing the state's fiscal problems and agreed that the
administration's suggestions -- primarily budget cuts -- would
produce most of the $10.2 billion in savings that it seeks.</LD>
<LD>   But through her comments and a written report, Hill questioned
whether they are the best ways to go about it.</LD>
<TE>   She offered a long list of alternatives -- many of them taxes and
fees -- for closing the state's projected $21-billion-plus budget
shortfall over the next 18 months. Her report came as the governor's
staff works on a proposed budget for 2003-04, in which it will have
to make up the rest of the budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's advice to ease the pain of the cuts by spreading them wider
and mixing them with tax hikes was underscored by testimony Monday
from the governor's deputy finance director, Robert Miyashiro. He
acknowledged 500,000 people stand to lose medical assistance under
the governor's plan -- more than twice the number indicated by the
administration earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Budget gridlock was already brewing at Monday's hearing, which
opened discussion of the issue in the Legislature. Republican
lawmakers appeared to be digging in on their vow to fight new taxes,
as Democrats warned that bringing the state into the black with cuts
alone would have dire consequences for the poor, elderly and
children.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) asked whether the
cuts Davis proposed in medical assistance already are so severe that
the "incontinent, frail elderly" would not be able to pay for
supplies that "keep them from being in their own waste."</TE>
<TE>   Each mention of a possible new tax on business or the wealthy was
met with Republicans warning that it could further hamper the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats were, however, receptive to Hill's suggestions for
steeper cuts at one agency largely missing from the Davis proposal:
the Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no meaningful reductions in the criminal justice area,"
Hill said of the Davis plan, noting that changing the overtime and
workers' compensation rules for prison guards could produce
substantial revenue. She also suggested discharging nonviolent
parolees early, putting some elderly inmates on parole early and
closing the Northern California Women's Facility as ways to produce
nearly $79 million.</TE>
<TE>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., the
26,000-member union representing prison guards, is one of the largest
financial contributors to state lawmakers. The association has given
Davis $1.4 million since he was elected to his first term in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst's office holds considerable influence over
lawmakers. Legislators use its reports and recommendations as a
foundation for drafting laws.</TE>
<TE>   Miyashiro said that Davis is not ruling out cuts in the prison
system, tax hikes or anything else for his budget proposal that will
be unveiled Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   He said the plan released earlier his month was just the "opening
salvo in our approach to the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's hearing kicked off a series of hearings the Assembly
Budget Committee will hold across the state this week in an effort to
assess the potential effects of the cuts proposed so far by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Hill used the opportunity to suggest several major tax hikes that
her office proposed during last year's budget fight that were never
approved. Her report notes the state's budget problems this time
around are "much more formidable and challenging than last year's ...
because a number of the one-time solutions heavily relied upon last
year are no longer available."</TE>
<TE>   Among the tax-hike proposals she rolled out Monday was restoring
vehicle license fees to their 1998 levels, which could raise as much
as $4.7 billion. Increasing the income tax rate for top earners would
generate $2.5 billion, she said, as would a sales tax increase of
half a cent.</TE>
<TE>   Hill also said lawmakers could consider suspending a
manufacturers' tax credit, at a savings of $400 million. Subjecting
amusement parks and other recreational facilities to sales tax could
produce close to another $2.5 billion, she said.</TE>
<TE>   They are all ideas Republicans have promised to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Hill warned that even if such tax increases are approved, only
half the money would go to balancing the budget. The rest would be
forced into education unless lawmakers passed a special "urgency
bill" suspending Proposition 98, which mandates about 35% of the
state's general fund for public schools.</TE>
<TE>   That news comes at a time when Davis is trying to take money from
education funding -- not add to it.</TE>
<TE>   And the $3.8 billion Davis is proposing to cut from education this
year and next, Hill warned, would not be as easily absorbed by school
districts as the administration indicates. The problem, she said, is
that state requirements, including class size and special education
funding, limit their discretion.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "across the board" cuts to local schools, Hill proposed
reducing the education budget by the same amount Davis suggested
through targeted cuts to the least-essential school programs,
deferring some spending until the beginning of the next fiscal year
in the summer, and shifting some federal child-care funds.</TE>
<TE>   The report also noted that at least $1 billion of cuts Davis has
proposed may not be legal. That includes taking $500 million in
affordable-housing funds generated by local property taxes away from
local governments, and cutting $500 million from the state teachers'
retirement fund.</TE>

<HD>Agencies Close Deal to Buy, Restore S.F. Bay Salt Ponds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and federal officials Monday completed a $135-million deal to
buy and restore 16,500 acres of salt ponds in South San Francisco
Bay, with a provision requiring a salt manufacturing company to clean
up the ponds as part of their reconversion to tidal marsh.</LD>
<LD>   The final agreement, authorizing the purchase of the acreage from
Cargill Inc., sets in motion the largest wetlands restoration project
on the West Coast. The multicolored ponds ring the southern rim of
San Francisco Bay. The deal also includes some ponds farther north at
the mouth of the Napa River that feeds into the bay near Vallejo.</LD>
<LD>   The restored marshland should help clean the bay by functioning as
a natural filter and help bring back fish and shorebirds that were
abundant there.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, in announcing the conclusion of six months of
negotiations, said that turning the industrial salt ponds back into
tidal marsh provides "an unprecedented opportunity to improve the
physical, biological and chemical health of the San Francisco Bay."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, he said, he appreciated Cargill's commitment to
assume responsibility for the initial cleanup of lead and other
contaminants and then retain liability if other toxic problems
surface after the state assumes control of the salt ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from announcing a final deal, state officials released the
first details of an environmental assessment of the ponds, which have
been used to produce salt from evaporated seawater since the days of
the California Gold Rush.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists had been concerned that 150 years of
evaporation might have concentrated toxic mercury that washed into
the bay, largely from mine tailings and the processing of gold. They
feared that the hidden cost of cleanup might make restoration of the
ponds prohibitively expensive to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Checking sediment samples and toxins in snails and fish,
environmental consultants found that mercury contamination was
similar to adjacent sloughs in the south end of the bay, but higher
than average levels in other parts of the bay. The highest levels of
mercury were found in nearby ponds already owned by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants also found lead, probably from lead-based paints,
and some lubricating oil in the soil surrounding residences at the
Napa salt plant site.</TE>
<TE>   Cargill has promised to remove those pollutants from the soil,
some lead shot from a skeet shooting range, and lower the salinity in
all of the ponds as required by state water pollution officials.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said the full report on the pollutants will be
released publicly in January before the state Wildlife Conservation
Board gives final approval to the agreement.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Chief Proposes Ban on Majority of Police Pursuits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton has proposed banning a
majority of police pursuits under a new policy that would also
require greater supervision of chases in progress.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton's proposal, to be considered by the Los Angeles Police
Commission today, follows a series of high-profile chases and
collisions that resulted in a death and many injuries this year, the
latest coming Dec. 3 in Sylmar when fleeing suspects crashed into a
minivan, severing the arm of an infant.</LD>
<LD>   "The chief of police is recommending substantial adjustments in
the department's pursuit policy," said Deputy Chief George Gascon,
whose responsibilities include oversight of training and policy
development. "It's a policy we will continue to refine and evaluate."</LD>
<TE>   The plan would ban the use of infractions -- minor offenses such
as broken taillights, missing license plates or minor traffic
violations -- to justify a pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Such offenses now prompt at least 60% of all pursuits by the Los
Angeles Police Department, according to a review by the Police
Commission, which must approve policy decisions for the department
under the city charter.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed change was applauded by the American Civil Liberties
Union, which has favored restricting high-speed pursuits since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Police Commission adopts the new policy, it would be doing
what some departments throughout Southern California have already
done," said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these high-speed pursuits have resulted in harm and even
death to innocent bystanders. It's an ongoing problem and it's about
time the Police Commission changed its policy."</TE>
<TE>   In choosing a policy for Los Angeles, Gascon said the commission
must balance the competing interests of keeping the public safe from
pursuits while also keeping it safe from the criminals who might
remain free if police don't chase them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a delicate balancing act, so we want to look at where can we
adjust the policy to enhance public safety without the unintended
consequence of increasing the danger to the community and officers,
which is a big concern of Chief Bratton's," he said, noting that the
Sylmar chase was initiated after a report of a felony stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   The department has proposed tracking fleeing suspects preferably
by air, rather than chasing them on the ground, when possible.
Bratton also wants to give supervisors, such as watch commanders,
control over chases.</TE>
<TE>   Now, LAPD patrol officers have wide discretion on whether to
pursue suspects who commit everything from a traffic infraction to a
felony. The senior officer involved in the chase has the
responsibility to decide whether and when to terminate a pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's proposal would not change the existing policy requiring
officers to weigh the potential threat to bystanders against the need
to make an arrest, taking into account traffic, pedestrians and the
danger posed by the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Rising pursuit-related accidents, many of which have involved
injuries and deaths, have caused the department to reconsider its
policy. In March, a driver fleeing police struck pedestrians Anna
Polivoda, 76, and her husband, Henry, 79, near the Beverly Center.
They suffered broken bones and head injuries. The chase began as the
result of a traffic infraction.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old girl was killed in June when an auto-theft suspect
being pursued by Los Angeles police ran a red light on a busy
downtown street, causing a chain-reaction accident that knocked over
a traffic light, crushing the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Then a 2 1/2-week-old boy lost an arm Dec. 3 after his parents'
sport utility vehicle was broadsided by a car occupied by four men
fleeing police during a short, high-speed pursuit in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Police chases and injuries among pedestrians resulting from them
increased significantly last year, according to Police Commission
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuits rose to 781 in 2001 from 597 the previous year.
Pedestrian injuries resulting from chases in 2001 were nearly double
those of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the California Highway Patrol showed that LAPD pursuits
decreased 36% from 1995 to 2000. Statewide, the five-year decrease
was 32%, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, in considering the policy change, also will draw on a
study that compares LAPD pursuit statistics and tactics with those of
20 police agencies across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the Police Commission of chases in Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and St. Louis found that the
LAPD had the highest total -- 781 pursuits, 283 collisions and 139
injuries in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Only Dallas and Las Vegas experienced a higher percentage of
pursuits that resulted in collisions.</TE>
<TE>   As in Los Angeles, officers in Dallas and Las Vegas are allowed to
pursue suspects for traffic violations.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the chases have been costly. According to the Los Angeles
city attorney, the amount paid out in liability claims stemming from
police pursuits from July 2000 to 2001 was $1.32 million. From July
2001 to September 2002, the city paid out approximately $196,400 in
claims.</TE>
<TE>   That legal exposure as well as the perceived danger to the public
have caused other departments to apply more conservative policies.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department requires deputies who
initiate a pursuit to give watch commanders specific information from
the field concerning their speed, location and the reason for the
chase, including what type of law was violated. The watch commander
then determines whether to chase or not.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department spokesman Darren Harris said reasons to
terminate a pursuit include unreasonable danger to the deputy,
motorists or pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   The department's policy is to track suspects with air units
whenever they are available.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the Sheriff's Department does not allow pursuits
based on infractions. That policy resulted in eight pursuits in 2001
and just one collision.</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Investment Urged</HD>
<DH>Ambassador to the U.S., a former Southern California
resident, cites country's natural riches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>GOLETA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Corporate America should get more involved in the rebuilding of
Afghanistan despite worries of security and political instability,
Afghanistan's ambassador to the United States said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ishaq Shahryar, who was in Southern California for the holidays,
called Afghanistan "a very rich country" with untapped supplies of
oil, gas, copper, iron and even gold.</LD>
<LD>   "The message I want to pass on is that the Microsofts and the oil
companies should help build an economy there because they will
benefit themselves," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Shahryar, 66, spent most of his adult life in Southern California,
first as a student at UC Santa Barbara, then as a business leader
pioneering in the uses of solar energy.</TE>
<TE>   He had watched his country suffer for decades, he said. First came
the Soviet invasion. Then the takeover by the Taliban. Only in March,
after a coalition of American-led troops had driven out Taliban and
Al Qaeda forces, was he able to return, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was emotionally devastated. Our country was totally destroyed.
Everything was in ruins," he said. "I cried a lot for days. That's
when I became totally committed."</TE>
<TE>   When Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai offered Shahryar the
ambassador post, it meant that Shahryar had to give up his U.S.
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very black day for me," he said. "But the even darker
day was when I had seen what the Taliban did to the country of my
birth."</TE>
<TE>   Shahryar was in Goleta and Santa Barbara on Monday to visit an old
friend, Dr. Wilton Doane, a surgeon. He also met with community
leaders and officials of Direct Relief International, which has
funneled $5.4 million in medical supplies to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is incredible human suffering there," he said. "One in five
Afghan children die before the age of 5. Medical supplies are
desperately needed."</TE>
<TE>   So is the continued strong presence of the U.S. military, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. left, the Taliban would retake Kandahar within hours,
and the rest of the country would follow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he said, Afghanistan now can become a model for Muslim
countries -- with democracy, freedom and independence.</TE>
<TE>   Shahryar presented his credentials as Afghanistan's ambassador to
the United States to President Bush on June 19. That made him the
first recognized Afghan official at that level in this country since
1978.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kabul, Shahryar moved to the United States in 1956 when he
was 20. He received a bachelor's degree in physical chemistry from UC
Santa Barbara in 1961 and a master's degree in international
relations from the university in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   From that point on, as he monitored events in his native country,
Shahryar gained recognition as a high-tech inventor and businessman.</TE>
<TE>   His biography notes that he was one of three scientists who
invented low-cost solar (photovoltaic) cells in 1972 and developed
the process for mass producing cells used in solar energy panels.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he helped develop ultraviolet sensitive solar cells
for NASA's Jupiter Project and founded a company called Solec
International, a leading manufacturer of solar electric technology.</TE>
<TE>   He also founded Solar Utility Co., a solar cell engineering,
design, marketing and installation company.</TE>
<TE>   An advisor to former Afghan King Zahir Shah for five years,
Shahryar was a key participant last year in the Bonn talks that
preceded formation of Afghanistan's interim government.</TE>
<TE>   Previously he served on an energy mission to India in 1994 and as
an advisor to numerous trade and environmental groups in the United
States and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Until he was named to his diplomatic post, he lived in Southern
California. He and his wife, Hafizah, have two children.</TE>

<HD>Attorney General Asks Probe of 'Extortionist' Legal Tactics</HD>
<DH>Bill Lockyer wants two Beverly Hills lawyers investigated
over thousands of suits against auto repair shops, restaurants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs and Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has requested that the State Bar of
California investigate two Beverly Hills attorneys who have sued
thousands of auto repair shops, restaurants and other small
businesses, likening the attorneys' tactics to extortion.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers at the Trevor Law Group in Beverly Hills have riled the
state's automotive repair industry by filing 2,000 suits against
garage owners, accusing them of unfair business practices. The
automotive industry says the lawsuits are frivolous and intended to
shake down business owners for quick cash settlements.</LD>
<LD>   More recently, the attorneys have sued hundreds of Los
Angeles-area restaurants on behalf of a charity for the blind, even
though the group's president disavows the legal action.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general is "concerned about the way these guys
operate in terms of how they pursue these lawsuits," said Tom
Dresslar, a Lockyer spokesman. "Some of their tactics appear to be
extortionist."</TE>
<TE>   Dresslar said it was uncommon for the attorney general to urge
such an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the State Bar would not say whether the group
has begun an investigation. But a source close to the matter
confirmed that a bar investigator has been assigned to the case.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers Damian Trevor and Allan Hendrickson, of the Trevor Law
Group, declined to comment Monday. In past interviews, the lawyers
insisted they filed the cases on behalf of the public in order to
protect consumers from unscrupulous garage owners.</TE>
<TE>   The suits accuse garage owners of a variety of unfair business
practices, from failing to file government forms to passing off used
parts as new. The cases aren't tied to specific defendants but rather
are based on citations the state filed against the mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has used a similar approach in lawsuits filed against
restaurants, citing health code violations issued by the county. The
restaurant suits were filed on behalf of Helping Hands for the Blind,
also claiming unfair business practices.</TE>
<TE>   But Robert Acosta, president of the Chatsworth-based nonprofit
group, said the law firm misled him.</TE>
<TE>   He said Hendrickson approached him several weeks ago about filing
suits against companies to "make life better for the blind," said
Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we went on vacation; we didn't know anything about suing the
restaurant industry," Acosta said. "I was thinking of major chains,
not small businesses. We were trying to get them to add maybe one
Braille menu."</TE>
<TE>   Acosta said he returned from vacation and was bombarded with calls
about the suits. He said he contacted Trevor and demanded that they
be withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   The suits against the restaurants and the auto repair shops are
filed under the state's Unfair Competition Act and allege that the
defendants are guilty of "harming the general public."</TE>
<TE>   The act allows plaintiffs to file civil suits even if they have
not been directly harmed.</TE>
<TE>   After being sued, some auto-repair firms said they received calls
or letters from the law group urging owners to settle the cases
quickly. Garage owners say that the Trevor Law Group created its own
organization, Santa Ana-based Consumer Enforcement Watch, to act as
the plaintiff in the garage suits.</TE>
<TE>   Dresslar, of the attorney general's office, declined to cite
examples of unprofessional conduct or incompetence on the part of the
Trevor Law Group. He did express concern that the situation could
fuel efforts to dismantle the Unfair Competition Act, which he said
is most often used by consumer groups to target abuses by large
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to try to pin down what the abuses are," Dresslar said.
"And once we do, then we can talk about solutions that are balanced,
that target the bad actors without reducing the important consumer
protections afforded by the statute," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some small-business groups have talked about seeking legislation
that would weaken the Unfair Competition Act.</TE>

<HD>Jury in Date-Rape Trial Views Tapes of Alleged Attacks</HD>
<DH>The prosecution presents video segments that millionaire
Andrew Luster made of women he is accused of drugging and assaulting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millionaire date-rape suspect Andrew Luster did not use a gun or a
knife to prey on young women, but a potent drug that knocked out his
victims and erased any memory of sexual assaults he gleefully
captured on a hidden camera, a prosecutor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Those homemade movies, scenes of which were shown during opening
statements in Luster's trial, are now prosecution evidence to prove
the 39-year-old surfer drugged and raped three women at his Mussel
Shoals beach home.</LD>
<LD>   "He did this so he could rob them of their memories and violate
them over and over again," Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve
Fox said, as she projected grainy pictures of two naked and
unconscious women onto a courtroom wall.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who did not give an opening statement Monday,
maintain that the women were pretending to be asleep while acting in
pornographic movies Luster hoped to sell.</TE>
<TE>   They say Luster engaged in consensual sex with the women, who have
been described as embarrassed party girls lying about the sexual
encounters.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, a great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with 87 criminal counts stemming from alleged assaults on
three women during a four-year span.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of rape,
sodomy, sexual battery, drug possession and poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Fox told the seven-woman, five-man jury the case is unusual
because many of those crimes were captured on videotape and will be
seen in graphic detail.</TE>
<TE>   Although the women will testify, Fox said, two have no memory of
the 1996 and 1997 videotaped encounters and the third, identified as
Carey Doe, has only a spotty memory of her alleged assault by Luster
in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was Carey Doe's report to law enforcement that led to Luster's
arrest two years ago. A 21-year-old UC Santa Barbara student, Carey
told police that she met Luster while partying at a downtown Santa
Barbara bar, then went back to his beach house where Luster allegedly
drugged and raped her.</TE>
<TE>   Carey's report led to a search of Luster's home, where detectives
seized numerous homemade movies that depict him raping the two
videotaped women and other women who have not been identified, Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges were filed on behalf of Carey and the two women,
Shawna and Tonja, after they identified themselves as appearing on
the tapes. On the tapes, the two women can be heard snoring and
having trouble breathing as Luster assaults them and makes remarks to
the camera, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   On one tape, Fox said, Luster can be heard saying that his perfect
dream is "a strawberry blond passed out on my bed ... ready for
anything." The blond is 17-year-old Shawna, naked and comatose, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is blacked-out cold; she is not playacting," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   On another tape, the second groggy woman winces in pain as the
defendant sodomizes her, Fox said. She urged jurors to watch the
women's faces when the tapes are played in court to determine for
themselves whether they were pretending to be asleep.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tapes and women's statements, jurors will hear
from an expert on the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB,
which prosecutors contend was Luster's "weapon of choice" to
incapacitate women.</TE>
<TE>   The clear, salty-tasting liquid, which can be produced from a
powerful drain cleaner, is commonly used by rapists, Fox said,
because it quickly renders victims unconscious and leaves them with
no memory of what occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In the prosecution case, jurors also will hear a telephone "cool
call," set up by detectives between Carey Doe and Luster, in which he
admits giving her Liquid X, or GHB, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors will then see a videotape of Luster's July 18, 2000,
interview with Ventura County sheriff's detectives in which he denies
giving Carey drugs, then admits to mutual GHB use after being
confronted about the earlier call.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that Mr. Luster knew exactly what the
significance of the GHB was," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   She also noted that during the police interview Luster described
himself as a wealthy real estate investor and stock trader -- but
never a porn producer, as the defense now insists.</TE>
<TE>   Before the prosecutor's opening statement, defense attorney Roger
Jon Diamond filed a flurry of last-minute motions and asked Superior
Court Judge Ken Riley to postpone the trial to give the defense time
to investigate new evidence of police and prosecutor misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot make an opening statement without this information,"
Diamond said, holding up large poster boards of investigative
reports, which he contend warrant further scrutiny. But Riley refused
to postpone the trial.</TE>

<HD>Dental Accord Delayed</HD>
<DH>Judge orders changes in warnings to be posted about
potential dangers of mercury fillings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An agreement to place warnings in all California dental offices on
the potential dangers of mercury fillings was delayed Monday when a
judge ordered revisions so patients can better decide how serious the
risk is.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the environmental group As You Sow and the
California Dental Assn. must submit proposed changes to the state
attorney general's office. If they can't agree, the attorney
general's office will suggest warning language.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Superior Court Judge A. James Robertson II has
ordered the parties to court Thursday, when he is scheduled to issue
the order requiring that warnings be posted within 90 days.</LD>
<TE>   As You Sow filed the lawsuit two years ago under the state's
Proposition 65, an initiative that requires businesses to post
warning signs if they use hazardous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, dentists have argued with environmental and patients
groups over the effects of mercury amalgam. Both sides agree that
mercury by itself is toxic.</TE>
<TE>   But the American Dental Assn. has concluded that not enough is
absorbed into the body through the fillings to affect health.</TE>
<TE>   But critics, such as As You Sow, say it causes reproductive and
neurological damage.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Khorrami, a Van Nuys attorney for the environmental group,
said the agreement will mark the first time the U.S. dental
establishment "has admitted that mercury is potentially a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Lori Reed, a spokeswoman for the California Dental Assn.,
downplayed its significance, saying that the warning simply puts
dentists in compliance with Proposition 65.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Weil, the supervising state attorney general, said the judge
wants language to help patients gauge what science says about the
risk and to suggest that they consult their dentists.</TE>
<TE>   Gold and ceramic fillings can substitute for amalgam, which
contains mercury. Dentists say mercury is easier to work with and
more durable. It also is cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   Weil noted that Canadian dentists do not use mercury fillings in
pregnant women, and that several European countries are much stricter
with their use.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are searching for two masked men who bound and robbed two
employees early Monday as they closed an Irvine video store,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The employees, whom police would not identify, were not injured in
the 1 a.m. robbery at Blockbuster in the 3900 block of Alton Parkway,
said Irvine Police Lt. Dave Freedland.</LD>
<LD>   The thieves ordered the two men to open the safe, then lie down in
the bathroom, where their hands were duct-taped, Freedland said. The
robbers took DVD players, computer programs, games and money before
fleeing.</LD>
<TE>   The employees freed themselves and called police.</TE>
<TE>   The thieves were in their 20s, about 5 feet 10, and wore black ski
masks and dark gloves. Anyone with information is asked to call
Investigator Mike Li (949)724-7244.</TE>

<HD>Light-Plane Crash Kills Two Aboard, Damages Two Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino and Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people were killed Monday afternoon when their small plane
crashed in a suburban Anaheim Hills neighborhood during a downpour,
damaging two houses.</LD>
<LD>   The Piper Cherokee, which flew out of Oceanside, crashed about
2:30 p.m. as it prepared to line up for a landing at John Wayne
Airport, said Larri Dillard, operations officer for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Lawndale.</LD>
<LD>   A man and a woman were killed in the crash, but their identities
were not immediately available, said Anaheim city spokesman John
Nicoletti. Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board were on the scene by late afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third such crash in less than two months in Orange
County, and the second in north Anaheim. On Nov. 8, Dennis Beitel,
58, of Temecula died when his single-engine Cessna crashed into a
hill along the Riverside Freeway, also during rough weather.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, two people were injured when a single-engine Beech
crashed at John Wayne Airport. Both of those accidents remain under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's crash occurred as a major storm moved across Orange
County, bringing wind, heavy rain and fog that authorities said
probably contributed to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the conditions were not ideal for flight," Nicoletti
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane clipped power lines and a tree as it plunged into the
driveway and frontyard of 810 South Sapphire Lane. The home's garage
caught fire, but firefighters extinguished the flames before they
damaged the home, Nicoletti said. Debris, which caused minor damage
to the garage next door, was scattered across front lawns and in the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Karen McEwen and her two young children were not home when the
plane crashed into their frontyard, neighbors said. They returned
briefly to collect belongings and left to stay with family members.</TE>
<TE>   Few neighborhood residents were home at the time, but those who
were said the crash startled them out of what had been a quiet
afternoon subdued by rain and clouds.</TE>
<TE>   One woman who declined to be identified said she was repotting
plants in front of her house when the plane swooped low, clipped a
tree and then flipped, landing on its roof across the street. She
said her son ran over and saw two people, apparently dead, inside the
wreckage before it exploded in flames.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Fasulo, 71, lives next door to where the plane hit the
ground. She said she was about to take a break from writing Christmas
cards when she noticed the sound of a plane unusually close, and a
moment later a loud "smack." Seeing nothing out a side window, she
went to the garage and opened the door to her driveway and saw a
neighbor across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor suddenly took off running, yelling that the plane was
going to explode, and then came a bright flash of fire, Fasulo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The flames just came up. It was terrible," Fasulo said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane didn't miss Fasulo's house by much. Her house reeking of
smoke, she was planning to stay elsewhere for the night.</TE>

<HD>State High Court Endorses Davis' Denials of Parole</HD>
<DH>The 5-2 decision bodes ill for convicted killers who hope
to be freed during governor's term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court gave Gov. Gray Davis wide latitude
Monday to deny parole to inmates, even if they have unblemished
prison records and the state parole board and lower courts say they
should be released.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-2 decision makes it highly unlikely that scores of inmates
convicted of murder will be paroled while Davis is governor.</LD>
<LD>   In an opinion written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, the court
said that Davis need only show that "some evidence" exists to support
his decision to deny parole. The gravity of the crime itself, the
court said, could qualify as sufficient evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The court held that Davis met this standard when he denied parole
to Robert Rosenkrantz, 35, who, at age 18, killed a Calabasas
schoolmate for exposing Rosenkrantz's homosexuality. Two lower courts
had decided that Rosenkrantz, a model prisoner, should be paroled.</TE>
<TE>   But the state high court said Davis' determination that
Rosenkrantz had "brutally murdered" the victim after "a full week of
careful preparation, rehearsal and execution" was enough to keep
Rosenkrantz locked up indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has overturned parole board recommendations for about 160
convicted murderers since taking office and agreed to parole only
two, both of them women who had killed men who battered them.</TE>
<TE>   "It effectively slams the door on a model prisoner who has been
rehabilitated and is no longer a threat to the public," said Donald
Specter, Rosenkrantz's lawyer. "And it virtually eliminates parole
for life prisoners in California during the Davis administration."</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen inmates whose parole dates Davis has revoked are
now pursuing court appeals, and Monday's decision is expected to give
Davis the victory in those disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in a prepared statement, commended the court. He said he
takes his authority to overrule parole recommendations "very
seriously and will continue to review each case thoroughly."</TE>
<TE>   Davis had asked for a ruling that would prevent courts from
reviewing his parole decisions altogether. The court did not go that
far.</TE>
<TE>   The court stressed, however, that it was granting only "limited"
judicial review of parole decisions under an "extremely deferential"
standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Some evidence supports the governor's determination that the
circumstances of petitioner's crime, as well as his conduct before he
surrendered to the authorities, tend to establish that petitioner is
not suitable for parole," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The high court rejected a finding by a Los Angeles Superior Court
judge that Davis has a blanket policy of denying parole to convicted
murderers. The court cited a passage from a Los Angeles Times story
that ran April 9, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Davis told The Times that he believes murderers, even those with
second-degree convictions, should serve life sentences. "If you take
someone else's life, forget it," Davis was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   But the state high court cited Davis' approval of parole for the
two women as evidence that he has no blanket policy.</TE>
<TE>   That Davis has overturned every other parole decision may simply
indicate "that the governor is more stringent or cautious than the
[parole] board in evaluating the circumstances of a particular
offense and the relative risk to public safety," the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz was sentenced to 17 years to life for the
second-degree murder of Steven Redman in 1985. Redman had told
Rosenkrantz's father that Rosenkrantz was gay, and the father threw
the son out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Rosenkrantz confronted Redman and demanded that
Redman retract the statement. Rosenkrantz said that Redman refused
and that he shot Redman 10 times with an automatic weapon outside the
victim's house in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Rosenkrantz, Robert's father, later blamed himself for his
son's actions because the father had rejected the son as a result of
the homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement faxed to The Times on Monday, the elder Rosenkrantz
likened the ruling to a life sentence without the possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Robert cannot change the facts of the crime, but can only
change himself, he could be doomed to spend the rest of his life in
prison regardless of the degree of rehabilitation he accomplishes,"
Herbert Rosenkrantz said. "Our hearts bleed for him."</TE>
<TE>   But he added that he and his family had not lost hope. "We want
the world to know that, in spite of today's decision, we will never
give up on Robert." Rosenkrantz's lawyers are considering an appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court and, if that fails, could petition Davis'
successor.</TE>
<TE>   While in prison, Rosenkrantz has earned a college degree and
tutored other prisoners. Among those who have advocated his release
are the judge who presided at his murder trial and a detective who
investigated the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Board of Prison Terms, which decides whether to parole
inmates convicted of first- and second-degree murder and other
serious crimes, found Rosenkrantz suitable for release in 1996. Board
administrators overturned the decision while Davis' predecessor, Pete
Wilson, was governor.</TE>
<TE>   The parole board did not recommend Rosenkrantz's release again
until it was ordered to do so by Superior Court Judge Paul Gutman in
Los Angeles, which acted on a petition by Rosenkrantz. Davis then
overruled the board.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding Davis' decision Monday, the state high court observed
that "the nature of the prisoner's offense" alone can be enough to
deny parole.</TE>
<TE>   The governor "properly may weigh heavily the degree of violence
used and the amount of viciousness shown by a defendant," George
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Under that reasoning, there will be "virtually always" enough
evidence for Davis to overturn parole decisions, said Specter,
Rosenkrantz's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It basically says the crime itself is a sufficient reason to deny
parole, and these are first- and second-degree murders," Specter
said. "They are the most egregious crimes."</TE>
<TE>   But the court said that, in some circumstances, the crime by
itself might not be enough to justify a denial of parole if there was
no evidence of violence beyond the minimum necessary to win a
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   This finding troubled Justice Carlos Moreno, who wrote separately
to express his qualms. He said that Rosenkrantz might have been found
suitable for parole if he had been convicted of first-degree murder,
instead of second-degree, because the level of violence did not
exceed the minimum needed for a first-degree conviction. First-degree
murder, unlike second-degree, requires premeditation and
deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   "There will come a point, which already may have arrived, when
petitioner would have become eligible for parole if he had been
convicted of first-degree murder," Moreno wrote. "Future denials of
petitioner's parole may warrant judicial reappraisal."</TE>
<TE>   Justices Joyce L. Kennard and Ming W. Chin dissented, arguing that
it was unconstitutional to deny Rosenkrantz parole because state law
has changed since he committed the murder.</TE>
<TE>   Until voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1988,
governors could not override a parole board's recommendation for
release. Laws generally are applied only to cases that occur after
the law's passage.</TE>
<TE>   "For over two centuries, a bedrock principle of American criminal
justice, embedded in both the United States Constitution and the
California Constitution, has been that no state may pass an ex post
facto law, which includes a law that increases the punishment for a
crime after it has been committed," Kennard wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Because Rosenkrantz committed his crime at a time when the parole
board had final say over release dates, he should be subject to the
parole board's decision, not the governor's, Kennard wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a two-year period, she observed that the board had denied
parole in about 99% of the cases it had reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "The board has hardly opened the floodgates; nor should we," she
wrote. "But imposing after the fact a new barrier to parole that
potentially keeps in prison even those scarce few who convince the
board they have earned it violates the prohibition against ex post
facto laws."</TE>
<TE>   One of the next likely cases to challenge the governor is pending
in the state Court of Appeal in San Francisco, said a prisoner rights
attorney, Keith Wattley, of the nonprofit Prison Law Office. It
involves Raymond Skinner, 68, who has served 20 years for killing his
wife during a cocaine-induced psychosis, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wattley said his client has compiled a perfect record in prison.
The board agreed to parole him, but Davis blocked it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about the cream of the crop and Davis doesn't like
them," Wattley said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Wilson, who argued the Rosenkrantz case
on behalf of the governor, said he was pleased with the outcome of In
re Robert Rosenkrantz, S104701. He said he did not know whether the
decision would end parole during Davis' term for people convicted of
murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Each case has to be decided on a case-by-case basis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Eliasberg, managing attorney of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, said the ruling ensures that courts
will rubber-stamp Davis' parole decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is saying, " 'You will just rot in jail for the rest of your
life,' and the court is saying that is fine," Eliasberg said.</TE>

<HD>Marines' Physical Training Halted by Outbreak</HD>
<DH>The San Diego base, where strep A has killed a recruit,
will suspend strenuous activities for three days to allow time for
the ill to recover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Marine officials on Monday announced a three-day halt to strenuous
physical training at a base here, following the death of a recruit
less than a week after the outbreak of a potentially fatal bacterium.
As many as 100 recruits have been hospitalized -- although it's
unclear how many have contracted Group A streptococcus -- and three
were sent to intensive care.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Capt. John Malone confirmed Monday that the death of
18-year-old Pvt. Miguel Zavala on Sunday was due to a bacterial
infection that was consistent with the bacterium, which has spread
quickly through the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in the past week.
Zavala's final autopsy results are pending.</LD>
<LD>   One recruit remained in critical condition with an upper
respiratory infection Monday, and about 50 others, including a drill
sergeant, remained hospitalized, doctors said. Most have pneumonia
and are taking antibiotics, although it is not confirmed that they
are infected with strep A, they added.</LD>
<TE>   Two other Marine deaths in the last month appear unrelated to the
outbreak -- one apparently tied to heart disease and the other to
pulmonary edema, the lungs filling with liquid.</TE>
<TE>   The roughly 4,600 recruits at the San Diego base, one of two
recruit training centers for the U.S. Marine Corps, will continue
taking classes but will not participate in martial arts, swim drills
or obstacle courses.</TE>
<TE>   Malone said doctors could not rule out the possibility that Zavala
also may have been infected with meningococcal bacteria, which can
lead to meningitis. Zavala died just hours after discovering a rash
on his ankle, before his family could arrive from Northern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, if confirmed, would reverse the earlier opinions of
doctors, who had said they did not believe his death was linked to
the outbreak of strep A.</TE>
<TE>   Marine officials discovered the spread of strep A last week and
gave injections to thousands of recruits Sunday. The bacterium is
often found in the throat and on the skin, and can cause illnesses
such as strep throat.</TE>
<TE>   In severe cases, it can cause potentially fatal necrotizing
fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease. It does not appear that the
bacteria in Zavala's system had progressed to that degree.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything possible to ensure the safety and
well-being of not only the recruits, but the training population here
as well," said Maj. Gen. Jan Huly.</TE>
<TE>   Recruits are being educated about the bacterium and will be
screened on a weekly basis, Huly said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the three-day suspension of physical training should
prevent any sick or recovering recruits from overexerting themselves.
Huly said he would reevaluate the situation Wednesday to see if
physical training should be resumed.</TE>
<TE>   Medical officials continue to investigate the outbreak, but
believe it is isolated to the recruits and the training staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We just do not have indications that this infection is moving
from our closely confined group of recruits to the population," said
Malone, director of medical services at the Naval Medical Center in
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   All three recruit deaths are under investigation. Huly said he
plans to step up medical screening when recruits arrive to ensure
that there aren't any preexisting conditions that could lead to
health problems with heavy physical activity.</TE>
<TE>   The first death occurred Nov. 23, when Pvt. Neal Edwards, 18,
collapsed on an obstacle course and died from a heart abnormality
known as cardiac arrhythmia.</TE>
<TE>   Pvt. Samuel Bruss, 19, died Thursday after survival training in
the swimming pool, where recruits swim while dressed in full combat
gear. Doctors believe he died from pulmonary edema.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rejects Reprieve on Deadline for Water Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- Hopes that coastal Southern California might get a
reprieve from a Dec. 31 deadline and avoid a water cutback were
dashed Monday when Interior Secretary Gale Norton said she will
immediately order such a reduction if a deal for Imperial Valley
farmers to sell water to cities is not reached.</LD>
<LD>   Some officials at the annual convention of the Colorado River
Water Users Assn. were hoping that Norton might announce a
last-minute arrangement to give four Southern California agencies
more time to reach an agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Norton said that it was "time to lay our cards on the
table and demonstrate that the Department of Interior has not been
bluffing."</LD>
<TE>   But Norton tempered her tough talk with a softer approach toward
the Imperial Irrigation District, whose refusal to sign the deal has
sent the world of Western water planning into disarray. Norton
declined to single out the Imperial district for criticism.</TE>
<TE>   She also backed off on comments made last week by Assistant
Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, the administration's point man on
Western water issues, that the government might move to reduce the
Imperial district's gigantic allotment of the Colorado River, without
compensation, if the Dec. 31 deadline is not met.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial district has already hired lawyers to fight any
attempt by the government to brand the district as wasteful and take
some of its water.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial directors said they appreciated Norton's softer tone and
her refusal to characterize Imperial as being intransigent or the
district's concerns as being illegitimate. They had been annoyed by
the hardball bargaining that preceded an Oct. 15 tentative agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's a message," said Director Andy Horne. "If so, we
received it. We appreciate that we have not been singled out."</TE>
<TE>   Other officials say that the different tone could be helpful in
aiding the negotiations between Imperial, the San Diego County Water
Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District and the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "They're working on it, so it's not helpful to throw out extra
threats right now," said Larry Dozier, deputy general manager of the
Central Arizona Project.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona stands to gain water if California cannot meet the Dec. 31
deadline and the Department of Interior suspends the surplus water
shipments, theoretically dividing the water among other Western
states.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial directors have said there has been daunting pressure from
the state and federal governments, as well as water officials
throughout Southern California and six other states. That made it
difficult, but still necessary, to reject the deal at the eleventh
hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been sweating dirt clods over this," said Director Bruce
Kuhn, who provided the swing vote in the 3-2 rejection.</TE>
<TE>   Under complex agreements between the federal government and seven
states that depend on the Colorado River, California is assured of
4.4 million acre-feet of water -- 75% of which goes to the Imperial
Irrigation District for desert agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   By receiving so-called surplus water, California has been
receiving more than 5.2 million acre-feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   The extra water goes to the Metropolitan Water District for
distribution to agencies serving 17 million people in six counties.</TE>
<TE>   The other drought-beset Colorado River states have demanded that
California learn to live within its allotment of 4.4-million
acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   In an agreement two years ago, those states said they would allow
California 15 more years to wean itself from surplus water but only
if certain deadlines were met.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 31 is the first such deadline. Norton said she had no
authority to extend it.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to respond to a failure to meet the first
deadline, in the seven-states deadline, by lessening the requirements
for enhanced access to surplus water," Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Gastelum, president and chief executive of the Metropolitan
Water District, said the agency has enough water in storage to offset
the loss of surplus water for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I would classify this as a serious situation but not yet dire,"
Gastelum said. "Dire would suggest we're not prepared. We are."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond a different tone in negotiations, Norton offered nothing
that will help alleviate Imperial's concern about being billed
hundreds of millions of dollars for damage done to the Salton Sea if
the deal is struck. The sea, which survives on agricultural runoff,
will shrink and become saltier if Imperial reduces its water usage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anyone stepping forward to sweeten the deal," Norton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed 75-year agreement, the Imperial district would
sell up to 200,000 acre-feet of water to San Diego County.</TE>

<HD>Republicans to Reconsider Lott as Leader</HD>
<DH>Key senators turn up the heat with plans for emergency
conference. Mississippian appears on black TV network to again
apologize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Republicans agreed Monday to reconsider whether Trent Lott
should remain their leader, while the Mississippi senator appeared on
a black-oriented cable television network to plead for forgiveness
for remarks seen as racially divisive.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by senior Republicans to hold an emergency conference
on Jan. 6 to review Lott's status as the incoming majority leader --
and possibly strip him of the title -- provided clear evidence of how
his support within the party has hemorrhaged in the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Suspense over the Senate leadership situation grew as GOP senators
gauged quiet signals from the Bush administration, public sentiment
toward Lott, the pros and cons of possible successors and their own
degree of loyalty to the man who has led them since 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Lott mounted a last-ditch defense of his job, using both public
and private channels as a showdown looms on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Just a month ago, Lott was triumphantly reelected as party leader,
unopposed after the GOP retook the Senate in the midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   But remarks Lott made on Dec. 5 at a birthday party for
centenarian Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), praising Thurmond's run for
president in 1948 on a platform advocating racial segregation,
unleashed a controversy that threatens to cost Lott his leadership
post.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to reverse the tide now running against him, Lott
journeyed to Mobile, Ala., for an interview with Black Entertainment
Television. In a 30-minute interview, Lott apologized yet again for
his praise of Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is to recognize the hurt that I've caused and
ask for forgiveness and find a way to make amends," Lott said in the
interview with BET's Ed Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's remarks represented a significant shift for a politician
whose voting record and past public statements have been harshly
criticized by civil rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   On BET, he repeatedly pledged support for affirmative action,
despite a record of voting consistently against federal initiatives
in that arena. Aides later clarified that Lott opposes racial quotas,
but wants to broaden opportunities for all Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Lott also recanted his vote two decades ago against establishing a
federal holiday for civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and
said he would "listen to and talk to African American leaders" if he
retains his Senate position.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he would reconsider his ties to the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a group attacked as segregationist.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange with Gordon, Lott cocked his head but did not
interrupt when the interviewer said he had a segregationist past. In
another, Lott told Gordon, who is black: "In order to be a racist,
you have to feel superior. I don't feel superior to you at all."</TE>
<TE>   The White House, aware that the Senate majority leader will bear
much responsibility for shepherding the administration's agenda
through Congress, has distanced itself from Lott, leaving the
longtime GOP leader to mount his own defense. Last week, President
Bush scorned Lott's comments at Thurmond's party; the White House's
chief spokesman repeated the criticism Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Lott received a boost late Monday from one of the most
prominent black Democrats in Congress. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a
leader in the civil rights movement, said he and Lott had what he
called "a very productive" conversation earlier in the day. Lewis,
who has been among those highly critical of Lott's remarks, said he
accepted Lott's apology as sincere.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like so many leaders of the old South, Trent Lott has the
potential to become a better person and a better political leader,"
Lewis said, adding that he had invited Lott to join a bipartisan
delegation to Selma, Ala., next spring to commemorate the historic
1965 march for civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders of the all-Democrat Congressional Black Caucus issued
a new statement reiterating their demand for a formal Senate censure
of Lott.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's appearance on BET was his latest, certainly most offbeat,
effort to apologize for his remarks at the Thurmond party. But many
of his GOP colleagues seem increasingly convinced that Lott's
standing has been damaged beyond repair.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, some Senate Democrats have called for Lott to
step aside as leader.</TE>
<TE>   An array of civil rights groups have also called for Lott's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   More ominously for Lott, many Republican senators have remained
silent on the matter -- a sign of peril for him in a capital that
prizes public shows of support.</TE>
<TE>   Others have issued terse statements that deplore the questions
hanging over the GOP leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana became the latest Republican to
express concern about Lott's status on Monday, joining a handful of
senators who had publicly called for a new meeting on the party
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) agreed, saying: "Given the gravity
of this most serious matter that has implications for our
institution, our party and our nation, it is imperative we resolve,
once and for all, the question of who should lead the Republican
majority in the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Intraparty rebellion broke into the open Sunday when Sen. Don
Nickles (R-Okla.) said Lott was a weakened leader who could be
replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Nickles, a longtime Lott rival, could contend for the majority
leadership if Lott is forced out.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, another possible candidate and one
with close ties to the White House, issued a statement that pointedly
omitted any expression of support for Lott.</TE>
<TE>   "My Republican colleagues and I are actively engaged in deciding
what is in the best interest of the Senate as an institution and the
country," Frist said. "I am confident a consensus will emerge, but no
decisions have been made yet, and I have endorsed no specific
proposal at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Still another potential successor, Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, has publicly stood by Lott.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has escalated continuously since Lott noted that
Mississippi backed Thurmond for president in 1948. Lott added: "And
if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have
had all these problems over all these years, either."</TE>
<TE>   Asked on BET what "problems" he meant, Lott said, "I was talking
about the problems of defense, of communism, and budget, of a
government that sometimes didn't do its job. But again I understand
that was interpreted by people the way it was and I should have been
sensitive to that."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House on Monday, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer called
Lott's statement at the Thurmond birthday party "offensive and
repugnant." Bush had used the term "offensive" last Thursday in
discussing Lott's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleischer reiterated that Bush "does not think he [Lott] needs
to resign."</TE>
<TE>   While Bush's opinions, public and private, could weigh heavily on
the outcome of the controversy, the final decision on the leadership
rests with the 51 Republican senators who will serve in the 108th
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency meeting, announced Monday by Sens. Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania, chairman of the Republican conference, and Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas, the vice chair, is scheduled for noon on Jan. 6
-- one day before the new Congress convenes.</TE>
<TE>   Many Senate Republican aides were betting that the situation would
be resolved sooner than that.</TE>
<TE>   Some gave Lott an outside chance at keeping his position. But most
said he appeared on his way out.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an air of inevitability" about Lott's fall, said a senior
Senate GOP aide.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican senator suggested there was still a chance Lott
could hang on. He also predicted Lott would not quit before the GOP
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "That's his nature," said this senator, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. "I don't see him resigning before then. He may rally
the troops and be given a vote of confidence."</TE>

<HD>Too Far to the Left for Far Right</HD>
<DH>Furor over Lott has laid bare a political reality: GOP's
conservative wing doesn't like him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- As one of the Senate's most conservative members,
Republican Trent Lott is an unlikely punching bag for his party's
right wing.</LD>
<LD>   But the voice of the conservative community has been among the
loudest in the growing clamor for Lott to relinquish his post of
incoming Senate majority leader, turning those who should be his
natural political allies into some of his fiercest adversaries.</LD>
<LD>   Their animus is helping propel the challenge to Lott by Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, one of the few Senate Republicans who is
arguably more conservative than the Mississippian.</LD>
<TE>   This has laid bare a long-standing political reality little
noticed outside the GOP inner circle: Many in the GOP's influential
conservative wing have never much liked him, even before this month's
imbroglio over comments by Lott that seemed to endorse segregation.
They also have viewed him as an ineffective leader.</TE>
<TE>   These conservatives believe he has not pushed their agenda
aggressively enough. Many blame him for the defection of Sen. James
M. Jeffords of Vermont from the GOP last year, which stripped the
Republicans of their Senate majority when Jeffords became an
independent. And they question whether Lott is, in his heart, a
dyed-in-the-wool conservative -- or just a typical politician most
interested in steering federal dollars to his state.</TE>
<TE>   "They have never felt comfortable with Lott," said one GOP source
close to conservative activists. "They believe he's a dealmaker, not
an ideologue."</TE>
<TE>   On that tinderbox of hostility, the controversy over Lott's
remarks at a party honoring Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) was like a
lighted match. Demands for his resignation have flared from such
bastions of conservative opinion as National Review commentators
William J. Bennett and Charles Krauthammer.</TE>
<TE>   "If he were an effective leader or personally popular, he would
have weathered this easily," said William Kristol, editor of the
conservative magazine the Weekly Standard. He also has called for
Lott's resignation as leader.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, Lott is about as conservative as they come. He opposes
abortion rights and government regulation of business; he supports
tax cuts and gun rights; he has a 93% lifetime voting record with the
American Conservative Union.</TE>
<TE>   When he was first elected Senate GOP leader in 1996, conservatives
were delighted because he promised a more aggressive, combative form
of leadership than was expected from the man he beat for the job,
fellow Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran. He also was expected to
more aggressively push conservative causes than the GOP leader he
succeeded, Bob Dole of Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   But many conservatives were quickly disappointed. Some were
especially angered when Lott in 1997 did not block Senate passage of
a chemical weapons treaty, despite vehement opposition from
conservatives skeptical of such international pacts. Conservative
activist Paul M. Weyrich denounced Lott as a "doormat for
[then-President] Clinton." In 1998, Lott and other GOP leaders
enraged fiscal conservatives by accepting a budget deal that critics
said spent too much and gave too much ground to Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, conservatives were disappointed that Lott was not
more combative in dealing with Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota. They argue that Lott did not push hard enough to get
a Senate vote on a ban on human cloning. He infuriated conservatives
in the House by last year joining in support of an airport security
bill that allowed federalization of baggage screening jobs and this
year by backing a tougher corporate reform bill than the one the
House had passed.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't see that Lott was able to hold his own against
Daschle," said one activist who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   To an even greater degree, the rap on Lott among conservatives has
been based more on style than substance.</TE>
<TE>   "Trent is not perceived as a fighter," said a Republican close to
the Senate leadership. "It isn't ideology; it's how hard is he
willing to fight and lose occasionally [to score political points].
Trent does not like to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's allies say that conservatives -- especially activists who
do not hold office -- do not understand the pragmatic need for
compromise within Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things you must do as leader that you have the luxury
of not doing when you're not in the leadership," said a senior Senate
GOP aide. "It's always much easier to stand outside this tent
machine-gunning in."</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives were already calling for Lott to step down
after the 1998 elections, in which the GOP failed to gain despite the
Monica S. Lewinsky scandal looming over Clinton. The National Review
urged Republicans to replace Lott with Nickles, arguing that Lott
"has proven himself better suited to the back bench, where he is at
least a generally reliable vote." Just last week, the magazine
revived its argument for Nickles. "We have long considered Lott a
clumsy and ineffective Republican leader, and his controversial Strom
Thurmond birthday remarks are a spectacular confirmation of that
judgment," the magazine editorialized.</TE>
<TE>   Also criticizing Lott, but stopping short of demanding he resign,
has been the Wall Street Journal's editorial board. It did, however,
raise the question of "whether Mr. Lott can still lead the GOP Senate
in what is a historic opportunity for conservative reform."</TE>
<TE>   The Family Research Council, a conservative group that focuses on
social issues, complained that Lott's comments "will serve only to
reinforce the false stereotype that white conservatives are racists
at heart."</TE>

<DH>Refs Suddenly Are Under Siege; Is Reality as Bad as
Perception?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since I spent a day with a group of former NFL officials who
teamed up to work one last high school football game with a friend
dying of cancer, I have thought of referees in a different light.</LD>
<LD>   They aren't robots in gray shirts or the enemy. They're people.
People who love sports, people who love to mine enjoyment out of
life. They're people who love their jobs and dedicate themselves to
doing that job well.</LD>
<LD>   But because they're human, I do think they can be subject to
personal feelings. They can be swayed by the charismatic aura of star
players or burn at the incessant hammering of an edgy coach.</LD>
<TE>   And because they're human, sometimes they simply blow the call.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that was the case in each of the nine mistakes the NFL
admitted were made in a review of a Minnesota-Green Bay game leaked
to the media.</TE>
<TE>   All of the above could have come into play in the three most
recent attention-grabbing incidents in the NBA. I'd like to leave it
at human error, but the biggest problem facing the league is the
perception that there's more behind calls than a mere reaction and
tweet of the whistle.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Boston Celtic star Paul Pierce chipped two teeth
when he was knocked to the floor against the Phoenix Suns. No foul
was called, prompting Boston broadcaster Tom Heinsohn to rage on the
air and later tell the officials, "You guys were awful tonight.
Absolutely terrible," as they made their way to their dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, after Miami Coach Pat Riley watched the New York Knicks
shoot 37 free throws to the Heat's 16, he said his team was the
victim of an "absolute dislike for me by the officials." He also said
that when his franchise went into decline, veteran official Steve
Javie told him, "It's given us absolute delight to watch you and your
team die."</TE>
<TE>   None of the words were as dangerous as the debris thrown at
officials by Utah Jazz fans after a late call went against their team
in a loss to the Sacramento Kings on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It has all led to an increase in paperwork and videotapes for Stu
Jackson, the NBA's vice president of operations -- and it has turned
up the volume on the always-humming chatter about objectivity of NBA
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "[The incidents] tend to come in bunches. That has been my
experience," Jackson said. "The same questions, whether it be
announcers, coaches or fans. We've had all three over the past
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   A little later, he said, "I'm concerned about the events of the
past few days. I'm concerned about the safety of our officials as
they enter or leave an arena. I'm concerned when somebody wants to
criticize the officials in a manner that's not constructive. We're
concerned about announcers that -- at least in my mind -- cross the
line with regards to criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of officials, it's an ongoing concern that we continue
to focus on their development and continue to attain a level of
consistency."</TE>
<TE>   That last part appears to be as far off as time travel.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion diluted more than the quality of the NBA. The extra
teams and games -- and the addition of a third official to each crew
in 1988 -- have padded the officiating ranks with more inexperienced
refs.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? The NBA has incorporated instant replay to help
determine if shots and fouls occur before the end of quarters.
Jackson said it has been used more than 100 times this season, with
six reversals -- and that the league is reluctant to expand the use
of replay because just about every call the officials make is a
judgment call.</TE>
<TE>   We can accept bad. We just can't tolerate agendas. It's already
accepted as fact that the superstars and the marquee teams get an
edge. The Lakers had to fight their way through that on the way to
the top, and now they benefit from the champion's perks.</TE>
<TE>   But is it simply a matter of the best team getting the breaks, or
do officials yield to the same celebrity wow-factor that lets actors
escape speeding tickets?</TE>
<TE>   I've seen officials introduce family and friends to Laker players
after games. According to a lawsuit filed by Karla Knafel, responding
to an extortion suit filed by Michael Jordan resulting from an affair
they had 13 years ago, she was introduced to Jordan by official Eddie
F. Rush. If a ref is dropping Jordan's name and calling him up while
talking to a singer at a hotel, don't you think he might hook Jordan
up with a trip to the free-throw line the next time a shot doesn't go
down? It sure seems possible.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the NBA doesn't have a written policy against
officials socializing with players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly discourage fraternization among referees with
players," he said. "However, we are not naive to think that there
won't be occasions when a player finds himself in the presence of a
ref socially and vice versa. That's going to happen at times.</TE>
<TE>   "The referees clearly understand that fraternization or contact
with players won't be tolerated. In the case of Karla Knafel, she
makes an allegation about Eddie Rush. We have talked to Eddie and
feel comfortable with his account of the incident."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson wouldn't elaborate on the discussion, but his comfort
level seems to be reached more easily than most NBA fans'.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the possibility of officials going out of their way
to antagonize players and coaches. I've heard players say that
officials told them they were going to get them. And if anyone would
be a target for officials' "animus," to use a Riley word, it would be
Riley himself.</TE>
<TE>   Riley is one of the primary reasons officiating is a talking point
in the NBA. When he coached the Lakers, he complained that the Boston
Celtics were too thuggish during their NBA Finals matchups. And he
and Phil Jackson turned every day off between playoff games into a
referee-baiting contest when the Knicks and Bulls went at it in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cashion, an NFL official for 25 years before retiring in 1996,
said it was never personal for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think officiating at this level is beyond that," he said. "I
hope it would be. I don't know of any case where I think any call was
made or not made because of a particular coach or a particular
player."</TE>
<TE>   He said that notion primarily comes from coaches under heat.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you ever hear any of the coaches, when they're
winning, fussing about the officiating," Cashion said. "That's a
strange phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   He said officials and participants can be friendly outside the
workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "If we ended up on a plane together and a coach wanted to visit,
I'd entertain him and be glad to do that," Cashion said. "If we met
at a social function, I'm not going to hide from him. But I'm not
going to go out of my way. I'm not, in a game situation, going to
call him by his first name. I'm going to call him Coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the ability to maintain the professional relationship is
of utmost importance. When he's got the team with him and I've got
the uniform on, it has to be professional."</TE>
<TE>   There's a decorum that has to pervade the game. The coaches,
players and officials have to be professional. The leagues have the
power to fine and suspend coaches and players to keep them in line.
(Riley could face disciplinary action as soon as Jackson's
investigation is concluded.)</TE>
<TE>   But what about the fans?</TE>
<TE>   In the Utah-Sacramento game, when Jazz center John Amaechi was
called for a foul to send Chris Webber to the line for the winning
free throws, a referee made a bad call. But that didn't give the Utah
fans the right to throw things at the refs. And if they aren't caught
in the act and arrested on the spot, it's hard to punish them.</TE>
<TE>   They're the least accountable, while the targets of their wrath
are the most accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "The critique that the officials are under with the instant replay
and slow motion puts the officials under greater scrutiny," Cashion
said. "You don't see instant replay of the player if he didn't catch
the ball, or that a coach should have gone for the first down instead
of kicking a field goal. Besides that, they don't know any of the
officials. So it's an easy target. I just hope the circumstances are
handled in a dignified and an adult way."</TE>
<TE>   So can we elevate the setting? Can we not throw things when calls
don't go our way? If we're going to make accusations as serious as
Riley's, can we have proof? Can refs stop acting like groupies around
NBA stars? I hope that isn't too much to ask.</TE>
<TE>   But here's what is: perfection.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that I ever saw a perfectly officiated game,"
Cashion said. "Don't know that I ever saw a perfectly coached game or
played game, either."</TE>

<LD>   Pepperdine vs. Montana, at Palo Alto, 7, KPLS (830, delayed 8
p.m.) -- The Waves advanced to the championship game of the Stanford
Invitational to meet Montana, an upset winner over the host Cardinal.
The Grizzlies are led by three-point shooters David Bell and Kevin
Criswell. Bell made six of eight three-point baskets and had 24
points in Monday's win over Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   UC Riverside (1-2) at St. Mary's (4-3), 7 -- St. Mary's is
shooting for its first winning season since 1996-97, when the Gaels
went 23-8 and qualified for the NCAA tournament. Frederic Adjiwanou,
a 6-foot-9 forward from France, scored 16 points Saturday in his
first start, but Stanford won, 76-58. Freshman forward Nate Carter is
averaging 19 points and 8.3 rebounds for Riverside.</LD>

<LD>David Bell had been shooting brilliantly all game, but Montana's
final shot was supposed to be taken by someone else.</LD>

<HD>Clipper Victory Jangles Spurs</HD>
<DH>Gentry ejected, but L.A. beats San Antonio at home for
first time in five years, 91-79. Duncan, Popovich get technical
fouls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At some point Monday, the Clippers stopped worrying about the
officiating. They quit fretting about the hacks and slaps that went
uncalled. And they shrugged off the absence of Coach Alvin Gentry,
who spoke up for them and got ejected.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers set their jaws and simply played basketball. They
played it better than the San Antonio Spurs, too, defeating them,
91-79, before a crowd of 16,575 at Staples Center. It was the
Clippers' first victory over the Spurs at Los Angeles since Dec. 4,
1997, ending a streak of eight consecutive losses.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Olowokandi took rebound after rebound, swished hook shots
and short jump shots and muscled up against San Antonio's Tim Duncan
on the low block. Olowokandi would score 17 points, take 18 rebounds
and add four blocks.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan had 32 points, 11 rebounds, two blocks and one technical
foul, in the fourth quarter. San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich also
got a technical, less than two minutes after Duncan's, as the Spurs
appeared to come a bit unglued down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Duncan is a great player," said Clipper forward Elton Brand, who
had 16 points and eight rebounds. "He's going to get his buckets. We
didn't want the other players to beat us. [Tony] Parker, Steve Kerr,
Steve Smith."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also fashioned their victory on the perimeter, with
Marko Jaric threading a 30-foot bounce pass to Melvin Ely for a dunk
and a 76-61 lead early in the fourth quarter. Andre Miller handled
the ball as if it were on a string, besting Parker. Miller had 12
points and eight assists and Parker had 12 points and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Just in case there was any lingering doubt late, the Clippers
turned Quentin Richardson loose against San Antonio's Danny Ferry.
Richardson scored 10 consecutive points down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers kept a double-digit lead for most of the second half
and led, 90-73, after Richardson scored the last of his season-best
21 points (in 27 minutes) on a twisting move against Ferry with 3:12
to play.</TE>
<TE>   "When a coach or a player gets kicked out, the team rallies around
each other," said assistant coach Dennis Johnson, who moved into
Gentry's seat after Gentry was ejected late in the first quarter. "I
know San Antonio is a good team, but the guys did what they're
expected to do. We're good enough to win games like this when
everybody comes to play."</TE>
<TE>   When the teams played Friday at San Antonio, the Clippers stayed
close until the Spurs went on a 28-4 run that began halfway through
the second quarter and lasted until midway through the third. They
coasted to a 97-84 victory.</TE>
<TE>   That spurt pretty much summed up the Clippers' 2-2 trip to New
Orleans, Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. Efficient one moment, out
of sync the next.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think we've got to learn to be consistent," Gentry said
before the rematch Monday against the Spurs. "Our lack of consistency
has hurt us more than anything this season. We were good in the New
Orleans game. We were good in the Houston game. We struggled like
crazy in between. There's always a five- or six-minute situation that
costs us.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've got to do is learn to stop the runs, execute and come
up with stops [on defense]. If a team like Dallas comes down like
they did [last week], and Nick Van Exel makes two threes, we have to
make sure we execute at the other end and get the ball in the basket.
We can't be seduced into shooting quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was around to witness only part of the Clippers' resilient
play Monday, drawing one technical with 3:22 left in the first
quarter for wailing for the officiating crew to call fouls against
the Spurs. He drew the second with 1:49 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Calculated?" Gentry said, repeating a reporter's question. "Heck
no. That's going to cost me $1,500" in a fine from the league office.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 28-23, by the end of the first quarter, and with the
Spurs' 28-4 run of Friday fresh in their minds, the Clippers went on
a 15-3 run early in the second period to take command before
halftime. Olowokandi keyed the run by scoring seven consecutive
points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers outshot the Spurs, 52.3% to 40.9%, by game's end.</TE>
<TE>   "The technical fouls and ejection [of Gentry] really turned it
around for them," San Antonio's David Robinson said. "They made some
key shots and three-pointers and we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs did get within 77-67 with 7:45 to play after a 10-3 run.
But the technicals on Duncan and Popovich blunted their momentum.</TE>

<HD>It's All Blanks to Giguere</HD>
<DH>Ducks ride his team-record three consecutive shutouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere was as poker-faced as ever
Monday. There was little indication that everything is aces these
days.</LD>
<LD>   His response was the same as ever, low-key, with a smirk and an
eye-on-the-prize philosophy. Giguere, whom the Ducks anointed their
No. 1 goalie in June, gave up 19 goals in his first six games, which
was a big reason for the Ducks' 3-6-3 start. Yet he never seemed
nonplused.</LD>
<LD>   Nor does he now that things are going better.</LD>
<TE>   Giguere recorded a team-record third consecutive shutout Sunday.
He didn't have to overexert himself in the 5-0 victory over
Pittsburgh as he extended his goal-less streak to 200 minutes 15
seconds, also a team record.</TE>
<TE>   But Giguere is not ready to pound his chest.</TE>
<TE>   "I just focus on the next game, that's the challenge," said
Giguere, who, at 25, is fulfilling the promise that led Hartford to
make him the 13th player chosen overall in the 1995 draft. "I know I
am going to have bad days -- a bad game, a bad practice. So whatever
happened this last week, didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   He is the foundation on which the Ducks have based their season.</TE>
<TE>   He is 5-1-1 in his last seven games, during which he has given up
only nine goals and lowered his goals-against average to 2.22. He is
tied for third in the NHL with four shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "You play defense as a team and we have done a pretty good job of
it," team captain Paul Kariya said. "But when we do make a mistake,
'Jiggy' is there to make the save. You have to get great goaltending
to be successful in this league."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are 10-3-3-3 since Nov. 6 and have moved into second
place in the Pacific Division. They are four games over .500 for the
first time since December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere has had much to do with that. He has given up more than
two goals only four times in that span.</TE>
<TE>   "The better your goalie is, the harder the guys play for him,"
Coach Mike Babcock said. "When he is in there, battling for you,
you're more apt to battle for him. If he's a dog, you're not likely
to get 'er going. When you're the meal ticket, you're the meal
ticket."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere has handled that duty with a lunch pail approach.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when he was struggling earlier this season, goaltending
wasn't an issue to me," Kariya said. "Not with the way he works and
the time he puts in."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was reared as a goalie in Montreal, using one of the NHL's
best as his role model. He went to the Montreal Forum to root for the
Quebec Nordiques, making him a picked-on minority. But while the
Nordiques had his heart, Giguere knew his soul belonged to a young
Canadien goalie, Patrick Roy, whose moves he watched and copied.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere must have taken good notes. Before Sunday, Roy was the
last NHL goalie to have three consecutive shutouts, which he
accomplished last season.</TE>
<TE>   But Giguere didn't have the rapid ride to the top Roy enjoyed. He
meandered through a yo-yo existence in Hartford and Calgary. He spent
three seasons shuttling between the NHL and the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I really never got a chance, and I wondered if I was good
enough," Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   That question was answered when the Ducks plucked him from the
Flames for a second-round pick in June 2000. The Flames, overstocked
at goalie, needed to unload one before the expansion draft. It wasn't
out-and-out thievery by the Ducks, but it was pretty close.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere played 34 games for the Ducks in 2000-01, mostly at the
end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That is when I knew I could play in the NHL," Giguere said. "I
finally got to test myself."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Giguere was the best-kept goalie secret in the NHL,
his play camouflaged by a 20-25-6 record. He competed with Steve
Shields, but the competition didn't last long. By December, it was
clear who was No. 1. Giguere finished fifth with a 2.13 goals-against
average and tied for fifth with a .920 save percentage in 53 games.
Shields was traded to Boston in June, and Giguere had to adjust to a
new role.</TE>
<TE>   "You go from being a guy who was battling for a job to a guy who
has the job, that's a whole different thing," Babcock said. "But it
is pretty obvious that Jiggy and [Columbus'] Marc Denis are the next
wave of guys."</TE>

<LD>The Mohegan Tribe, which operates the Mohegan Sun casino in
Uncasville, Conn., is among the groups bidding to own and operate a
Women's National Basketball Assn. team in Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   "The league is aware of our interest," said Mitchell Etess,
executive vice president of marketing for Mohegan Sun.</LD>
<LD>   NBA owners recently voted to allow WNBA teams to play in non-NBA
cities. Hartford, Conn., is the leading contender to land a team for
next season, WNBA President Val Ackerman said. Owners also voted to
allow non-NBA ownership of WNBA teams.</LD>
<TE>   Gambling won't be an obstacle to the tribe's landing a team and
having it play at the 9,700-seat Mohegan Sun Arena, because the
casino doesn't offer sports betting, said Traci Cook of the WNBA. The
NBA has played exhibition games at Mohegan Sun.</TE>

place in Las Vegas on Sept. 13 and be fought at 154 pounds.</DH>

<LD>A tentative agreement has been reached for Oscar De La Hoya and Shane
Mosley to meet in a long-awaited rematch in Las Vegas, at either
Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand on Sept. 13. Under terms of the contract,
which will not be signed until both camps have gone over the details,
De La Hoya will receive between $12 million and $15 million, and
Mosley $4 million with additional money based on pay-per-view buys.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, which stipulates that the fight will be at 154
pounds, is also contingent on Mosley's defeating Raul Marquez on Feb.
8 at Mandalay Bay Events Center. That fight will be formally
announced today. De La Hoya has no plans to fight in the interim.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a done deal," said promoter Bob Arum of De La Hoya-Mosley
II.</LD>
<TE>   "In my book, a done deal is a signed deal," cautioned De La Hoya's
business manager Richard Schaefer. "We went through this with
Fernando Vargas [negotiations collapsed, then were revived]. But all
that said, we are looking forward to signing a contract and, yes, I
think this fight will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Mosley won a split decision over De La Hoya in their first meeting
in June 2000 at Staples Center. According to a source close to the
negotiations, Staples Center officials have been unwilling to enter
the expensive bidding for the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "They just haven't stepped to the plate," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Without signatures on the contracts, neither fighter was available
for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to Shane. Whatever he wants to do, I'm always in his
corner," said Mosley's father, Jack, who serves as his trainer. "He
still has the speed and the agility and he continues to work hard. He
has all the attributes which made him a champion."</TE>
<TE>   The boxing landscape appeared to have changed drastically after
Mosley's hand was raised in the Staples Center ring 2 1/2 years ago.
De La Hoya's world seemed to have fallen apart. He had suffered his
second defeat in as many years, having lost to Felix Trinidad in
1999. De La Hoya was bitter and depressed. He fired his trainer,
Robert Alcazar, cut his legal ties with Arum and flirted with
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, on the other hand, was still unbeaten and seemingly on top
of the world. He fully expected to inherit De La Hoya's title as
boxing's Golden Boy.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, De La Hoya, after a nine-month break to try a singing
career, got a new trainer in Floyd Mayweather Sr., got back into the
ring, got married, eventually made up with Arum and is now coming off
one of his biggest victories, a TKO of Vargas in September.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, on the hand, has lost his last two fights, both to Vernon
Forrest, and will be moving up to 154 pounds for his next one.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya had hoped to lure Trinidad -- who has retired -- back
into the ring, but has given up hope on that option. At least for
now.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if Trinidad reads that we are about to sign with Mosley,"
Schaefer said, "he'll come out of the bushes."</TE>

<HD>Juicy Conversation a Bad Talking Point for ESPN</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't know about you, but when I turned on the TV for the Sunday
Conversation to find O.J. Simpson discussing jokes made about dropped
gloves and slicing when he plays golf, I wondered if ESPN had lined
up alleged murderers, alleged crooks or Michael Irvin to speak in his
place in the event a player from Penn State, Iowa or Miami had won
the Heisman Trophy a day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   I know all about unwatchable TV, appearing regularly on "Around
the Horn" on ESPN, but this goes one ESPN step further, because I'm
not sure there's ever going to be a good reason again to put Simpson
on TV unless he's hooked up to a polygraph.</LD>
<LD>   It's one thing to televise the Heisman Trophy ceremony for a
wandering hour just so you can run almost a dozen promos for the ESPN
movie "The Junction Boys," but there's something odorous about
linking Carson Palmer's Heisman win with the former Trojan Heisman
winner's appearance on center stage a day later.</LD>
<TE>   ESPN said it had no idea Palmer would win the trophy and said the
interview with Simpson had been set earlier, but it was all part of
the Heisman weekend hype and, even if a coincidence, very unbecoming.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday everyone was treated to pictures on ESPN of a
disbelieving, innocent young man cradling his Heisman with joy, and
on Sunday we heard on ESPN about a guy who couldn't care less if he
ever gets back the trophy that was sold to some anonymous East Coast
phone caller for $230,000 to help pay damages in the civil suit he
lost following the murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday the kid talked about the priceless thrill he felt in
receiving such an honor, and on Sunday the other guy told us that for
the right price he'd allow himself to be the butt of some kind of
murder-related joke in a movie.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday the winner struggled to find just the right words to
live up to the moment, and on Sunday the loser said one stupid thing
after another.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC AND Palmer each receive a Heisman Trophy, and while the
school's trophy will be sent via Federal Express on Wednesday,
officials hope to "unveil" the new Heisman in the Heritage Hall lobby
shortly after the team returns from its loss in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU NEVER know with the Clippers, so when I heard Lamar Odom was
practicing without limitations, but won't return to the court until
Dec. 28 -- even though the Clippers are also playing on Dec. 27 -- I
figured it had something to do with owner Donald Sterling saving
money.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the question of Odom's problems off the court earlier
in his career, and so one wonders if there is some sort of NBA
suspension at work here, or some other roadblock keeping him off the
court Dec. 27 in Phoenix -- if the team knows he'll be healthy enough
to play Dec. 28 here against Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   "To me he's doing everything he needs to do in practice to play
right now, but there is a projected date which has come right from
the trainer," said Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry, while obviously none
too happy about having to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Did you ask the trainer why not Dec. 27?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really get a clear-cut answer," Gentry said. "Why don't
you ask him?"</TE>
<TE>   Both the trainer, Jasen Powell, and Odom said they mutually set
Dec. 28 for his return, and Powell explained it's a building process
in allowing Odom's confidence in his healing ankle to grow, and it
will be a boost to his confidence to make his return in front of a
home crowd.</TE>
<TE>   There is no conspiracy here, Clipper executive Andy Roeser said
from his perch on the grassy knoll. "It's 100% medical, and
absolutely nothing more than that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GENTRY, IN the final year of his contract, with the Clippers
holding the option to keep him for another season, opened practice to
the media recently so reporters could see Odom was ready to play. It
caused some friction within the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry's future is tied to Clipper success, and Clipper success is
tied in part to how much Odom, who has been sidelined almost 11
months now, can contribute to the cause this season.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, who oozes charisma and who has the talent to establish
himself as one of the league's stars if he can avoid failing another
drug test, said, "I have taken care of what I need to take care of
off the court and have stayed out of the negative spotlight. I've
done what I need to do to stay in the league and not become a
distraction to this team.</TE>
<TE>   "We set Dec. 28 for my return and we're going to stick by it to
make sure my body is right. I want to make sure I'm here to help come
March and April, and so I will probably come back a patient player,
and poise will have to be my friend."</TE>
<TE>   It'll be interesting now to see how the Clippers fare in Phoenix
on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TEMPORARY Clipper signage on the scorer's table -- running the
length of the Staples Center court between the home and visiting
benches Monday night -- read, "Natural Male Enhancement," while also
providing a phone number, which I didn't see any reason to write
down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CHARGERS are on the verge of missing the playoffs again and
are now feuding with city officials, while threatening to invoke the
escape clause in their stadium lease. Ah, the good old days when we
had a pro team making our lives miserable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Greg Parvin:</TE>
<TE>   "In your face, loser. Carson Palmer won the Heisman. Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha."</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe he got more votes than I did.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrance Johnson scored a season-high 23 points to help Pepperdine
hold on to win its fourth game in its last five with an 83-77 victory
over Richmond in the opening round of the Stanford Invitational on
Monday night at Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   Jimmy Miggins had 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Waves (4-3).
Alex Acker added 16 points and Mike Westphal had 11. Pepperdine will
play Montana in tonight's championship game. The Grizzlies (4-6)
upset No. 17 Stanford, 70-68.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Myers and Tony Dobbins each scored 17 for Richmond (3-3).</LD>
<TE>   Myers made a three-point basket with 14 minutes 27 remaining to
tie the score at 47. The Spiders, making their first trip to
California in five years, scored 12 consecutive points in the first
five minutes of the second half to put themselves back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   The game was still tied with seven minutes remaining when Miggins
made two free throws and Pepperdine began pulling away.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine used a 16-0 run midway through the first half to forge
a 25-15 lead with 6:48 left in the half to take control with a 40-27
lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 72, Loyola Marymount 70 -- Junior center
Varnie Dennis made the decisive two free throws with 1.5 seconds
remaining in overtime for the Mustangs at San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly (2-4) held a 14-point lead at 58-44 with 8:55 remaining
in regulation, but Loyola Marymount went on a 13-1 run. Loyola's
Brandon Worthy made one of two free throws with 48 seconds left in
regulation to force overtime. Worthy had a team-high 14 points for
the Lions (5-4).</TE>
<TE>   Shane Schilling scored 16 points for Cal Poly and Diaby Kamara had
14. Both players played their first game since the 2000-01 season

<HD>McNair Sorely Needed</HD>
<DH>Tennessee quarterback plays through pain and delivers a
24-7 victory over New England.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>You say you want a revolution?</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta's Michael Vick might be the talk of the NFL, but
Tennessee's Steve McNair is still one of the most dangerous
double-threat quarterbacks in the game.</LD>
<LD>   "Michael Vick is the next Steve McNair, not the other way around,"
fullback Greg Comella said. "Michael hopes to one day have the
experience and poise that Steve has."</LD>
<TE>   McNair showcased his skills Monday against New England, running
for a pair of touchdowns to lead the Titans to a 24-7 victory in
their only prime-time game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee (9-5) has won eight of nine since stumbling to a 1-4
start and is tied with Indianapolis for first place in the AFC South.
The Patriots (8-6), who had won five of six, had a chance to catch
first-place Miami in the AFC East but took a step backward in a
conference that has yet to award a postseason berth.</TE>
<TE>   A troubling Patriot trend: They are 7-0 against teams that are
.500 or worse, and 1-6 against teams with winning records. They close
the regular season with home games against the New York Jets and
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans not only outgained New England, 365 yards to 176, but
built a commanding edge in time of possession, 41:30 to 18:30.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a better football team," Patriot Coach Bill Belichick
said. "We just weren't good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee took a 14-0 lead after two quarters, briefly let the
Patriots back into the game with a Tom Brady touchdown run, then
pulled away again when safety Rich Coady intercepted a deflected pass
and returned it 24 yards for a touchdown with 9:58 left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nedney's 28-yard field goal in the fourth quarter gave the
Titans a comfortable cushion, and they wore down the clock with the
running of Eddie George and Robert Holcombe.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the return of Tennessee defensive end Jevon
Kearse, who has been sidelined since the opener because of a broken
bone in his left foot. He recorded a tackle and a pass defensed, and
helped apply the pressure to Brady, who was sacked three times.</TE>
<TE>   Even though McNair hasn't practiced for three weeks because of
nagging rib and toe injuries, he showed why he has quietly emerged as
a most-valuable-player candidate and the offensive centerpiece of the
Titans. The team that once belonged to George now rests squarely in
the hands of McNair, who didn't show a hint of trepidation in running
for a pair of second-quarter touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to count on scrambling and making plays with my legs, and
that's what I did," McNair said.</TE>
<TE>   On his first touchdown, he twisted out of a near-sack by safety
Tebucky Jones, broke up the middle and finished the 11-yard run by
smacking through cornerbacks Terrell Buckley and Ty Law at the goal
line. Later, he plunged in from the one.</TE>
<TE>   McNair might have thrown for a touchdown too, but Justin McCareins
dropped a beautifully placed 44-yard pass at the goal line in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   McNair completed 11 of 24 passes for 136 yards, and rushed six
times for 49 yards. It wasn't a dominating performance, but it was a
reminder to all that he's still going strong. George, who has
struggled with multiple injuries the last two seasons, recorded his
third 100-yard game of the season with 101 in 31 carries.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Boston Globe, McNair ranked 10th last week among
AFC quarterbacks in fan voting for the Pro Bowl, trailing Drew
Bledsoe, Rich Gannon, Brady, Peyton Manning, Tommy Maddox, Brian
Griese, Trent Green, Drew Brees and Chad Pennington. Fan ballots
count one-third toward Pro Bowl selection, with the other two-thirds
comprising votes by players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because Steve isn't breaking the records like Gannon, he
doesn't have the instant fame like the quarterback in Indianapolis
[Manning]," receiver Derrick Mason said. "[McNair's] father wasn't
one of the great quarterbacks in the NFL. What Steve does for this
team, I don't think any other quarterback does for his team. What he
does and he comes out and battles, no matter what's wrong with him.
He's a quarterback in a linebacker's body."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, that linebacker's body was moving around pretty
gingerly after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do you hurt?" someone asked McNair.</TE>
<TE>   "All over, man," he said. "All over."</TE>

<LD>Northern Arizona at UCLA,</LD>
<LD>   7:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Site -- Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   Records -- Northern Arizona 5-2, UCLA 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   TV -- None.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- Fox Sports (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Update -- After a horrendous start, UCLA is gathering momentum in
time to face Kansas on the road Saturday. The Bruins defeated
Portland, 105-67, Saturday for their second decisive victory in a
row. They beat Long Beach State, 81-58, on Dec. 8, ending a losing
streak that included two regular-season games and two exhibitions.
Rebounding remains a concern, but UCLA is getting better,
outrebounding Portland, 61-31. Forward Andre Patterson played seven
minutes in his first action since becoming eligible and gives the
Bruins a stronger post presence. UCLA should be able to crank up the
tempo against Northern Arizona, a Big Sky Conference team that has
won four in a row since losing, 101-65, to Arizona on Nov. 27.</TE>

<LD>It's doubtful USC Coach Chris Gobrecht would have changed her mind
about the Trojans' grueling nonconference games, even if she had
known the outcomes beforehand.</LD>
<LD>   The partial mea culpa delivered by Gobrecht after Saturday's big
loss to Tennessee -- "It may have been a mistake to schedule as many
of these top-10 opponents as we did so close together" -- should not
make her or other Southland coaches skittish about playing the best
teams they can.</LD>
<LD>   Take it from Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt, who says that the
benefits of playing top competition outweigh the concerns.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important to weather the storms," Summitt said. "I know in
1997, when we were 6-4 in January and went on to have 10 losses, it
was a matter of us not giving up on each other. This year, when we
lost to Duke, we examined ourselves individually and collectively. If
you get through the pain of it and get past it, that's when you grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes your losses have to be your greatest lessons."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, that 10-loss team won the NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Summitt: As a consultant to the Washington Mystics, the
Tennessee coach has been closely following the off-season maneuvers
of the WNBA franchises -- Miami and Orlando shutting down operations
and looking to relocate, Portland uncertain whether Trail Blazer
owner Paul Allen will buy the team, Seattle's team considering a move
to another city in the state, and Utah's team moving to San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   She sounded nervous about the league's health and about labor
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you start up a league, players have to be sensitive to
making it work," Summitt said. "Obviously all of the GMs are working
hard and [NBA Commissioner] David Stern is behind it. It certainly
concerns me.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for everyone to get in a room and figure out how to
make it work. A lot of teams have lost a lot of money, and there's
been a lot of money put into this league. There's no question that
without the NBA, there would be no league. Sometimes you have to
learn to work with people through the process and [endure] growing
pains to get where you want to go."</TE>

<TE>   Santa Barbara will play host to sixth-ranked Purdue tonight. The
Gauchos would love a full house at the Thunderdome for obvious
reasons -- and one not so obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Every year for the last four years, Santa Barbara has designated
one home game as a fund-raiser for charity. For every ticket sold
beyond 2,500, $2 goes to a charity.</TE>
<TE>   This year the Gauchos are working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
The goal is to eventually raise $5,000 this season to help grant
wishes of local children who have life-threatening diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our athletes to be givers, not takers," said assistant
coach Cori Close. "So once a year, we have a game to try and make a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   Close said the idea was struck four years ago when the team
decided to raise money for David Clark, a boy whose family had
incurred large medical bills in his fight against aplastic anemia, a
rare blood disease that keeps the bone marrow from producing healthy
cells. Clark is alive today, in part because of the assist by the
Gauchos.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the team's donation went to a fund set up for the
surviving children who'd lost parents in the terrorist attacks on the
New York Twin Towers.</TE>
<TE>   Close said Santa Barbara usually draws 2,500 in its 6,000-seat
arena.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping more people will drop by.</TE>

<HD>Soldiers Shoot 4 Dead in Gaza</HD>
<DH>Israel lets bus service resume in West Bank. Arafat agrees

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
on Monday, at least two of them armed, and Israel eased a key travel
restriction in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat accepted
an invitation from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to send a
delegation to London in January to discuss Mideast peace prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Neither side gave details of who would make up the delegation.
Arafat has been confined to his West Bank headquarters for a year.
Israel has said that he may leave but that he might not be allowed to
return.</LD>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers killed two Hamas members approaching a
border fence. The militant group said the men had been trying to
plant explosives to be used against tanks.</TE>
<TE>   A third Palestinian was shot dead by soldiers when he went to
check on songbirds he kept in cages near his home next to an army
checkpoint in central Gaza, witnesses and relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military sources said gunmen had shot overnight at troops
guarding the Jewish settlement of Neve Dekelim. They said soldiers
returned fire, but they could not say whether the troops hit anyone.</TE>
<TE>   In Rafah, at Gaza's southern tip, a Palestinian was shot dead
Monday night when he approached an army patrol, Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security sources said troops shot and killed a man running
toward them in the dark. The soldiers believed he might have been
carrying explosives and said they would wait until daybreak before
fully examining the scene, the sources added.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Rafah, Israeli tanks and bulldozers knocked down 16
shacks. Palestinians said more than 200 people were left homeless.
The Israelis said the structures were empty and used by Palestinian
gunmen for firing at Israeli positions.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, Israel announced it would ease travel
restrictions and allow Palestinians to run buses between towns and
cities, restoring service that has been cut off for more than two
years. Palestinian bus companies said the service was to resume
today.</TE>

<HD>Vatican OKs New U.S. Policy on Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>The Vatican gave its approval Monday to the revised U.S. bishops'
policy to protect children and combat sex abuse by the clergy,
declaring the need to restore the image of the priesthood in a
scandal that has rocked the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   Approval had been expected after U.S.-Vatican differences in the
plan were worked out by a joint commission last month.</LD>
<LD>   The policy allows bishops to conduct a confidential, preliminary
inquiry when a molestation claim is made to determine whether it is
plausible. If it is, the accused priest is to be put on leave and
then must go before a clerical tribunal.</LD>
<TE>   The original policy, which the bishops approved in Dallas six
months ago, would have allowed church leaders to pull priests out of
their jobs as soon as they were accused. Vatican officials expressed
concern that that approach would deny priests due process.</TE>
<TE>   Under the revised policy, bishops are compelled to obey local
civil law on reporting abuse claims, but not more than that. Church
leaders, however, have pledged to report all allegations involving
children.</TE>
<TE>   Denouncing priestly pedophilia as "evil," the Vatican released a
letter saying the church would have to throw all its energy into
winning back the respect of U.S. Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican announcement came three days after Pope John Paul II
accepted the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law as archbishop of
Boston, removing a figure whose handling of abuse allegations made
him a lightning rod for victims' groups, lay Catholics and some
priests.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bishops say the new guidelines still require guilty clerics
to be removed from public ministry -- saying Mass, teaching in
Catholic schools, wearing a Roman collar -- after a single case of
abuse. Bishops can also ask the Vatican to waive the church's statute
of limitations, which requires victims to come forward by age 28.</TE>
<TE>   The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests has criticized
the revised rules, saying they give too much discretion to bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Review boards including lay people will monitor how dioceses
respond to abuse, but the policy stresses that only bishops can
manage clergy.</TE>

<HD>Judge in Runnion Kidnap-Murder Case Is Replaced After
Request by Defense</HD>
<DH>Attorney files bias claim for defendant Avila, who is
scheduled to get a trial date Friday.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new judge was appointed Monday to preside over the trial of a man
accused of kidnapping and murdering 5-year-old Samantha Runnion after
his lawyers accused the original judge of prejudice.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Avila's defense team did not explain the bias claim
filed in court against Superior Court Judge F.P. Briseno. By law,
attorneys are limited to one such request without having to give a
reason.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a tactical decision I'm not going to discuss," said
Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg.</LD>
<TE>   Briseno was replaced by Judge William Froeberg.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 28, of Lake Elsinore, reentered pleas of not guilty to one
count each of murder and kidnapping, and two counts of lewd acts on a
child under 14.</TE>
<TE>   He could face the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Avila has waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was
ordered to return to court Friday, when a trial date could be set.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he would continue
to press for a trial within 60 days, while Gragg indicated she needs
more time.</TE>
<TE>   Runnion was kidnapped July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton home.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was found the next day on a mountain road in Riverside
County.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles civil rights lawyers, clergy and academics filed a habeas

captured in Afghanistan and held at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in
Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar bid last
month, ruling that the group had no relationship with any prisoners
and had made no effort to communicate with them.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest petition, civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman said he
asked President Bush to forward a letter to each prisoner, offering
to help them obtain legal counsel and court hearings.</LD>

functions in Parker Center should remain centrally located.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, chief legislative analyst Ron Deaton told a city panel
it would be cheaper to build a new headquarters on city land at 1st
and Alameda streets or 1st and Spring streets than rebuild on the
existing site.</LD>

<HD>Cost of Airport Security in Burbank Is Going Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Security upgrades at Burbank Airport will likely cost several million
dollars more than the original estimate of $25 million, in part
because of design changes requested by the federal government,
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials also warned that departing passengers who check luggage
might experience longer delays as the airport implements new
federally required baggage-screening measures before year's end.</LD>
<LD>   "It's part of our ongoing needs for security," said Dios Marrero,
executive director of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport.</LD>
<TE>   To accommodate new explosives-detecting machinery as well as
beefed-up passenger screening -- required by federal law in the wake
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the airport is expanding its
173,000-square-foot terminal by 40,000 square feet. The terminal will
have more passenger check stations, a wider ticket lobby and office
space for security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, only a fraction of Burbank's checked luggage is
inspected. But the federal government requires that all baggage be
screened by Dec. 31. Until new luggage-screening technology can be
fully installed -- possibly by next spring -- security officers will
use hand-held explosives detectors on baggage throughout Terminal A
and in parts of Terminal B, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Feger, deputy executive director of the airport, said costs
would eclipse the original estimate by several million dollars,
though he could not give a more precise figure. Reasons for the
increase include higher-than-expected costs for new technology as
well as design changes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials asked the airport to build a mezzanine to
improve the work environment for federal employees, an enhancement
that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, Feger said. The cost
of new baggage-moving equipment is also expected to rise because of
increased demand nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of airport commissioners chafed at the higher cost and
expressed hope that the federal government would help pay for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration spokesman Brian Doyle said
the agency is already paying for new screening machinery as well as
the salaries of federal security personnel now stationed at all
airports. Individual airports, for now, are responsible for their own
construction costs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To help pay for the security-enhancement project, airport
commissioners approved an increase in passenger fees, from $3 per
ticket to $4.50. With 2.2 million to 2.3 million departures a year,
the fee increase is expected to generate more than $3 million
annually.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the project cost is coming from the airport's
reserves, currently at $58 million, said spokesman Victor J. Gill.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of the legal newspaper Metropolitan News-Enterprise sued
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley in Los Angeles Superior
Court on Monday, seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the
May 2 search of the newspaper's offices and Cooley's explanations of
it.</LD>
<LD>   During the search, reporters and other staff had to leave the
building for three hours, and an edition was delayed.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators, who were probing allegations of corruption in
South Gate, were seeking material relating to a legal advertisement a
law firm had placed in the paper.</LD>
<TE>   The paper's owner, Roger M. Grace, eventually provided the
material under a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint filed Monday alleges the warrant was invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Cooley, said the district
attorney would have no immediate comment about the suit.</TE>
<TE>   He had not been served yet, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Grace alleges in the suit that during the search, Cooley "did not
even attempt to provide a justification" for closing the paper and
removing the staff.</TE>
<TE>   He also alleges that a press release and letter written by Cooley
to explain the search "were false and defamatory, calculated to harm
the reputation and standing of the Metropolitan News Co. and to
deflect criticism of the rash and unconstitutional raid by the
district attorney."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley had insisted that Grace failed to cooperate with his
investigation, necessitating the search.</TE>

<HD>EIDC May Pay Some of Cluff's Legal Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. have
proposed paying up to $200,000 in future legal fees for its embattled
president, Cody Cluff, who is under investigation for alleged misuse
of funds and perjury, according to a draft agreement obtained by The
Times.</LD>
<LD>   The package would total $300,000, including six months' salary at
about $100,000, according to the document.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, Cluff would be required to fully cooperate
with EIDC officials, including consultants who were recently hired to
conduct a management audit of the film-permit agency. The proposal
includes mutual agreements that Cluff and the EIDC would not sue each
other.</LD>
<TE>   The package has been under discussion between EIDC consultant
Keith Comrie and Cluff or his representatives since Nov. 22, when the
agency's executive committee put Cluff on an administrative leave
with pay, at least until the conclusion of an audit, which is
expected to take about four months.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the negotiations between EIDC and Cluff over the
severance package said details contained in the draft were considered
by members of the executive committee Monday during a closed session.
In attendance were Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Los
Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel and a representative of Mayor
James K. Hahn, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Action was postponed because some members wanted to ensure that
the proposal firmly requires Cluff to reimburse EIDC if he is
convicted of any crimes, according to sources close to the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said members feel they are abiding by state law
and the requirements of EIDC's bylaws to provide funds to Cluff to
defend himself if he is accused of criminal or civil violations for
carrying out his responsibilities as president of the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC's bylaws require that any employee "shall be indemnified
against expenses actually and reasonably incurred" for legal costs if
they are successful in any "civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative proceeding" brought against them because of their work
for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The draft agreement also cites a specific section in California's
corporations code that gives corporations "the power to indemnify"
any of its employees for legal actions against them that arise out
their work.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley sent
letters to EIDC board members that some of them interpreted as
warnings that providing money for Cluff's defense could be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the legal requirements, sources say, executive committee
members recognize that any severance package with Cluff is likely to
ignite public criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members refused to reveal any details about the
discussions Monday, and Cluff declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   When the severance package, which is titled the "Resignation,
Severance and Release Agreement," is concluded, it will end the
seven-year tenure of the man who founded the agency at the behest of
Los Angeles city and county governments. The City Council and the
county Board of Supervisors signed contracts putting the EIDC in
charge of streamlining and combining their cumbersome processes for
issuing permits to production companies and to promote the county to
the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, the EIDC's board and executive committee gave
Cluff virtual carte blanche to run the agency and spend its money as
he saw fit.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Cluff has greatly expanded the EIDC's duties,
taking over film-coordination activities from other government
entities such as the Los Angeles Unified School District, and
increasing the agency's staff from eight to 45, plus 30 part-timers.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's expenditures are what caught the eye of criminal
investigators for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   In a search warrant affidavit earlier this year, they alleged
Cluff had misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in EIDC funds for
trips to resort areas, expensive wine and exorbitant tips, and for
campaign contributions to elected officials, many of whom serve on
the EIDC Board of Directors.</TE>
<TE>   For months after the investigation became public in September,
Cluff continued working for EIDC and getting advice from its lawyers.
But when news stories emerged revealing that Cluff had directed
nearly $47,000 to the Pittsburgh Film Office and a national film
organization run by a close friend of his, Hahn, Yaroslavsky and
Greuel called on him to take a paid leave.</TE>
<TE>   When the committee voted 8 to 2 to force him to leave, Cluff
resisted, prompting the three weeks of negotiations that continued
Monday.</TE>

<HD>UC, Cal State Fees to Increase</HD>
<DH>The hikes, the first in eight years, are in response to the
state's budget crisis. They come over student protests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein and Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's two public university systems Monday approved their
first systemwide fee increases in eight years to help offset proposed
state budget cuts. They warned that more fee hikes, class reductions
or other retrenchments may be on the way for next fall.</LD>
<LD>   Despite protests that some students would have trouble paying the
higher attendance fees, the leaders of California State University
and the University of California said the only alternative was to cut
back on class sections and other academic spending.</LD>
<LD>   For in-state undergraduates, Monday's actions mean an annual
increase of $144 at Cal State schools and $405 in the UC system, with
the first installments due this spring.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very clear that next year will be a much worse year than
this year," said Richard C. Atkinson, president of the nine-campus
University of California system.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to consider virtually every possibility at that time,
including major layoffs, cuts in instructional programs" and in other
areas, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The tone was the same at the California State University Board of
Trustees meeting in Long Beach, where Chancellor Charles B. Reed
successfully argued for the board to boost fees for his 23-campus
system. "When you have nearly a $30-billion shortfall in revenue," he
said, referring to California's overall budget deficit, "everybody is
going to feel some pain."</TE>
<TE>   The two meetings -- a rare instance of both systems' approving
increases on the same day -- came as many students were beginning
their winter breaks or finishing final exams.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for the Cal State meeting, an estimated 200 students came
in busloads from around the state, arguing for the board to hold off
on committing to a midyear fee increase. Many pointed to the hardship
such increases would present students, many of whom are working
adults or from low-income minority families.</TE>
<TE>   Maribel Martinez, president of student government at San Jose
State, said higher fees could result in student dropouts. In
addition, she said, those who remain "are going to be paying more and
possibly receiving less," citing cuts expected to come in the next
school year.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Board of Regents session was conducted by teleconference
from five locations around the state, including UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Klass, chairman of the UC Student Assn., spoke from the
San Diego campus, where he is enrolled. He criticized the regents for
voting on the increases when students there were on vacation and many
were unable to return for the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   He described the fee increase as "a backdoor policy" that "does
not give students and families time to prepare."</TE>
<TE>   Together, the two systems had to deal with a $134-million
reduction in state support in the middle of this academic year.</TE>
<TE>   By a 13-3 vote, Cal State's board raised systemwide yearly fees by
$144 for undergraduates and $228 for graduates. The increases take
effect next month, in the form of a $72 boost for undergraduates and
a $114 increase for graduate students for the spring semester.</TE>
<TE>   In the Cal State system, that will bring annual systemwide fees to
$1,572 for California-resident undergraduates. On top of that, they
pay about $500 for campus fees. For graduate students, system and
campus fees typically will total more than $2,200 a year.</TE>
<TE>   UC regents approved, 11-4, an increase that amounts to $405 more a
year for their students. So for in-state undergraduates, systemwide
fees will be $3,834, with about $1,000 on average extra for added
campus fees and health insurance. The fee increase begins with a $135
boost for the spring term.</TE>
<TE>   For professional school students, the regents approved additional
fee increases that will translate into boosts ranging from $150 to
$400 in the spring term.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who sits on both the Cal State and
University of California boards, appeared at both the Long Beach and
UCLA meeting sites to argue against fee increases. Although the Cal
State and UC systems are widely regarded as inexpensive compared with
equivalent systems around the country, Bustamante called those
assessments a myth, saying they neglect the high cost of housing and
other living expenses in California.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante noted that one-third of the nearly $60 million raised
overall by the rare midyear increases will be returned to the
lowest-income students in the form of financial aid. However, he
said, other students will be hit hard by the fee increases.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're headed for is a substantial cost being born again by
the middle-class and middle-class families," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a strong majority at both meetings said that postponing action
would only make the university systems' financial crises worse. Cal
State trustee Robert Foster praised the students in the audience for
their arguments. Still, Foster said, "there just isn't enough money.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I'm doing this," he added, referring to his vote in
favor of the increase, "is I do believe that the enemy of the future
is indecision today. I hope you understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, UC Regent John Davies, who voted for the increase,
stressed that other parts of the university will be taking cuts and
that students unfortunately have to share the burden. "We are trying
to keep our fees as low as we can and still maintain quality. To me,
it would be irresponsible not to spread the pain around as much as we
can."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Pledges Help in Fight Against Gangs</HD>
<DH>Hahn and Bratton are promised stepped-up prosecutions and
special anti-drug enforcement units to combat rising violence in Los
Angeles.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities Monday pledged more resources to the Los Angeles
Police Department's fight against gang violence, including special
drug enforcement units with a track record of reducing crime in
targeted neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came two weeks after Mayor James K. Hahn and
Police Chief William J. Bratton appeared with family members of a
slain teenager in South Los Angeles, calling the city's street gangs
a national threat that deserved intense federal attention.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn and Bratton met Monday with U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang and top
local agents for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau
of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference after the meeting, Yang -- who prosecuted Los
Angeles gang members after the 1992 riots -- called gang violence
"the worst it has been for some time."</TE>
<TE>   She said that killings in Los Angeles, which Bratton said Monday
now number more than 650 for the year, had "threatened the very way
many citizens live their lives and have taken away their ability to
feel safe and secure in their own homes." Law enforcement officers
estimate that about half of all homicides are gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   "We can bring narcotics charges, which have a mandatory minimum of
10 years in prison. We can bring firearm charges that have a
mandatory minimum of five years," Yang said. "We can bring
racketeering charges, also known as RICO, which can be used to attack
organizers of structured criminal gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Yang said that although such cases take much longer to build than
those using other approaches, they are more likely to significantly
damage the infrastructure of the most organized gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the DEA pledged a 20-member Mobile Enforcement Team
to South Los Angeles early next year. The use of such a team earlier
this year in the Hollenbeck Division is credited by law enforcement
officials with stemming skyrocketing crime in that area -- at a time
when the homicide rate in the city looked to be far worse than the
current 11% jump over last year's totals.</TE>
<TE>   ATF officials also said they plan to assign 20 to 25 additional
agents to pursue illegal gun trafficking in targeted city
neighborhoods by spring 2003, although those positions have yet to be
funded. Don Kincaid, head of the ATF local office, said resources
have been stretched on antiterrorism and his agency's capacity to
contribute to the anti-gang effort depends on additional funding.</TE>
<TE>   Yang called prior cooperation between federal and local
authorities a patchwork approach. Together with Hahn and Bratton, she
expressed confidence that better coordination would get results, even
without additional U.S. money.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities will cross-train LAPD officers in federal
statutes to improve the chances of success in federal felony filings.</TE>
<TE>   Yang said federal prosecutors already are reviewing firearms cases
from the LAPD's 77th Division -- where there have been 116 homicides
to date this year -- and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
Lennox Station to determine if federal prosecution would be
appropriate -- and if it would mean longer sentences than state law.</TE>
<TE>   "We target those gang members who are among the most dangerous,"
Yang said. In the last decade, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles
County have convicted more than 275 gang members.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, U.S. prosecutors brought racketeering indictments against
alleged members of three gangs: the Aryan Brotherhood, the Nazi Low
Riders and the Wah Ching.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Monday that the federal government could and should do
even more.</TE>
<TE>   "California needs its fair share of resources to fight this
problem," Hahn said. He said he would make that point when he and
Bratton visit Washington next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to surrender one inch of turf to the gangs. The
streets of Los Angeles belong to the law-abiding citizens," Hahn
said. "The federal government has some important tools, some powerful
tools, some heavy hammers to use in this fight," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said that cooperation between police and residents in
South Los Angeles -- particularly the 77th Division -- seemed to be
helping.</TE>
<TE>   Since the news conference two weeks ago, Bratton said, anonymous
tips from residents there have produced leads in nine unsolved
homicides. And the addition of 70 officers to the South Bureau has
also produced results, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had one homicide in the 77th so far in the month of
December. This is a division that had over 100 homicides rolling into
the month of December, leading the city," Bratton said. "This is
focused policing, smart policing, and it is going to be policing in
partnership with counterparts in the federal and state
bureaucracies."</TE>

<HD>Officer Testifies She Shot Teen as Last Resort</HD>
<DH>Trial starts for girl, 14, who prosecution says was wounded
after ignoring orders to drop a knife. Defense says shooting
unjustified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura police officer testified Monday that she considered using
every instrument on her belt to stop a teenage girl who threatened
her with a knife -- her baton, her pepper spray, even her tape
recorder -- but resorted to shooting the troubled girl because she
wouldn't back off.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing I was doing made her stop," Officer Kristin Rupp said on
the opening day of the girl's trial on one felony count of assaulting
a police officer with a deadly weapon. "It was a terrifying
experience."</LD>
<LD>   After responding to the home of the girl's foster parents in May,
the rookie officer said she repeatedly told the 14-year-old to drop
the kitchen knife and then decided to defy her department's
shoot-to-kill policy and aim her gun well below the girl's chest.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought to myself, 'I don't want to kill her. I just want to
stop the threat,' " Rupp said.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the first two shots struck the girl in the lower
abdomen, but she continued to advance with the knife, the officer
said. But after being hit a third time, she crumpled to the kitchen
floor. The four other officers at the house rushed in to handcuff the
girl and tend to her wounds, Rupp testified.</TE>
<TE>   The officer's testimony suggested that the girl, a Chinese
immigrant, wanted police to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   "You were supposed to kill me. Why didn't you kill me?" Rupp said
the bleeding girl told officers.</TE>
<TE>   In the defense's opening statement, the girl's lawyer said inept
officers ignored procedures for dealing with emotionally disturbed
subjects. Further, attorney Paul Loh said, the knee-jerk shooting was
just another instance in which the troubled girl was abandoned by
adults and the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Youth has dealt her a very cruel hand," he told Ventura County
Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother abandoned her as a baby in China, he said. After
she moved to the United States to live with her father, a Newbury
Park restaurateur, he whipped her with a belt and kicked her out of
his house. When the father was convicted of child abuse, the
child-welfare system tried to send the daughter back to China "as if
returning damaged merchandise to the factory," Loh said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's attorneys have filed a civil claim against the city of
Ventura and Ventura County, contending that the shooting was
unjustified, and accusing the county of failing to train the girl's
foster family and failing to provide adequate treatment for her
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Police Department cleared Rupp, 24, of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese American leaders in Ventura and Los Angeles counties have
called for the girl's release. The trial continues today with
testimony from Zaida Worthley, who, with her husband, hosted the girl
and three other foster children in their home last May.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Plans Fail to Satisfy Secessionists</HD>
<DH>Leaders of the defeated Valley cityhood drive say mayor's
proposals do not offer enough local control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite their defeat in last month's election, San Fernando Valley
secession leaders demanded in a meeting with Mayor James K. Hahn on
Monday that City Hall undergo dramatic reform and significantly
improve city services beyond what officials have proposed, or risk
another drive to split the city.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn, speaking to about 70 of the 132 former candidates for Valley
and Hollywood city offices, pledged to reshape city government so it
is more responsive to residents and more effective at providing basic
services.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard loud and clear, from Hollywood, from the Valley and from
every other L.A. neighborhood, that you want a city government where
quality services are available to all residents," Hahn said at the
Encino Community Center meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "You want City Hall to empower local communities to make decisions
about those quality-of-life issues that affect your daily lives," the
mayor added. "And that is what I want to do." Hahn and a past
secession backer, Bert Boeckmann, co-hosted the meeting, asking for
support for the mayor's plan.</TE>
<TE>   However, it was clear from Monday's meeting, that the mayor's
vision of reform falls far short of what some secession leaders would
like to see happen.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn touted the creation of 58 advisory neighborhood councils
representing communities throughout Los Angeles. He said he has
committed to giving each council $50,000 annually for expenses and
that general managers would meet with each council for input on
service priorities.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted he has proposed a government reorganization plan
called TeamWork LA, which would create seven Neighborhood Service
Areas, each with its own city hall and managers for city departments.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who received the
most votes among 10 candidates for mayor of a new Valley city, said
in an interview that Hahn's "proposal to decentralize city government
does not go far enough."</TE>
<TE>   He told the mayor Monday night that neighborhood councils should
be given decision-making power over local land-use and budget issues,
or the city should create a borough system in which local communities
can decide their own fate.</TE>
<TE>   "Empowered neighborhood councils don't mean giving them a pittance
of $50,000," Richman said. "Those neighborhood councils need real
authority or we need to move toward the borough system of
government."</TE>
<TE>   Richman also reiterated his campaign proposals to expand the
police force in the Valley by 500 officers, about 30%, and to
eventually phase out the business tax on gross receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Other secession backers called on the mayor to appoint more Valley
residents as commissioners, install more street lights, clean up
Valley parks, secure more state and federal grants for the Valley,
and prevent changes to the Chatsworth Specific Plan that could erode
horse-keeping rights.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hahn has supported efforts to expand the police force, he
has not committed to a specific increase in the Valley and has not
backed elimination of the gross-receipts tax.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing concerns that the City Hall bureaucracy makes it
difficult to do business with the city, Hahn plans to announce today
that he is forming a task force to streamline the contracting process
for vendors.</TE>
<TE>   The five leading vote-getters in the Hollywood city council
election boycotted Monday's session, telling Hahn in a letter that,
if he is serious about addressing their concerns, he needs to hold a
meeting in Hollywood with the former candidates from that area.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley meeting drew most of the 121 candidates who ran for
office in the Valley as part of the secession election.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, so many Valley secession leaders attended the Hahn
meeting that Valley VOTE delayed a decision during its simultaneous
meeting Monday on whether to file a lawsuit to have only the Valley
votes counted from the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires approval by the breakaway area and the city as
a whole for a cityhood measure to pass. The Valley secession measure
received support from 50.7% of Valley voters but failed 2-1 citywide.
A Hollywood secession measure lost both in Hollywood and citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close said during the group's meeting
in Mission Hills that the group will decide by Friday whether to file
a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, challenging the validity
of the election. Some argue that only the Valley vote should have
counted toward cityhood.</TE>

<HD>November Jobless Rate Up Slightly, but Retail Hiring Also
on the Rise</HD>
<DH>The addition of 1,900 nonfarm jobs puts local unemployment
on par with the national rate of 5.7%, and below the state average of
6.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Ventura County's unemployment rate climbed four-tenths of a
percent to 5.7% in November, the number of jobs was up 1,900 compared
with the same month last year.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first month, on a year-over-year basis, that we've
shown positive growth in the nonfarm sector since April, and the
largest since February," said economist Mark Schniepp, director of
California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   The local jobless rate in November, up from 5.3% in the month
before and the same period a year ago, matches the national
unemployment rate and is better than California's 6.3%, according to
the state's Employment Development Department.</LD>
<TE>   "Ventura County is strong and never really did show the kind of
weakness that appeared elsewhere in the state," Schniepp said. "There
should be no concern here."</TE>
<TE>   The county's November jobless rate is 19th among California's 58
counties. San Luis Obispo and Marin counties had the lowest
unemployment rates at 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara County had a rate of 4.5% and Los Angeles County had
a 5.8% rate.</TE>
<TE>   The data are "strong enough to support the idea that Ventura
County remains a great place to visit and to live," said Bill
Watkins, executive director of the Economic Forecast Project at UC
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Schniepp said local job creation peaked in late 1999 and early
2000, when the area had more than 12,000 new jobs in a year's time.
That figure dropped to just a few thousand in January 2002. And 1,900
jobs were lost in August.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, 1,900 nonfarm jobs were created in November, with
retail employment representing the largest gain at 1,600 positions.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 800 more people were hired at eating and drinking places
and 700 were newly employed at other retail establishments.</TE>
<TE>   "That means a lot of vendors are looking to a more-robust
Christmas season, and they're anticipating that by hiring more
people," Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said the hiring numbers are, in part, a result of an
expanded retail base. Ventura Gateway Plaza placed a Barnes &amp; Noble
and a Pier 1 Imports on the site of a former drive-in movie theater,
and the reinvigorated Esplanade Mall in Oxnard continues to open
additional stores.</TE>
<TE>   The number of education jobs was up compared with November 2001,
with 200 more state jobs being credited to Cal State Channel Islands,
the new four-year public university in Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   And while the number of local education jobs was down compared
with the same month last year, 1,500 were added in November over the
previous month.</TE>

<LD>A charred body found inside a dumpster in Buena Park was identified
Monday as that of a Los Angeles security guard who was kidnapped last
week from Commerce, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Dental records were used to identify Song Chea, a 52-year-old
Monterey Park resident, said Orange County Deputy Cullen Ellingburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Chea's body was discovered about 10:30 p.m. Saturday after
firefighters extinguished a blaze in a dumpster behind a business
complex in the 8400 block of Artesia Boulevard, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputy Bill Spear.</LD>
<TE>   Police said Chea was kidnapped about 4 a.m. Thursday when three
men tried to steal trailers from Overnight Transportation Co., where
Chea worked as an unarmed guard.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men was allowed inside the business but fled after
employees saw him trying to steal a trailer, police said. The two
other men dragged Chea him into a waiting van.</TE>

<HD>Fillmore Project Is Newest Target</HD>
<DH>Conservationists concerned about a 750-home development
along the Santa Clara River recently sued the city and builder.</DH>

<LD>Conflict between builders and conservationists has shifted to a new
site in Fillmore, where a proposal to build about 750 houses beside
the Santa Clara River is being challenged in court as potentially
harmful to the environment.</LD>
<LD>   Heritage Valley Park would bring houses, a school, trails and 20
acres of parkland to a city with some of the most affordable housing
in Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council approved the project in October.</LD>
<TE>   Houses would be built in three phases over 15 years on a 300-acre
parcel, with the first units available in July 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas-based Griffin Industries is the developer.</TE>
<TE>   But Friends of the Santa Clara River sued the city and Griffin
last month over concerns about the project's effect on the last
free-flowing river in the region. This is the latest flap over a
housing development in which builders and city officials cite the
need for more homes to satisfy a growing population, and
conservationists press to safeguard the county's semirural character
and natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Upriver, detractors have targeted the 21,700-home Newhall Ranch
project in Los Angeles County, and in the east county, opponents are
trying to block the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development.</TE>
<TE>   Objections to the Heritage Valley Park plan focus on the
environmental impact report the city approved.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say it does not adequately consider traffic, the effect
on a proposed levee along the river and the source of dirt needed for
the site and the levee.</TE>
<TE>   Talks are planned next month in an attempt to settle the dispute.</TE>

<HD>Jury Views Videos of Alleged Rapes</HD>
<DH>In opening statement, prosecutor shows tapes Andrew Luster
made of three women he is accused of drugging and assaulting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millionaire date-rape suspect Andrew Luster did not use a gun or a
knife to prey on young women, but a potent drug that knocked out his
victims and erased any memory of sexual assaults he gleefully
captured on a hidden camera, a prosecutor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Those homemade movies, scenes of which were shown during opening
statements in Luster's trial, are now prosecution evidence to prove
the 39-year-old surfer drugged and raped three women at his Mussel
Shoals beach home.</LD>
<LD>   "He did this so he could rob them of their memories and violate
them over and over again," Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve
Fox said, as she projected grainy pictures of two naked and
unconscious women onto a courtroom wall.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who did not give an opening statement Monday,
maintain the women were pretending to be asleep while acting in
pornographic movies Luster hoped to sell.</TE>
<TE>   They say Luster engaged in consensual sex with the alleged
victims, who have been described as embarrassed party girls lying
about the sexual encounters.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, a great-grandson to legendary cosmetics magnate Max
Factor, is charged with 87 criminal counts stemming from alleged
assaults on three women during a four-year span.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of rape,
sodomy, sexual battery, drug possession and poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Fox told the seven-woman, five-man jury the case is unusual
because many of those crimes were captured on videotape and will be
seen in graphic detail.</TE>
<TE>   Although the victims will testify, Fox said, two have no memory of
the 1996 and 1997 videotaped encounters and the third, identified as
Carey Doe, has only a spotty memory of her alleged assault by Luster
in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was Carey's report to law enforcement that led to Luster's
arrest two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A 21-year-old UC Santa Barbara student, Carey told police that she
met Luster while partying at a downtown Santa Barbara bar, then went
back to his beach house where Luster allegedly drugged and raped her.</TE>
<TE>   Carey's report led to a search of Luster's home, where detectives
seized numerous homemade movies that depict him raping the two
videotaped women and others who have not been identified, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal charges were filed on behalf of Carey and the two women,
Shawna and Tonya, after they identified themselves as the women on
the tapes.</TE>
<TE>   On the tapes, the two women can be heard snoring and having
trouble breathing while Luster appears to assault them and makes
remarks to the camera, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   On one tape, Fox said, Luster can be heard saying that his perfect
dream is "a strawberry blond passed out on my bed ... ready for
anything." The blond is 17-year-old Shawna, naked and comatose, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is blacked out cold, she is not playacting," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   On another tape, the second groggy woman winces in pain as the
defendant sodomizes her, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   She urged jurors to watch the women's faces when the tapes are
played in court to determine for themselves whether they were
pretending to be asleep.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tapes and women's statements, jurors will hear
from an expert on the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB,
which prosecutors contend was Luster's "weapon of choice" to
incapacitate women.</TE>
<TE>   The clear, salty-tasting liquid, which can be produced from a
powerful drain cleaner, is commonly used by rapists, Fox said,
because it quickly renders victims unconscious and leaves them with
no memory of what occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In the prosecution case, jurors will also hear a telephone "cool
call," set up by detectives between Carey Doe and Luster, in which he
admits giving her Liquid X, or GHB, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors will then see a videotape of Luster's July 18, 2000,
interview with Ventura County sheriff's detectives in which he denies
giving Carey drugs, then admits to mutual GHB use after being
confronted about the earlier call.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that Mr. Luster knew exactly what the
significance of the GHB was," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   She also noted that during the police interview Luster described
himself as a wealthy real estate investor and stock trader -- but
never as a porn producer, as the defense now insists.</TE>
<TE>   Before the prosecutor's opening statement, defense attorney Roger
Jon Diamond filed a flurry of last-minute motions and asked Superior
Court Judge Ken Riley to postpone the trial to give the defense time
to investigate new evidence of police and prosecutor misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot make an opening statement without this information,"
Diamond said, holding up large poster boards of investigative
reports, which he contend warrant further scrutiny. But Riley refused
to postpone the trial.</TE>
<TE>   For months, the defense has accused prosecutors of concealing acts
of police misconduct, and specifically accused a sheriff's detective
of coaching an alleged rape victim to lie.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue the detective altered a tape-recording of an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   But in a series of pretrial rulings, Riley found no evidence of
misconduct and barred defense counsel from making any references of
police wrongdoing in opening statements.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the judge struck another blow to the defense case by
denying Diamond's request to play other videotapes which allegedly
depict Luster and Tonya Doe engaging in consensual sex before the
camera.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond renewed his request in court papers Monday, arguing that
"Tonya enthusiastically participated in fetish films with the
defendant."</TE>
<TE>   Riley told Diamond that he could renew his request to play the
"fetish" tape at the conclusion of the prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   But in an unusual move late Monday, Diamond requested an
open-court prescreening of his opening statement, outside the jury's
presence, to ensure that his remarks are consistent with the judge's
prior rulings.</TE>
<TE>   After a wild exchange of pleas and accusations -- including Deputy
Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold charging Diamond with grandstanding before
reporters in violation of a gag order -- Riley agree to a
closed-court review of the defense opening remarks, which may be
presented today.</TE>

<HD>Man Guilty of Slaying Father, Girlfriend</HD>
<DH>Matthew Marky of Reseda faces life in prison without parole
after jury verdict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Reseda man was found guilty Monday of murdering his girlfriend and
his Emmy-winning father, then trying to shoot a housemate during a
daylong rampage in a quiet suburban neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Marky, 33, listened forlornly in a near-empty Van Nuys
courtroom as a clerk read the jury's verdicts: guilty of first-degree
murder for strangling his girlfriend, Maria Ruiz-Smeriglio; guilty of
second-degree murder for shooting his father, William Marky; and
guilty of assault with a deadly weapon for shooting at housemate
Scott Hinkley.</LD>
<LD>   The jury also found Marky guilty of the special circumstance of
double murder, which means he will automatically receive life in
prison without parole.</LD>
<TE>   In a hearing scheduled for Jan. 28, he will face additional
sentences of 25 years to life for using a gun in the attack on his
father, and up to 26 years for the assault charge and a charge of
firearm possession by a felon.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office decided earlier
not to seek the death penalty against Marky.</TE>
<TE>   Marky's attorney, James E. Blatt, said the jury's decisions were
influenced by the conflicting stories and lies Marky told about the
events of Aug. 5, 2001. "In my discussions with the jurors, they had
a great concern for the numerous false statements [Marky] made,"
Blatt said. "That was a significant factor in their determination."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the "violent rampage" began when Marky, a cocaine
and alcohol abuser, decided to lash out against Ruiz-Smeriglio
because she had kicked him during an earlier dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Dale Cutler and Dmitry Gorin said they were
able to show a pattern of violence on Marky's part and an attempt to
cover up his crimes. They played jurors a tape of a 911 call Marky
made that Sunday afternoon, in which he said that Ruiz-Smeriglio had
stopped breathing. On the tape, Marky could be heard making obviously
false sound effects to make it seem as if he were administering CPR,
Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours after killing his girlfriend, Marky was drinking beer
with his 63-year-old father in the backyard of his father's house,
which was next door to the house Marky shared with Hinkley and
Ruiz-Smeriglio in the 18900 block of Valerio Street. At 11 p.m.,
William Marky was fatally shot in the eye with his own gun.</TE>
<TE>   Gorin said Marky gave four versions of the incident. In the final
version on the witness stand, Marky said he and his father grappled
for the gun, and William Marky was shot at close range. But Cutler
and Gorin introduced physical evidence that showed the father must
have been shot from a distance.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, prosecutors said Marky ran back to his house
and tried to kill Hinkley for reasons that are not clear. But Marky's
gun misfired and Hinkley was able to hide in a bathroom until police
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Marky tried to convince authorities that it was
Hinkley who shot his father.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, defense attorney Blatt argued that Hinkley's
recollection of the shooting attempt was a drug-induced
hallucination. Blatt argued that Marky had killed his father in
self-defense, and that another man had strangled Ruiz-Smeriglio.</TE>
<TE>   Gorin said that while Ruiz-Smeriglio and Hinkley had substance
abuse problems, only Marky had a previous history of violence.</TE>
<TE>   One witness testified that Marky had assaulted a convenience store
clerk a few months before the incidents, because the clerk had
forgotten to give Marky a book of matches.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this was a long time coming," Gorin said.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Marky was a Vietnam veteran and respected Hollywood
sound technician who won an Emmy in 1982 for his work on the TV
series "Hill Street Blues."</TE>

<HD>Plane Crash in Downpour Kills Two</HD>
<DH>The Anaheim Hills tragedy, which also damages two homes, is
Orange County's third such crash in less than two months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino and Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people were killed Monday afternoon when their small plane
crashed in a suburban Anaheim Hills neighborhood during a downpour,
damaging two houses.</LD>
<LD>   The Piper Cherokee, which flew out of Oceanside in San Diego
County, crashed about 2:30 p.m. as it prepared to line up for a
landing at John Wayne Airport, said Larri Dillard, operations officer
for the Federal Aviation Administration in Lawndale.</LD>
<LD>   A man and a woman were killed in the crash, but their identities
were not immediately available, said Anaheim city spokesman John
Nicoletti. Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board were on the scene by late afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third such crash in less than two months in Orange
County, and the second in north Anaheim. On Nov. 8, Dennis Beitel,
58, of Temecula died when his single-engine Cessna crashed into a
hill along the Riverside Freeway, also during rough weather.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, two people were injured when a single-engine Beech
aircraft crashed at John Wayne Airport. Both of those accidents
remain under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's crash occurred as a major storm moved across Orange
County, bringing wind, heavy rain and fog that authorities said
probably contributed to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the conditions were not ideal for flight," said
Anaheim city spokesman John Nicoletti.</TE>
<TE>   The plane clipped power lines and a tree as it plunged into the
driveway and frontyard of 810 S. Sapphire Lane. The home's garage
caught fire, but firefighters extinguished the flames before they
damaged the home, Nicoletti said. Debris, which caused minor damage
to the garage next door, was scattered across front lawns and in the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Karen McEwen and her two young children were not home when the
plane crashed into their frontyard, neighbors said. They returned
briefly to collect belongings and left to stay with family members.</TE>
<TE>   Few neighborhood residents were home at the time, but those who
were said the crash startled them out of what had been a quiet
afternoon subdued by rain and heavy clouds.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who declined to be identified said she was repotting
plants in front of her house when the plane swooped low, clipped a
tree and then flipped, landing on its roof across the street. She
said her son ran over and saw two people, apparently dead, inside
before it exploded in flames.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Fasulo, 71, lives next door to where the plane hit the
ground. She was about to take a break from writing Christmas cards
when she noticed the sound of a plane unusually close, and a moment
later a loud "smack." Seeing nothing out a side window, she went to
the garage, opened the door to her driveway, and saw a neighbor
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor suddenly took off running, yelling that the plane was
going to explode, and then came a bright flash of fire, Fasulo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The flames just came up. It was terrible," Fasulo said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Doo, 40, was in his home a couple of hundred yards from
the crash when he heard "this zooming sound, then a prolonged
crashing sound." Outside, "I saw smoke coming from down the street,"
Doo said. "I walked down and there was fire and wreckage where the
plane had crashed into the garage."</TE>
<TE>   As word of the crash spread, residents who had been at work or
running errands came home early and gathered under umbrellas to watch
firefighters and assess the field of debris, which spread across
three lawns and into the street.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial flurry of activity, Fasulo went back to her
house, which reeked of smoke from the crash. She planned to stay
elsewhere for the night, in hopes the smell would clear and her
nerves settle. The plane missed her house -- and her -- but not by
much.</TE>
<TE>   As Fasulo spoke, a loud bang echoed through the house, startling
her. She quickly glanced around for the source: A gust of wind had
blown her door shut.</TE>
<TE>   "Now every little noise is going to scare me," she said.</TE>

<LD>Ready for a heart-warming Christmas story? Well, this isn't quite it.
The police log of the Coastline Pilot newspaper reported that Laguna
Beach officers were "called to intervene when a Christmas tree
delivery service accidentally made a delivery to the wrong
address.... The homeowner refused to hand it over."</LD>
<LD>   The delivery company said it would bill the homeowner.</LD>
<LD>   Christmas Story II: A college student in Illinois was allegedly
cheated out of a computer by a bogus-check writer in an eBay
transaction.</LD>
<TE>   The victim made some inquiries on the Internet and found that a
Los Angeles resident also claimed to have been swindled. So the
student set up his own sting operation, offering another computer
through his girlfriend's eBay account.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect answered the ad and was directed to an address where
police were waiting. The suspect's name:</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast, Gray Davis: A reader has sent me compelling evidence
of what may have been an election snafu as big as the one that befell
Florida in 2000. It's a calendar that shows that Nov. 5, which was
election day, fell on a Sunday, among other days (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Gee, wouldn't it be fun to have the election nullified so all
those political commercials could resume?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock plot: Mike Zepeto of L.A. received
a life insurance flier and wondered if "it pays to murder your
spouse" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Life's a beach: I have a dry-skin problem, so I guess I wouldn't
have any trouble gaining entrance to one shop in Seal Beach (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dueling Harveys: Mention was made here of a visit to a drugstore
by my sister, Marilyn Stein of Pacific Palisades, to pick up some
medicine for her dog. Though the prescription was made out to Sammy
Canine Stein, and she informed the busy pharmacist that Sammy was a
dog, he warned her not to let Sammy drink any alcohol or operate
heavy machinery.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, a few days later, a friend of Stein's said that he had
heard Paul Harvey tell the story. "No, Steve Harvey, my brother,"
Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it was Paul Harvey," the friend insisted, explaining that he
listens to the broadcaster's syndicated news program every day. It
was the latest of many items that the other Harvey has picked up from
this column over the years without crediting the L.A. Times.</TE>
<TE>   As a reader remarked awhile back, if I write a book, it should be
titled, "As Retold by Paul Harvey." By the way, Paul, feel free to
use this item.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Steve Koenig takes me to task, a little bit, for my
story about the street person who mistook me for a panhandler one
morning and offered me some money.</TE>
<TE>   (I was only trying to get change to buy a newspaper, though I
wasn't dressed very well.)</TE>
<TE>   "I laughed at first," Koenig said, "then thought about it, and
found the incident kind of touching. That guy has more class than a
lot of people I know."</TE>
<TE>   Good point. But I'm going to work on improving my wardrobe.</TE>

<HD>Parents Acquitted on 1 Charge</HD>
<DH>Harsh punishments were not a criminal conspiracy to abuse,
jury says. It deadlocks on a lesser count.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a case that tested the line between tough love and child abuse, an
Orange County jury Monday acquitted a Yorba Linda couple of
conspiring to abuse their teenage son but deadlocked on a lesser
charge.</LD>
<LD>   Grady Machnick, a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, and his
wife, Deborah, a former elementary school principal, stood accused of
emotionally abusing their son over several years. They forced him to
spend nights outside for not doing his homework and in one instance
sent the teen to school with dog feces in his backpack as punishment
for not picking up after the family dog.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors agreed the parents' discipline was not part of a criminal
conspiracy, but they could not decide whether it amounted to
misdemeanor child abuse. The panel, made up mostly of parents and
grandparents, were divided 7 to 5 in favor of convicting Deborah
Machnick of misdemeanor child abuse and voted 9 to 3 to acquit Grady
Machnick of those charges.</LD>
<TE>   Many jurors said that though they disapproved of the parents'
conduct, they shared the Machnicks' frustrations of trying to
discipline a wayward child. The Machnicks' son earned poor grades,
refused to do his chores, shoplifted and stole money from his
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "People [on the panel] were saying things like 'I wouldn't have
done that' or 'A normal parent wouldn't have done that,' " said jury
foreman Mark Lindeman, a 45-year-old father from Mission Viejo.
"[But] we can't use our value system to judge what's been done in
their household."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the jurors who voted to convict Deborah Machnick, who is
on unpaid leave from the Walnut Unified School District, said they
were disturbed that she made the teen strip and took a photograph of
him as a form of punishment. Several said they were also bothered
that Grady Machnick woke his son at 3:30 in the morning and forced
him out of the house before he left to work at Men's Central Jail in
Los Angeles because he thought the boy could not be trusted in the
home alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking someone down mentally, that's what they tried to do,"
said juror Susan Abdullah, who voted to convict both parents of
misdemeanor child abuse. "There were no bruises, but the whole
behavior of Grady and Deborah was to break him down mentally. I think
it was excessive and unreasonable and not justified.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were in their shoes, I would have sought professional help.
I didn't see that coming from them," Abdullah added.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are scheduled to return to court Jan. 3 to tell
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey if they intend to pursue a
second trial on the misdemeanor abuse charge.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Pierce declined to discuss the jury's
verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   The Machnicks' lawyers said they hoped prosecutors won't retry the
case, saying that parenting strategies are so diverse that no jury
would unanimously agree to convict.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of what occurred here, it's really not black and
white," said Salvatore Ciulla, Deborah Machnick's attorney. "It's
different from breaking an arm or the type of physical abuse we would
see."</TE>
<TE>   Several jurors said Deborah Machnick, the boy's stepmother, was
more to blame than her husband. Grady Machnick testified that he
didn't know that his wife placed dog feces in his son's backpack or
that she took a nude photograph of him.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Ciulla said the stepmother's decision to
put dog excrement in the boy's backpack did not amount to criminal
abuse. In order to convict the parents of child abuse, the jury had
to agree that their conduct was unjustifiable and caused physical or
emotional injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a great parenting technique. If you're grading, A, B, C,
D or F, maybe it's an F," Ciulla said. "But it's not a crime."</TE>
<TE>   Some jurors agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I would never do to my children, [but] I don't
think it amounted to a crime," said juror Tony Osmena, the father of
twin 15-year-old boys.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We can do this easy, or we can do this hard. Your choice.</LD>
<LD>   I can shake you down for charitable contributions by tweaking your
sense of competition. This year, people in the punch-line states of
Mississippi and Alabama gave a higher percentage of their dough to
charities (many of them churches) than Californians did. No wonder
the country thinks we're self-absorbed infidels. And no, your
aromatherapy doesn't qualify as a religious contribution.</LD>
<LD>   Or I can make you feel guilty, like this: Do you truly want to
spend the holiday season pretending you're on your cell phone to
dodge the bell-ringers' kettles, and then blow 30 bucks on "The
Clapper" for someone you don't much like, someone who really ought to
be hoisting his butt out of the Barcalounger once in a while and
making it over to the light switch to burn off a couple of Cheetos?</LD>
<TE>   How'm I doing so far?</TE>
<TE>   Long lists of good causes clamor for what we all want more of --
time and money. They clamor all year long, but we may only be
listening this month, when the taxman's deductible deadline hangs
before us, when the vulgar excess of the season leaves us feeling a
little ill -- the moral equivalent of empty calories.</TE>
<TE>   Me, I'll be writing checks to protect abused and abandoned
creatures, to spay and neuter pets to keep millions of "extra" dogs
and cats from being born only to be killed.</TE>
<TE>   And I'll give to the cause of putting into every hand, into every
head, the most basic and vital tool of society and culture: reading
and writing.</TE>
<TE>   Ladies, gentlemen -- start your checkbooks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Antoinette Laudermilk -- "Toni, please" -- sold real estate for
more than 10 years, and if you think she's lost her instinct for the
deal, the close, now that she's executive director of the Remedial
Reading and Learning Center in L.A., you do so at your peril.</TE>
<TE>   She was giving me the tour, telling me about the Wednesday night
class that preps students for taking SATs, how the kids read
newspapers and ... She stopped, interrupting herself: "You work for
them. Who can I call about getting free newspapers?"</TE>
<TE>   Now, every time my phone rings, I expect Toni's alto voice. In
this, she says, good deed-doing is like real estate: "Follow-up,
follow-up, follow-up. You have to call, you have to write, you have
to visit." Chip Murray of First AME Church, you're on Toni's list. So
are you, Golden State Mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Charities come and charities go, some faster than
summer-replacement sitcoms. The center has come and stayed. It's
closing in on 35 years since Helen Ramey founded it. Back then it was
mostly black children who came after school. Now it's Latino kids,
but the need hasn't changed because the schools still can't turn
every child into a reader.</TE>
<TE>   Four days a week, four hours a day after school, 400 to 600 kids a
year rotate through the center, to be tutored by volunteers, getting
time and attention they can't get in the harried public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Kids come to love it so much they tend to stay longer than they
need to, and when Toni began the job three months ago, she first had
to "assess who was being taught and who was being baby-sat," for
there are a hundred, two hundred other children waiting to get in.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Ramey, the founder, never wanted the red-tape hassle of
government money, so every book, every lightbulb and every dollar in
petty cash is donated -- from checks from big foundations to the
paper plates from a family whose child is learning to read here.</TE>
<TE>   Woodworking fathers just put in a new kitchen; no child studies
here before having something hot to eat, even if it's macaroni and
cheese. A bank gave the center its furniture, and the upholstery shop
down the street re-covered it free.</TE>
<TE>   And years ago, Toni began donating herself. Her nieces and nephews
were struggling with reading in Chicago. Her daughter here in L.A.
needed tutoring. Now her nieces and nephews teach college and work
with a NASA science program. Her daughter is a financial analyst. On
an easel inside the door are clippings of the center's alums -- a
muckety-muck at Hughes, a VP at a Florida museum. People who learned
to read there 30 years ago telephone to sign up their grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends call me and say, 'Do you miss real estate?' And I say
'No!' I was feeling so unfulfilled, trying to find my goal."</TE>
<TE>   Toni's goal comes in the door every afternoon, one child at a time
-- the shy, the dyslexic, the sleep-deprived ... immigrant brothers
who just need to be separated to study properly ... a kid who assures
her breezily that he has no homework. "Yeah, right. I tell 'em to
write me a composition about what they did over the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   She has a Rolodex the size of a Ferris wheel and a passion the
size and strength of El Nino. Take my advice -- if Toni calls, call
her back. You'll feel better for it. And I know the kids will.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 5 Years in Pyramid Scheme</HD>

<LD>Denounced by his victims as a coldhearted sociopath, a Los Angeles
businessman was sentenced to five years and three months in federal
prison Monday for defrauding more than 200 relatives, friends and
acquaintances in a $21-million investment scam.</LD>
<LD>   "This man is guilty of a serious crime that has devastated a lot
of people," U.S. District Judge Manuel Real said as he ordered Gary
A. Eisenberg taken into custody after imposing the sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Eisenberg, 64, who operated Advance Finance Inc. in Beverly Hills,
pleaded guilty earlier this year to four counts of securities and
mail fraud.</LD>
<TE>   His victims included his half brother, his in-laws, other
relatives by marriage and a large assortment of friends and business
associates, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Cazares.</TE>
<TE>   One former friend, Lindsey Berkson, a medical writer from Santa
Fe, N.M., told Real that she lost $629,000, her entire life savings,
by investing with Eisenberg over seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Gary Eisenberg is a sociopath who cannot be
rehabilitated," she told Real. "He acted like my best friend, knowing
all the time that he was conning me. He stole my future and broke my
heart."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Nadelberg, an anesthesiologist from Sudbury, Mass., who
is distantly related to Eisenberg by marriage, told of a widowed
82-year-old relative who lost her life savings, as did her grown
children, by investing with Eisenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on his own behalf, Eisenberg apologized to his victims
and asked forgiveness, saying: "Those who suffered most were those
who loved me."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the prison term, Real ordered Eisenberg to pay
$12.7 million in restitution and to immediately surrender $208,000
from a retirement account. Cazares said an additional $1.6 million in
cash and properties has been recovered through bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenberg was in the business of advancing money to manufacturers
while they awaited payments for accounts receivable, a practice known
as factoring.</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 through 2001, prosecutors charged, he raised more than
$21 million from the sale of partnerships in his factoring
enterprise, promising investors returns of 9% to 18% a year.</TE>
<TE>   He told the investors that the partnerships were risk-free because
the receivables were owed by Fortune 500 companies, such as Home
Depot, Macy's and American Express.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Eisenberg lent the money to high-risk clients, some of
whom paid kickbacks to his employees.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1996, prosecutors said, Eisenberg knew that Advance
Finance was racking up huge losses. As a cover-up, they said, he
began making interest payments with proceeds from new investors.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Eisenberg's house of cards collapsed and he was forced to
file for bankruptcy protection. The Securities and Exchange
Commission filed civil charges against him as well.</TE>

<HD>INS Order Prompts Big Lines, Anger</HD>

<LD>A new federal law requiring the registration and fingerprinting of
temporary U.S. male residents who are from many Mideastern countries
sparked confusion and anger Monday, as thousands lined up to report
to immigration offices in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like the roundup of the Japanese during World War II," said
Adel Hajrasilihd, whose brother was registering along with hundreds
of others at the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrorists don't report themselves," Hajrasilihd said. "It's
people who are honest who are here, and they are not being treated
well."</LD>
<TE>   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said that the agency was responding
to a public desire for integrity in the nation's immigration system
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been charged with putting into place a comprehensive
entry and exit system," Kice said. "This is the first step and it
will eventually apply to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Confusion over the new orders in particular roiled the Armenian
American population, which is heavily concentrated in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The confusion began when the Justice Department published a notice
in the Federal Register that added Armenia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
to the list of 18 nations whose nationals are required to register.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of North Korea, the 18 nations are heavily
Muslim countries from North Africa and the Middle East. Armenia, once
part of the former Soviet Union, is predominantly Christian.</TE>
<TE>   The listing provoked an explosion of protest from Armenian
organizations here, who said members of their communities had no
links to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, federal officials announced that Armenians were not
being subjected to the new requirement after all.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the notice had been published in the Federal Register by
error, Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said: "I can't say
it was a mistake. I can only tell you there are only two countries
being added" -- Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the Saudi and Pakistani embassies did not return
repeated telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The governments of both nations are considered U.S. allies, and
adding the countries to the list is certain to strain relations.</TE>
<TE>   However, many of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia,
and Pakistan has been accused of nurturing extremists in hard-line
Islamic religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   The federal order requires males age 16 and older from designated
nations to register with the INS by specific deadlines. For Saudi
Arabians and Pakistanis who arrived in the United States before Sept.
30, the deadline is Feb. 21 of next year. The requirement covers
visitors, students and anyone who is not a permanent legal resident.
Those who do not comply could be subject to deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Several Arab and Muslim organizations criticized the registration
program for failing to adequately inform people of the new
requirements -- yet punishing those who fail to comply with
deportation.</TE>
<TE>   James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in
Washington, said his staff had made spot checks with several INS
offices across the nation and found that few were getting the word
out about the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials in the Dallas-Fort Worth area reported that they had
reached the Arab community by contacting the local "Indo-American
Business Assn." and assumed Indians were Arabs because "their women
are covered," Zogby said.</TE>
<TE>   Zogby said, however, that the Los Angeles office was one of the
few found to be engaging in effective community outreach -- sending
an official to appear on Farsi-language television, for instance, to
alert the Iranian community about the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some radio and television stations were besieged with
irate callers, many of whom were trying to get information.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations has asked immigration
officials to extend the registration deadline to give people more
time to learn about the new requirements and comply with them.</TE>
<TE>   The council estimated that about 10,000 individuals would be
affected, although immigration officials put the number at about
7,500.</TE>
<TE>   At the INS offices in Anaheim, hundreds of men milled around,
nervously pacing and debating whether to register. Failing to
register could mean immediate deportation. But registering could also
lead to a deportation proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those who sought to register -- INS officials declined to
say how many -- were taken into custody, including several who said
they were establishing legal residency.</TE>
<TE>   A man who would only identify himself as Faramarz said he had been
in the United States waiting for residency after a work permit
expired.</TE>
<TE>   His case has been delayed, he said, because the INS lost his file
and he has continued to run a Los Angeles flooring business.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so scared," he said as he smoked his last cigarette before
heading into the INS building, where he said he expected to be taken
into custody. "I have employees, a wife and two children. What can I
tell them?"</TE>

<HD>City May Pay $2.5 Million to Woman Who Lost Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Glover and Matt Lait</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles city attorney's office has tentatively agreed to pay
$2.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by a woman who lost an eye
after a police officer shot her with a beanbag projectile because he
mistakenly believed she was reaching for a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed settlement with Annette Amoroso, 40, comes amid
allegations by her attorneys that police investigators withheld a
videotape from the evening she was shot that might have been key
evidence in the case. Additionally, they alleged, the officer's claim
that he shot Amoroso after she put her hands in her pockets near the
bottom of her jacket was undermined by the jacket itself: There were
no outside pockets near the bottom of the jacket.</LD>
<LD>   Amoroso was shot on Nov. 27, 2000, by Officer Craig Marquez during
an investigation to determine whether the sport utility vehicle she
was a passenger in was stolen. Although the SUV had been reported
stolen by the owner, it was, in fact, the owner's husband who had the
vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   An internal investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department
concluded that the officer did not have sufficient reason to shoot at
Amoroso.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, who had previous excessive force complaints against him,
including unnecessarily pointing his gun at another motorist's head,
was suspended for 22 days as a result. He has requested a
disciplinary hearing to fight the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is expected to vote on the proposed settlement
today.</TE>
<TE>   Amoroso's attorneys declined to comment on the case, pending the
council's vote. But court documents they filed allege that the LAPD
covered up the true facts of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Special Assistant City Atty. Josh Perttula, a spokesman for the
office, said attorneys are recommending settling the case for a
number of reasons, including "the out-of-policy finding in the
shooting, the plaintiff's injuries, which were severe, as well as
some very difficult evidentiary hurdles that had to be overcome."</TE>
<TE>   The evidentiary problems included the missing videotape and the
fact that the jacket's design did not appear to square with the
officer's description of the incident, a city official said. The
officer's previous complaint history also posed potential problems
for the trial, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUV Reported Stolen</TE>
<TE>   According to police reports, Marquez and his partner were on
patrol when they became suspicious of a brown Toyota Land Cruiser,
which had pulled out of a motel parking lot near 3rd and Alvarado
streets. When they checked the vehicle's license plate number, they
learned that it had been reported stolen.</TE>
<TE>   The officers called for help and continued following the SUV as it
pulled into a nearby gas station and parked. Amoroso then exited the
vehicle's right rear passenger door.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that she was a possible car thief, the officers got out
of their car, drew their weapons and ordered Amoroso to put her hands
on her head and kneel on the ground. Amoroso, who was wearing a short
leather jacket and miniskirt, and who said later that she had been
drinking, did not do as she was told.</TE>
<TE>   A male passenger, identified as Kevin Patrick, also got out of the
vehicle. He too refused the officers' commands to get down on his
knees. As the confrontation escalated, other patrol officers
responded to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Amoroso yelled profanities at the officers, and told
them she was going to go into the gas station's mini-mart to buy some
water. Marquez said he felt threatened by Amoroso's conduct and
retrieved a beanbag shotgun, a weapon that police sometimes use to
subdue a violent or uncooperative suspect when the situation does not
call for use of a normal gun.</TE>
<TE>   Amoroso, with her hands allegedly inside her jacket pockets,
continued to swear at the officers and took a couple of steps toward
them, police reports state. In response, Marquez fired one beanbag
round at her, which apparently missed. Amoroso then started to walk
toward the mini-mart.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, who said he thought Amoroso might take hostages inside
the mini-mart, fired another round, this time striking her in the
torso.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe you just shot me," Amoroso cried as she fell to
her knees and then laid in a fetal position, according to the police
report.</TE>
<TE>   "Moments later, Amoroso sat back up on her knees," the police
report states. "Amoroso then leaned forward, placed her hands in her
jacket pockets and began to rise, simultaneously turning clockwise
toward Officer Marquez. Believing Amoroso may be armed and was
possibly about to draw a weapon from her jacket or waist, Officer
Marquez fired a third beanbag round."</TE>
<TE>   That one struck Amoroso directly in her right eye. The force of
the blow obliterated her eyeball, broke bones around her eye-socket
and caused bleeding in a layer of her brain.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police report, the entire incident occurred
within two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the totality of the situation, it was not reasonable for
Officer Marquez to conclude Amoroso was armed or presented an
immediate threat," then-Chief Bernard C. Parks said in finding the
officer's actions "out of policy."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it turned out that the vehicle was reported stolen by
Patrick's wife, apparently because they had been fighting, and he
failed to pick her up at the airport as he had promised.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the injury, Amoroso had to have surgery to remove
the remnants of her eye. She is undergoing reconstructive surgery
around her eye. Amoroso, a onetime hairdresser and mother of four
from Westlake Village, has since moved to Hawaii and could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times shortly after the shooting, Amoroso
said she had been out to the Viper Room nightclub with friends that
evening to see a friend's band perform and did not want to kneel on
oily pavement because she was wearing nice clothes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Findings Questioned</TE>
<TE>   Amoroso's attorneys -- Ian Herzog, Amy Ardell and Richard Plotin
-- were critical of the department's investigation. According to
court papers, they alleged that physical evidence and witness
testimony refuted the police account.</TE>
<TE>   They contended that Amoroso was on her knees with her hands in the
air the first time she was struck by a beanbag, and was shot in the
eye when she turned around. The lawyers also argued that Amoroso's
jacket has no pockets in which she could have hidden her hands. The
only three pockets on the outside of the garment are small ones near
the breast and shoulder areas, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when they asked for any photographs and videotape during
the discovery process before a trial, they were told by lawyers for
the city that no video existed. However, during the deposition of one
officer who was at the scene that evening, a security tape from the
gas station was discovered. According to that officer, who viewed the
tape for only a few moments, the video depicted Amoroso just prior to
her being shot and may have shown more of the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney in the case initially denied that any videotape
had been recovered from the gas station. Later, the city attorney
acknowledged that a tape had been seized, but that it did not show
anything relevant and ultimately was returned to the gas station
owner, who taped over it.</TE>

<LD>Five candidates will run in the Jan. 28 special election to fill a
vacant seat on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, according to
papers filed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The seat, for the 3rd District, represents Brea, Irvine, Orange,
Tustin, Villa Park, Yorba Linda and portions of Anaheim. Candidates
had until Monday at 5 p.m. to file paperwork with elections officials
and pay a $1,074 fee.</LD>
<LD>   The candidates are Douglas Boeckler of Orange, a veterans
representative; former Assemblyman Bill Campbell; reserve deputy
Robert L. Douglas of Orange; former Tustin Councilman Jim Potts; and
William Wetzel, an assistant professor from Orange.</LD>
<TE>   Orange Councilman Mike Alvarez announced last week that he
wouldn't seek the seat, citing the quick election and a lawsuit
challenging its validity.</TE>
<TE>   The election was made possible by a March ballot measure that gave
voters, rather than the governor, the power to fill vacant seats on
the board. But that measure is being challenged in court.</TE>

<HD>Separated Twin Girls to Spend the Holidays in U.S.</HD>
<DH>It is taking longer than expected for one of the
Guatemalans to recover from surgery.</DH>

<LD>The formerly conjoined twins who were separated in a marathon
operation at UCLA will probably not return home to Guatemala in time
for Christmas, hospital officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 16-month-old twins, Maria de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej
Alvarez, have had their return date pushed back several times since
the operation in August to separate them at the skull.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital is aiming for them to return home to continue their
recovery in a Guatemala City hospital in early January, which means
the twins will probably spend Christmas and New Year's at UCLA's
Mattel Children's Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "We still do not have a date," spokeswoman Roxanne Moster said.</TE>
<TE>   The twins' plastic surgeon, Dr. Henry Kawamoto, suggested last
month that they might be home for the holidays. But the hospital
announced in late November that Maria de Jesus' scalp wound from
surgery was taking more time than expected to heal. Surgeons used
skin grafts to cover the girls' exposed brain tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Although tests on the other twin, Maria Teresa, have shown that
she is hearing-impaired in one ear, officials said the twins are
recovering steadily.</TE>

<CX>   Separated twins -- An article and headline in Tuesday's California
section incorrectly stated the reason for a delay in the return of
two formerly conjoined twins to Guatemala. The article and headline
said that the recovery from surgery for one of the twins was taking
longer than expected. According to UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital,
both twins have recovered from the surgery to separate them, but
medical authorities in Guatemala have asked for additional time to
prepare for their return.</CX>

<HD>Combo Vaccine Approved</HD>
<DH>New inoculation will protect babies against five diseases
in three shots instead of nine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators have approved a new vaccine against five major
diseases that will significantly cut the number of shots in an
infant's first six months, reducing the pain and hassle involved in
this childhood rite of passage.</LD>
<LD>   The new vaccine, Pediarix, cuts from nine to three the number of
shots required to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,
polio and hepatitis B. The shot would be administered at 2 months, 4
months and 6 months of age.</LD>
<LD>   Pediatricians in the Southland welcomed the news, saying it will
increase vaccination rates and will lessen the anxiety that children
and parents suffer during each encounter with the dreaded needle.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is a godsend," said Dr. Marie Kelley, a pediatrician
in Pasadena. "I think the parents will be appreciative and the babies
too."</TE>
<TE>   But some parents expressed concern about whether so many vaccines
combined in one shot would harm their children.</TE>
<TE>   "If a child is being vaccinated for one bug, their system has an
easier time fighting that off," said Eli Ramirez of Studio City, who
has a 6-month-old daughter. If you have more, "the immune system has
a lot to deal with at that point."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the side effects caused
by Pediarix -- pain, redness, swelling, fever and fussiness -- are
not much different from the effects caused by the current vaccines
for the same diseases. But fevers are more common with Pediarix,
according to the agency, which approved the drug late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, is expected to be
available in doctors' offices next month and will cost about the same
as the existing vaccines combined. Previously, the five diseases were
covered by three separate vaccines: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis,
polio and hepatitis B.</TE>
<TE>   "This vaccine allows protection against more diseases in one
vaccine than any other that we currently have in the U.S.," said Dr.
Karen Midthun, director of the Office of Vaccines Research and Review
at the FDA's Center for Biologics.</TE>
<TE>   The new vaccine does not provide protection against a number of
other childhood diseases. Children younger than 2 years will still
need shots against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, pneumococcal
disease, haemophilus influenza type B, hepatitis A and influenza.</TE>
<TE>   But sparing children six shots in the first six months is a major
advance because it will likely improve vaccination rates, doctors
say. Research has shown that the more times parents have to take
children to the doctor, the less likely they are to return.</TE>
<TE>   As new vaccines have been added to the childhood regimen, doctors
and parents have struggled to keep up with the recommended schedule.
The percentage of children who received most of the needed vaccines
by age 2 was about 73.7% nationally last year. For Los Angeles, the
comparable rate was 71.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the vaccines should help improve those numbers, medical
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This vaccine and combination vaccines like it that other
companies have in the development pipeline represent a real advance
in our ability to immunize children," said Dr. John Modlin, chairman
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises
the federal government on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the research on the new vaccine was conducted in Southern
California at the UCLA Center for Vaccine Research and at Kaiser
Permanente.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joel Ward, director of the UCLA center, said many physicians
require infants to come in for multiple visits because they don't
feel comfortable giving them so many shots at once. "By combining
them all in a single vaccine, it makes it much more ... easy to
administer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the new vaccine should reduce the time and trouble it
takes to prepare and administer different shots, said Dr. Steven
Feig, a Los Angeles pediatrician. It will also cut down on medical
errors, others said.</TE>
<TE>   Some insurance companies, including Kaiser and PacifiCare Health
Systems, are still studying the new vaccine and haven't decided
whether to cover it. Others, like WellPoint Health Networks, say they
will pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Parents said they would value convenience and fewer shots but only
if the vaccine was as safe and effective as existing inoculations.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it be as effective?" asked Karissa Coakley, 23, of
Lancaster, who brought her 4-month-old son, Kadyn Joshua Griffith, to
a doctor's office Monday for several vaccines. "One more shot
wouldn't hurt if [the new vaccine is] not as effective as it's
supposed to be. I would want him to get the full effect of it."</TE>
<TE>   Her doctor, Dr. Pejman Salimpour of Sherman Oaks, expressed
confidence in the new vaccine, adding that in his experience, parents
don't want to see their children wail any more than they have to.</TE>
<TE>   "When they cry, you feel it with them," he said. "Every time that
mother, that father, that family member brings a child to the
pediatrician's office, he or she has to see them cry in pain."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Randolph, a PacifiCare spokeswoman, said her employer is
still weighing the costs and benefits of the vaccine, but she favors
it personally -- as a parent of a 20-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just awful, especially when they're infants, because they're
just looking at you like, 'What are you doing to me?' "</TE>

<HD>Teaching Latinos to Buckle Up, Restrain the Kids</HD>
<DH>Program in Santa Ana will try to educate Spanish-speaking
drivers about the importance of seat belts and car seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Working undercover on a Santa Ana street corner, the two employees
from Latino Health Access are under orders to monitor traffic.</LD>
<LD>   They are not looking for red-light runners or speeders.</LD>
<LD>   Health workers Rubi Gonzalez and Moises Vazquez are watching for
drivers whose children are not in their car seats.</LD>
<TE>   The unique observation is part of a Spanish-language car-seat
program launched by Latino Health Access, a Santa Ana nonprofit that
seeks to promote health through community projects.</TE>
<TE>   Observation studies are used infrequently because they are
time-consuming and imperfect, experts say. But they applaud the
effort and hope it will provide some scope of a problem believed to
be plaguing Santa Ana, which has the highest concentration of
residents who speak Spanish primarily of any major city in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting a baseline on car-seat use in Santa Ana, as an
idea of car-seat use in low-income areas," said Patricia Cantero,
director of program evaluation. "We want to know what the barriers
are that our community faces."</TE>
<TE>   The energetic workers are working with a $95,000 grant from the
Children and Families Commission, which was created by Proposition
10.</TE>
<TE>   By January, the workers will be conducting surveys with city
residents and conducting neighborhood discussions, or platicas, about
car seats. They will then tour apartment complexes to teach proper
car-seat installation and give car seats to residents who owned seats
that have been recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Although no study has been done in Santa Ana, a nationwide tally
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows car
crashes are the leading cause of death for Latinos under the age of
44. The largest contributor, the study found, was a disregard for
seat belt and car-seat laws.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 John Hopkins University study showed Latino children under
12 had a 72% greater probability of dying in a car crash than
non-Latino children. More than 60% of the children who died in motor
vehicle crashes were unrestrained.</TE>
<TE>   "To reach new immigrants is a challenge, particularly people who
are not documented," said Jose Ucles, spokesman for the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "Hispanic families are, in
some instances, of less means with larger families and [drive] older
cars. It's a set of situations that are difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Theories abound on why car-seat use has been slow to catch on in
Latino communities. Few states in Mexico have car-seat laws, meaning
many immigrants aren't familiar with the requirement. The seats
aren't cheap, they take up space, and they are inconvenient for
families who share rides with others.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, Gonzalez knows the problem firsthand just
from watching cars on the streets of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on a street corner recently, Gonzalez peered into the
passing cars, watching as young children stood up or jumped around
inside the car, all clear violations. In one case, a child riding in
a car seat tipped over as the car made a turn.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they love their kids, but what we are seeing is a lot of
parents who don't even have car seats," Gonzalez said. "They don't
even use seat belts."</TE>
<TE>   California law requires children up to 6 years old or less than 60
pounds to be in a car seat. The seat must be tightly strapped down
with a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez and Vasquez previously worked as translators at car-seat
events conducted at Children's Hospital of Orange County. But they
and others at Latino Health Access said they wanted to work directly
with the Latino community and became certified car-seat technicians
through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad Gonzales, safety program director at National Latino
Institute in San Antonio, Texas, said the Latino Health Access
program is important because there are few Spanish-speaking
technicians in the country. There are so few Spanish-speaking
technicians that he has been asked to give classes in Arkansas, New
York, Arizona and other states with new immigrant populations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people all over who don't use belts or seats. But
immigrants can have greater problems. When they come to the United
States, they are used to not having car seats or even their seat
belts in. People think 'I'm just going a few blocks' ... or they
think 'It won't happen to me,' " Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are few materials in Spanish. Even those
materials in Spanish "don't speak" to immigrants because the
translations are so poor, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Fausto Villalobos, another Latino Health Access worker, said many
low-income families buy car seats at garage sales, which he said is a
dangerous practice because of the possibility the seat has been in an
accident or is equipped with straps that no longer work.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them think car seats are just for little babies," Rubi
Gonzalez said. "It's up to us to get the word out, in Spanish, about
how they can do what they want anyway, which is to protect their
children."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Sweetens Deal for Women</HD>
<DH>Mentoring, physical fitness programs are meant to boost
female ranks to 25% of force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that the Los Angeles Police Department must do more to reflect
the society it serves, top city officials announced a series of
programs Monday intended to significantly boost the number of women
in the ranks.</LD>
<LD>   Women make up 19% of the roughly 9,000-member department. At a
news conference at the LAPD's Westchester training facility, Mayor
James K. Hahn and Chief William J. Bratton said their goal is to
increase the percentage of women to at least a quarter of the force.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a potential pool of candidates who are being overlooked,"
said Hahn, standing before an oversized LAPD recruitment banner,
flanked by several dozen female officers and commanders. "We are here
to do something about it."</LD>
<TE>   Under an agreement with the federal government, the department has
committed to pursuing policies that would boost its ethnic and gender
makeup to reflect the city population.</TE>
<TE>   To help get there, city leaders say they will focus on preparing
women for the physical and psychological rigors of the job. Potential
candidates get free fitness training and a four-month fitness guide
before entering the academy, Hahn said. A mentoring program matching
recruits with women in the department will be created.</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Barker, legal director for the California Women's Law
Center, called the initiative a good start. But, she said, once the
department reaches its 25% goal, it will need to continue that
momentum given the strengths women bring to the department.</TE>
<TE>   "Studies show that women police officers are very effective in the
field because they tend to de-escalate situations using verbal skills
rather than physical force," Barker said. "They also are less likely
to be involved in excessive-force incidents, and reports show they
are not involved in domestic violence incidents."</TE>

<HD>YWCA Board Ponders Options</HD>
<DH>Central group delays a vote on a proposal to share a
building with the Boys &amp; Girls Club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following criticism of a proposed merger with the Boys &amp; Girls Club,
the board of the Central Orange County YWCA late Monday discussed an
alternative that would preserve a scaled-down version of the
beleaguered 81-year-old organization.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to go back to our roots," said Shannon Tucker, the YWCA's
executive director. "We want to get more into community outreach."</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan discussed, the Boys &amp; Girls Club would move into
the YWCA's Grand Avenue headquarters in Orange and take over the Y's
after-school programs. The YWCA would continue as a separate entity
working rent-free out of an office in the building.</LD>
<TE>   "It would involve giving the opportunity for the YWCA to focus on
issues that the organization is promoting nationally, such as women's
empowerment and racial and social justice," Tucker said. "The
building has been an albatross for us -- this way we can regroup and
refocus."</TE>
<TE>   The board on Monday postponed a vote on the issue, and instead
scheduled a meeting for Jan. 6 to consider several options for the
YWCA.</TE>
<TE>   The merger was originally proposed as a solution to the YWCA's
increasing financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   At a public meeting before the board went into closed session,
however, many parents and community members spoke against that plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that they've been acting against the bylaws and that
there's no need to merge with another organization," said Arianna
Barrios, a board member and critic of the original plan. "I think
we're facing a simple cash-flow problem that's easily corrected."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Livingstone, a parent who remembered taking ballet lessons
at the YWCA as a child, said she has been disheartened by the
possible closure.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel saddened and betrayed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   DeAnn DeBerry, a neighbor, agreed, calling such a loss a "terrible
thing" for the community.</TE>
<TE>   Trudy Chatham, 78, a lifelong YWCA member, said she would mourn
the loss of the building.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disturbed," she said. "We knocked ourselves out to build and
keep this building -- they shouldn't sell it out."</TE>

<HD>Not Guilty Verdict in Priest's Shooting</HD>
<DH>Lawyer says Baltimore man was pushed over the edge after
alleged abuse by cleric in 1993.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>A jury on Monday acquitted a man of attempted murder and other
charges in the shooting of a priest he says abused him nearly a
decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Dontee Stokes, 27, was convicted on three lesser handgun charges
for the attack on Father Maurice Blackwell, who was wounded in the
hand and hip.</LD>
<LD>   As the verdict was announced, some of Stokes' relatives gave sighs
of relief and Stokes hugged a family member.</LD>
<TE>   During the trial, defense attorney Warren Brown said Stokes was
pushed over the edge by the abuse and Blackwell's refusal to
apologize. He said Stokes suffered a "psychotic episode" during the
May 13 attack.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had said his client shouldn't be held criminally responsible
for the shooting because he was suffering a mental disorder as a
result of the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also acquitted Stokes of using a handgun to commit a
violent crime, the only charge that carried a minimum mandatory
sentence. He was also acquitted of assault.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Sylvester Cox told jurors that Stokes' abuse allegation
didn't justify the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During deliberations, jurors reviewed a videotape of testimony
from forensic psychiatrist Michael Spodak, who said Stokes was
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he shot Blackwell.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes testified that he didn't intend to harm Blackwell when he
confronted him in front of the priest's house. But he said that when
Blackwell brushed him off, memories of abuse flooded back.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal William Keeler told jurors Thursday that he regretted
reinstating Blackwell.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler, who was the bishop in charge of Blackwell at the time of
the 1993 allegations, said he decided to send the priest back to St.
Edward Roman Catholic Church under certain restrictions after
Blackwell spent three months undergoing psychiatric evaluation. The
abuse allegations are under investigation. No charges have been filed
against the priest.</TE>

<HD>FEMA Chief, a Key Bush Advisor, Announces Resignation</HD>
<DH>Joe Allbaugh says he will stay close to the administration
and will be actively involved in the president's reelection campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Joe Allbaugh, the "gentle giant" who managed George W.
Bush's presidential campaign, announced his resignation Monday as
head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency but cautioned that he
was "not going very far."</LD>
<LD>   Allbaugh, 50, is the latest in a series of administration
officials to announce his return to the private sector. Like several
others, he intends to play a role in Bush's reelection campaign.</LD>
<LD>   His departure leaves the president with just one leg of the "iron
triangle" of longtime friends and advisors who managed his first run
for the White House. Soon only Karl Rove, the president's senior
advisor, will remain.</LD>
<TE>   But like former communications director Karen Hughes and departing
strategist Mary Matalin, Allbaugh said he fully intended to continue
serving the president.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be actively involved in the reelection effort," he said in
an interview shortly after meeting with Bush in the White House.
Allbaugh scheduled his departure from FEMA for March 1, by which date
the emergency response agency, with its 7,000 employees and budget of
some $3 billion, is slated to become part of the new Department of
Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got 75 days until March 1," said Allbaugh, known as much
for his no-nonsense, hands-on management style as his buzz haircut.
"We still have a job to do."</TE>
<TE>   Though some have expressed concerns that FEMA's natural-disaster
mission could get lost in the huge new department's anti-terrorism
focus, Allbaugh said, "That's just not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The nation will "be better off for having an integrated response"
to all types of emergencies, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Under Allbaugh's leadership, the agency best known for its
assistance to victims of floods, tornadoes and hurricanes responded
to 89 major disasters, disbursed some $7.2 billion in aid and played
a critical, if somewhat subdued role in helping the nation recover
from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The more than $5 billion in federal recovery funds FEMA disbursed
to the city, state and residents of New York included a $154-million
grant for crisis counseling, the largest in the agency's history.</TE>
<TE>   Allbaugh said he was "very proud" of his decision not to
federalize the agency's response to the attack on New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a need for people to be deeply involved in the recovery
and for us not telling them how to do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Allbaugh and Hughes went to work for Bush in 1994 and helped run
his first campaign for Texas governor. Allbaugh then became the
governor's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear Monday that Allbaugh had gained the affection of his
colleagues and staff. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer referred to
the burly, 6-foot-4 Allbaugh as a "gentle giant."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, speaking from Austin, Texas, recalled standing with
Allbaugh at New York's ground zero three days after the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so comforted to know that he was in charge," she said.
"He's got a heart as big as that frame of his."</TE>
<TE>   And the president, who often jokes about Allbaugh's appearance --
referring to him as "the pretty one" -- played it straight Monday. "I
have trusted Joe in a variety of positions in my public life," Bush
said in a statement, "and he has always met the highest standards of
service and integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Allbaugh said he hoped to sort out his next career move over the
holidays.</TE>

<HD>Lott's Appearance Could Be a Redefining Moment for BET</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>All day, chat rooms that cater to black Americans buzzed with anger.</LD>
<LD>   Some urged a boycott of Black Entertainment Television's interview
with besieged Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) -- upset with a network, now
owned by the global media giant Viacom, that has already canceled the
very public affairs show airing the interview.</LD>
<LD>   Others seemed more offended that Lott would seek out a black
audience for his latest mea culpa for remarks at Sen. Strom
Thurmond's 100th birthday party, in which he suggested that the
country would have been better off if Thurmond's 1948 presidential
platform of segregationist policies had prevailed. "Why is BET giving
him the luxury of addressing black Americans?" wrote one
correspondent. "Why hasn't he been on BET before?"</LD>
<TE>   Beneath the turmoil is a long history of distrust of BET's
founder, Robert L. Johnson, by those who believe he is more
interested in making money with hip-hop and rap than in nurturing
black talent in public affairs -- or even in entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "The network has had shaky credibility in the African American
community in the areas of news and information," said Condace
Pressley, president of the National Assn. of Black Journalists. "This
offer to Sen. Lott from BET is more of a publicity stunt to move the
discussion away from the cancellation of the network's news and
public affairs programs."</TE>
<TE>   But others say the Lott interview is a signal moment, a
recognition that BET is now part of the media landscape, as shameless
in grabbing headliners as any of the major networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any network in the country would take an exclusive interview with
Trent Lott about now," said Tavis Smiley, who hosts a talk show on
National Public Radio and was himself fired from BET during an
earlier round of belt-tightening. "I don't demonize the black network
for doing what CNN or ABC or any of the others would have done."</TE>
<TE>   BET was born in the early years of cable television's promise, the
brainchild of a businessman who was the only one of his family's 10
children to graduate from college. In fact, after graduating from the
University of Illinois, Johnson also received a master's degree in
international affairs from Princeton. Then he came to Washington as a
lobbyist for the cable industry, where he met cable television
pioneer John C. Malone.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson borrowed $15,000 in seed money, Malone invested $500,000
and in 1979, BET began its odyssey with an odd mix of movies, gospel,
sports and a few music videos. Before long, Johnson had shifted
emphasis largely to music, off-color comedy and lots of gyrating
women draped around gun-toting male rappers.</TE>
<TE>   African American fraternities and sororities protested, urging BET
to drop some of the more titillating rap videos as exploitative. But
the number of subscribers, particularly in urban areas, exploded.
Johnson took BET public in 1991, bought it back for $1.3 billion in
1998 and then sold it for double that in 2001. Along the way, he
became America's first black billionaire -- and a controversial
figure among blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is how BET represents black people," syndicated radio
talk show host Thomas Joyner told Forbes magazine after the sale to
Viacom last year. "Shaking that booty in a video is fine, but you
need a lot more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), a member of the Congressional Black
Caucus, is not one of those who faults Johnson for putting BET on the
cultural map.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Johnson made a dream into reality," he said. "I don't
think he should be punished for making money."</TE>
<TE>   But he and other members of the caucus have written Viacom, urging
that shows like "BET Tonight with Ed Gordon" be restored. "That's
what BET should do more of," Meeks said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Gordon who conducted Monday night's interview in which Lott
spoke of the closed society in which he grew up. "That society was
wrong; it was wicked," he said. "I didn't create it, and I didn't
really understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's attempt to rescue his career may or may not benefit from
the appearance on BET, particularly since much of the network's
74-million-home audience is young and antipolitical.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Sen. Lott trying to reach young African Americans interested
in hip-hop music video?" asked Pressley, who in addition to being
president of the black journalists association is assistant program
director at WSB radio, a news and talk station in Atlanta. "I suspect
more African Americans will see the Lott BET interview in news
excerpts on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC than will
actually watch it on BET."</TE>
<TE>   To Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the debut on the nation's
only black television network of a man who just this week renounced
his previous attempts to keep blacks out of the mainstream is filled
with irony.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a privilege he doesn't deserve -- getting the opportunity to
go on a show he's never wanted to be on before," she said. Explaining
that she is a "fierce defender of freedom of speech" in part because
her own outspokenness sometimes prompts others to wish for a muzzle,
she added of Lott's appearance: "I don't like it, but I would never
oppose it."</TE>
<TE>   With some delight, Waters noted that the Lott controversy is
prompting what she considers a healthy debate about America's
shameful racial record. And if that puts Lott on BET, she said, bring
him on.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole debacle is causing a lot of odd things to happen," she
said. "I heard today that if the Democrats move to censure Lott, the
Republicans will amend the bill to include Sen. Robert Byrd." Byrd, a
Democrat from West Virginia first elected to the Senate in 1958, used
a racial slur during a television interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time America had this debate," she said. "Let's have
it. Whatever happens, happens."</TE>

<LD>A 6,000-pound elephant smashed a rookie keeper against a rock pile at
Miami's MetroZoo, badly injuring the man in what a spokesman
described as an attack to test herd dominance.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Embury, 31, who was in critical but stable condition after
surgery, was the elephants' newest keeper, the zoo's Ron Magill said.
"You, in effect, become part of the ... herd," Magill said. "Any time

member."</LD>

<HD>Former N.J. Gov. Kean Takes Over 9/11 Probe</HD>
<DH>Bush hails replacement for Kissinger for his 'integrity,
fairness and good judgment.' The college president heads a 10-member
commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday appointed former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H.
Kean to replace former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger as
chairman of a federal commission charged with investigating events
that led to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America.</LD>
<LD>   "Tom Kean is a leader respected for integrity, fairness and good
judgment. I am confident he will work to make the commission's
investigation thorough," Bush said. "It is important that we uncover
every detail and learn every lesson of Sept. 11."</LD>
<LD>   Later in the day, Trent Lott, the incoming Senate majority leader,
named former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. to the commission.
Lehman's appointment completes the 10-member bipartisan commission.</LD>
<TE>   Kean, 67, said he will retain his job as president of Drew
University, a small liberal arts university in Madison, N.J., about
30 miles from the site of the former World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a Washingtonian. I haven't even run for elected office in
over 15 years," Kean said at a news conference at Drew. He said he
will serve as "a friend to a lot of people who lost their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Kean has little experience with defense affairs or intelligence
issues, but as a public servant, Kean (pronounced Cane) established a
record of bipartisan cooperation. He served on presidential
commissions in Democratic as well as Republican administrations.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as [Kean] is independent, and looks into the agencies
that failed us that day, then we look forward to starting this
commission," said Mindy Kleinberg, whose husband was killed in the
World Trade Center. "We've waited a long time," Kleinberg told
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   One former Cabinet officer in Kean's second gubernatorial
administration predicted that the former governor will ably fulfill
his mission.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a consensus builder, somebody who's credible and is trusted
by all sides," said Drew Altman, who served as Kean's commissioner of
human services.</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced Kean's appointment just three days after Kissinger
abruptly withdrew as commission chairman amid charges of conflicts of
interest. Kissinger said he did not want to liquidate his lucrative
international consulting firm or disclose his far-flung international
clients.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger's withdrawal followed by just two days the departure of
former Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine), who said
he could not afford to sever his ties with his Washington law firm.</TE>
<TE>   In Mitchell's place, congressional Democratic leaders named former
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), now head of the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars here.</TE>
<TE>   The commission was created last month by Congress to investigate
the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The other Democratic commissioners are former Sen. Max Cleland of
Georgia, retiring Rep. Tim Roemer of Indiana, Richard Ben-Veniste, a
Washington lawyer and longtime Democratic investigator; and Jamie
Gorelick, vice chairman of Fannie Mae, who served as deputy attorney
general in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The other Republican commissioners are former Sen. Slade Gorton of
Washington, former Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson and Washington attorney
Fred Fielding, who was a deputy counsel in the Nixon White House.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), an advocate for 9/11 families, praised
the appointment of Lehman to the commission, saying he "will
aggressively pursue the truth to wherever it may lead so we may help
avoid future terrorist attacks on our nation."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman is chairman of J.F. Lehman &amp; Co., and of OAOT Technology
Solutions. He also serves as director of the Ball Corp., Insurance
Services Office, SDI Inc., Elgar Inc. and Racal Instruments Inc.,
according to Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Kean served two four-year terms as New Jersey's governor, starting
in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He is on several corporate boards, including the Pepsi Bottling
Group and Aramark Corp., which manages food and support services at
office buildings and sports facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Aramark operated a food court and other concessions in the World
Trade Center and lost about 80 employees in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Kean also has served on the advisory board of President Clinton's
initiative on race, and as vice chairman of the U.S. delegation to
the fourth U.N. World Conference on Women in 1995. He led the U.S.
delegation to the World Conference on Education for All in Thailand
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "The strengths that Gov. Kean brings to this commission, in the
president's judgment, are, one, his ability, and over time, his
history of bringing people together on particularly difficult
issues." Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   A Princeton graduate with a history degree, Kean comes from a line
of public servants. His grandfather was a United States senator and
his father was a congressman.</TE>
<TE>   Kean taught history at a Massachusetts prep school before entering
politics and serving several terms in the New Jersey Legislature,
including as Assembly speaker.</TE>
<TE>   As an officeholder, Kean steadfastly preached a message of
diversity and authored a book titled "The Politics of Inclusion."</TE>
<TE>   In his reelection campaign, Kean won 60% of the black vote and
two-thirds of union households.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he chaired the New Jersey reelection campaign for George
H. W. Bush, the current president's father.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Kean rebuffed calls by the Republican Party to run
against incumbent Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, who was embroiled in
a Senate ethics investigation. Torricelli withdrew from the race
shortly before last month's election.</TE>

<CX>   Kean appointment -- In a story in Section A on Dec. 17 about the
appointment of former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean to head a
federal commission to investigate the events preceding the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, The Times incorrectly reported the number of
Aramark Corp. employees who died at the World Trade Center. The
number of Aramark fatalities was seven, not "about 80." Kean is a
board member of Aramark, which operated a food court and other
concessions at the center.</CX>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LYNCHBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>The federal fraud trial of the National D-Day Memorial Foundation's
former president ended in a mistrial Monday when jurors couldn't
reach a verdict after three hours of deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not guilty," Richard B. Burrow said afterward. "They came
after me with their best case, and I'm not guilty."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. John Brownlee said his office will reevaluate the case
before deciding whether to try Burrow again.</LD>
<TE>   Burrow, 55, was charged with four fraud counts accusing him of
lying about the foundation's fund-raising activities as part of a
plan to secure loans for the struggling memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors told U.S. District Judge James C. Turk after about two
hours that they had major disagreements. Turk declared a mistrial
after a second hourlong session proved just as fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   The National D-Day Memorial Foundation is seeking Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in federal court. All construction on the
monument has stopped, and it still owes about $3.8 million.</TE>

<HD>The Day After, Democrats Begin Life After Gore</HD>
<DH>There's no front-runner, but three candidates may emerge,
each with a stronghold of support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democrats on Monday began adjusting to a 2004 presidential race
reshaped by the withdrawal of former Vice President Al Gore and the
likely entrance of Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), Gore's running
mate two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, Lieberman indicated that it was likely he would
join the race now that Gore has removed himself. "I [have] said I
probably would run if Al Gore doesn't run, and that remains the
case," Lieberman said.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberman had pledged not to run against Gore, the man who in 2000
made him the first Jewish candidate on a major party's presidential
ticket.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gore, at a news conference in Raleigh, N.C., said that
despite his decision not to seek the presidency again, he would
remain politically active and would "probably endorse" one of the
2004 Democratic contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ready to write my political epitaph because I intend to
remain active politically, even though I will not be a candidate,"
said Gore, who was visiting Raleigh to promote his new book, "Joined
at the Heart." "So hold off on getting the chisel and granite out."</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, though, the focus in Democratic circles quickly turned
to 2004's potential candidates. Across the party, the broad sense was
that Gore's departure leaves the emerging contest without a clear
front-runner.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks a lot like 1988 did, with a lot of people who have
pieces of the action but no one who dominates the whole thing," said
Democratic consultant Harrison Hickman, who polled for Gore in 2000
and would work for Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) if he runs in 2004.
"There is no one with gravitational pull."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many Democratic analysts say that three candidates -- each
with his own strongholds of support -- may share the front-runner
mantle for at least the next several months.</TE>
<TE>   With Gore gone, some Democratic operatives believe that Lieberman
may emerge as the leader in the national polls because of the name
identification and support he established during the 2000 campaign.
In his remarks Monday, Lieberman said he would announce his decision
on running by early January.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take a few more weeks to do some final thinking,"
Lieberman said. "This big decision has to come not just from my head,
but from my heart and soul."</TE>
<TE>   But whatever Lieberman decides, two other candidates hold the
early lead in the critical first two contests on the nomination
calendar, according to recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa -- whose precinct caucuses will lead off the nomination
season in mid-January 2004 -- outgoing House Minority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) led in a recent survey sponsored by Hotline, an
electronic political newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses in 1988, when he ran unsuccessfully
for the Democratic nomination, and still has considerable support in
the state. He is expected to announce his candidacy soon.</TE>
<TE>   In New Hampshire, which will hold the first primary in the nation
later in January 2004, another recent Hotline poll gave a commanding
lead to Sen. John F. Kerry, who comes from neighboring Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Monday, Kerry -- who recently formed an
exploratory committee to begin organizing support -- rejected
suggestions that he has become the front-runner in New Hampshire. But
Kerry's efforts, not only in New Hampshire but nationally, appear to
be gaining more momentum and notice in the last few weeks than anyone
else in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond those three, other likely candidates include outgoing
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who has begun organizing among grass-roots
activists in Iowa and New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, who could be strong in the South, is also nearing a final
decision. Once considered a certain candidate, he has surprised
supporters by an extended reassessment of his intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota is examining
the race more intently than many Democrats expected, though close
advisors said it remains most likely he will not run.</TE>
<TE>   Also considering the race are retired Gen. Wesley Clark and
African American activist the Rev. Al Sharpton.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's departure will create openings for all these candidates.
Although the former vice president was not attracting nearly as much
institutional support as in 2000, he retained a considerable network
of backers around the country.</TE>
<TE>   One party insider said operatives for Edwards and Kerry were
calling Gore fund-raisers by Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Over the long term, Gore's departure could have the greatest
impact on the competition for two constituencies with enormous
influence in the nominating process.</TE>
<TE>   One is organized labor, where Gore's support, though diminished
from 2000, remained substantial. His decision not to run could lead
to more union backing for Gephardt, who has had close ties with labor
throughout his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Gephardt has support within the labor movement because of the
kinds of things he's done and the way he has spoken out, basically
all through his career," said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "But I
don't think it means ... the other candidates can't make a case."</TE>
<TE>   Gore's exit also means that black voters, who remained among his
most loyal supporters, will be more up for grabs. With Sharpton's
potential appeal unproven, now there may be no obvious consensus
favorite for black voters.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no natural for black voters," said Donna Brazille, an
African American activist who managed Gore's 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Brazille may make the competition even more complex: She is
considering a plan to encourage African American leaders in several
states to run favorite son or daughter candidacies in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Gore fleshed out the process and rationale that led to
his announcement on CBS' "60 Minutes" Sunday night that he would not
run in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said he decided Friday morning after meeting with his family
as he rehearsed for his appearance this last weekend on "Saturday
Night Live." He said there was no "single epiphany," but a "slow
dawning on me" that an attempted rematch against President Bush would
have focused "more on the past than it should have."</TE>
<TE>   He described himself as "completely at peace" with the decision
and repeated his declaration that he was unlikely to again seek
public office. "It is exciting at the age of 54 to have the
opportunity to consider a lot of new things in life," he said.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Revive Algae, Bacteria From 2,800-Year-Old Ice</HD>
<DH>Scientist working on project in Antarctica says techniques
and findings may be useful in similar searches on Mars in the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In ice that has sealed a salty Antarctic lake for more than 2,800
years, scientists have found frozen bacteria and algae that returned
to life after thawing. The research may help in the search for life
on Mars, which is thought to have subsurface lakes of ice.</LD>
<LD>   A research team led by Peter Doran of the University of Illinois
at Chicago drilled through many feet of ice to collect samples of
microscopic bacteria and algae.</LD>
<LD>   "When we brought them back and warmed them up a bit, they sprang
back to life," said Doran, the first author of a study appearing this
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</LD>
<TE>   Doran said the microbes have been age-dated at 2,800 years old,
but even older microbes may live deeper in the ice sheet sealing the
lake and in the briny water below the ice. That deeper ice and the
water itself will be cautiously sampled in a later expedition that
will test techniques that may be used on Mars.</TE>
<TE>   Called Lake Vida, the 3-square-mile body is one of a series of
lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, some 2,000 miles due
south of New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   "This lake has been known since the 1950s, but people ignored it
because they thought it was just a big block of ice," Doran said.
While at the site for other research in the 1990s, Doran and his
colleagues sent radar signals into the clear ice covering the lake
and were surprised to find that 62 feet below was a pool of water
that was about seven times saltier than seawater.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted the researchers to return in 1996 with equipment to
drill a hole down to within a few feet of the water layer. At the
bottom of this hole, they harvested specimens of algae and bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Doran said the researchers halted drilling at 39 feet to preserve
an ice shell over the surface of the ancient lake.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't broken the ice seal yet," Doran said. "We don't want
to disturb that environment until we're ready."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers will return in 2004 equipped with instruments that
are sterilized.</TE>
<TE>   They will then drill through the full 62 feet of ice and sample
some of the briny water from the lake for analysis. The water
specimen will be cultured to see if it contains life.</TE>
<TE>   Any specimens from the water are expected to be even older than
the life forms extracted from the ice covering.</TE>
<TE>   Doran said besides making sure the equipment is germ-free, the
researchers will suck up samples of the water into an air lock.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to contaminate the lake," he said. "If we find life
in the lake, we want to make sure it was living in the lake and not
on our instruments."</TE>
<TE>   The new study is being funded by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration because the space agency is anxious to learn how
best to search for life in submerged pools of briny water, said
Doran, noting that Lake Vida may be an Earthly version of water
deposits thought to exist on Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "There is evidence of flow features on Mars made within the last
million years," Doran said. "Some kind of fluid is seeping out. One
theory is that it could be pockets of brine like the one in Lake Vida
that will not freeze because they are so salty."</TE>
<TE>   Doran said water flows into Lake Vida during some Antarctica
summers, but the new water stays on top of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "In warm summers, you get a lake on top of a lake -- a one meter
of water sitting on top of 19 meters of ice," he said. "That freezes
over the winter and you get a buildup year after year."</TE>
<TE>   Salt is expelled as the water turns to ice and is concentrated
below, Doran said. Over many thousands of years, the salt
concentrates in the water, making the water increasingly difficult to
freeze. He estimated that water just below the ice may have a
freezing point of minus 10 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do find life in that water, it will be from one of the most
extreme environments on Earth," Doran said.</TE>

<HD>'At Least We Got to Kiss Him Goodbye'</HD>
<DH>Jeff Smith knew the Harrier was unforgiving, but he flew it
with gusto. 'I'm ahead of it, Dad,' he would say.</DH>
<SE>THE VERTICAL VISION / PART III: CASUALTIES</SE>
<AU>Kevin Sack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COGGON, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Through the viewfinder of his mother's video camera, Jeffrey Smith
looked the picture of Marine Corps confidence in the moments before
takeoff on June 29, 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Fit and trim in his olive flight suit and aviator shades, the
29-year-old pilot flashed a Tom Cruise smile as he made his final
preflight checks. He walked around the wings of his AV-8B Harrier,
inspected the flaps and climbed nearly all the way into the huge
conical intakes, surveying the fan blades for any hint of damage.</LD>
<LD>   "No gremlins in there," he reported.</LD>
<TE>   Then he pulled on his helmet and clambered into the cockpit. He
fired up the Harrier's engine, which responded with its trademark
screaming whistle, and gave a final thumbs-up and a waved farewell to
his mother and father. Smith taxied the plane to the end of the
runway, and paused like a bull getting ready to charge.</TE>
<TE>   As they watched from the tarmac, Ronnie and Donna Smith could not
have been prouder of their son.</TE>
<TE>   After an eight-month deployment in Japan, he was thrilled to
be back on American soil, reunited with his wife, Dee, and discovering
the heart-tug of fatherhood with the 6-month-old daughter who had
been born in his absence.</TE>
<TE>   With 619 flight hours under his belt, he had recently been
promoted to captain and clearly felt in command of his plane. While
overseas, he had worked himself into top physical shape. His parents
could feel the muscles when they hugged him goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "He just seemed invincible," Donna Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a word used often to describe the 45 Marines who have died
in noncombat accidents involving the Harrier. They always appeared
that way before they climbed into their planes, so utterly
self-assured, like the all-American heroes of some old
black-and-white movie.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of the culture. They were among the best aviators
in the country: bright, brave, ambitious, dedicated to the Marines and
to the Harrier's mission of protecting troops on the ground, like
airborne big brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Many gravitated to the single-seat Harrier precisely because of
its daredevil appeal. The pioneering aircraft can ascend like a
helicopter and then speed off like a jet, and its uniqueness has made
it both the most captivating and the most dangerous plane in the U.S.
military.</TE>
<TE>   During his training, Jeff Smith had called his father any number
of times with news of Harrier crashes. With 143 major accidents in
its 31 years of service, the Harrier's accident rate is significantly
higher than those of comparable combat planes.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff always had an explanation -- the pilot or some mechanic had
fouled up -- and he promised to spend extra time in the simulator,
practicing emergency procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ahead of it, Dad," he'd say.</TE>
<TE>   But as they watched that day, under a sky the color of faded
denim, Ronnie and Donna Smith came to understand that even the most
conscientious pilot can only do so much to stay ahead of the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths, with their thick hands and sun-weathered faces, are
about as Iowa as you can get. Jeff was the second of five children,
all of whom pitched in on the 1,700 acres the family farmed in the
"Field of Dreams" lushness of eastern Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Until they got caught short in the credit crunch of the 1980s and
sold off much of their land, the Smiths planted corn and soybeans and
alfalfa and raised beef cattle and hogs.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff weeded beans by hand and cared for 30 or so of the hogs,
including his prize pets, Pork Chop and Sauerkraut, so named because
Donna had once threatened to make that meal of them if they kept
rooting around in her garden.</TE>
<TE>   Always mechanically inclined, Jeff loved tearing down the tractors
and was captivated by the new technology of farming, like using
computers to set the depth and width of the rows.</TE>
<TE>   He wrestled in high school, as Iowa boys are expected to do, and
narrowly missed making the state tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But from his earliest days, Jeff Smith's real passion was speed.</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster, he raced down country roads in his father's red
Cockshutt tractor. His driver's education teacher warned his parents
that their son had "the heaviest damn foot" he'd ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   When Jeff got his driver's license, Donna Smith predicted that her
little hellion would take no more than 30 days to smash his first
car. He made it to 29, when he drag-raced his 1964 Mustang into a
telephone pole and nearly sliced off his scalp.</TE>
<TE>   Later in life, he would take his red Corvette into the repair
shop, complaining that "it shakes a little at 130."</TE>
<TE>   Cars were fast. But airplanes were really fast.</TE>
<TE>   While Jeff was studying engineering at Iowa State, Ronnie Smith
bought a used Cessna 170 and learned how to fly.</TE>
<TE>   His father's four-seater captured Jeff's imagination, particularly
when Ronnie took the kids "cloud-chasing" by pulling the nose into a
steep climb and giddily slamming through puffy cumulus formations.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Smith already sensed that farming was not going to be
demanding enough for him. Flying, he thought, just might be his
escape.</TE>
<TE>   He started going to air shows around the Midwest. As soon as he
graduated from college, he joined the Marines and trained as an
aviator in Pensacola, Fla. He finished high in his class and was
assigned to fly the Harrier. He liked that it was a single-seat
airplane that forced the pilot to rely on his own instincts and
skills.</TE>
<TE>   He had himself photographed in the cockpit of a Harrier and sent
the picture back home with an inscription: "Eat your heart out, Chuck
Yeager."</TE>
<TE>   When his wife once remarked that he could have made more money as
an engineer, Smith responded, "Yes, I could have, but not one of them
will ever pull four Gs in his life."</TE>
<TE>   On that June weekend in 1992, it was Smith who was featured at the
air show. After returning from Asia, he had wrangled a trip home by
offering to fly a Harrier to the Quad City Air Show in Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   His parents flew the Cessna in from Coggon (population 745 --
"Some Bigger, None Better") and they spent the weekend catching up in
a shared motel room and attending the wedding reception of a close
friend.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff kept the groom up so late in the hotel bar, regaling him with
tales of Marine Corps adventures, that the bride finally surrendered
and retired to bed alone.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was as happy as he had ever been. Everyone could see it.</TE>
<TE>   After all his world travels, he seemed nostalgic for Iowa, and
remarked on how green the fields were.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the people in the world," he told his parents, "Iowa
people are the best."</TE>
<TE>   His friends noticed a new maturity about him, an interest in
family and future that seemed almost ill-fitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel lucky," he told Doug LeClere, a high school
wrestling buddy. "I feel like I've got the world by the tail."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, after the air show had closed, Smith told his
mother he couldn't believe how happy he was.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Jeff, don't say that," she responded. "That's just what Jay
said to me."</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, Jeff's 17-year-old brother, Jay, had been
driving a car that was T-boned by a pickup truck. One of his sisters
watched the crash from another car. Donna Smith, who was following
only minutes behind, came upon the wreckage in time to see the
paramedics loading her youngest child into an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Jay didn't make it. That left just the three girls and Jeff.</TE>
<TE>   On the Monday morning after the Quad City Air Show, Ronnie Smith,
by then a part-time home-builder, had hoped to fly home early. He had
work to do. But his wife persuaded him to stay long enough to see
Jeff soar away toward his base in Yuma, Ariz. After all, they had
never seen him fly the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths walked down the runway with their son as he picked up
rocks and other debris and tossed them to the side, like a golfer
preparing the green for a long, clean putt.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the farmland around him, Jeff joked to his parents:
"Well, one thing about it, if I have to abort, at least I'll be in an
Iowa cornfield."</TE>
<TE>   His mother chided him for even thinking that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Mom," she recalled him telling her, "that's what they teach
us. You have to think about the possibilities. If you have to abort,
where can you go, because the main thing is public safety. They don't
want you to hit buildings or anyplace people will be."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Smith didn't want to think about that. "This is ingrained in
his head from his training," she told herself. "Why would anything go
wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   As Smith began his race down the runway, everything seemed normal.
But as the plane reached 134 mph, the engine's roar seemed to roll
back, as if someone had pulled the plug on a vacuum cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   "He's lost power," Ronnie Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Jeff started to brake, he had sped halfway down the
4,800-foot runway. With his left hand, he pulled the throttle to
idle, then yanked back the nozzle control lever so the Harrier's four
thrusters rotated as far forward as possible, blasting exhaust out
ahead of the plane. Then he throttled back up while pressing the
rudder pedals fully forward to activate the antiskid brakes on the
main landing gear. His right hand gripped the stick, controlling the
steering.</TE>
<TE>   Donna kept filming as a whirl of white smoke enveloped the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "Abort, abort, abort!" Smith yelled into his radio. "I'm
aborting!"</TE>
<TE>   But the pilot quickly ran out of runway, and his Harrier veered
left across a field and then dipped into a shallow drainage ditch
abutting Slopertown Road, shearing off the nose and the main landing
gear.</TE>
<TE>   "He's off the runway!" Ronnie Smith screamed. He began chanting
beneath his breath, "Eject, eject, eject!"</TE>
<TE>   Though his parents could no longer see him, Smith did eject just
as his plane, loaded with 11,000 pounds of fuel, crossed the two-lane
blacktop. Seconds after his ejection seat shot him 106 feet high and
151 feet forward, the Harrier jumped another drainage ditch and
exploded in a farmer's field, sending up a massive ball of orange
flame and billowing black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God, no!" Donna Smith cried as she dropped her camcorder and
ran toward the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   As Jeff descended, he made one full swing under an open parachute.
But then the wind blew him toward the flames, which melted the
orange-and-white parachute panels and cut the pilot loose for a drop
of more than 30 feet.</TE>
<TE>   He landed head-first, possibly hitting a fence post, and was found
unconscious, his breathing labored, his heart and kidneys bleeding, a
leg broken.</TE>
<TE>   When Ronnie Smith got near enough to see his son's helmet, all
dented and smashed, he knew the prospects were grim. At Mercy
Hospital in Davenport, the doctor told the distraught parents that
Jeff's brain "was just scrambled."</TE>
<TE>   Before sunrise the next morning, Jeff's wife, Dee, and infant
daughter, Skylar, flew in from Yuma. The couple had married three
years earlier after a courtship that began when Smith visited Dee's
hometown of Pensacola on spring break.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was born in Yuma while Smith was in Japan, but Dee
scented her crib sheets with his cologne and played audiotapes of him
reciting nursery rhymes. When he returned, only a month before his
accident, he fell quickly in love with his "princess," even when she
was smearing mashed carrots across his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Once the family had gathered at the hospital, the doctor informed
them there had been no sign of brain activity. They paid Jeff a final
visit, with Dee holding his blistered hand and kissing his swollen
forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Then they ordered him removed from life support.</TE>
<TE>   They buried him on the Fourth of July at Mount Clark
Cemetery, near his hometown of Coggon. His slate-gray tombstone bears
etchings of his portrait on one side and a Harrier on the other.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine Corps investigation concluded that even though Smith
was an attentive and knowledgeable pilot, he probably stayed with the
plane too long in trying to minimize damage and protect bystanders.
Had he ejected sooner, the investigators wrote, he might have
survived.</TE>
<TE>   Other pilots speculated that an initial second or two of
indecision in his 25-second abort may have cost Smith his life. But
Ronald V. Deloney, his commander in Yuma, said there "was no
indication of any pilot error."</TE>
<TE>   In the months before the fatal crash, mechanics had noted a number
of minor problems with the plane that had not been fixed -- fluid
leaking from a nose strut, worn rudder mounts, a light that needed
replacing.</TE>
<TE>   But only after a detailed engineering analysis did investigators
identify the most likely cause of the engine's deceleration: a tiny
L-shaped piece of plastic debris, 7/100ths of an inch long and
2/100ths of an inch wide, that had choked the flow of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines never determined exactly how the shard of plastic
found its way into the engine. But the Smiths are, in Ronnie's words,
"disgusted" that it was not discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's something that broke loose, it's one thing," he said.
"But if they just didn't clean it or get the piece out, that'd be
pretty hard to take."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Smith remains bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines are so meticulous about everything," she said. "I
couldn't believe something like this could get by."</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths' friends wondered how much heartbreak the family could
bear. For the second time in three years, they had witnessed the
death of a son.</TE>
<TE>   But in some odd way, Donna Smith was glad she was there. While
Jeff was overseas, she had always feared getting one of those solemn
calls from a faceless colonel or chaplain.</TE>
<TE>   "This way," she said, "at least we got to kiss him goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, Dee has remarried, had another child and divorced.
She lives in Cedar Rapids, not far from the Smiths.  Five years ago, she
was a bridesmaid in a wedding in which both the bride and the maid of
honor were also Harrier widows.</TE>
<TE>   Skylar, now 11, is increasingly curious about the father she never
knew. Her teacher recently assigned her to write a paper about an
American hero. She didn't have to look far for her subject.</TE>
<TE>   Donna and Ronnie deal with Jeff's loss in different ways. Ronnie
likes to watch the video, over and over, to see his handsome young
son flash him that confident thumbs-up. Donna, by contrast, has never
brought herself to view it.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie likes to fly the Cessna to the airfield in Davenport, where
a stone monument erected by family and friends now stands as "an
eternal salute from a pilot to his colleagues" in Yuma's famed Black
Sheep Squadron.</TE>
<TE>   Donna sobs at every telling of the story, as if she is seeing it
all again, and dissolves on Memorial Day when the bugler blows taps.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they wonder whether greater vigilance by the Marines might
have saved their son, the Smiths have tried to move on. They comfort
themselves with the embrace of friends and the regularity of work.
They still have three daughters to cherish.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't been easy.</TE>
<TE>   "After Jay was killed, I didn't think I was ever, ever going to
get over that," Donna said. "And after Jeff was killed, I couldn't
believe that God was doing it to us again. A lot of people fall back
on their faith. We didn't. We abandoned it."</TE>
<TE>   Once devout Catholics, the Smiths stopped going to church. It's
not that they don't believe in God. But they do think he sometimes
turns away.</TE>
<TE>   And so even on the days when she feels God's presence in the
tallness of the corn or the pink sunset over the fields, Donna Smith
cannot help but ask why she lost both of her boys.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess," she said, "I'm still waiting for his answer."</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Law Asks for Forgiveness for Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law, making his first public appearance since
resigning as archbishop, offered another apology and asked for
forgiveness Monday for his role in the clergy sex abuse scandal that
rocked the Boston Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   "As I said last Friday, it is my hope and it's my prayer that my
resignation as archbishop might help the Archdiocese of Boston to
experience healing, to experience reconciliation and to experience
unity," Law told reporters at a brief news conference. He left
without taking any questions.</LD>
<LD>   Law, 71, said policies have been put in place in the last 11
months that he hoped would prevent future abuses by priests. Although
he had hoped to remain head of the fourth-largest U.S. archdiocese,
"it came to be ever more clear to me that the most effective way I
might serve the church at this moment was to resign."</LD>
<TE>   Law expressed uncertainty about his future, and said he plans to
take a brief vacation with fellow priests after Christmas and later
retreat to a monastery. He said he would then live outside the
archdiocese, which covers eastern Massachusetts, but did not say
where.</TE>
<TE>   Law had become the lightning rod for the criticism of alleged
victims, parishioners and, eventually, fellow priests who did not
approve of his handling of the scandal that ensnared dozens of
priests and eventually spread to dioceses around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis erupted nearly a year ago after previously secret
church documents revealed that Law had shuffled offending priests
from parish to parish rather than removing them.</TE>
<TE>   Law's resignation came as thousands of additional documents were
released in recent weeks. Among the most shocking concerned a priest
trading cocaine for sex and another having sex with teenage girls
studying to become nuns by telling them he was the "second coming of
Christ."</TE>

<HD>Dachshund Mauls Baby, Critically Injuring Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A 6-week-old St. Mary's County, Md., boy was in critical condition
Monday after being dragged from his playpen and mauled by the
family's dachshund, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The infant was sleeping in a downstairs bedroom Sunday morning
when his mother, Andrea Meyers, heard cries coming from a baby
monitor, according to a report from the criminal investigations unit
of the Maryland State Police. When Meyers reached the bedroom, she
found the dog attacking the boy, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The dog had chewed a hole through the mesh of the playpen and
pulled the baby from it before biting his legs and feet.</LD>
<TE>   When the police arrived at the home, the baby was alert but had
numerous wounds on his lower body, a detective sergeant said.</TE>
<TE>   Although state police identified the mother by name, Cpl. Roger
Redmond refused to provide the name of the child on grounds he was a
juvenile. Redmond said police were continuing their investigation to
determine whether charges should be brought against the child's
family.</TE>
<TE>   No one answered the telephone at the family home Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the incident was unlike any they could remember in St.
Mary's County, particularly involving such a diminutive dog.</TE>
<TE>   Dachshunds aren't typically aggressive, yet preparation is
required to familiarize a dog with a new child, said Andra O'Connell,
secretary of the Dachshund Club of America.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the animal -- which comes from a hunting breed -- feels
like an overlooked older child, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The dachshund is so incredibly tuned to being a family dog,"
O'Connell said. "They are very loyal to their family and owners. They
don't want to be left out, and for that reason, they will get upset.
But attack, no. That's not normal."</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's County animal control officers removed the dachshund
from the Meyers' home.</TE>

<HD>Court Backs Prescription Drug Curbs</HD>
<DH>Michigan's cost-cutting move to limit which medications
low-income patients get is upheld.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANSING, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Michigan acted legally when it attempted to cut costs by limiting the
drugs doctors can prescribe to low-income patients, the state appeals
court said in a decision released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision was a victory for the Michigan Department
of Community Health. It also sent a clear signal to other states,
which have been waiting to see if courts would approve Michigan's
unique approach.</LD>
<LD>   "This allows us to continue to offer high-quality health care to
low-income Michigan citizens and prudently manage costs," Community
Health Director James Haveman said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Drug companies and mental health advocates, who sued to stop the
plan, said they were disappointed with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients in Michigan are being denied the medicines their doctors
want them to have," said Bruce Lott, a spokesman for the
Washington-based trade group Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan's plan, which went into effect in February, requires
doctors to use a state-developed list when prescribing medications to
patients who rely on state aid, including Medicaid fee-for-service
patients and programs for infants and the elderly. The program will
eventually cover around 1.6 million patients.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors must get state authorization for medications not on the
list, which was developed by a committee of physicians and
pharmacists selected by Republican Gov. John Engler.</TE>
<TE>   Some drugs were allowed on the list because they were considered
medically necessary. In other cases, drug companies were told to give
discounts or risk being left off the list.</TE>
<TE>   PhRMA and mental health advocates said the state program endangers
patients' lives and is unconstitutional because it was never
considered by the full Legislature.</TE>

<HD>Deal Offered in Flap Over Mormons' Protest Ban</HD>
<DH>Salt Lake City proposes land swap. Issue landed in court
after church barred rallies on plaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The city offered a compromise Monday in an effort to resolve a fight
over the Mormon church's attempt to ban public demonstrations on the
church's Main Street Plaza -- a former city street.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Rocky Anderson proposed that the city give up a sidewalk
pedestrian easement that it retained when it sold the block-long
section of Main Street to the church, in exchange for 2.17 acres of
church-owned land on the city's western side. The deal would require
City Council approval.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop David Burton said the mayor's idea represents a "workable
solution" that he would take to leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints. The church had been prepared to appeal its case
over control of the plaza to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   The church paid $8.1 million for the section of Main Street in
1999 and turned it into an extension of Temple Square.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute arose after the church banned actions it considers
offensive, including smoking, sunbathing and "any illegal, offensive,
indecent, obscene, vulgar, lewd or disorderly speech, dress or
conduct." It also claimed the right to ban anyone who violated the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah sued on behalf of Salt
Lake City's First Unitarian Church and others, arguing that the
restrictions were unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver overturned a lower court judge, ruling that the
plaza must remain open to free speech, including protests, because of
the city's public easement.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Monday threw out a University of South Florida
lawsuit that sought court approval for a plan to fire a tenured
Palestinian professor accused of having terrorist ties.</LD>
<LD>   The university had wanted U.S. District Judge Susan Bucklew to
rule that its plan to fire the computer science professor, Sami
Al-Arian, would not violate his constitutional rights to free speech.</LD>
<LD>   The judge recommended that the dispute be submitted to arbitration
instead of a federal court, under the school's collective bargaining
agreement with its employees.</LD>
<TE>   The state university has alleged that Al-Arian raised money for
terrorist groups, brought terrorists into the United States, and
founded organizations that support terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe that terminating him would violate his rights,
but this was an effort to make absolutely sure," university spokesman
Michael Reich said in a statement. He said the school still could
fire Al-Arian, but would explore all of its options before
determining how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian had already said he would sue if he were fired.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian's attorney, Robert McKee, said he was pleased with the
judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball's in their court," he said. "If USF is, as they
represented to the court, uncertain whether firing Dr. Al-Arian
violates his constitutional rights, then we suggest they shouldn't
fire him."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian has been on paid leave since a television appearance
shortly after the 9/11 attacks in which he was quizzed about links to
known terrorists, and asked about tapes from the late 1980s and early
1990s in which he said "Death to Israel" in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, at the urging of university trustees, university
President Judy Genshaft said Al-Arian should be fired from his
$67,500-a-year job, alleging breach of contract and saying his
presence on campus was disruptive and a safety threat.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Arian has denied the allegations of terrorist links, which
earlier this year got his brother-in-law, Mazen Al-Najjar, deported
to Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The two men founded the World and Islam Studies Enterprises, a
now-defunct Islamic think tank at the university. A former head of
the group, Ramadan Adbulah Shallah, left in 1995 and later resurfaced
as head of a terrorist organization, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Besieged Senate Republican leader Trent Lott on cable's Black
Entertainment Television?</LD>
<LD>   He was forthright. He was incisive. He was earnest. He was strong.
He was bold. He was commanding. He was believable. He was
intelligent. He was perceptive. He was shrewd. In other words, he was
everything viewers could have asked for in an eagerly anticipated
televised one-on-one with national political implications.</LD>
<LD>   But enough about interviewer Ed Gordon.</LD>
<TE>   And Lott? Surely he'd had better nights.</TE>
<TE>   He was again apologetic Monday night, hoping to atone for saying
at a 100th birthday party for Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) that the
nation would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president
in 1948 when running as a segregationist.</TE>
<TE>   Although his apologies were familiar, Lott did break ground. It
was likely the first time in his Senate career that his television
lead-in was a program titled "Best Comedy in Rap Videos," an exotic
juxtaposition for a senator accused of still being racist after all
these years.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there was something surreal about the entire half-hour
interview, which Lott sought in hopes of impressing BET's
predominantly black audience, and perhaps those of his fellow
Republicans who now believe he's too stained politically to continue
functioning as their leader in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Lott was following a long tradition of politicians seeking
redemption -- and approval -- through television, from Richard
Nixon's famed Checkers speech to Bill and Hillary Clinton on "60
Minutes" to Rep. Gary A. Condit self-destructing with Connie Chung on
ABC.</TE>
<TE>   How politicians do on these occasions usually depends on the
quality of the interviewer, whether that person is aggressive or
passive, well-informed or a dumb palooka wildly throwing out
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was no palooka. He never is. He had earlier gotten famous
on BET by conducting tough interviews with the likes of O.J. Simpson
and Louis Farrakhan before moving on to NBC. Now he's back at BET.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he was Lott's worst nightmare, offering a primer for
other TV interviewers.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was polite but firm. Without being a bully, he held Lott's
tongue to the fire, pressing him on "your past" and not allowing the
senator to dodge, finesse or answer questions that weren't asked.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon ticked off instances of Lott's behavior that his critics
now point to as allegedly racist, and challenged him to explain them.
When Lott tried to separate his actions on a personal level from his
legislative record, Gordon would have none of it.</TE>
<TE>   As for the newer, more enlightened Lott's hat-in-hand mea culpa
about his opposition to a national holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and other issues, a stony Gordon wanted to know exactly when
his epiphany had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's non-answer was his answer. Gordon thanked him for coming
on, which was about like a wildebeest being thanked by a lion for
dropping by.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court Upholds Ban on Farmers Plowing Wetlands</HD>
<DH>California case decided on split vote. The issue is
expected to come up again before the justices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An evenly divided Supreme Court, in a setback for a Central
California rancher, upheld the government's power to prohibit farmers
from plowing up wetlands to convert the land to fruit orchards.</LD>
<LD>   The justices split, 4 to 4, in a closely watched case that tested
the line between a protected wetland and a farmer's use of his own
land.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a Sacramento native, withdrew from the
case because he knew Angelo Tsakopoulos, the rancher and developer
who appealed the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the eight justices heard a spirited argument on the
case and then voted behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the court issued a one-line order announcing that, by a
tie vote, the ruling of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had
been affirmed.</TE>
<TE>   This means that, at least for now, the Army Corps of Engineers and
the Environmental Protection Agency maintain their broad authority to
prevent landowners from dredging or filling wetlands that drain into
rivers and streams.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they were relieved, but not reassured.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good news for today, but I'm sure industry will try to
bring this up again," said Julie Sibbing of the National Wildlife
Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of acres of wetlands would have been threatened,
environmentalists said, if the court had allowed farmers to plow.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers who challenged the reach of the government's
regulatory power said they were disappointed, but not defeated.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the court is very divided. They will be looking for
another case to decide this issue, and the environmentalists have to
be worried," said Chicago attorney Timothy Bishop, who represented
Tsakopoulos in last week's argument. "We think Justice Kennedy would
have been on our side" had he voted. Last year, in a 5-4 decision,
the court stripped federal regulators of their power over isolated
ponds and seasonal pools of water that do not flow into navigable
streams. Environmentalists said this left millions of acres of
wetlands unprotected. In that case, Kennedy sided with the
conservative majority.</TE>
<TE>   In dispute in the California case was low-lying farmland that
fills with water during the winter rains and drains into a stream.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Tsakopoulos bought the 8,400-acre Borden Ranch along the
border of Sacramento and San Joaquin counties. Cattle had grazed on
the land, but the new owner decided to plow it and plant fruit trees
or grapevines.</TE>
<TE>   A bulldozer with a deep plow was used to break up the hard clay.
This "deep ripper" cut seven-foot grooves into the ground and "had a
dramatic effect on the character of the wetland," federal officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tsakopoulos was repeatedly warned that he could not plow in the
wetlands area without a permit. In 1999, a federal judge in
Sacramento found that he had committed 348 violations and handed down
a $1.5-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Wetlands are protected under the Clean Water Act, which forbids
polluting, dredging or filling of these waters but makes an exception
for "normal farming."</TE>
<TE>   In a 2-1 decision, the 9th Circuit upheld the federal regulators,
ruling that the deep plowing had the effect of dredging and filling
the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The California Farm Bureau, American Farm Bureau and other
agriculture groups supported Tsakopoulos, arguing that plowing a
field is not the same as dredging and filling a wetland.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush administration lawyers vigorously defended the
environmental regulators in the case of Borden Ranch vs. U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not talking about a yeoman's plow here. We are talking
about a 100,000-pound bulldozer," said Assistant Solicitor General
Jeffrey Minear.</TE>
<TE>   His brief also noted that Tsakopoulos had sold 4,000 acres for
$16.2 million after planting the orchards.</TE>
<TE>   The landowner's legal case was not a total loss. The 9th Circuit
Court ordered the trial judge in Sacramento to reduce the fine
because some of the violations involved isolated pools that are not
protected wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we are disappointed to lose on a tie vote, but outside
the 9th Circuit, this issue remains wide open," said Edmund L.
Regalia, a Walnut Creek lawyer who represented Tsakopoulos.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Monday, the court asked Bush administration
lawyers for their view on whether antiabortion activists who had set
up a Web site with "Wanted" posters of doctors who perform abortions
engaged in illegal threats.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a jury in Oregon handed down a $109-million verdict in
favor of doctors who were the targets of these sites. Earlier this
year, the 9th Circuit upheld that verdict on a 6-5 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Antiabortion activists appealed to the high court on free-speech
grounds. They also say that the Web site did not violate the Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it illegal to block
abortion clinics. Monday's order asks Solicitor General Theodore B.
Olson to give the government's view of that law. This will delay for
several months a decision on whether to take up the appeal.</TE>

<HD>Montgomery Eateries Dread Smoking Ban</HD>
<DH>Alabama health advocates are elated over the ordinance, but
restaurateurs fear they will lose customers to bars, which are
exempt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>For more than a decade, health activists in Alabama have tried to
pass a state law to restrict smoking in public places. Every year,
they offer a bill in the state Legislature. Every year it dies.</LD>
<LD>   So it was a pleasant jolt for advocates of smoking restrictions
when the City Council here in the state capital abruptly barred
indoor smoking last month in most public places, such as restaurants,
bowling alleys, pool halls and arcades. The municipal measure,
approved on the first night it came up, represents the most stringent
rules against smoking in Alabama, which remains the only state
without a statewide law to regulate smoking in public places.</LD>
<LD>   "They passed it, 7 to 2 -- I mean, 'Bam!' " said an elated Ben
McNeill, the councilman who sponsored the ordinance. "I was a little
surprised."</LD>
<TE>   But since passage on Nov. 19, the Montgomery ordinance has stirred
protests from the city's restaurateurs, who fear they will lose
business to local bars, which are exempt from the new rules.
Restaurant owners have hurriedly sought to head off the law before it
goes into effect on Thursday. A council member who voted in favor has
switched sides. Opponents plan to ask the council tonight to delay
imposing the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "If they leave it like it is, this is probably going to put me out
of business," said Johnny Sullivan, who runs two Montgomery
restaurants called Sinclair's.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery joins a handful of Southern municipalities that are
imposing or weighing smoking bans -- a trend that reflects the
evolving tactics of anti-smoking activists and shifting attitudes
toward the use of tobacco in a region that grows lots of it. While
smoking bans have popped up in a few states and scores of counties
and cities -- including Boston and, soon, apparently, New York -- the
spurt of proposed ordinances in the South is striking because of the
region's traditional antipathy toward restricting personal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "We're resistant to governmental regulation -- governmental
interference -- in our lives, even when it's for our own good," said
William Stewart, an emeritus professor of political science at the
University of Alabama and an expert on state politics. "It's part of
our political culture."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the South, whose smoking rates are higher than the
national average, was the only region in the country without a single
local ban on smoking in privately owned spaces, such as work sites
and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   While most Southern states have enacted limited regulations --
say, to restrict smoking in government buildings or prevent it in
day-care centers -- anti-smoking forces generally have met resistance
to strict statewide bans. Instead, activists are seeking toeholds in
the cities and towns, much as counterparts have done in other
sections of the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Mississippi's Delta region, the town of Metcalfe, population
1,109, made state history in October when it barred smoking in all
its businesses, which consist of a few convenience stores and beauty
parlors. In Georgia, Loganville would become the first city in the
state to require that all public places, except stand-alone bars, be
free of smoke. The proposal won preliminary City Council approval and
awaits hearings next month. A similar prohibition is being debated in
Milledgeville.</TE>
<TE>   Other communities are expressing interest, and backers say their
next move may be to try to pass a strict indoor-smoking ban, as
California and Delaware have. Some other states, including Maine,
Maryland, Oregon, Minnesota and Utah, also restrict smoking to
varying degrees, and Florida voters recently approved a ban, with
some exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of caught on," said Ken Vance, a councilman in
Milledgeville who is pushing for the smoking ordinance. Vance said he
thought of proposing such a measure a few years back, but he figured
it wouldn't pass. "It didn't feel right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Vance and other local officials who back smoking restrictions
say their constituents now are asking for measures to curb secondhand
smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a health issue," Vance said. "I've done a little bit more
homework since three years ago and so have a lot of other people."</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding Lobbyists</TE>
<TE>   The focus on local laws reflects a growing belief among activists
that they face better chances on Main Street, where residents who
support smoking bans can appeal directly to municipal lawmakers --
far from the influence of tobacco-industry lobbyists in the corridors
of state government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having better success getting to city council members and
mayors than state lawmakers," said advocacy director for the American
Lung Assn. of Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   In Montgomery, McNeill, the councilman, got together with the
American Cancer Society to toughen the city's 1989 ordinance, which
required restaurants and other public places to create separate
sections for smokers and nonsmokers. McNeill said the old law was
poorly enforced.</TE>
<TE>   The new ordinance bars smoking in all public places, such as
restaurants, stores, government offices and hospitals. Smoking is
allowed in restaurants after midnight, and in bars anytime. "We're
hoping for a domino effect," said Brad Owen, the American Cancer
Society's director of government relations in Alabama. "We think if
we can just get one, then others will follow."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's restaurant owners, who said they were not notified
that such restrictions were under consideration, now envision the
worst as they scramble to undo the new law.</TE>
<TE>   At Country Gal's, a few miles from downtown past a stretch of
weatherworn homes and auto shops, the cigarette smoking is nearly as
central to the scene as the plates of crispy fried chicken and baked
sweet potato. It's a clock-puncher's joint, where customers with name
tags sewn on their work shirts pack away heaping lunches before
settling back with a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the folks who eat here are smokers; there's almost no one
to be found in the separate -- and smaller -- nonsmoking section
after 1 p.m. "It's a lonely place back there," said owner Carol
Brooks, who opened the restaurant eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said it is none of the government's business whether
grown-ups do or don't smoke in her place. She predicted the ordinance
would drive her customers away. Several diners said that was probably
true.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have to bring a sandwich and then go to the park and have
my cigarette," said Theresa Walton, a 47-year-old secretary who is
not allowed to smoke at the Baptist church where she works. She had
just finished a lunch of roast beef and mashed potatoes -- and
several Carlton cigarettes, puffed in quick succession -- before
heading back to work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair," said Richard Wagner, 44, a car mechanic. "They
should have left it up to the people to decide instead of the City
Council." The next thing you know, said one waitress, they'll be
coming around to ban frying chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Significant Barriers</TE>
<TE>   Despite the limited gains in the South, health advocates face
significant barriers to enacting widespread smoking bans. Two of the
biggest tobacco-growing states, North Carolina and Tennessee, prevent
municipalities from imposing restrictions that are more stringent
than state law, making it impossible for local lawmakers to prohibit
smoking outright. A similar rule in South Carolina has kept smoking
foes from proposing local bans.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, activists in those states have sought to persuade
businesses to go smoke-free on their own.</TE>
<TE>   In Montgomery, some restaurant owners feel they will lose no
matter which way the battle turns out. "I'm in a no-win situation,"
said owner Gail Royal. If the ban survives, she said, the happy-hour
crowd at Down the Street Cafe may abandon its barstools. If it is
overturned, nonsmoking customers might be miffed.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll always remember me for going to bat for the smoker," said
Royal, a nonsmoker. "I'll be the bad guy. And I'm not bad."</TE>

<LD>Two teenage brothers who pleaded guilty to killing their father have
been transferred from prison to a juvenile detention center despite
objections from the judge and prosecutor, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Alex and Derek King, ages 13 and 14, were turned over Friday to
the Department of Juvenile Justice at the request of state prison
officials, according to Bill Bankhead, the department's secretary.</LD>
<LD>   He did not say where the boys were sent, but a lawyer for their
mother said they had been separated.</LD>
<TE>   Bankhead said the decision was based on the boys' youth and his
department's programs for juvenile offenders, but he warned they
could be sent back to adult prison if they broke department rules.</TE>
<TE>   Derek admitted he fatally beat their father, Terry King, with an
aluminum baseball bat Nov. 26, 2001, and Alex said he had urged his
brother to do it. The boys said they then set their house on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant State Atty. David Rimmer and Circuit Judge Frank Bell
objected to the Department of Corrections' request for the move. Bell
wrote to the Department of Juvenile Justice that both sides "should
now be required to abide by what was presented in court."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, children are placed in juvenile detention centers only
after being tried in juvenile court, but Derek and Alex were tried in
adult court.</TE>
<TE>   The boys were convicted but their second-degree murder convictions
were thrown out. They then pleaded guilty to arson and third-degree
murder in an unusual mediated settlement. Bell sentenced Derek to
eight years and Alex to seven, both with credit for a year of time
served.</TE>
<TE>   Bankhead said he decided to accept the boys into the juvenile
system because they would have been among the youngest inmates in
adult prison. He also said the juvenile system will give them
education and treatment more appropriate to their age.</TE>

<HD>Bare-Bones Accord Averts Transit Strike in New York City</HD>
<DH>Tentative three-year deal is a much smaller wage hike than
union sought. It includes a $1,000 bonus and a 3% raise in each of
two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Averting a crippling New York City transit strike, negotiators agreed
Monday on a spartan, three-year deal in which union leaders accepted
a much smaller wage increase than they had demanded.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, subway and bus employees would get a $1,000
lump-sum bonus, but no wage increase, in the first year, and a 3%
salary increase in each of the following two years. The deal must
still be approved by the 34,000 members of the Transit Workers Union.</LD>
<LD>   "I have every confidence that the membership will approve this
overwhelmingly," said transit union leader Roger Touissaint, who
originally sought a 24% wage increase over three years. Asked whether
the union had settled for too little, the labor leader said, "I don't
want to inflame the situation, so I'll simply say good night."</LD>
<TE>   The deal was approved after four marathon days of negotiations.
Although the contract officially expired at midnight Sunday, union
leaders said sufficient progress had been made to "stop the clock"
just before the deadline and continue talks through Monday.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference Monday night with Touissaint at a
Manhattan hotel, Peter Kalikow, president of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, voiced relief at the settlement. He called
it "a historic turning point" in the relationship between the MTA and
the transit union, one in which "confrontation would give way to
cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Kalikow and Touissaint hugged after announcing the deal, and New
Yorkers who had been bracing for the city's first transit strike in
22 years breathed a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   During recent days, when it seemed that the two sides were making
no progress, millions of people geared up for contingency plans
prepared by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   Had there been a strike, those driving automobiles would have
needed three or more passengers to enter Manhattan on weekdays, and
one or more passengers on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Taxis were prepared to handle more than one customer at a time,
and ferry services to New York were also going to be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg estimated that the city would have lost between $100
million and $350 million daily during a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Any work stoppage "would have been a catastrophe for the city,
especially during the holiday season," Kalikow added.</TE>
<TE>   But it would have also been a financial disaster for the union.
Strikes by public employees are illegal in New York, and the MTA had
secured an injunction barring any labor action by the Transit Workers
Union, despite threats to walk off the job.</TE>
<TE>   The union could have been fined millions of dollars for each day
of a strike. Individual members were liable for $25,000 in daily
penalties under the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Given those realities, former Mayor David N. Dinkins said in an
interview on New York 1 News, "there would have been a lot of pain
all around. It's a blessing that we finally got this thing settled."</TE>
<TE>   The starting salary for transit workers is $33,000 a year, while
senior workers can earn up to $47,000, according to union statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Although Touissaint did not get the raises he wanted, the union's
members were pleased by concessions made in the MTA's disciplinary
policies that they said would treat workers with more dignity.</TE>
<TE>   The union also won funding for a child-care program.</TE>
<TE>   In return, MTA officials said they had won productivity increases
from workers that would allow the trains and buses to run more
efficiently and save money.</TE>

<LD>Their average age was 30. They came from 24 states and the District
of Columbia. Thirty-three were married and three were engaged. They
left behind 38 children and five on the way.</LD>
<LD>   They are the 45 Marines who have died in Harrier accidents during
the jump jet's 31 years of U.S. service. Two more Marines were killed
when their Harriers were shot down during the Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of Lt. Stephen J. Chetneky, a flight surgeon,
all were pilots. Some were highly experienced; others were "nuggets."
All shared a devotion to the corps and to the Harrier's special
mission of using Marine air power to protect Marines on the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Some came from military families, with fathers and
even grandfathers who had flown or fought in America's wars. Others
stunned their parents when they announced plans to enlist and learn
to fly. They typically were high achievers in school and in flight
training. Some chose to fly the Harrier, invigorated by the
challenge. Others were assigned to the plane by the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   They died in fiery explosions and ill-timed ejections. Some made
fatal mistakes. Some did everything right and perished anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Following are the stories of their lives and deaths.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAJ. MICHAEL J. RIPLEY</TE>
<TE>   Died: June 18, 1971</TE>
<TE>   Ripley, a test pilot, was the first to die at the controls of a
Harrier in the United States. His AV-8A crashed into Chesapeake Bay
during a test flight.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a railroad foreman, Ripley grew up in a small town in
the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. He finished college
and joined the Marines in 1958. After serving in Vietnam, Ripley -- a
decorated combat pilot -- began flight training on the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   Ripley's oldest son, Charles, remembers the excitement of hearing
the drone of a military plane every day around noon. "My father would
fly over and he'd tip his wings at us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On his last flight, Ripley flew toward a target in the bay at a
steep angle, but then couldn't pull up fast enough to avoid hitting
the water.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine investigation found pilot error, said his brother,
retired Marine Col. John W. Ripley. "That's almost always the case,
especially when you can't recover the aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ripley was 33. He had a wife and three sons under the age
of 6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. RICHARD H. BRIGGS</TE>
<TE>   Died: June 5, 1974</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress and military brass were watching as
Briggs, 28, brought his AV-8A in for a landing during a military exercise
near Camp Lejeune, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   His plane banked, rolled, then crashed. He didn't survive an
ejection into a wooded area, said his widow, Marv Briggs.
Investigators blamed pilot error and noted he was flying on five
hours' sleep.</TE>
<TE>   An experienced A-4 Skyhawk pilot, he had just 44 hours of flight
time in the Harrier. His logbook showed he flew 6.2 hours in the
month before his death and 10.2 hours the month before that, his
widow said. His wing commander used the incident to write that
Harrier pilots needed to fly 17 to 20 hours a month to stay
proficient.</TE>
<TE>   Marv Briggs remembered him as a "warm, funny and kind man." A U.S.
Naval Academy graduate, he flew in the first Harrier squadron trained
in this country. "He was very excited about the possibilities of that
plane," she said. "It was a whole new part of aviation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. ROY R. DOUGHERTY</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Shank 47 Died: Oct. 9, 1974</TE>
<TE>   The landing gear of Dougherty's AV-8A Harrier collapsed on
touchdown at the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, N.C. The
plane skidded off the runway and flipped into a drainage ditch, where
it burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   As the plane flipped over, the ejection seat was thrown from the
cockpit and slammed to the ground with Dougherty still strapped in.
He was flown by helicopter to the base hospital, where he died two
hours after the crash. He was 30 years old.</TE>
<TE>   He had been assigned to the Harrier for just two months and it was
only his third training flight. He left behind a pregnant wife and a
3-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   He was the oldest of four siblings growing up on a farm in
southeast Michigan. Though he planned to enter law school after
college, Dougherty instead joined the Marines and fought in Vietnam,
said his sister, May Shull. He came home with a Purple Heart and a
desire to fly jets, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The family treasures a photo of Dougherty in uniform that he
inscribed for his parents. "Rest easy," he wrote. "Your security is
in my hands."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. RICHARD F. DAVIS</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Rock Died: Feb. 14, 1975</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Terre Haute, Ind., Davis begged to watch jets take
off at the airport. He got his pilot's license before his driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   Between semesters at Indiana State University, he attended officer
training school and wore the uniform of a Marine lieutenant by the
time he graduated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, the Marines tapped him to fly the Harrier. "He was
ecstatic," said his widow, Annie Davis Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   When his father fell ill the next year, Davis flew a Harrier to
the Terre Haute airport to visit him. People poured onto the tarmac
to watch as he made it hover, turn and climb straight up, his brother
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis died four months later. His AV-8A Harrier rolled and crashed
on Feb. 13, 1975, during a vertical takeoff at Cherry Point. He was
27.</TE>
<TE>   A flashlight left in the engine bay or contamination of the
hydraulic system could have caused the accident, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Three more pilots in his squadron were killed in Harriers over the
next four years. "I was shocked and amazed when I heard that,"
Kennedy said. "I just thought, 'Is this never going to stop?' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. CLEVE B. DOSTER</TE>
<TE>   Died: July 3, 1975</TE>
<TE>   Doster, 26, was flying a training sortie with Maj. Woody F.
Gilliland, who was in his own Harrier. Gilliland's plane lost power
because of a mechanical problem and he ejected successfully,
parachuting into a cotton field near Bennetsville, S.C. Soon
afterward, Doster's Harrier crashed into trees. The cause could not
be determined, but officials assume he lost control while trying to
locate Gilliland for rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   A bright, gregarious and athletic Marine with a compact 5-foot-7
frame, Doster came from a remarkable military family.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Col. Grover Cleveland Doster, was a Marine aviator who
flew in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, then served as a White House
naval aide during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Cleve Doster held a bachelor's degree in engineering from Georgia
Tech and a master's in aeronautical engineering from the University
of West Florida. He dreamed of being an astronaut. He had been
married for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "He had always wanted to fly and his idea of flight was real fast
flight," said his younger brother, David Doster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. DONALD P.</TE>
<TE>   KALTENBAUGH</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: K-10 Died: Dec. 16, 1976</TE>
<TE>   Kaltenbaugh's AV-8A crashed into the Sea of Japan during a
training flight.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Judy Kaltenbaugh, said the Marines told her he became
disoriented in the fog. "I was told he got turned upside-down and
instead of pulling up, he plunged down into the water."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, he flew other aircraft before
training on the Harrier in January 1976. "Donnie lived and breathed
to fly," his widow said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time he died, his oldest daughter was 4 and his twin girls
were 1 1/2. "The most tragic part about this is that they didn't know
him," Judy Kaltenbaugh said. "He adored them."</TE>
<TE>   Kaltenbaugh was 29.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1st LT. THOMAS J. EVANS</TE>
<TE>   Died: April 6, 1977</TE>
<TE>   Heavy crosswinds battered the runway as Evans set out to practice
a vertical takeoff in his AV-8A in Beaufort, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   A novice Harrier pilot, Evans, 25, had a hard time controlling the
plane in previous attempts. Now, with the wind whipping around him,
he lifted his plane off the runway, hovered and lost control as he
tried to accelerate into conventional flight. The plane rolled to the
left, dropped nose down and bounced so hard on the ground that it
detonated Evans' ejection seat. He died of a skull fracture and
internal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation described Evans as "an inexperienced first-tour
aviator" and suggested that pilot error caused the crash. But the
report also found fault with the decision to let Evans take off in
heavy winds.</TE>
<TE>   He was married and had a 2-year-old son. A scholarship was named
for Evans at his New Jersey high school, where he was an athlete who
made top grades, said his brother, David Evans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. TIMOTHY C. KREPPS</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Tango Charlie Died: July 12, 1977</TE>
<TE>   Krepps crashed into the Atlantic during a demonstration for
several high-ranking government officials, including Navy Secretary
W. Graham Claytor Jr. and Bert Lance, then director of the Office of
Management and Budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrific sort of thing," recalled Lance, who was on
board the carrier Saratoga with the other observers. "They were
giving some kind of flyby demonstration and maybe a firing
demonstration. It was out on the horizon. You could see him
disappear."</TE>
<TE>   The investigative report found that Krepps, 30, "became
disoriented" and may have been confused by clouds or distracted by
cockpit tasks. Little of the AV-8A was found, and Krepps was lost at
sea. He was married and had two sons, 7 and 9 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really gung-ho about learning to fly the Harrier," said
Krepps' sister, Judy Corcoran. "He understood the complex nature of
it. And he was a bit afraid of it, especially when these accidents
started happening."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. ANTHONY</TE>
<TE>   FRANOVICH JR.</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Bayou Died: July 26, 1977</TE>
<TE>   Franovich was the first in his large, extended Cajun family to
explore life beyond the oil rigs off Louisiana's Gulf Coast, said his
widow, Pam Franovich Kinard. After graduating from Louisiana State
University, he joined the Marines and flew F-4 Phantoms. He requested
a transfer to the Harrier program in North Carolina shortly after
they lost their 2-week-old firstborn child, she said.</TE>
<TE>   One day the base commander dropped in on a meeting of officers'
wives. "He and the chaplain told us that they knew there were a lot
of fears, but we needed to support our husbands," Kinard said. "They
brought out a wife whose husband had to eject from the Harrier but
survived. He died later in another Harrier accident."</TE>
<TE>   She knew it was her turn when she saw a chaplain approaching at
the Cherry Point base hospital, where she had taken their second
child for a routine checkup. Witnesses saw Franovich's AV-8A descend
into the Bay River in the rain and explode. An investigation couldn't
determine the cause. Franovich was 32.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after his death, Kinard gave birth to their third
child, a son she named Tony.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. CHARLES G. REED</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Husky Died: Sept. 6, 1977</TE>
<TE>   Reed flew into a mountainside during a bombing training run at
Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   The cause was never determined. But investigators surmised that
Reed, 30, didn't realize how close he was flying to the rugged
terrain -- perhaps partly because his altimeter wasn't working
properly. He had complained to a fellow pilot that the device was
acting up during a flight the previous day, the accident report said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators recommended that the Marines equip all AV-8A
aircraft with an audio and visual low-altitude warning system. It was
added to the plane over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   A highly regarded pilot, Reed left a pregnant wife and three
children between 1 and 4. His father, a private and commercial pilot,
had died in a plane crash about three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. JOSEPH GALLO</TE>
<TE>   Call sign: Cobra Died: Oct. 2, 1978</TE>
<TE>   Dana Gallo said her husband advised her to sue if he died flying a
Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   "He had lost too many friends in accidents," she said. "He loved
the aircraft, loved what it could do, but it was not a forgiving
aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   His AV-8A Harrier crashed in the Chocolate Mountains east of
California's Salton Sea during a bombing training run. He flew into
the ground inverted, according to his wingman. No cause was ever
determined, Dana Gallo said. She never sued.</TE>
<TE>   Gallo had flown Cobra helicopters in Vietnam and was one of the
first Marine helicopter pilots to make the transition to the Harrier.
After learning to fly the plane, he had served in Japan and the
Mediterranean.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a career Army officer, Gallo was due for a promotion to
major when he was killed, Dana Gallo said. He was 34. He left two
sons, who were 2 and 5 at the time of his death.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1st LT. ROBERT C. MURRAY</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Sweet Biscuit  Died: Oct. 12, 1979</TE>
<TE>   Murray was a by-the-book Marine who wore his hair short and
regularly attended Bible study.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Mississippi, son of a World War II military pilot
and a schoolteacher. He was an Eagle Scout, played high school
football and tinkered with the piano, trumpet and French horn. His
father told him he would buy him a car if he didn't take a drink or
smoke a cigarette before graduating from Mississippi State. Murray
had little trouble meeting the challenge. He got a shiny new Ford.</TE>
<TE>   As a Marine, he was a cautious but fearless pilot, family members
say. "One day I said to him, 'Robert, I know what you're doing is
terribly dangerous,' " recalled his mother, Marjorie Murray. "But he
said: 'Mama, don't worry about me. If anything happens to me, I'll be
face to face with my savior, Jesus Christ.' "</TE>
<TE>   His AV-8A crashed during a training flight over the Atlantic just
off Cape Lookout, N.C. He hit the water at a steep angle and a high
rate of speed. He never ejected. His body was never found and the
plane was destroyed. No cause was ever determined.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was 25.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. ARTHUR G. MORRELL</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Otter Died: March 13, 1980</TE>
<TE>   Morrell flew into a 200-foot-thick cloud bank at the start of a
short trip back to base at Cherry Point, N.C. Two fishermen in a
waterway below heard the AV-8A crash and reached the wreckage first.</TE>
<TE>   The family was never told the cause of the accident, said his
father, Wallace Morrell, who died earlier this month. "The
explanation was simply that he went in the water and they didn't know
why."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Morrell had co-captained the football team at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania and married his high school sweetheart the
day before graduating with a degree in mathematics. He had two sons,
one 7 months and the other 2 years old, when he died at the age of
26.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to be mad at him and the Marine Corps for about two
seconds," said his widow, Blenda Morrell Long. "But flying is what he
wanted to do with his life, and he accomplished it. How many people
can say that?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1st LT. DONALD P. BECKER</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Dirt Died: May 1, 1980</TE>
<TE>   When the Marines assigned Becker to the AV-8A, his wife felt some
trepidation.</TE>
<TE>   "We had heard there were accidents and different things
that tended to go wrong with the plane," said Catherine Waid Keating.
"There was definitely a sense of a safety issue."</TE>
<TE>   The crash that took his life was one of the most spectacular in
Harrier history: During a vertical takeoff at Cherry Point, his plane
rolled, dropped to the runway, bounced into a ditch, burst into
flames, flipped, slid through a hangar and into a parking lot, where
it damaged 20 vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines never determined the cause of the crash, though an
engineering analysis found no evidence of mechanical failure.</TE>
<TE>   Becker, 25, was a graduate of James Madison University. His widow
remembers him as "a fun-loving guy" who danced and hunted.</TE>

<TE>   Call Sign: Ranger Died: Jan. 19, 1981</TE>
<TE>   With 24 years of service, including many missions in
Vietnam, Ditto, 44, was among the Marines' most experienced pilots and a
member of the Golden Eagles, an elite group of naval aviators.</TE>
<TE>   Though he had flown 4,900 hours, only 13.7 were in the Harrier.
He'd been named commanding officer of an air group at Cherry Point
that included Harriers and wanted to know how to fly all aircraft in
his charge. He called it "a bear of an airplane," said his widow,
Susan Page.</TE>
<TE>   Before the crash, Ditto began having dreams -- premonitions, Page
thinks -- about flying without an airplane. The day of the crash, she
saw him fly past their house not long before a chaplain knocked on
the door.</TE>
<TE>   Ditto had ejected too late from his AV-8A after losing control
while practicing a vertical takeoff. The investigation concluded he
stayed with the plane too long trying to save it, citing his "limited
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Ditto had been married 13 years to Page, a former Miss Texas whom
he met at an air show.</TE>
<TE>   He left a daughter and a son who recently won his wings as a
Marine F/A-18 pilot.</TE>

<TE>   MAJ. THOMAS W. TYLER</TE>
<TE>   Died: June 26, 1981</TE>
<TE>   Family members had been invited on board the amphibious assault
ship Tarawa for a cruise, and Tyler's fiancee was watching as he did
a demonstration flyby in his AV-8A. He was supposed to make several
passes by the ship from stern to bow. But after the first pass, he
changed direction, heading bow to stern. After narrowly missing the
ship, the plane hit the water.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators concluded the "primary cause of the accident was
pilot error," noting that the presence of his fiancee "may have
altered Maj. Tyler's previous conscientious flying attitude." Their
report also faulted shipboard personnel for not warning Tyler sooner
that he had strayed from his flight plan.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and flew helicopters
in Vietnam. But his real love was the Harrier. "He just loved to fly
that plane," said John L. Tyler, his father.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Tyler, 33, was divorced and had a daughter, who was 7 at
the time he was killed.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. JEFFREY C.</TE>
<TE>   FISHBAUGH</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Bones Died: Dec. 3, 1981</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Fishbaugh left for a monthlong training exercise in
California, a surprise arrived at the family's home in Cherry Point.</TE>
<TE>   He had arranged to have flowers delivered weekly during his
absence. There was a bouquet for his wife and a nosegay for his
4-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "She carried that little nosegay around until it fell apart and
the next one came," said his widow, Alexis Fishbaugh Rainey. "That's
one of her last memories of him."</TE>
<TE>   He died one day before the exercises were to end when his AV-8A
Harrier crashed in the desert during a practice bombing run near
Twentynine Palms.</TE>
<TE>   He was 27. Besides his wife and daughter, he left a 6-month-old
son.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation report did not cite a cause, but noted that
Fishbaugh had previously complained that the radar altimeter was
inoperative. The recovered barometric altimeter read 2,500 feet --
200 feet lower than the impact site, noted the investigator, 1st Lt.
Robert G. Wilson Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was originally scheduled to fly the day Fishbaugh was
killed. But when the planned sortie was replaced at the last minute
with a more advanced maneuver, an instructor decided Wilson was too
inexperienced. Fishbaugh agreed to take his place. Wilson died in a
Harrier crash three months later.</TE>

<TE>   1st LT. CHARLES E. SIMPSON</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Chester Died: Jan. 26, 1982</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was just 10 minutes into a training flight at Yuma, Ariz.,
when he noticed a fuel tank problem that caused a dangerous weight
imbalance in his aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   With ground crews declaring an emergency, Simpson brought the
plane in but rolled left and crashed just as he was about to touch
down. At final approach, he had 2,800 pounds of fuel on the left side
and 1,200 pounds on the right.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation found Simpson's AV-8A had experienced fuel tank
problems twice previously. Mechanics did repairs on the plane the
first time but took no action the second. Investigators concluded the
crash was caused by a known mechanical problem that was not fixed by
maintenance crews. But they also blamed Simpson for failing to take
the right steps to safely land the plane.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a World War II fighter pilot, Simpson learned to fly as
a teenager and studied airport management in college. He flew A-4s
until the Marines assigned him to the Harrier in 1980, said his
mother, Marva Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in awe of the Harrier," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was promoted to captain posthumously. He was 27.</TE>

<TE>   1st. LT. ROBERT G.</TE>
<TE>   WILSON JR.</TE>
<TE>   Died: March 5, 1982</TE>
<TE>   After a Harrier crashed in Nevada, Wilson called his mother to
assure her he was not the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Robbie, why do you fly that damnable airplane?' "
recalled his mother, Ann Bandgren. "And he said: 'Mother, it's not a
damnable aircraft. It's a wonderful aircraft and I love it. I'm right
with God, and I'm doing what I want to do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's own AV-8A crashed on March 4, 1982, while he was
attempting to land from a hover during a training exercise at Cherry
Point.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bandgren, he was dropping onto a small metal pad
surrounded by trees. The plane drifted left. When he tried to correct
it, he became enveloped in debris kicked up by the nozzles. The plane
rolled and Wilson ejected, but into the ground. He survived for about
15 hours. A letter Bandgren received from the squadron commander
said, "The final cause was undetermined, with most probable cause as
pilot error."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, 25, was the oldest of three brothers, a graduate of
the U.S. Naval Academy and had been married less than six weeks when he
was killed.</TE>

<TE>   Call Sign: Grover Died: Sept. 24, 1982</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, 26, was a devout Christian utterly devoted to the Marine
Corps, said his wife, Rosemarie Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed that it was a calling almost," she said.</TE>
<TE>   He picked the Harrier when he left flight school, she said, even
though he considered it "a squirrelly plane" that "took a really
delicate touch" to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly believed in the aircraft's mission of providing close air
support to ground troops. And he was supremely confident in his
ability to handle it, she said. "He was not intimidated by anything."</TE>
<TE>   His AV-8A Harrier crashed into the North Sea near Germany shortly
after he took off from a ship during a training exercise. Navy
officials said they cannot find the investigative reports on the
incident. But his widow said she was told that his Harrier went down
after encountering wind shear.</TE>
<TE>   They had been married three years. "He said he thought he had the
best job of anyone in the world," she said.</TE>

<TE>   1st LT. WILLIAM M. SQUIRE</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Jackal Died: Dec. 1, 1982</TE>
<TE>   Squire was the inquisitive son, the fifth of seven siblings,
who was always in motion. He raised pheasants, repaired cuckoo clocks,
and picked and canned 52 quarts of cherries to surprise his parents
one year.</TE>
<TE>   Although his father, an inventor, could comfortably send him to
college, Squire insisted on paying his own way. He enlisted in the
Marine Corps ROTC and graduated from Pennsylvania State University in
1979 with an officer's commission and an engineering degree.</TE>
<TE>   His AV-8A crashed during a practice bombing run at the
Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma. Squire had just completed his fifth
bombing pass when the aircraft went into a fatal dive, said his
father, Edward Squire.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident is not known. Squire was 25.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. PAUL L. SPARGO JR.</TE>
<TE>   Died: April 27, 1983</TE>
<TE>   A jammed control stick downed Spargo's two-seat training plane.
The TAV-8A had crashed previously and been rebuilt. Before Spargo's
crash, a pilot had reported a jammed control stick, but mechanics
couldn't find a cause and recertified it for flight.</TE>
<TE>   The stick stuck again on Spargo during vertical takeoff
from Cherry Point. Spargo's student, Dwight Motz, ejected safely but
Spargo was seconds too late. He hit the ground, breaking his neck.
The investigation found that a spare part, a metal hose adapter, had
been left beneath the cockpit floorboard and had caused the stick to
jam.</TE>
<TE>   A Connecticut native, Spargo, 30, had been in the Marines for 10
years, flying Harriers virtually the whole time.</TE>
<TE>   His widow, Ann Spargo, said he was a well-balanced man who was
bright, thoughtful, funny and sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   Motz described him as a meticulous, hard-working pilot who had a
gentle touch with those he was training. "He always had a positive
side to a negative event," Motz said.</TE>

<TE>   1st LT. DONALD R. FLATLIE</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Flatbush Died: April 25, 1985</TE>
<TE>   Flatlie was practicing dogfighting maneuvers with another
plane when he banked his AV-8A too severely. The plane failed to recover
from its turn, hit the ground and exploded.</TE>
<TE>   He had personality conflicts with some squadron members, including
the other pilot, according to his widow, Lori Leatherbee. But
investigators said those conflicts did not affect his job
performance. The investigation cited "pilot error in judgment" as the
cause of the crash at the Naval Air Station in Fallon, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Flatlie, 29, was "a Marine first and a pilot second," Leatherbee
said. "It was in his blood. He was pretty loyal to the grunts, which
is why he was set on flying an aircraft that would work with the men
on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   A native of small-town North Dakota, Flatlie graduated from North
Dakota State University. Leatherbee described him as a meticulous
Marine who took pride in staying in shape and keeping his shoes
shined. "His closet was organized short sleeves to long sleeves,
everything in order, because of his Marine training," she said.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. DANIEL P. CAMPBELL</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Indian Died: Aug. 12, 1987</TE>
<TE>   Campbell died of a broken neck when his seat unexpectedly ejected
during a training flight over Pamlico County, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Steven J. Chetneky, a Marine flight surgeon in the other seat
of the TAV-8A training plane, also died in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators blamed the accident on a small, undetected fracture
in the acrylic canopy that gave way under the pressure of flight. The
canopy shattered, triggering the ejection seat. Investigators
recommended that maintenance workers begin inspecting TAV-8A canopies
weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell was born in Cahokia, Ill., to an Ogallala Sioux
mother and Air Force veteran father. He attended Parks College of
Aeronautics in Cahokia, then enlisted in the Marines. He and his
wife, Nancy Campbell Jobin, had two sons, ages 7 and 9 at the time of
the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "I know wholeheartedly that if Dan had known on Aug. 12, 1987,
what was going to happen, he wouldn't have changed a single thing
that he did," she said. "He was dedicated to his country and to the
Marine Corps and that in itself gives me some comfort."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell was 33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LT. STEPHEN J. CHETNEKY</TE>
<TE>   Died: Aug. 12, 1987</TE>
<TE>   He was the flight surgeon catching a ride in the rear seat of the
TAV-8A Harrier training plane piloted by Capt. Campbell. As the
aircraft plummeted, Chetneky ejected too late, and his seat hit the
ground before his parachute could open.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-seven years earlier, when Chetneky was 7 months old, his
father was killed in the crash of his F-86 Sabre Jet at the end of a
routine flight in California.</TE>
<TE>   Chetneky's mother, Irene, remembered her son as a compassionate
child who brought home stray animals that inevitably became family
pets. "We had dogs, birds, fish, turtles, rabbits," she said.</TE>
<TE>   He attended college and medical school in New Jersey then joined
the Navy. Like other flight surgeons, who perform a variety of
medical duties in their squadrons, he occasionally took back-seat
training flights to become accustomed to the plane.</TE>

<TE>   SCRIVENOR IV</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Skivvies Died: March 1, 1988</TE>
<TE>   Scrivenor had a photographic memory and was constantly
studying the Harrier training manual, said his widow, Sharman Scrivenor.
That's why family members found the circumstances surrounding his
death so befuddling.</TE>
<TE>   He died while flying his AV-8B during an air-to-air combat
training run that caused violent G-forces to snap his spinal cord in
two places. His plane crashed in the Neuse River near Cherry Point.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation concluded that Scrivenor, 28, had been flying too
fast and may have improperly switched off the roll-stabilization
system. Even so, the report made a point of commending him as an
"aggressive and knowledgeable" pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Sharman Scrivenor remains convinced the plane malfunctioned. She
said her husband had not wanted to fly the Harrier because of its
safety record. But once assigned to it, he devoted himself to
learning how to fly it well, she said.</TE>
<TE>   He was a perfectionist by nature, who made himself good at
anything he tried, she said, whether cabinetmaking, landscaping,
tennis or trick water skiing. He grew up in Columbia, S.C., and
graduated from Virginia Tech, where he and Sharman met. They had been
married for five years.</TE>

<TE>   Call Sign: Toad Died: July 13, 1988</TE>
<TE>   The flaps malfunctioned on Dale's AV-8B Harrier seconds after
takeoff from Cherry Point. As he lost control, the plane tore through
a tree line, hit the ground and exploded.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation concluded that an electrical short caused the
flaps to fail. But the report also blamed Dale for not landing the
crippled plane safely, and noted that he waited too long to eject.</TE>
<TE>   Dale's father, Jim P. Dale, said his son was tired that morning
because he and his wife, Tami, had been up much of the night with
their sick 4-month-old baby.</TE>
<TE>   But the elder Dale resents the finding of pilot error.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was just an extremely complex dadgum aircraft with
extremely complex avionics in it," the father said.</TE>
<TE>   Dale, 26, was president of the senior class at his Texas high
school and an all-star football player, family members said. He
attended Baylor University, where he studied business before joining
the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we'd talk and say goodbye, the last thing I'd say was,
'Kerry, fly safe,' " his father said. "And he'd say, 'I will, Pop.' "</TE>

<TE>   RICHARDS JR.</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Bullet Died: May 3, 1989</TE>
<TE>   Richards apparently didn't set his AV-8B's nozzles properly during
a short takeoff and lost control during the complicated maneuver. He
tried to eject but the plane was in the process of flipping.</TE>
<TE>   The lead investigator found that Richards made mistakes because he
was "task overloaded" and feeling rushed by his recent transfer from
a training squadron to his new flight squadron.</TE>
<TE>   But the commanding general of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing later
rejected that finding and called Richards, who had flown only 77.9
hours in the Harrier, "a competent, though inexperienced pilot." The
crash was attributed to pilot error.</TE>
<TE>   Richards, 26, grew up in Charleston, S.C., the son of a physician,
and attended the University of Virginia. His parents remain bitter
about the assignment of pilot error, saying their son was pushed into
attempting a maneuver he was not prepared to perform. "They've got to
protect the instrument," said his father, James T. Richards, "because
other people are going to be using it."</TE>

<TE>   Anderson was a native of Clemson, S.C., and a graduate of the
Citadel, which he attended on a Marine Corps scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an all-conference, all-state wrestler," said Richard
Anderson, his brother. "You looked at him and you just thought he was
invincible."</TE>
<TE>   He died while on a training flight from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa
to Osan Air Base in South Korea. His AV-8B Harrier fell from 35,800
feet, sliced through a cloud bank and disappeared into the water.
Neither the plane nor the body of Anderson, 25, was ever found.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident remains unknown. Investigators guessed
that Anderson lost consciousness, perhaps from a depressurized
cockpit. He may have missed danger signs because he had become "task
saturated" while flying the plane, their report speculated.</TE>

<TE>   "Magnum, you're on fire! Eject, eject, eject!"</TE>
<TE>   1st Lt. Ricardo L. Fresquez radioed those frantic instructions to
Kolb while flying in formation with him near Twentynine Palms. Smoke
was pouring from the hot nozzles of Kolb's AV-8B. Seconds later, Kolb
ejected and his Harrier crashed into a mountainside. He was found
dead on the ground with a broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   The accident investigation found a compressor blade broke, which
caused a fuel leak that ignited. The report was not conclusive about
Kolb's death but suggested the ejection seat malfunctioned. An
internal report found evidence that some of the lanyards that
stabilize the seat had deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew of the problems previous to my brother's dying," said
Kolb's sister, Linda Stovall. "Why did it have to come to the point
of so many young men dying?"</TE>
<TE>   Kolb enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1988, two years after
graduating from San Diego State University. He finished first in his
flight class and chose to fly the Harrier because he wanted to
support Marines on the ground, said his father, Leonard Kolb.</TE>

<TE>   At 37, Wheeler was an experienced Marine pilot and flight
instructor with 1,759 hours of flying time, the vast majority of them
in the Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   He died of brain and heart injuries after ejecting from his AV-8B
during a low-altitude training flight over a dense North Carolina
forest. He hit the trees before his parachute opened.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation could not determine the cause of the crash,
though it found that "human factors must be considered."</TE>
<TE>   Another pilot and a witness on the ground reported seeing flames
coming from the plane shortly before it crashed. But investigators
found no physical evidence of fire before impact and concluded that
the witnesses may simply have seen the detonation that launches the
ejection seat from the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler, father of three, had been in the Marine Corps for 15
years.</TE>

<TE>   Rivera made 29 landings aboard his squadron's ship in the three
weeks before his crash. But on the night he died, while conducting a
training mission during the Persian Gulf War, he smashed into the
Omani coastline while approaching the deck of the amphibious assault
ship Nassau for a landing, according to a Marine investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The cause could not be determined. Investigators initially
speculated Rivera may have become disoriented by a false horizon or
that his vision may have been obscured by condensation on the AV-8B's
canopy. But senior officers dismissed those explanations as
guesswork.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a career Marine, Rivera grew up in public housing in
the South Bronx as the oldest of four children. He was a champion
racquetball and handball player who aspired to become an astronaut.</TE>
<TE>   After his death at the age of 31, a school, a housing project, a
street and a park in the Bronx were named for him. He left his estate

upside down. His parachute broke away before he reached the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation determined that a problem with the
ailerons caused the crash but offered no explanation for the parachute
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Driscoll, 26, who graduated from Villanova on a Navy ROTC
scholarship, never seemed intimidated by the Harrier, said his
father, John Driscoll. "His mind-set was that he would not do
anything that would jeopardize himself."</TE>
<TE>   His son showed an interest in flight at an early age. He liked to

Airport to videotape the departure of his AV-8B.</TE>
<TE>   As his plane sped down the runway, the engine lost power, forcing
him to abort. He stuck with the plane long enough to steer it into a

<TE>   Van Sickle and another pilot were simulating bombing runs in the
desert in Kuwait when his AV-8B crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation found no evidence of mechanical failures and
concluded that, "in the absence of any external factors as the cause,
the probable cause of the mishap was pilot error." Investigators said
problems with the plane's infrared navigation aid, which had been
noted three months earlier, could have been a contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   The middle of three children in a Midwestern family, Van
Sickle was a high school tennis star who inherited his interest in flying
from his father, Robert Van Sickle, who piloted his own Cessna 172.</TE>
<TE>   Van Sickle told others that the Harrier was a risky plane flown by
highly skilled Marines. "He felt that most of the pilots he knew were
very competent," Robert Van Sickle said. "They were just faced with a

<TE>   Call Sign: Booger Died: Sept. 18, 1995</TE>
<TE>   Begehr was flying his AV-8B in formation during a night training
run in North Carolina when his plane clipped another Harrier and
crashed into the Neuse River.</TE>
<TE>   The other Harrier made it safely back to Cherry Point. It took 12
days to locate Begehr's body and the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine report attributed the crash to a momentary distraction.
"Operating within the demanding environment of flying a close parade
formation position, at night, left very little room for error," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Begehr's parents, German immigrants, said he loved flying.
"He said to me one time, 'You know, Mom, I can't believe they're paying
me for it,' " said his mother, Lore Begehr of Danville, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of San Jose State University, Begehr had been married
three years. He was 28.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. RONALD C.</TE>
<TE>   WALKERWICZ</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Wiggy Died: Feb. 16, 1996</TE>
<TE>   Walkerwicz was one of four Harrier pilots involved in the daring
rescue of a downed Air Force pilot, Capt. Scott O'Grady, in Bosnia in
1995. The Harriers provided cover for the helicopter that plucked
O'Grady from hostile territory.</TE>
<TE>   Walkerwicz , 30, a Marine for eight years, had been obsessed with
the Harrier ever since studying its use by the British in the
Falkland Islands War, said his father, William Walkerwicz. He said
his son "knew they were flying the most unforgiving aircraft in our
arsenal."</TE>
<TE>   His AV-8B crashed after apparently being struck by lightning
shortly after takeoff from Cherry Point in foggy and windy
conditions. The lightning set fire to one wing, then part of the wing
broke off. He never ejected from his plane.</TE>
<TE>   Walkerwicz, who grew up in New York state, died two months before
he was to be married.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. DALE W. MULKEY</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Pops Died: Oct. 7, 1996</TE>
<TE>   Mulkey was blown out of the sky when three bombs, all with expired
fuses, detonated prematurely aboard his AV-8B as he flew a training
mission over California's Chocolate Mountains. One fellow pilot
compared the descending plane to a meteorite.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators initially blamed Mulkey for flying too slow at too
steep an angle when he tried to release the bombs. Higher-ranking
officials rejected that finding and harshly criticized the ordnance
handlers who had loaded the bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is it never should have happened and I don't want it
to ever happen to another family," said Judith Long, Mulkey's mother.
"I'm just disgusted with the military for the way it was handled, and
I hope they corrected the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Mulkey, 32, was born in Pueblo, Colo. He was a diligent student,
won varsity letters in track and football, and spent his summers as a
lifeguard and swimming instructor at a local park.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife, Katherine, at Colorado State University in Fort
Collins. Their daughters were 5 and 4 at the time of his death.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LT. COL. PETER E. YOUNT</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Gator Died: April 22, 1998</TE>
<TE>   Yount ejected after his engine failed during a training flight
over the Imperial Valley. He was killed when his seat rotated out of
position and his parachute harness straps snapped against his helmet,
breaking his neck.</TE>
<TE>   He was 42, a venerated Marine pilot who was about to become a
squadron commander. He had two daughters, 4 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation concluded that an "incorrectly installed"
fastener on the gas turbine starter led to the engine flameout that
crippled Yount's AV-8B, and the ejection killed him. The crash led to
changes in the ejection system.</TE>
<TE>   Yount graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in
nuclear engineering. "He told me once, 'When I'm in the plane, you
don't have to worry because I'm in control of what's going on,' "
said his widow, Janet Yount.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete Yount was one of those rare guys who was very, very smart,
very outgoing and a great pilot," said retired Lt. Gen. Fred
McCorkle, chief of Marine aviation at the time. "Here was a guy who
did every single thing correctly and still the airplane ended up
letting him down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COL. KEVIN E. LEFFLER</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Snatcher Died: Aug. 30, 1999</TE>
<TE>   Three years before Leffler's death, the Marines discovered that a
wrong-sized washer had been installed in some Harrier engines. The
error caused two nonfatal crashes.</TE>
<TE>   The Naval Air Systems Command ordered a partial inspection of the
Harrier fleet for the problem part. The engine in Leffler's AV-8B was
never checked. Investigators say the washer caused Leffler's plane to
lose power over Death Valley National Park, forcing him to eject into
high winds. He landed hard in rocky terrain and died of a head
injury.</TE>
<TE>   A highly experienced pilot with nearly 3,000 hours of flight time,
Leffler, 49, was nine months from retirement. He was commanding
officer of the Marine Aviation Detachment at the Naval Air Warfare
Center at China Lake, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   He had survived a midair collision of A-4s in 1979, and Kathy
Leffler had lived since then with the foreboding that her husband was
flying on borrowed time. He left two sons, one of whom has followed
him into the Marine Corps.</TE>

<TE>   MAJ. TODD S. DENSON</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Cuddles Died: Feb. 3, 2001</TE>
<TE>   Denson, 32, son of an Army chaplain, grew up in an era when young
men were lured into military aviation by the movie "Top Gun." He
enlisted after graduating from the University of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to fly the F/A-18, which he considered a safer
plane, said his widow, Melissa Denson Rankin, but he quickly became a
Harrier enthusiast after being assigned to the AV-8B. He had some
close calls in the Harrier before his fatal accident.</TE>
<TE>   He had been flying the Harrier for a decade and had been an
instructor for two years, yet he kept emergency procedures written on
flash cards and studied them constantly, Rankin said. "He knew it was
a dangerous plane and he took it very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   He died when he and his student, Capt. Jason K. Meiners, lost
control of the two-seat training Harrier they were flying to their
base at Cherry Point. Denson, in the rear seat, ejected too close to
the ground. Meiners also was killed. It was unclear which pilot had
control.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAPT. JASON K. MEINERS</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Coal Died: Feb. 3, 2001</TE>
<TE>   Meiners' and Denson's TAV-8B training plane was landing at Cherry
Point when the nose of the plane dipped. They couldn't correct it in
time, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Meiners' body was found in the wreckage, still strapped to his
ejection seat. His body could not be removed immediately because of
the risk that detonation devices still attached to his seat might
explode. The wreckage was shielded from the rain with a tarp and
protected by an honor guard until a special team arrived the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   His wife was three months' pregnant at the time. "Their little
girl is inquisitive and outgoing, just like her father," said Carol
Meiners, the pilot's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Meiners, 27, was so determined to fly that he reapplied to the
U.S. Naval Academy after being rejected the first time. He finished
in the top 10% of his class and joined the Marines. "He liked the
camaraderie of the group," Carol Meiners said, "how they stood up for
each other and how they never left a man behind."</TE>

<TE>   WILBOURN III</TE>
<TE>   Call sign: L.Z. Died: Feb. 23, 1991</TE>
<TE>   Wilbourn's AV-8B Harrier was shot down over central Kuwait during
a night attack in Operation Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   He had been flying missions since the first day of the Gulf War,
when he attacked Iraqi rocket launchers and artillery positions,
according to news accounts.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Huntsville, Ala., and the son of a Navy veteran,
Wilbourn received a degree in aviation management from Auburn
University in 1984 and then joined the Marines, earning his wings in
1987. He first flew the A-6 Intruder, switching to the Harrier in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbourn kept a photograph of Army Gen. George S. Patton on his
bedroom wall at home. As a high school football player, he would
motivate himself before games in the locker room by playing a tape of
the theme music from the movie "Patton."</TE>
<TE>   While in the Persian Gulf, Wilbourn regularly wrote to his parents
and his sister back home. He often signed the letters: "Love, Trey,
pilot, patriot and defender of freedom."</TE>
<TE>   He was 28.</TE>

<TE>   CAPT. REGINALD C.</TE>
<TE>   UNDERWOOD</TE>
<TE>   Call Sign: Woody Died: Feb. 27, 1991</TE>
<TE>   Underwood died on the final day of the Persian Gulf War when his
AV-8B was hit by a heat-seeking Iraqi surface-to-air missile. He left
a 5-month-old daughter he had never met.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he would fly even if he was not paid for it," said his
widow, Donda Hill Rhodes. "It was his passion. The Harrier was a
challenge and you could not fly it unless you were at the top of your
class."</TE>
<TE>   Underwood grew up in Lexington, Ky., and had flown since he was a
teenager. He graduated from the University of Kentucky and then
joined the Marine Corps. His squadron went to war and he flew nine
combat missions before his final one.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, he was flying in formation with three other planes
after taking off from the amphibious assault ship Nassau. The
mission's target was a convoy of military vehicles traveling north
toward Basra. The pilots decided to fly beneath cloud cover at about
8,000 feet to get a clear view, making their Harriers easier targets.</TE>
<TE>   When the missile hit,  the commanding officer of Underwood's
squadron was flying 1,000 feet away. In retrospect, says Lt. Col.
Jerry W. Fitzgerald, it was a mistake to be flying so low. The plane
crashed in a huge fireball. Underwood's body was later found in the
wreckage of the plane just inside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Underwood was 33.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Are Focusing on Floyd and McGriff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The Angels and Dodgers accomplished their goals before leaving the
winter meetings Monday, laying groundwork for trades and free-agent
signings that could be completed this week.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have a short to-do list after winning the World Series,
but General Manager Bill Stoneman, who is considering moves to
acquire outfield depth, identified "some possibilities out there"
during four days of talks.</LD>
<LD>   "You never know where the next deal will come from," Stoneman
said. "It could only be a phone call away."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers were busier because of their run-production problems,
focusing on trades for a consistent hitter and narrowing the pool of
free agents they plan to pursue. Outfielder Cliff Floyd and first
baseman Fred McGriff are high on the Dodgers' free-agent list,
baseball officials said, but General Manager Dan Evans said he "won't
make any decisions until we identify the right guy, and we're not
there yet."</TE>
<TE>   Free agents who have been offered arbitration, such as Floyd, have
until Thursday to accept. Teams have until Friday to offer players
contracts or they become free agents, so the Dodgers could soon have
additional intriguing possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We did exactly what we wanted to do. We found out from a majority
of the teams exactly where they stand," Evans said. "We said all
along we weren't coming here to make a trade. We were coming here to
get answers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a few teams we need to get a little better feel
for where things are, there are a few [trade] possibilities I want to
[flesh] out, but what we've done here in four days is achieve what we
wanted to achieve."</TE>
<TE>   The next phase of the plan figures to be more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have about $4.5 million to spend on a hitter and
left-handed reliever, and Evans is attempting to clear more payroll
space by trading starter Andy Ashby, officials said. The right-hander
has been mentioned in several proposals, including a deal for Texas
Ranger outfielder Juan Gonzalez that failed to materialize because
Gonzalez wouldn't waive his no-trade clause.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff, among the major leagues' top run producers the last 15
seasons, has expressed interest in the Dodgers, and the club would
not lose draft picks as compensation for signing him. Moreover, he
would fit easily into the Dodgers' salary structure on a one-year
deal, allaying their luxury-tax concerns if they can't find a taker
for Ashby in a budget-conscious market and allowing franchise player
Shawn Green to stay in right field instead of moving to first base.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, 30, has also shown plenty of interest in the Dodgers and he
has even more upside than the 39-year-old McGriff. Floyd played for
Manager Jim Tracy in the Montreal Expos' farm system and officials
believe he would sign with the club for less than the three-year,
$24-million contract he rejected from Boston because of their
handling of his situation.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox hope Floyd, who had a salary of $6.5 million in 2002,
does not accept arbitration because he could receive more than $10
million, a hit on their payroll that might stop them from making
additional moves. The Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees and New
York Mets are believed to have some interest in Floyd, but not to the
level of the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Evans and Kim Ng, the Dodgers' assistant general manager, met with
Floyd's agent, Seth Levinson, for almost three hours early Monday
morning, though Evans said financial parameters of a contract were
not discussed. There are hurdles to completing a deal, but Levinson
believes they can be cleared and Evans hasn't ruled out anything.</TE>
<TE>   General managers who had trade discussions with the Dodgers said
most of the club's roster is available, but the asking price for
third baseman Adrian Beltre is too high. The Chicago Cubs have
pursued a deal for the arbitration-eligible Beltre, but the Dodgers
have told clubs they plan to retain him for at least another season
unless they are overwhelmed by an offer.</TE>
<TE>   Evans plans to have lunch today in Chicago with catcher Todd
Hundley, reacquired Dec. 3 from the Cubs for first baseman Eric
Karros and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing is, Todd and I talked and we just thought it was
a real good situation where we could get together and spend some
quality time," said Evans, who is attending to personal matters in
Chicago. "We're reaching out to him because we want him to know we're
really happy to have him and he's a good fit for us.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to catch up a little bit. I've heard some good things
about him and his teammates have expressed some real positive things.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for he and I to get to know each other a little
bit before the first day of spring training."</TE>

<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig will issue an edict next month requiring
batboys to be at least 14 years old. That comes in response to the
near-accident at home plate in the World Series involving Darren
Baker, 3-year-old son of former San Francisco Giant manager Dusty
Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "The minimum age for bat boys will be either 14 or 16 years old,"
Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president for baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, said. "The commissioner will make that
ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Selig will announce his decision at the owners meetings in
Scottsdale, Ariz., on Jan 15-16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers acquired left-hander Derek Thompson, a Rule 5 draft
selection, from the Cubs for $50,000 in addition to the $50,000 fee
to draft him. The Dodgers lost right-hander Luke Prokopec and
outfielder Shane Victorino. The Cubs selected Thompson, 21, from the
Cleveland Indians with the fifth pick of the major league phase of
the draft. He went 5-7 with a 3.65 earned-run average for the
Indians' Class-A affiliates last season. The Dodgers must keep
Thompson on the active roster for 90 days or offer him back to the
Indians for $25,000.</TE>

<LD>The NBA legalized zone defenses, or at least a variation of them,
before last season. League coaches, reluctant at first to drop their
players into a zone, have embraced the strategy this season.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it seems hardly a game passes without one or both teams
spending a good chunk of time in a zone, challenging opponents to
beat them from the perimeter. Heck, even Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley
has played a zone this season, a first in his 21-year coaching
career.</LD>
<LD>   "I just think people don't like playing zone," said Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry, who has nevertheless adopted a 1-2-2 zone on those
occasions he opts for something other than a man-to-man defense. "I
don't think you can have a steady diet of it, where you try to play
35 or 40 minutes of it. Dallas probably does the best job of it.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been in a situation where it's like a floating man-to-man.
You don't see a lot of pure zone."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers often switch from man-to-man to zone and back during
a quarter, banking that the changes will confuse the opposition once
it figures it has solved one or the other.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The best estimate the Clipper medical staff could put on small
forward Corey Maggette's return from arthroscopic knee surgery is
early January, according to trainer Jasen Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette had damaged cartilage removed from his right knee Nov. 29
and the timetable for his return was at least one month. He has not
been cleared to practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played Monday without shooting guard Eric Piatkowski,
who sat out his third game because of a lower abdominal strain. His
status for Wednesday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers is
uncertain.</TE>

the standings?</LD>
<TE>   Sunday, vs. Phoenix, 5 p.m., Channel 9 -- The Coyotes average 18
minutes in penalties per game. Isn't that the sort of brutal style
that Wayne Gretzky used to complain about?</TE>

<HD>Bowl Season Gets Started Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At midseason, the prospects for a bowl game looked bleak for North
Texas and Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   But North Texas won its last six games to defend its Sun Belt
Conference title. Cincinnati, meanwhile, won five of its last six to
tie Texas Christian for first place in Conference USA.</LD>
<LD>   The Mean Green (7-5) and the Bearcats (7-6) play tonight in the
New Orleans Bowl, the first of 28 bowl games to be played in an
18-day span.</LD>
<TE>   Although their records aren't impressive, the participants view
the game as a meeting between two conference champions who got on a
roll when they had to.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that elevates the status of our game -- maybe in
our own minds -- but the fans who come to the game will know they're
seeing two champions play," Cincinnati Coach Rick Minter said.</TE>
<TE>   Minter said he's happy to be in New Orleans but wonders whether
his Bearcats, who beat TCU, should have replaced the Horned Frogs
(9-2) in the Liberty Bowl -- a game that traditionally features the
Conference USA champion.</TE>
<TE>   "In our case, we got penalized for taking on stronger
non-conference opponents" such as Ohio State, West Virginia and
Hawaii, Minter said.</TE>
<TE>   North Texas also won the Sun Belt last year, which gave it an
automatic berth to the first New Orleans Bowl. But because North
Texas had lost all of its non-conference games and was 5-1 in the
conference, the Mean Green came in at 5-6, the only losing team to
get a bowl bid. North Texas then lost, 45-20, to Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really big for us. We want to let them know that we can
compete with other conferences," said North Texas defensive lineman
Brandon Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police are looking for two suspects in the shooting death of North
Carolina defensive lineman Carl Smalls, who was killed at a
fraternity party at Columbia, S.C., on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Smalls, 22, was shot three times at a private club the fraternity
had rented for the party. Jeroid Price, 20, and Ryan Brooks, 19, both
of Columbia, were charged with murder, the Richland County Sheriff's
Department said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Price and Brooks were identified as suspects based on witness
accounts, police said. No motive for the shooting has been
established.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami of Ohio defensive coordinator Jon Wauford pleaded not guilty
to a misdemeanor battery charge that he knocked down a Marshall fan
after a game. Wauford did not appear in the Huntington, W.Va., court.
Magistrate Patty Spence said it would be a few weeks before a trial
date is set.</TE>

<LD>Edmonton at Colorado, Thursday, 6 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The streaking Oilers will get a chance to keep their run going
against an opponent that has been hit with injuries lately. Forward
Anson Carter leads Edmonton in scoring, but the key to the Oilers'
recent success has been the play of goaltender Tommy Salo. The
Avalanche has the worst penalty-killing unit in the league;
defenseman Rob Blake is struggling with a minus-4 plus/minus rating.</LD>

<HD>Simmons Given Clearance, Will Make Lynwood Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kameca Simmons, who played last season for Southern Section Division
I-AA runner-up Long Beach Poly and transferred before the end of the
school year to Division I-AA and state champion Lynwood, was granted
a hardship waiver last week by Southern Section Commissioner Jim
Staunton.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second time that Simmons has used a hardship waiver to
transfer. The first occurred during her freshman year, which allowed
her to transfer from Compton Dominguez to Poly without a change of
address. That transfer was for academic reasons, according to Melvin
Simmons, Kameca's father.</LD>
<LD>   He also said the second transfer was because of academics, and
told The Times this year it was not a basketball-related issue.</LD>
<TE>   A Southern Section spokesman said "her parents split, and under
the hardship criteria, that qualifies as unavoidable, unforeseeable
and uncorrectable. She went to live with one of her parents."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons' brothers, junior Marlin, and sophomore twins Marcel and
Marcello, play football for Long Beach Poly, which was ranked No. 1
in the Southland during the regular season, but her brothers did not
transfer to Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Without Simmons in the lineup, Lynwood won the Lone Star Classic
in San Antonio behind most valuable player Sade Wiley-Gatewood and
all-tournament players Lorie Rayford and Sade Cunningham. Lynwood's
five victories in San Antonio included a 58-55 defeat of Forestville
(Md.) Bishop McNamara, which was ranked No. 2 in the country --
behind Lynwood -- by Student Sports Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously going to give us a bonus," Coach Ellis Barfield
said. "[Simmons is] going to fit into the rotation pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons should make her debut for Lynwood (5-0) this week, when it
plays Wednesday through Sunday at the Nike Tournament of Champions in
Phoenix, an event the Knights won last season.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood has a 38-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though freshmen such as Latara Darrett from Chino Hills Ayala and
Morghan Medlock from Harbor City Narbonne get most of the notice,
Bridgette Reyes scored all six of her points to help Irvine
Woodbridge close out a 50-47 upset of Redondo. Playing in her second
varsity game, Reyes' three-pointer gave Woodbridge a 47-44 lead, and
her three free throws with three seconds remaining broke another tie.
A week earlier, she played with the junior varsity.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Eric Bangs, whose teams have won state championships:
"I don't think we've had many wins better than this in 16 years."</TE>
<TE>   Said Reyes, a guard: "This is what I came to play for."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a scheduling quirk, Burbank Burroughs played Crescenta Valley
in back-to-back games.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley got a three-point basket from Jenine Deno with 14
seconds left to give her team the lead in a 59-55 upset in the
championship game of its own tournament. Burroughs, in that game,
played without two starters and had three of its nine players foul
out.</TE>
<TE>   "With our [aggressive] style, when you're down to nine healthy
bodies, you have to play differently," said Coach Doug Nicol. "When
we have everybody, I'm not too worried."</TE>
<TE>   Four nights later in a nonleague game, Burroughs beat the Falcons,
47-43.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A nonleague game Monday between Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and host
Beverly Hills was halted by mutual agreement after 2 minutes 10
seconds because of rain-related safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Droplets of rain were falling onto the floor through open windows
in the gym's roof. Maintenance workers were called to try to close
the windows, forcing the game's start to be delayed by about 35
minutes, Notre Dame Coach Jason Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   When Beverly Hills Principal Ben Bushman was alerted to the
situation, he said "if there were any drops at all, we would have to
cancel the game," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   A game is scheduled between Beverly Hills and Pasadena today in
the same gym.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jessie Thompson, who led Temecula Valley last season with a 16.7
scoring average, could be out for the rest of the season. She
suffered a torn meniscus in October, but didn't get a correct
diagnosis until last week. She's out until at least Feb. 1....Hart
may be without Brandi Kimble, who transferred to Lynwood, but the
Indians are getting 20 points a game from sophomore Ashlee Trebilcock
and are off to a 5-1 start, including a split of two games with
Palmdale. "I like this team," Coach Dave Munroe said. "We have seven
seniors and really good team chemistry."</TE>

<HD>Budget Crisis Ominous for Sports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with another state budget crisis, those who believe strongly in
the importance of high school sports had better be prepared for more
grueling battles like those fought in the early 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone is gearing up for the mother of all debates: What should
be done to reduce a state budget deficit estimated between $21
billion and $30 billion?</LD>
<LD>   The last time the state faced such a crisis was 1991-92, when
there was a $14-billion deficit. It was ugly, with colleges and high
schools forced to cut athletic programs.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach State dropped football, swimming and tennis. UC Irvine
got rid of baseball. Moorpark College discontinued men's tennis and
men's golf.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District dropped junior varsity
football and cut back practice games for varsity baseball and
basketball. The Anaheim Union High School District cut JV football,
sophomore basketball and freshman baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Beach Union High School District trimmed coaching
stipends for sophomore football, frosh-soph baseball and boys' and
girls' swimming assistants. The Los Alamitos Unified School District
cut assistant coaching stipends for football, swimming, cross-country
and wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Unified School District eliminated water polo,
soccer, swimming and golf.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how bad it could be this time, considering the deficit is,
perhaps, double what it was 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "From everything we hear, this is worse," said Chuck Eklund,
director of secondary education for the Thousand Oaks-based Conejo
Valley Unified School District. "I think everything is on the table,
and I don't think it's a phony threat. These are going to be
difficult times."</TE>
<TE>   School district superintendents across the state have been meeting
to exchange ideas and scenarios. No one knows how deep the cuts will
be to education until the state legislature acts. But cuts, indeed,
are coming and they will, undoubtedly, include sports programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how massive [the cuts] will be," said Marie Ishida,
executive director of the California Interscholastic Federation.
"[What programs are trimmed] will be up to each school district."</TE>
<TE>   Ishida said non-varsity sports could take the biggest hit, with
districts potentially saving millions by cutting coaching stipends
and bus transportation.</TE>
<TE>   But cutting sports programs comes with a price, of which school
board members must be wary. It's the quickest way to attract negative
media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, when Cal State Northridge cut four men's sports teams
because of budget and gender-equity concerns, community uproar forced
an immediate retreat. Within two years, the school's president, her
second in command and the athletic director had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   There are no easy choices facing school boards. Do you cut nurses
or coaches? Do you cut janitors or security guards? Do you cut
Advanced Placement classes or the marching band?</TE>
<TE>   There are many who don't want to see any programs cut, but
increasing taxes or participation fees is not a popular alternative.</TE>
<TE>   The City Section receives $80,000 from the LAUSD to help pay for
its sports teams to play championship events at such facilities as
the Coliseum, the Forum and Dodger Stadium. That money may disappear,
forcing the section to rely on corporate generosity that rarely comes
through.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows how we're going to try to save money, but I think
everyone is going to be looking at trying to maximize revenues or
cutting expenses," Ishida said.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches have become, of necessity, adept at raising money.</TE>
<TE>   They have players selling Christmas trees and candy bars. They
hold car washes, bowl-a-thons, walk-a-thons and golf tournaments, all
designed to help pay for equipment, uniforms and travel expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Those funds may have to be diverted for coaching and referee
stipends.</TE>
<TE>   Some sports teams were resurrected or saved in the 1990s because
of fund-raising efforts. But those came about only after emotional,
gut-wrenching public confrontations between coaches, students,
parents and school board members that nobody wants to repeat.</TE>
<TE>   Those involved with high school sports programs are willing to
join in the sacrifice needed to survive these difficult economic
times, but they won't stand for school board members using the threat
of cutbacks to influence other agendas, such as imploring Sacramento
politicians to raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Voters know when elected representatives are playing games, and
they won't accept their children's athletic or extracurricular
programs being held hostage.</TE>

<HD>McAlpine, Corvo Bolster Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defensemen Aaron Miller and Lubomir Visnovsky are sidelined because
of injuries, but the Kings have not had much of a drop-off at the
blue line, thanks to the recent play of Chris McAlpine and Joe Corvo.</LD>
<LD>   McAlpine, who signed with the Kings as a free agent last summer,
doesn't provide much offense but has been steady on the defensive end
in the 16 games he has played.</LD>
<LD>   "He's played very well in the absence of the other guys," Coach
Andy Murray said of McAlpine, who played in 268 NHL games with New
Jersey, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Atlanta and Chicago before joining the
Kings. "We knew that Chris had played in the league and had that
experience. We knew what he was capable of."</LD>
<TE>   That wasn't the case with Corvo, a rookie who played in his first
two NHL games against Pittsburgh and Phoenix over the weekend. Corvo
played 26 games for Manchester and was the top scoring defenseman in
the American Hockey League before being recalled Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on his training camp ... we weren't quite sure how he would
do," Murray said about Corvo, drafted 83rd overall by the Kings in
1997. "He's played very well in his first two games, but now it has
to be an every-night challenge for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like he believes in himself a lot more on the ice right
now. With Joe, it's all about his belief system."</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky, out since late November because of a back injury, is
close to returning, so Murray will have decide which defenseman to
sit down if Visnovsky plays tonight against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Jason Allison, who returned to the lineup last week, a
month earlier than expected, after a knee injury, has been an
inspiration to his teammates, according to Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been playing courageously," Murray said. "He's still not
able to do all of the things that he was able to do before; there's
no question about that. But he's still averaging about two points a
game."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just sated at the company Christmas party and through a cool rain,
the Lakers left Monday afternoon for the stretch of games that could
change everything, from the way they play to the makeup of their
roster.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson has promised to wait through the holidays
before considering changes, and General Manager Mitch Kupchak has
chosen to evaluate his underachieving team only after it became
whole.</LD>
<LD>   It is mid-December, Shaquille O'Neal, Samaki Walker and Devean
George are healthy again, and by the time they've all been through
Minnesota, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Toronto, Los Angeles (vs.
Sacramento) and Denver over the next six games, the new year will be
only days away.</LD>
<TE>   By Christmas night, they could be .500 and gaining on their dismal
start to the regular season. Or, Kupchak could be on the telephone,
hunting for a shooter or a power forward or both.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams aren't going to lay down for us," Derek Fisher said.
"They're tired of what we've been doing the last three years. So,
it's gotten tougher every year."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes before Sunday's game against Orlando, which would
become a 23-point victory, Robert Horry gathered his teammates and,
in the theme of the season, told them there was nothing left to lose.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we have no [trade] value," Horry said, "so let's go
out here and have some fun."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly Rockne.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like by New Year's we're going to know, pretty much, and
barring injuries, what this team is capable of," said Jackson, who
told the players he hoped to win at least two of the next four.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three of the Lakers' worst losses have come in the first game of
trips -- by 19 in Cleveland, 26 in Dallas and 12 in Miami. That would
seem to make tonight's game against the Timberwolves the most
critical of the coming four, but Jackson thought Thursday's game at
New Jersey was essential.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the Lakers swept the Nets in the NBA Finals,
so they should know how to play them, and it is the first in a
back-to-back series; they play the 76ers on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 1-4 in the first games of back-to-backs, 0-5 in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 22nd in the league in shooting the three-pointer
and 29th in defending it, having made 19 fewer than they have
allowed, 57 points they couldn't afford to give away.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sunday afternoon, the Lakers shooting 30% or worse from the
arc included Kobe Bryant (29.0%), Rick Fox (28.1%), Devean George
(24.1%), Tracy Murray (30.0%) and Kareem Rush (16.7%).</TE>
<TE>   The rookie Rush made 42.2% of his three-pointers in three years at
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the arc, Rush is shooting 44.4%, better than the team's
42.7%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Minnesota, 5 (6 p.m., Ch. 9)</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Target Center</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC-AM (570), KWKW-AM (1330)</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 10-15, Timberwolves 13-11.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Timberwolves -- 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Timberwolves beat the Lakers, 110-107, Dec. 1 in Los
Angeles. O'Neal had 31 points and 13 rebounds. Bryant missed a late
free throw -- after making the first two -- that would have tied the
score. The Timberwolves have won three of their last four games
against the Lakers after winning three of the previous 23. Guard
Wally Szczerbiak (sprained toe) has been on the injured list since

<HD>Francis Delivers Again for Rockets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the game on the line, the Houston Rockets put the ball in the
hands of their Mr. Clutch. Once again, Steve Francis didn't
disappoint.</LD>
<LD>   Francis forced overtime with a buzzer-beating three-point basket
for the second time in less than a week, then came up with a key
loose ball to help the Rockets defeat the Heat, 105-100, Monday night
at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Francis, who scored 21 points, sent the game into overtime by
making a 25-footer to tie the game at 91. The shot was similar to the
one Francis sank at the end of regulation Friday against Memphis in a
114-109 overtime loss.</LD>
<TE>   With five seconds left, Francis ran around a pick set by center
Yao Ming and launched a shot over Brian Grant just before the buzzer
sounded. The ball swished through.</TE>
<TE>   "We run that play a lot at the end of the game," Francis said. "We
knew Miami is known for being a tough defensive team. It's a tough
play. Brian Grant was right there. He might have nipped my hand, but
I had enough elevation."</TE>
<TE>   With the Rockets leading, 101-100, Miami's Eddie Jones lost
possession with the clock winding down, and Francis came up with the
ball. Eddie Griffin made a pair of free throws with nine seconds left
and Yao added a pair to help the Rockets snap a two-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Cuttino Mobley scored 27 points for the Rockets, and Yao had 15
points and 12 rebounds. Jones scored 32 points for the Heat,
including 17 in the fourth quarter as Miami rallied from a 14-point
deficit. Jones also added 10 rebounds, seven assists and six steals.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew exactly what they were going to run at the end," Jones
said. "We saw it about four or five times on tape. Brian was all over
him, and [Francis] hit a tough shot. You have to give him credit for
that."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 94, Boston 83 -- Donyell Marshall had 20 points and 13
rebounds, including a key three-pointer late in the fourth quarter,
as the Bulls held off the Celtics at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose led the Bulls with 24 points, and Marcus Fizer had a
big night off the bench, scoring 20 and tying his career high with 17
rebounds. It was the fourth victory in five games for the Bulls, who
didn't get their eighth victory last season until mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce had 37 points and 15 rebounds on a night in which the
Celtics shot only 33% and were outrebounded, 58-46.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 87, Orlando 84 -- Penny Hardaway fell two assists shy of a
triple-double at Phoenix as the Suns won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic was without Tracy McGrady (bruised back) and Mike Miller
(strep throat).</TE>
<TE>   Playing his former team, Hardaway had 16 points, 10 rebounds and
eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   All five Sun starters scored in double figures with Shawn Marion
leading the way with 19 points. Pat Garrity scored a season-high 21
points for Orlando, but only six in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 111, Cleveland 98 -- Gary Payton moved into ninth place on
the career assist list, adding nine more to his total in the
SuperSonics' victory at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Payton, in his 13th season, surpassed Terry Porter on the list.
Payton has 7,164 assists and is averaging a league-leading 9.5 this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Rashard Lewis led Seattle with 29 points. Ricky Davis had 20
points for Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 93, Denver 71 -- Allen Iverson had 23 points at
Philadelphia as the 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak, sending
the Nuggets to their fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Denver scored only 22 points in the first half for the second time
this season. Rookie Nene Hilario scored a career-high 23 points for
the Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 104, Golden State 91 -- After missing his first eight
shots, Wesley Person scored 11 of his 13 points in the fourth quarter
at Memphis, Tenn., as the Grizzlies won for the fifth time in six
games. Gordan Giricek and Pau Gasol led six Grizzlies in double
figures with 18 points each.</TE>

<HD>Irregular Heartbeat Sidelines Harrington</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit Lion rookie quarterback Joey Harrington will sit out the rest
of the season because of an irregular heartbeat.</LD>
<LD>   Harrington, the No. 3 overall draft pick out of Oregon, left
Sunday's game against Tampa Bay because of the heart problem and was
taken to the hospital for tests and observation.</LD>
<LD>   He was expected to stay in the hospital until Monday evening.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors said Harrington's heartbeat returned to a normal rhythm
before he was hospitalized. Lion Coach Marty Mornhinweg said the
ailment is not career-threatening. Detroit (3-11) has two games left
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were Week 5, we would expect him to return, but there is
no way that he will be back within two weeks," Mornhinweg said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NFL rushing leader Priest Holmes has a right hip injury and
probably will not play against San Diego this Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes was injured in the third quarter of the Chiefs' 31-24 loss
at Denver on Sunday. He was scheduled to undergo an MRI exam Monday,
and the results will not be known until today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Stephen Davis' season might be over -- along with his
career with the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Davis separated his right shoulder Sunday against the Philadelphia
Eagles and had the injury re-examined Monday. He is out for this
Sunday's game against Houston and might not play in the season finale
against Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   If the Redskins release Davis in the off-season to save salary-cap
space, as expected, the 15-yard run in which he was injured will
stand as Davis' last carry in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland defensive end Courtney Brown will have knee surgery
Thursday and might be out for the season. Coach Butch Davis said that
Brown appears to have cartilage damage in his left knee and will
undergo surgery to determine the extent of the damage.... The
Philadelphia Eagles signed 41-year-old punter Lee Johnson to replace
Jason Baker, who averaged 33.4 yards on seven punts against the
Redskins last Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Perreault's Late Goal Rescues Canadiens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montreal Canadiens salvaged a victory and denied division rival
Ottawa a valuable Eastern Conference point.</LD>
<LD>   Yanic Perreault scored with 17 seconds left for the Canadiens, who
gave up two third-period power-play goals before defeating the
Senators, 3-2, Monday night at Ottawa.</LD>
<LD>   Montreal, which won for the fourth time in five games, also got a
goal from Doug Gilmour, who became the 14th player to reach 1,400
career points.</LD>
<TE>   "The standings are so close right now, and sometimes you win two
or three games and you're in fifth or sixth position, and you lose
two or three and you're back in ninth or 10th position," Canadien
defenseman Patrice Brisebois said.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa is second in the Northeast Division with 38 points, four
ahead of third-place Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 1, Toronto 0 -- Brad Tapper, recalled from the minors,
scored in his first game this season, Pasi Nurminen got the first
shutout of his career and the host Thrashers ended a six-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 2, San Jose 1 -- Mike Dunham, acquired from
Nashville on Thursday, made 25 saves in his debut with the host
Rangers and Petr Nedved scored 2:15 into overtime to help New York
end a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Colorado 2 -- Goaltender Olaf Kolzig came off the
injured list to make 35 saves, and the visiting Capitals salvaged a
tie at Denver. It was Colorado's 14th overtime game this season and
NHL-leading ninth tie.</TE>

<LD>It was one play among hundreds in a forgettable loss to Minnesota
last week, but it summed up the rocky aspects of Curtis Joseph's
adjustment to the Detroit Red Wings and their adjustment to the
goalie they anointed to fill the metaphorically large skates of
Dominik Hasek.</LD>
<LD>   The Wild had dumped the puck into the Detroit end within Joseph's
reach, no doubt aware he likes to leave his net to play it.
Defenseman Chris Chelios was a few feet away, perhaps expecting
Joseph to shovel it into the corner -- as Hasek liked to -- or make a
pass that would let Chelios move the puck out of the zone. Instead,
Joseph banked it off the boards. And when it hit a seam in the glass
and bounced into the slot, he and Chelios were caught out of position
for an easy Minnesota goal.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph hunched his shoulders and stared down at the ice as if the
answers lay somewhere beneath him. They don't.</LD>
<TE>   "In the locker room, it was a really simple transition," Detroit
Coach Dave Lewis said. "You go through phases of the season where we
play a different style of game than most teams. He wanted us to play
certain plays different than what we played with Dominik, and that's
just a little, subtle adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's still in the learning process. Look at the schedule.
We've played [30] games. I think familiarity comes later. You'd like
to think it would come rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   It's still evolving for Joseph, whose 2.60 goals-against average
and .905 save percentage are well behind the NHL leaders and those of
his replacement in Toronto, Ed Belfour (1.99, .929).</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings' depth, grit and smarts have fueled them during
Joseph's acclimatization, and they're 5-1-1 in their last seven, even
missing Steve Yzerman, Jiri Fischer and Pavel Datsyuk. But at some
point, they might need Joseph to steal some wins for them, and he
hasn't done that. Although he played in the Toronto media fishbowl,
he has never experienced a situation like the one in Detroit, where
anything less than a second straight Stanley Cup will be considered
failure -- and he's likely to be vilified if they don't win again.</TE>
<TE>   "But as an athlete, that's a good situation to be in," he said
last week in Detroit. "Sure, there's pressure, but coming from
Toronto, I felt pressure every night to perform. You have to be good
every night or you're going to be criticized. I would say I'm used to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph, 35, said he never considered a move until Hasek retired
and the Red Wings offered him a three-year, $24-million deal with an
option for a fourth season. The Maple Leafs "didn't really negotiate.
They just let me play it out," he said. "Leaving Toronto was very
emotional, being from that area and having friends and family
watching the games. It was quite a four years."</TE>
<TE>   Getting used to his new teammates' tendencies, he acknowledged,
hasn't been a breeze. Nor are they always sure how he will read a
two-on-one or react to various plays. Those are minor points,
certainly, but bumps that must be smoothed.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn as you go along," he said. "Sometimes, there are
mistakes made, whether you made a bad read or whatever. But you
actually learn from that....</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell when we lose, it doesn't sit well. That's the way
you want it to be."</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Shanahan, who once played with Joseph in St. Louis,
believes Joseph can handle the pressures of playing in Hockeytown.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who plays in this city knows what the expectations
are," Shanahan said. "And he's not in it alone. We had a great season
last year and we won, but it wasn't about Dominik last year and it's
not about Cujo this year. It's about the team. There's pressure on us
and there was pressure on Dom, but this is not a team that's built
around its goaltender. We're not asking him to save our butts every
night. We're trying to share it equally."</TE>
<TE>   Said forward Kris Draper: "Maybe early on he might have been a
little nervous and felt the pressure. But one thing about this team
is that there's a lot of quality-character people here. Right off the
bat, we welcomed him. The bottom line is to make him feel comfortable
and go out and win hockey games. The better he plays when he's
comfortable, the better chance we have to win."</TE>
<TE>   And the Red Wings might very well win it all with Joseph, although
the Dallas Stars, Vancouver Canucks, Blues and the persistent Wild
are making the Western Conference race a formidable test.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pressure he wants," Lewis said, "because the pressure is
worth the reward. The risk is worth the reward."</TE>
<TE>   Net Gains</TE>
<TE>   When the NHL ordered teams to install nets behind each goal, it
insisted it was not acting solely in response to the death of
Brittanie Cecil, the 13-year-old who died two days after being hit in
the head by a puck at a Columbus Blue Jacket game in March. But
Columbus General Manager Doug MacLean said he's reminded of her every
time he enters an NHL rink.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see it, I think that's how this little girl has been
honored," said MacLean, whose son was the same age as Cecil was when
she died. "You still get sick to your stomach thinking of it, but I
hope at least some good can come out of it."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's family hasn't sued the Blue Jackets. MacLean said the
club's legal counsel has had conversations with her family that have
"gone to the next level," but said he couldn't elaborate. Sources
said it's likely a settlement has been worked out or will be arranged
between her family and the Blue Jackets or the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Our plan is, when things are sorted out, we're going to do
something special" in remembrance, MacLean said.</TE>
<TE>   Words of Warning</TE>
<TE>   San Jose winger Teemu Selanne is pessimistic about avoiding a work
stoppage after the collective bargaining agreement expires Sept. 15,
2004.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is going to be war," he said. "I think the league is
trying to change so many things that we feel are important for us.
Everyone is expecting that there is no season. I think it's good for
the guys to get well-prepared right now. Whatever happens, we have to
fight for our rights and expect the worst. The worst is, there is no
season.</TE>
<TE>   "The last lockout [in 1994-95] was nasty, and it's going to be
nasty again. I think the players have prepared really well. They know
what this is all about. I know players who have started putting money
on the side."</TE>
<TE>   Dreaded Vote of Confidence</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky, the Phoenix Coyotes' managing partner, backed Coach
Bobby Francis when asked whether a change behind the bench might
transform the struggling team.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the coach of the year," Gretzky said. "To replace a guy of
that caliber would be just silly. That's the least of our problems
and the least of our worries."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but with two games left on a nine-game home stand, the
Coyotes are 2-4-1 and six points out of the final playoff spot in the
West. Factor in that Francis is among the few employees who haven't
been replaced since Gretzky became a major investor last year, and
his prospects don't look rosy.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   A roster freeze will begin at midnight Thursday and run through
midnight Dec. 27. The freeze is in respect to waivers, trades and
other player assignments. However, players can be recalled during
that time.</TE>
<TE>   Scotty Bowman rebuffed overtures to become the Calgary Flames'
coach. He has a good deal as a scout-advisor for the Red Wings and
doesn't need the day-to-day headaches of coaching. Ted Nolan
interviewed for the Flames' job last week and fans chanted his name
during Saturday's game, but management doesn't appear to be in a
hurry to hire someone and might keep interim Coach Al MacNeil
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Bombastic Canadian TV commentator Don Cherry recently made a good
point during his "Coach's Corner" segment of "Hockey Night in
Canada." If the Philadelphia Flyers could find white protective
netting that meets NHL safety standards and is less obtrusive than
the black nets behind the goal, why haven't other teams followed
suit? "Let's go over this again," Cherry said. "The ice is white. The
net is black." Once in a while, there's substance behind his bluster.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Rangers made the best of a bad situation by acquiring
Mike Dunham from the Nashville Predators. The Rangers were about to
ruin young goalie Dan Blackburn, who started 19 games after Mike
Richter was driven out of the lineup by concussion symptoms, and
Dunham is a fine alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Richter's career, diminished by injuries the last few seasons,
might be over because of this latest head injury, suffered more than
a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yzerman, still recovering from knee surgery, is skating with the
Red Wings but isn't ready for contact drills. There's no target date
for his return. "We weren't going to rush him, anyway, even if there
was a need to rush him," Lewis said. Yzerman's absence gives Swedish
rookie Henrik Zetterberg the chance to play center instead of the
wing, and he has been impressive.</TE>

leaving only U.S. and Swiss sailors in contention with defender Team
New Zealand for the America's Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Whoa! Take a closer look.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the U.S. sailors departed the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger
trials with Dennis Conner two weeks ago. Between Oracle BMW and
OneWorld, which are scheduled to start a knockout semifinal repechage
series Thursday (Friday in New Zealand), there aren't enough Yanks
left now to sail even one boat without dipping into the second
string.</LD>
<TE>   The America's Cup Deed of Gift was written by George L. Schuyler,
the sole surviving owner of the cup won by the schooner America in
England in 1851. In 1887 he donated it to the New York Yacht Club, in
his words, "upon the conditions that it shall be preserved as a
perpetual Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign
countries."</TE>
<TE>   "Friendly" didn't last long, and "foreign" got all mixed up.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle BMW is owned by software giant Larry Ellison and represents
San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club. But Oracle BMW had only six
Americans among its 16 crew members when it sailed its most recent
race Sunday, closing out a 4-0 blitz by Switzerland's Alinghi. They
were Peter Holmberg, a U.S. Virgin Islander who is now only the
part-time helmsman; bowman Geordie Shaver; pitman Matt Smith; and
grinders Phil Trinter, Brian McInnes and Eric Doyle. Smith, Trinter
and Doyle are Southern California residents. The skipper is Chris
Dickson of New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld, owned by two other billionaires, Craig McCaw (cell
phones) and Paul Allen (Microsoft), represents the Seattle YC.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld has had only two U.S. citizens aboard in its bid to
eliminate Italy's Prada: tactician Charlie McKee of Seattle and
navigator Kevin Hall of Ventura. The skipper is Cup veteran Peter
Gilmour, the helmsman 23-year-old James Spithill, both Australians.</TE>
<TE>   As for Alinghi, the only Swiss on the boat was its 37-year-old
billionaire owner, Ernesto Bertarelli (pharmaceuticals), who serves a
legitimate role as navigator. But Alinghi often sails with two
Americans: pitman Josh Belsky and grinder John Barnitt, who is a
throwback to Conner's triumphant team that won the prize from
Australia in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Even Prada had Rod Davis driving for the starts -- at least until
Monday when Gavin Brady, a New Zealander, took over that task. It was
academic. Although the Italians won by 17 minutes 46 seconds in very
light and wildly erratic breezes to make the score 3-2, OneWorld was
already the winner of the series because there was no time to run
more races.</TE>
<TE>   Throw all the Yanks together and they're still still five short of
a regulation red, white and blue crew. But between the two "American"
boats, there are 14 Kiwis, seven Australians, two Japanese and one
Italian.</TE>
<TE>   After Conner won in '87, President Reagan invited the team to the
White House. If OneWorld or Oracle BMW wins, the United Nations might
be more appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 46, has sailed nine America's Cups for four nations, but
not his own since '87. He was with New Zealand in '88 and '92,
Australia in '95 and Italy in 2000 and now. A resident of New Zealand
since '87, he has won Olympic medals for the U.S. and New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   And Davis, of all people, thinks the nationality thing has gotten
out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it should just be the first country you sail for," he said,
"unless if you want to change [countries] you can sit one out."</TE>
<TE>   John Cutler, an alternate tactician in the Oracle BMW afterguard,
is a New Zealander who has sailed the Cup for Japan and now the U.S.,
as well as his country.</TE>
<TE>   How can anyone do that? The America's Cup has a rule that all one
needs to do to sail for a given country is to establish residence
there two years in advance. "Residence" is rather loosely defined and
enforced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bogus," Cutler has said. "They should either make it a pure
nationalistic sport or eliminate the rule. I think if George Schuyler
saw what was happening now he'd agree."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that there aren't enough lucrative jobs for all the
top sailors. Cutler said: "I've been a professional sailor since 1990
and I've sailed on one boat that had NZL on its sail. It's a
professional sport we're doing now and you want to get the right
people onto the team."</TE>
<TE>   If it became purely nationalistic, Cutler said, "We would have to
find some other way to make a living."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The latest off-the-water issue to surface is a letter sent by Team
New Zealand rules advisor Russell Green to the Challenger of Record
Management. It points out that the America's Cup Protocol would seem
to prohibit challengers from switching boats between their semifinals
and finals. Article 6.2 reads:</TE>
<TE>   "The Finals of the challenge selection series will be between the
top two yachts in the Semi Finals."</TE>
<TE>   One reaction is that Team New Zealand is exploiting sloppy wording
to create a distraction among the challengers. By "yachts," the
creators of the Protocol probably meant yacht clubs or teams, not the
actual boats.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian striker Ronaldo was poised Monday to sweep all of
international soccer's top honors for 2002 after winning France
Football magazine's Golden Ball as European Footballer of the Year.</LD>
<LD>   The Real Madrid forward last week was named player of the year by
the English magazine World Soccer and is favored to be selected as
FIFA World Player of the Year ahead of France midfielder Zinedine
Zidane and Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.</LD>
<LD>   Ronaldo, 26, who also won in 1997, became only the eighth player
to win the prestigious award twice in its 47-year history. He
finished ahead of Real Madrid and Brazil teammate Roberto Carlos,
Kahn (Bayern Munich), Zidane (Real Madrid) and Michael Ballack
(Bayern Munich) as players from the two clubs dominated voting by 52
of Europe's leading soccer journalists.</LD>
<TE>   World Cup 2006</TE>
<TE>   The organizing committee for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, meeting in
Madrid, announced that the tournament's qualifying draw will take
place in Frankfurt, Germany, on Dec. 5, 2003, and that qualifying
play will begin on Feb. 28, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The latter date might be changed, depending on whether South
America is successful in persuading the committee to allow it to
begin its qualifying process in August 2003. That decision will be
made in March.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also gave formal approval to the 12 German cities
staging the 2006 tournament and said the final draw for the 32
qualified teams, including host Germany, will be held in Leipzig,
Germany, in December 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Germany Wins</TE>
<TE>   Germany closed out an eventful year in which it finished as an
unexpected runner-up to Brazil in the World Cup by defeating an
all-star team of foreign players from the Bundesliga, 4-2, Monday
night in front of 36,200 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Second-half substitute Benjamin Lauth, a 21-year-old forward from
TSV 1860 Munich, scored in the 68th and 90th minutes to lead a win
for Coach Rudi Voeller's squad in the charity game that raised $3.5
million in aid for victims of last summer's floods.</TE>
<TE>   Jens Jeremies and Miroslav Klose also scored for Germany.
Brazilian midfielder Marcelinho and Czech striker Jan Koller scored
for the Bundesliga team.</TE>
<TE>   Arena Agrees</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Soccer will announce today that Coach Bruce Arena, who led
the U.S. to the quarterfinals of Korea/Japan '02, has agreed to a new
contract that will run through the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Luciano Ban</TE>
<TE>   The penalty for Brazilian-born winger Luciano Siqueria, who in
September was handed a seven-month ban by the Italian league's
disciplinary committee after admitting that he had played under a
false identity and age for the last six years, was significantly
reduced Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Olympic Committee's chamber of conciliation and
arbitration in sport ruled that Luciano, 27, who plays for Chievo
Verona in Serie A, can return Jan. 26 after he agreed to pay a fine
of $100,000, which will be donated to relief efforts in the
earthquake-damaged town of San Giuliano di Puglia.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer has reached an agreement with Bayer Leverkusen
that will keep U.S. midfielder/forward Landon Donovan on loan with
the San Jose Earthquakes for two more years.... Columbus Crew and
former Poland national team midfielder Robert Warzycha, 39, announced
his retirement. Warzycha will become an assistant coach for the Crew
.... Former Kansas City Wizard and Scotland national team midfielder
Mo Johnston, 39, was named assistant coach of the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.... Former Trinidad and Tobago national team striker
Rolston James, 27, was shot and killed Monday in his apartment in
Aranguez, near Port-of-Spain, during what police theorized was a
robbery attempt gone bad.</TE>

<HD>Chargers Plan to Take It Slow</HD>
<DH>Team offers to wait before triggering escape clause in
lease, allowing San Diego officials to examine feasibility of a new
stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers said Monday they have met the financial
criteria required to activate the escape clause in their Qualcomm
Stadium lease, but they are offering to postpone the 60-day
triggering window in the interest of both sides.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Fabiani, the team's point man on new stadium issues, said the
Chargers are willing to delay the process for three months --
essentially calling a timeout on a triggering period that began Dec.
1 -- to allow the specially appointed task force to finish its
examination of the stadium situation. Upon approval of San Diego
Mayor Dick Murphy and the city council, the triggering period would
begin March 1.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to give the process in San Diego every possible chance to
succeed," Fabiani said. "We think by our actions we are proving that
we want to stay here. We don't ask people to believe what we say; we
ask people to look at what we do."</LD>
<TE>   Fabiani said the franchise is ready to open its books to city
officials who want to review the trigger calculations and the
supporting data.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy sent a memo to city council members Monday applauding the
decision by the Chargers and promising to put the issue on the
council docket in early January.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this is a positive action by the Chargers," Murphy said
in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   According to two NFL sources, Charger President Dean Spanos was
prepared to trigger the escape clause this week but reconsidered
after meeting Friday in New York with NFL executives. The
notification would activate a series of deadlines that could pave the
way to a new stadium in San Diego, or a relocation of the team after
the 2003 season, presumably to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the trigger is especially sensitive because San
Diego is preparing to play host to Super Bowl XXXVII on Jan. 26, and
the 8-6 Chargers are entering a do-or-die stretch in their push to
make the playoffs for the first time since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   By a 5-4 vote last week, the San Diego City Council rejected a
chance to approve private talks between Charger and city officials.
The council recommended passing along the matter to the task force,
which is scheduled to finish by mid-February at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers' relationship with the San Diego community has become
increasingly strained in recent years, in part because of a
controversial ticket guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The provision, agreed to in the afterglow of San Diego's only
Super Bowl appearance, promises the Chargers revenue equivalent to
60,000 general admission seats for every home game in the first 10
years of the lease.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last season, the city had spent $25.3 million on
unsold tickets since 1997, almost offsetting the $28.9 million in
rent collected during that span.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials have informed Murphy the Chargers are willing to do
away with the current lease and sign a two-year deal to stay where
they are. That would clear the way to put a new stadium and
development of the Qualcomm site on the November 2004 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The caveat to that deal, though, is the city cannot throw up any
legal roadblocks if the Chargers want to leave after the 2004 season.</TE>

<HD>Money Won't Stop Riley</HD>
<DH>After interviewing for UCLA coaching job, he says he
doesn't expect contract details to be a barrier. Officials to talk to
Dorrell today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA coaching search and shuttle service is fully operational.
Mike Riley has returned to New Orleans after an interview with campus
decision-makers Monday, and Karl Dorrell is on his way to Westwood
today.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, a New Orleans Saint assistant, did not talk about a
contract during a two-hour meeting with Chancellor Albert Carnesale,
Vice Chancellor Peter Blackman, Athletic Director Dan Guerrero and
Assistant Athletic Director Bob Field.</LD>
<LD>   However, he said nearly every other topic pertaining to Bruin
football was discussed.</LD>
<TE>   "Goals, discipline, recruiting, rivalries, facilities, we went
over everything except money," Riley said before boarding a flight to
New Orleans. "I don't think [contract details] would hold this up,
and I think they know that."</TE>
<TE>   If Riley takes a head coaching job, he forfeits $750,000 owed to
him by the San Diego Chargers for the last year of a five-year
contract he signed in 1999. He would not expect UCLA to compensate
for any part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already made more money in this profession than I ever
dreamed of making," he said. "I'm not worried about it."</TE>
<TE>   A contract is also the last thing on the mind of Dorrell, a Denver
Bronco assistant who will interview today and return to Colorado in
time for morning meetings Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The money would not be a problem," Dorrell said. "If you get an
opportunity to coach and do something with it, that is an area that
will take care of itself."</TE>
<TE>   A third candidate, Kansas City Chief assistant Greg Robinson, has
no plans to travel to Los Angeles today, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's decision could be made as soon as late today, although the
process is likely to continue into the latter part of the week,
sources said. Riley believes he will be informed of a decision over
the phone and will not be asked to return for another interview.</TE>
<TE>   The search, which began within hours of Bob Toledo's being fired
Dec. 9, has focused from the beginning on Riley and Dorrell, with
Robinson close behind. Guerrero and Field interviewed Riley in New
Orleans one week ago and interviewed Dorrell and Robinson on Saturday
in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Price of Washington State was contacted by UCLA on Friday but
a day later told his team he had no interest in the job.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, who is in his first year as athletic director, said
there is no timetable on a hire because UCLA must exercise due
diligence. Even if a new coach is announced this week, interim Coach
Ed Kezirian will lead the Bruins in the Las Vegas Bowl on Christmas
Day. "[A new coach] wouldn't know the assistants and wouldn't know
the kids," Guerrero said. "It wouldn't make much sense."</TE>
<TE>   Riley, 49, has had head coaching stints with the San Diego
Chargers from 1999-2001, Oregon State from 1997 to '98 and the
Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League from 1987 to
'90. He also was an assistant at USC from '93 to '96.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at an age where I want to settle in and stay somewhere a long
time," Riley said. "I told [UCLA] they'd have to tear the uniform off
me."</TE>
<TE>   Riley turned down a lucrative multiyear offer from Alabama, his
alma mater, Thursday and for the first time admitted that the lure of
UCLA played a role.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I wanted to give myself a chance to explore this
opportunity," he said. "I know myself. I've been to enough places.
I've coached all over, and I have a good idea where I want to be."</TE>
<TE>   Returning to college football is part of his plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the NFL, the guys I'm coaching in New Orleans are great,
but I miss coaching college kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, although reserved by nature, is expected to display every
bit as much enthusiasm in his interview. The former Bruin receiver is
in his second year with the Broncos after serving as offensive
coordinator at Colorado and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, 39, has no head coaching experience but enjoys the
support of a large group of alumni. One former UCLA player said that
by hiring Dorrell the athletic department would gain more than an
excellent up-and-coming coach: an immediate and substantial increase
in alumni donations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle C.J. Niusulu is expected to enter a plea to
reduced misdemeanor charges today in Barstow Superior Court. Niusulu,
a freshman, is charged with felony battery for allegedly punching a
ticket-taker at a Barstow drive-in theater in July.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Dupree to Learn His Status Soon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his judgment day fast approaching, USC junior Jerry Dupree's
teammates are holding out hope that the high-flying forward did well
enough on his finals to warrant his return to the Trojans.</LD>
<LD>   "We talk about it because we're excited to get him back," USC
captain Robert Hutchinson said. "He's a big impact player, very
versatile and plays a lot of positions. And we need somebody to come
off the bench to give us that lift sometimes."</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore center Rory O'Neil agreed.</LD>
<TE>   "We need him," O'Neil said. "We could use him, another big man in
there blocking shots, getting rebounds, athletic, running the floor.
If he comes back, that's absolutely awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7, 200-pound Dupree, who served a six-game suspension
handed down by Coach Henry Bibby to help him concentrate on
academics, said he needed above a 2.0 grade-point average in his fall
semester classes of journalism, dance and geography to pull him out
of academic probation. Dupree, who dropped a class and was not a
full-time student, cannot join the Trojans for practice until after
grades are posted, which might not be until after Christmas. That
puts his plan of dressing for Saturday's game against La Salle (3-3)
in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby was out of town Monday on a recruiting trip and could not be
reached for comment. But junior guard Desmon Farmer, Dupree's closest
friend on the team last year, said the Trojans have to be prepared
for any scenario.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what's going on with that situation," Farmer said.
"We've still got to play. If he comes back, 'Hurrah, we're glad
you're back.' But if he doesn't....</TE>
<TE>   "Disappointed? It hurt the team, but I'm not disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   X-rays of junior center Jonathan Oliver's sprained left ankle were
negative, as were X-rays of Hutchinson's sprained right ankle,
according to the players.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver, though, is awaiting the results of an MRI exam and does

[against Cal State Fullerton last Wednesday] and then this happens,"
said Oliver, who tweaked the ankle stepping on Titan center Pape

"Now I have to sit out of practice for a couple of days and I'm going
to get out of shape."</TE>

<HD>Palmer Steps Into Elite Club</HD>
<DH>Formal dinner, including 17 former Heisman winners, honors
USC quarterback in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>USC quarterback Carson Palmer joined an exclusive club by winning the
68th Heisman Trophy, and 17 members were among a crowd of more than
1,500 that honored him at a black-tie dinner Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Heisman winners spanning from 1951 winner Dick Kazmaier to 1999
winner Ron Dayne joined Palmer on the dais at the New York Hilton.
Mike Garrett and Charles White, who won the award as Trojan tailbacks
in 1965 and 1979, respectively, provided USC with the largest
contingent of winners in attendance.</LD>
<LD>   "It hadn't really sunk in yet, but to be up there with all those
guys, it finally felt like I was part of the fraternity, part of the
whole group," Palmer said.</LD>
<TE>   Before the dinner, Palmer stood by the famous statuette and posed
for hundreds of photographs with guests.</TE>
<TE>   USC President Steven Sample, Trojan Coach Pete Carroll, offensive
coordinator Norm Chow and quarterback coach Steve Sarkisian arrived
during the photo session. It was the first time the coaches had seen
Palmer since last Wednesday, when he left Los Angeles for Orlando,
Fla., for the start of what turned out to be a six-day postseason
awards trek.</TE>
<TE>   "How about that!" said Carroll, as he greeted Palmer with a hug.</TE>
<TE>   Chow also attended the event in 1990 when he helped Brigham Young
quarterback Ty Detmer win the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same kind of feeling," Chow said. "You're proud of the
kid and happy to see them have a moment like this."</TE>
<TE>   After tributes to the late Billy Vessels, who won the Heisman in
1952 at Oklahoma, and Earl Campbell, the 1977 winner at Texas, Palmer
was called to the podium amid a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-year senior delivered a smooth three-minute speech and
broke up the crowd with his observation from a social hour earlier in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting there and was kind of trying to put things in
perspective, and I realized, I'm just some punk college kid in a
rented tuxedo rubbing elbows with Archie Griffin and shaking Earl
Campbell's hands," Palmer said. "I don't know when it's going to wear
off, but I hope it never does because this is such a cool feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Palmer relaxed with his family during a post-dinner
reception and said he was looking forward to finally seeing his USC
teammates again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to get together with all the fellas in L.A. and
celebrate this," he said.</TE>

<HD>Northern State Lashed by Storm; Southland Hit Too</HD>
<DH>Two inches of rain fall in L.A. and flooding is severe
across California, closing part of I-5. Thousands lose power as wind
topples lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna and Stephen P. Pizzo</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A savage storm cast hundreds of thousands of homes into darkness in
Northern California on Monday and then barreled south, snarling
traffic on flooded streets, closing the Santa Ana Freeway in Los
Angeles and triggering a crash that killed two people in Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   More is on the way. Two ominous Pacific Ocean storms are expected
to wallop the state from one end to the other on Thursday, continuing
a battery of systems that are supposed to last through Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "It's one of the wettest patterns we've seen in several years. And
we're not out of it yet," said Bob Benjamin, a forecaster for the
National Weather Service.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in Los Angeles from 2 to 4 p.m., a
record for the day in downtown.</TE>
<TE>   But hardest hit was Northern California, where since late Thursday
a series of punishing weather systems has swept through the region
with torrential rains and wind gusts that topped 100 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The storms were blamed for the weekend death of a driver in
Calaveras County when a tree toppled into his vehicle, and of a man
in Stanislaus County who was electrocuted when he was struck by a
broken power line. On Sunday, a snowboarder trapped in a
storm-related avalanche near Lake Tahoe was found and pronounced
dead.</TE>
<TE>   More than 330,000 Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. customers from Eureka
to Bakersfield were without power, and numerous schools were closed.
Flood warnings were issued for both the Napa and Russian rivers, and
waves of 25 feet pounded North Coast beaches.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California's high desert, winds toppled four
transmission towers and more than two dozen power poles about 10:45
a.m., leaving 16,000 Southern California Edison customers without
electricity in parts of Lancaster, Palmdale, Acton and Quartz Hill.
About 2,200 customers were still without power late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The storm was blamed for more than 160 accidents in Los Angeles
County, the CHP said, and at least 80 in the Inland Empire. Those
included a 4:21 p.m. crash on the Pomona Freeway in Riverside when a
pickup truck veered across four lanes, struck a tour bus in the
carpool lane, then veered out of control and struck a car. The
drivers of the car and the truck died on impact, and 26 people in the
tour bus were injured, CHP Officer Jim Whitney said. Two lanes of the
westbound Riverside Freeway remained closed at 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon downpour also flooded the Santa Ana Freeway, which
was shut down in both directions in Commerce from 4 to 6 p.m.,
backing up traffic for miles.</TE>
<TE>   "There was too much rain in a short period of time with a lot of
concrete. The rain's got to go somewhere," said Bruce Rockwell, a
forecaster with the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   The storm also brought down high-voltage power lines in North
Hollywood, forcing the evacuation of scores of homes and businesses
along Vineland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters arriving at 2:45 p.m. found wires arcing and
transformers exploding. The 34,500-volt lines on the ground posed an
"extreme danger" of electrocution and prompted the precautionary
evacuations, although no one was injured, said Jim Wells of the Los
Angeles Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Just before dusk, reports that someone had fallen into the
rain-swollen Los Angeles River sent swift-water rescue teams into
position.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by helicopters equipped with heat-detecting cameras, rescue
crews scoured a 10-mile stretch of the river from Sherman Oaks to
Glendale, but called off the search when they found no sign of anyone
in the water.</TE>
<TE>   In Malibu, a chunk of boulder fell on Malibu Canyon Road, closing
it in both directions from 3 to 6 p.m. In Glendora, Big Dalton Canyon
was closed due to gushing mud. The Fire Department has offered
sandbags to canyon residents there in preparation for more storms.
And on Melrose Avenue in West Los Angeles, shopkeepers and restaurant
owners used plastic buckets and sandbags to stave off water that
surged through their entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Fierce winds also prompted authorities to close a section of the
Golden State Freeway on both sides of the Grapevine in the Tehachapi
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The wind caused a military satellite launch at Vandenberg Air
Force Base in Santa Barbara County to be postponed for at least a
day, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Santa Barbara's downtown tourist section also was smacked
by the storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown Santa Barbara took a fair hit, with water going into
some businesses and some streets becoming virtually impassable,"
county fire Capt. Charlie Johnson said. Fortunately, he said, the
water receded almost as quickly as it came in.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the rain caused the roof of an auto-parts store
in La Habra to collapse. There were no injuries. But the bigger
problem was storm-driven waves. Seal Beach officials warned residents
that despite the recent reinforcement of the sand berm protecting
oceanfront property, sandbags might be needed to hold back the sea.
Breakers were in the 8- to 10-foot range Monday, and were expected to
increase several more feet today when a 6-foot high tide is expected
at 7:09 a.m., Seal Beach officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For state water officials, the precipitation is good news. "We'd
like as much rain and snowpack as we can get, but of course not all
at once, because no one wants flooding," said Gary Bardini, chief
forecaster for the California Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the Northern Sierra Precipitation Index, which measures
snow and rain in key watersheds, is 125% above average. And the more
water that collects in the mountains now, the less likely the state
will suffer drought conditions next summer. "It's certainly good to
be ahead of the average," Bardini said, "but we've still got a lot of
year left."</TE>
<TE>   As of Monday morning, the storms had dropped nearly a foot of rain
on San Rafael in Marin County; 6.2 inches in downtown Oakland; and
5.8 inches in San Francisco, which set an 85-year record Friday for
most rainfall for the date, 2.9 inches.</TE>
<TE>   One 25-year-old Northern California woman was given a fright as a
50-foot oak tree crashed through her bedroom roof over the weekend,
missing her by only a few feet. But a San Francisco man wasn't so
lucky: His leg was broken when a section of scaffolding loosened by a
gust of wind struck him.</TE>
<TE>   In Sonoma County, where 30,000 homes remained without power
Monday, low-lying vineyards were turned into massive lakes with only
the tops of grape trellises showing, and many intersections were
without working traffic lights.</TE>
<TE>   At J's Amusement Park near Santa Rosa, which is closed for the
season, the scene was equally surreal. The blue water slides were
half submerged by a flood of muddy water from a nearby creek.</TE>
<TE>   Still, residents remained upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   At a Safeway store in Guerneville, a small, wooded resort town
along the Russian River in Sonoma County, a generator provided power
for cash registers and a handful of florescent lights. But managers
used yellow tape to cordon off the frozen food aisle like a crime
scene, moving all frozen and refrigerated foods to trucks parked
behind the store. At the meat counter, a butcher worked overtime to
cut to order, just like in the old days.</TE>
<TE>   It was much the same at the Guerneville post office, where
Postmaster Greg Pace has greeted customers wearing a miner's lamp for
light since the power went off Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like going back 25 years," he said. "Back in the early
1980s, all the post offices were hooked up to a central satellite
transaction system. But with the power off, we are now back to
licking stamps and weighing mail on these old scales we had stored
away in a closet."</TE>
<TE>   Pace said mail delivery has proceeded smoothly. "The only problem
we had was Saturday, when one of our carriers got trapped behind a
private electric gate when the power went off. We had to get someone
to come and free him."</TE>
<TE>   At Kragen Auto Parts in nearby Sebastopol, customers were allowed
into the darkened store one by one, served by three employees -- one
who took orders, another who fetched products from the shelves and a
third who wrote out receipts by hand, cash only.</TE>
<TE>   While most Guerneville businesses remained closed, Angelo Dieli
opened his River Inn as usual -- with a few storm-related changes:
Locals sat in booths lighted by kerosene lamps while Dieli prepared
breakfast over propane stoves in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, business actually picks up at times like this," the owner
said as he smartly cracked two eggs on the grill with the snap of his
wrist. "No one has power at home and they can't get to work, so they
come here."</TE>
<TE>   At the Green House restaurant in Sebastopol, owner Ray Kinley had
the same idea. Even though power remained out nearly all of Sunday
and into Monday, the kitchen was open and diners were asked to sit
near the windows and not in the darkened back room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a die-hard cook," Kinley explained. "You know how to do this
stuff in your sleep, so I can do it without lights."</TE>

will suffer drought conditions next summer. "It's certainly good to
be ahead of the average," Bardini said, "but we've still got a lot of
year left."</TE>
<TE>   As of Monday morning, the storms had dropped nearly a foot of rain
on San Rafael in Marin County; 6.2 inches in downtown Oakland; and
5.8 inches in San Francisco, which set an 85-year record Friday for
most rainfall for the date, 2.9 inches.</TE>
<TE>   One 25-year-old Northern California woman was given a fright as a
50-foot oak tree crashed through her bedroom roof over the weekend,
missing her by only a few feet. But a San Francisco man wasn't so
lucky: His leg was broken when he was struck by a section of
scaffolding loosened by a gust of wind struck him.</TE>
<TE>   In Sonoma County, where 30,000 homes remained without power
Monday, low-lying vineyards were turned into massive lakes with only
the tops of grape trellises showing, and many intersections were
without working traffic lights.</TE>
<TE>   At J's Amusement Park near Santa Rosa, which is closed for the
season, the scene was equally surreal. The blue water slides were
half submerged by a flood of muddy water from a nearby creek.</TE>
<TE>   Still, residents remained upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   At a Safeway store in Guerneville, a small, wooded resort town
along the Russian River in Sonoma County, a generator provided power
for cash registers and a handful of florescent lights. But managers
used yellow tape to cordon off the frozen food aisle like a crime
scene, moving all frozen and refrigerated foods to trucks parked
behind the store.</TE>
<TE>   It was much the same at the Guerneville post office, where
Postmaster Greg Pace has greeted customers wearing a miner's lamp for
light since the power went off Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like going back 25 years," he said. "Back in the early
1980s, all the post offices were hooked up to a central satellite
transaction system. But with the power off, we are now back to
licking stamps and weighing mail on these old scales we had stored
away in a closet."</TE>
<TE>   At Kragen Auto Parts in nearby Sebastopol, customers were allowed
into the darkened store one by one, served by three employees -- one
who took orders, another who fetched products from the shelves and a
third who wrote out receipts by hand, cash only.</TE>
<TE>   While most Guerneville businesses remained closed, Angelo Dieli
opened his River Inn as usual -- with a few storm-related changes:
Locals sat in booths lighted by kerosene lamps while Dieli prepared
breakfast over propane stoves in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, business actually picks up at times like this," Dieli
said. "No one has power at home and they can't get to work, so they
come here."</TE>
<TE>   At the Green House restaurant in Sebastopol, owner Ray Kinley had
the same idea. Even though power remained out into Monday, the
kitchen was open and diners were asked to sit near the windows and
not in the darkened back room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a die-hard cook," Kinley explained. "You know how to do this
stuff in your sleep, so I can do it without lights."</TE>
