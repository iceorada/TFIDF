<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We could thank Mr. and Mrs. Brooks for the Chevrolet Corvette.</LD>
<LD>   In 1949, Maj. Kenneth Brooks of Newport Beach wanted to give his
wife, Dottie, a special sports car. The retired Army Air Corps
officer hired boat builder Bill Tritt to craft a fiberglass roadster
body that could be fitted to a Jeep chassis the Brookses owned.</LD>
<LD>   In a one-car garage in Costa Mesa, Tritt created a striking
light-green two-seater reminiscent of the Jaguar XK120.</LD>
<TE>   Earl Ebers, a sales executive for U.S. Rubber, saw the car and in
it the potential to make his fiberglass-producing company loads of
money--if Detroit's automakers could be swayed to make car bodies out
of the glass-reinforced plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Ebers commissioned Tritt to make a second vehicle using the Brooks
mold, and in late 1951 Ebers had his car. A few months later, the
salesman showed the vehicle to General Motors Corp. styling guru
Harley Earl, who was so taken by what he saw that he arranged to have
it kept at a GM auditorium for detailed study.</TE>
<TE>   That was in the spring of '52, and a mere nine months later a
sports car debuted at the GM Motorama in New York. At 150 yards, the
fiberglass-bodied, two-seat Chevrolet Corvette could be mistaken for
the car Tritt created.</TE>
<TE>   It's been half a century since Maj. Brooks set things in motion,
and during those years, GM's Chevrolet division has rolled out 1.2
million 'Vettes, ranging from gutless wonders to street-legal cars
that are racing machines in disguise.</TE>
<TE>   The debutantes--the 1953 models--featured anemic motors with
two-speed transmissions hidden beneath classy polo-white exteriors.
Interiors were red vinyl and tops were black canvas and convertible.</TE>
<TE>   Today, because they started it all and because only about 200 of
them still are around (out of a class of 300), the '53s typically
fetch $125,000 to $190,000 at auction.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet had planned to put 10,000 'Vettes on the streets the
next year, but only 3,640 were made for 1954 because of meager
demand. The car's paltry six-cylinder engine, a carry-over from the
year before, and its hefty price--$2,774 for the base roadster, or
$959 more than the annual per-capita income in the U.S. back
then--helped curb demand.</TE>
<TE>   Chevy offered the Corvette with a three-speed manual transmission
in 1955 and in most '55s replaced the six-banger with a V-8 engine.
But third-year Corvettes otherwise varied little from their
predecessors. Only 700 of the cars were built, due to fears they
wouldn't sell. That low number makes them very expensive today.</TE>
<TE>   Chevy stylists redesigned the Corvette in 1956, giving the car a
lean, mean look befitting its made-over spirit: Under the hood lurked
a 265-cubic-inch engine producing 210 horsepower (240 horsepower with
performance options).</TE>
<TE>   No longer did anyone look on the 'Vette as a cute little car. 1956
also was the first year the Corvette was offered with a removable
hardtop.</TE>
<TE>   The '57 Corvette resembled its predecessor, but '57s are notable
for being the first with optional fuel injection and an optional
four-speed transmission. The engine now displaced 283 cubic inches,
with the stronger of two available motors producing 283 horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps taking cues from Cadillac, the Corvettes of 1958 traveled
down Gaudy Lane. The lithe, lean cars of '56 and '57 were followed by
a '58 chromium colossus brandishing quad headlights, 18 ludicrous
faux hood louvers and kitschy trunk spears. The '59s and '60s were
less gaudy, but all three model years packed excessive weight:
3,000-plus pounds with an empty tank.</TE>
<TE>   The 'Vettes of 1960-61 marked the end of the so-called classic
Corvettes--those with external trunks that permitted owners to lock
stuff out of sight and solid rear axles instead of independent rear
suspensions all later Corvettes carried. The '61 also was the last
Corvette to feature exposed headlights.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasts often speak of Corvettes in five groups: the C1s
(1953-62), the C2s (1963-67), the C3s (1968-82), the C4s (1984-96)
and the C5s (1997-present). The first year in each group was a year
an extensive redesign was introduced.</TE>
<TE>   A 1983 Corvette doesn't exist; Chevy was so late with its '83
offering that it designated as '84s all Corvettes built that year.</TE>
<TE>   Today, most C1s are collectibles commanding $25,000 on up, and all
but extensively modified C1s and C2s are horrible drivers. The cars
also are geared so low that their motors tach up high, letting out a
continuous, unwelcome moan starting at about 65 mph. "They're not
comfortable cars due to their harsh ride, difficulty getting in and
out of, lots of wind noise--and they aren't watertight," said Carlos
Vivas, owner of C&amp;S Corvette Restoration in Torrance. His personal
stable contains eight early 'Vettes.</TE>
<TE>   The C2s were better-built cars. Of the 21,513 made in 1963, just
less than half were coupes. Not only did 1963 mark the first year the
'Vette was available with a fixed roof, but that model year also is
famous for its rear window--two panels of glass separated by a
divider. The '63 was the only model to feature the split window.
Though generally regarded as a cool-looking feature--a split-window
'Vette can fetch up to 50% more than the single-window 1964 model
that is almost identical in other respects--the divider created a
blind spot that Chevy rectified the next year by replacing the window
panels with a single large piece of glass.</TE>
<TE>   A '63 in fair condition can be found for $20,000; an award-winning
restored model can cost 10 times as much.</TE>
<TE>   The 1965-67 Corvettes are among the most desirable, and those with
327-cubic-inch "small-block" engines actually make decent daily
drivers. That's because they get acceptable gas mileage and their
seats provide lumbar support (sorely lacking in earlier models). Many
'65-'67s pack optional power brakes, power windows, power steering
and air conditioning as well--all welcome conveniences for Southern
California commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Optional large-block engines included a 396-cubic-inch,
425-horsepower motor in 1965 and a monstrous 427, rated at 435
horsepower, in 1967. A mint small-block '65-'67 will set you back
about $45,000 for a coupe and $48,000 for a ragtop.</TE>
<TE>   Although the C3s ('68s through '82s) share a body shape, these
model years vary considerably in desirability.</TE>
<TE>   The '68s came under fire from auto writers for various quality
issues that always have influenced their resale value.</TE>
<TE>   The '69 'Vette packing the optional 427-cubic-inch ZL1 engine was
factory rated at 430 horsepower but actually puts out more than 500
horses.</TE>
<TE>   Corvettes from the 1970 and '71 model years, featuring 350-plus-
and 330-plus-horsepower engines, respectively, are highly desirable
(expect to pay $25,000 or more for a healthy specimen). These cars
sold new for $5,192 and $5,496 in the base model, and if you had an
extra $1,221 to burn back then, you could have bought a '71 'Vette
with 425 horsepower under the hood.</TE>
<TE>   The '72-'80 Corvettes are primarily daily drivers--few owners put
big bucks into restoring them--and are among the least sought-after
'Vettes.</TE>
<TE>   These cars make up the second batch of gutless wonders,
eviscerated by emissions regulations, bearing the Corvette nameplate.
Not one of the base engines during these eight years produced more
than 200 horsepower; the '75 'Vette harnessed a mere 165 ponies.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, though, as the 1970s-era Corvettes steadily lost power,
they gained popularity. By 1979, Chevy was selling every Corvette it
could make--53,807 of them that year, more than in any year before or
since. And not a single one of them was a convertible; ragtops had
been sent into exile in 1975 and weren't readmitted to the lineup
until 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980, '81 and '82 models also were produced in big numbers
despite a dearth of performance options; '82 Corvettes weren't even
available with a stick shift or an engine generating more than 190
horsepower. Chevy introduced a fairly good computer-controlled
fuel-injection system called "cross fire" on the '82 Corvette, but
the system disappeared after one year, and parts for it are tough to
come by.</TE>
<TE>   Ask 10 Chevy mechanics to comment on the Corvettes of the 1980s
and most will encourage prospective buyers to avoid the '84s. That
was the first year of a redesign, and '84 models contained many bugs,
including a horridly stiff suspension and, in those equipped with a
four-speed manual transmission, a troublesome powertrain computer. It
was meant to improve fuel economy but hampers acceleration, and
there's no way drivers can override the device.</TE>
<TE>   The annoying gearbox-computer combo haunts the 'Vette from '84
through '88, but prices for these cars are tempting; one in good
condition can be had for as little as $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The reputation of the C4s (1984-96) improves with the 1989 models,
thanks to the retirement of the troublesome gearbox in favor of a
German-supplied six-speed stick shift (most of the '89s were,
however, supplied with an automatic transmission).</TE>
<TE>   The next year saw the Corvette offered with a much-anticipated LT5
engine option that produced 375 horsepower, and for the 1993 model
year 'Vettes again entered the 400 club, with the LT5 upgraded to 405
horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   Many 'Vette experts, such as Michael Bensaid, owner of Corvette
Specialty of California in Riverside, view the late C4s as offering
the best value.</TE>
<TE>   "You can buy a '92 to '96 for less than $20,000," Bensaid said.
"It's a lot of car for the money. They are reliable, they are
comfortable and the fuel economy on them [about 22 miles per gallon]
is very good for a sports car with a [base] 300-horsepower engine."</TE>
<TE>   The C4s are notorious, though, for two features: a high door sill
that makes climbing in difficult for some, and narrow foot wells that
can make the cabin feel cramped, especially on a long drive.</TE>
<TE>   Chevy came out with an all-new Corvette in 1997, powered by an
aluminum 5.7-liter V-8 producing 345 horsepower and connected to
either a six-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. A
coupe with a one-piece lift-off top was the only body style offered
that year, but from '98 onward the 'Vette was available as a coupe or
a convertible.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-generation 'Vettes also reduced the side sill step-over
by 4 inches and widened the foot wells. At the same time, Chevy
engineers pushed the wheels toward the corners of the car and moved
the transmission to the rear, improving ride and handling.</TE>
<TE>   Of the C5s, the best value for the money is to be found in the '97
and '98 Corvettes. A good specimen can be had for less than $30,000
(versus $53,000-plus for a new 'Vette). Unfortunately, they aren't
holding resale value well because they are so new: C5s are
depreciating at 10% to 13% a year. That makes them a good buy for
shoppers but not so nice for those with one to sell.</TE>

<HD>New Designs Get Top Marks in Buyer Satisfaction Survey</HD>

<LD>Underscoring the importance of stand-out design in the automotive
market, buyers of three of the most striking vehicles introduced in
the last year have given their cars and trucks top scores in J.D.
Power &amp; Associates' annual APEAL study.</LD>
<LD>   The study measures new-car buyers' satisfaction with their
vehicles after 90 days of ownership. BMW's Mini Cooper, Ford's
Thunderbird roadster and Cadillac's Escalade EXT sport truck led a
field of more than 200 models reviewed by 117,800 respondents.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, the study--Automotive Performance, Execution and
Layout--found that 26 of the 31 all-new or extensively redesigned
vehicles launched in the last year led their respective segments.</LD>
<TE>   "Radical designs and concepts are paying off," said Brian Walters,
director of product research at Westlake Village-based J.D. Power.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers willing to take risks with design and performance
characteristics, he said, are being rewarded in the market.</TE>
<TE>   "These cars sell faster, fetch premium prices and need fewer
incentives," Walters said, adding that though car buyers typically
respond well to unique designs, "automakers have been loath in the
past to break away from the pack."</TE>
<TE>   The last two years have seen a renaissance of individualism in
auto design, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Lincoln brands ranked highest in five APEAL segments.
American Honda, General Motors and Toyota Motor Sales brands each
received three top segment rankings.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first time in the 7-year-old study, a South Korean car
led a category; the redesigned Hyundai Sonata received top ranking in
the entry-level mid-size segment.</TE>

<HD>Motorists Still Nonchalant About Head Restraints</HD>
<DH>With the statistics on the side of neck injuries in
accidents, the Insurance Institute is striving for better designs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The risk of a fatal traffic crash worries many motorists, but
statistics show that an accident is more likely to result in a
garden-variety whiplash--not fatal, but apt to cause pain for days,
even months.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government began requiring neck protection in 1969,
but after 33 years many motorists still are nonchalant about the
risks they face and the need for the best possible safety equipment
in their vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Neck injuries from rear-end collisions affect about 800,000
Americans every year and cost about $7 billion for medical attention,
rehabilitation and insurance claims.</LD>
<TE>   "Neck injuries are the single largest type of injury that we see
in our claims," said John Bindseil, medical claims manager at
Progressive Casualty Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those injuries could be prevented if motorists would pay
closer attention to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by Progressive, the nation's fourth-largest car
insurer, found that 86% of drivers do not know the correct position
for a head restraint and 40% never bother to adjust the restraints
after buying a new car.</TE>
<TE>   The optimal position places the top of the head restraint no more
than 2.5 inches below the top of the head, or about even with the
ears. The head restraint should be positioned no more than 4 inches
from the back of the seat occupant's head--2.5 inches is better yet.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is studying
whether to update its decades-old standard for head restraints,
though it is unclear whether it will issue a new rule. Much of the
research and pioneering engineering in preventing whiplash comes from
Europe, which has long had stricter safety standards for head
restraints than the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the auto industry is rapidly improving head
restraints on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety evaluates head
restraints designs and in its most recent examination of 200 models
found half had marginal or poor designs. In 1995, only five models
had good or acceptable designs.</TE>
<TE>   But many vehicles still have mediocre restraint systems, and it is
sometimes impossible to properly adjust the head restraints the car
makers provide.</TE>
<TE>   Head restraint standards apply only to front seats, and many
models have no protection for rear-seat occupants, a troubling
omission for parents with tall teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   The best cars are continuing to get better. General Motors, Saab
and Volvo, among others, are working on advanced head restraint
systems that would provide substantially more safety.</TE>
<TE>   Saab and GM offer active systems on some of their models that
allow the restraint to move up and forward during an accident. Volvo,
meanwhile, has a fixed restraint but allows its entire seat to flex
backward, reducing the forces acting on the neck.</TE>
<TE>   Whiplash, as it is commonly called, is an injury of the soft
tissue--muscles, tendons and ligaments--in the neck.</TE>
<TE>   Although 90% of those injuries go away within a year of an
accident, some become lifelong problems. Hyperextension of the spinal
column explains much of the strain on the tissue, but compression of
spinal fluid also is thought to be a cause of long-lasting nerve
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Preventing such injury requires a system that limits acceleration
of the torso relative to the head during an accident. Less stiff car
frames and flexible seats help. The head restraint completes the
protection by catching the head and keeping it aligned with the
torso.</TE>
<TE>   The Insurance Institute has found that the head restraints it
rates as good or acceptable can prevent serious whiplash in a 15 mph
crash most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Its ratings for specific car models can be found on the group's
Web site at www.hwysafety.org. Those ratings are based on the
physical configuration of the restraints.</TE>
<TE>   But the institute has built and just begun to operate a crash test
sled that will allow researchers to simulate the forces in a rear-end
collision and to measure dynamically the effectiveness of different
restraint systems.</TE>

<LD>Grills in California never go into storage, but cooking starts moving
indoors as the weather cools. Spareribs, typically reserved for the
barbecue season, become succulent and tremendously flavorful as they
roast in the oven.</LD>
<LD>   Making these chipotle ribs is a two-step process, but it's fairly
hands-off for the cook. First, the ribs are browned, sealing in their
juices, then generously brushed with chipotle barbecue sauce for yet
another flavor layer. Creating a chipotle barbecue sauce from a
bottled sauce is a nice shortcut. Be sure to taste the bottled sauce
before adding any sugar or lemon juice as noted in the recipe.</LD>
<LD>   Baby backs are popular because their meat is tender. They're from
the upper part of the rib section of the loin. They're typically
leaner than spareribs, which come from the belly of the pig. You can
also use this recipe for an appetizer; baby backs are popular party
nibbles.</LD>
<TE>   The two do-ahead side dishes--Texas rice and baked zucchini and
spinach--can be reheated in the oven with the ribs. The rice has zip
and variety that holds up to the ribs, while the vegetables are
deliberately subtle.</TE>
<TE>   For a meal with this much flavor, you'll just need some simple
accompaniments. Try warmed corn or flour tortillas and chilled
Mexican beer.</TE>

<TE>   Chipotle Barbecued Ribs Roasted in the Oven</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   2 racks lean baby back ribs, about 1 1/2 pounds each, trimmed of
excess fat, rinsed, blotted dry</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons chili powder</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons light brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 cup bottled barbecue sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons light brown sugar or 1 to 2 teaspoons lemon
juice, depending on sweetness of barbecue sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Arrange the ribs, rounded side up, in a single layer on a rack in
a shallow roasting pan. Roast, uncovered, 30 minutes. Combine the
chili powder, 2 teaspoons brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste in a
small dish. Remove the ribs from the oven and sprinkle the chili
mixture on both sides, rubbing the mixture in. Continue to roast the
ribs, rounded side down, for 20 minutes. Use tongs to turn. Roast 10
minutes longer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bring the barbecue sauce, onion, water, pureed
chipotles, 1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar or lemon juice and cumin to
a boil; reduce the temperature and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After the ribs are cooked, cut into 2-rib portions; place in a
large shallow casserole. While the ribs and barbecue sauce are hot,
pour all but 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce over the ribs. Brush the
sauce on both sides. (This can be made a day ahead, cooled and
refrigerated, well covered. Chill reserved sauce separately.) Bake
the ribs, rounded side up, covered with foil, at 350 degrees for 30
minutes. Uncover; bake about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Serve hot; pass
the remaining sauce separately.</TE>

<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   1 cup rice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup minced white onion</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup diced green pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 jalapeno pepper, seeded as desired, minced</TE>

<TE>   1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes in sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add the
rice; cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Add the onion, green pepper, jalapeno, garlic, cumin and salt. Cook,
stirring often, until the onion softens, about 4 to 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Stir in 1 1/2 cups of broth and the tomatoes. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the liquid is
absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Let stand,
covered, 10 minutes. This can be served immediately (after stirring
in the cilantro) or made a day ahead and refrigerated. (If made
ahead, reheat, covered, in 350-degree oven until hot, about 45
minutes. Add more broth if the rice is too dry. Stir in the cilantro.
Serve hot.)</TE>

<TE>   Baked Zucchini, Spinach and Cheese</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   3 large zucchini, about 1 1/2 pounds total, shredded in food
processor</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 (5-ounce) bag baby spinach</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup grated Chihuahua cheese, about 2 ounces</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the zucchini, oregano, salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring,
until some of the zucchini just starts to wilt, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the spinach. Toss into the zucchini. Cook, stirring, until some
leaves begin to wilt. Remove from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer to a shallow baking dish, spreading evenly. Sprinkle the
cheese over the top. (This can be baked now or cooled and
refrigerated overnight, well covered.)</TE>
<TE>   Bake, tented with foil, until the liquid is bubbling, about 40 to
45 minutes. (Remove the foil after 35 minutes so the cheese browns a
little.) Carefully drain off the accumulated juices. Serve hot.</TE>

<LD>A big spatula like this can come in handy. Try it when you're making
giant cookies. This will lift them from the baking sheet without
cracking them. It's also works well for pancakes, big hamburgers,
quesadillas and delicate pastries, such as individual tarts. The
stainless steel spatula, which measures 6 1/4 by 7 inches, has a
wooden handle.</LD>

<HD>Take a Taiwanese Pastry Chef, Add French Technique</HD>
<DH>The result is a bakery filled with both whimsy and classic
style</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA WU</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called the "Wizard of Oz," no doubt because it is dusted in a
delicate shade of emerald. It is a petite, refined cake--thin, pretty
layers of pink, white and pale green--and it looks as if it came
straight off the shelf of a glittering French pastry shop.</LD>
<LD>   But one bite and you're not in Paris anymore. The layers are made
of green tea mousse, red azuki beans in red bean mousse and vanilla
cake, all sprinkled with green tea powder. It is subtly sweet,
faintly herbal and unlike anything you've had before.</LD>
<LD>   The cake is just one of many unusual pastries at R.J. Patisserie,
a bakery tucked in a Hacienda Heights strip mall anchored by a 99
Ranch Market. The owner and pastry chef, R.J. Guo, combines classic
French technique with an Asian sensibility and ingredients to create
a stunningly beautiful array of cakes, cookies and other sweets.</LD>
<TE>   There are mousses and genoises tinged with passion fruit and
mangoes. Garnishes made from whisker-thin chocolate stripes, powdered
sugar-dusted champagne grapes and swirls of Japanese chestnut paste.
Each pastry is whimsically named, each a little work of art.</TE>
<TE>   "I love beautiful things, and I like making pastries that are
unique," Guo says.</TE>
<TE>   Guo's "Mont-Blanc" has a vanilla cake base, lightly striped with
chocolate, and is filled with Cognac-flavored chocolate cream. A
noodley-looking mound of chestnut cream made from sweet Japanese
chestnut paste and French chestnut cream sits on top. Perched on that
is a carefully balanced strip of chocolate and a chocolate-covered
espresso bean.</TE>
<TE>   His "Tender Rose" cake is garnished with champagne grapes, white
chocolate, strawberries and strawberry jelly. Its top layer is
strawberry mousse, followed by a pistachio genoise moistened with an
aromatic rose petal syrup. The next layer is mildly sweet white
chocolate mousse with crushed rose petals, followed by another layer
of soaked pistachio genoise.</TE>
<TE>   Guo, 35, learned to make traditional Chinese pastries as a teenage
apprentice in Taiwan. But it was later, while working at the Grand
Hyatt in Taipei, that Japanese-style French pastries caught his eye.
In Japan, pastry chefs often added Japanese touches to French
pastries. Guo, enamored of these desserts, decided he would try
something similar.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the United States in 1999 at the urging of a friend who
had worked with him in a bakery in Taiwan. Later that year, Guo
opened his Hacienda Heights shop, and now he's scouting sites for
another location closer to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Guo's desserts are not overwhelmingly sweet--in keeping with the
Asian style, he uses less sugar than Western palates are accustomed
to. And Guo is picky about ingredients, which include
imported-Belgian chocolate, French fruit purees, British tea leaves,
Italian coffee and Japanese green tea. He even grows a few of his
ingredients in his Rowland Heights backyard, including rose petals,
mint leaves and rosemary.</TE>
<TE>   "A great cake is 30% effort and 70% quality ingredients," Guo
says.</TE>
<TE>   The bakery also makes biscotti, souffles and a variety of cookies,
including some distinctive shortbread cookies flecked with Earl Grey
tea leaves. They look simple and ordinary, until you crunch down on
one and get the haunting flavor of tea mingling with the sweet flavor
of butter.</TE>
<TE>   But the main focus of Guo's staff of seven is cakes--they make 500
to 600 of the dainty little cakes a day. They cost $2 to $3.75 each.
Some of the shop's grander creations, such as sheet cakes, sell for
as much as $240.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not much of a speaker," says Guo, who is more comfortable in
his native Mandarin, "but I can really make cakes."</TE>
<TE>   R.J. Patisserie: 1635 Azusa Ave., Hacienda Heights. (626)

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earl Grey Cookies</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes,
plus 3 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon blanched whole almonds</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) butter, cut into chunks, softened</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 cups cake flour</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks, lightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Earl Grey tea leaves, crushed</TE>
<TE>   Flour, for rolling</TE>
<TE>   Make almond powder by grinding the almonds in a food processor
until they become grainy like sand, about 30 seconds. Do not
over-process or the mixture will turn into a paste. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer on medium-high
speed until it looks creamy, 1 minute, scraping the bowl once with a
rubber spatula. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed until the
sugar is just incorporated into the butter, 30 seconds. Scrape the
bowl. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture is
light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl
occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, combine the almond powder and the
cake flour.</TE>
<TE>   Add half of the egg yolks to the sugar-butter mixture and beat
until well incorporated, about 15 seconds. Beat in the remaining
yolks.</TE>
<TE>   Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture in 4 stages and mix on
low speed until all the flour is well incorporated, about 2 to 3
minutes. Stir in the tea leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Take
the dough out of the refrigerator and mix with an electric mixer on
low speed until the dough is softened a bit and easier to handle,
about 30 seconds. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into 2
(12-inch) logs, 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the dough in plastic
wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Slice the logs into 1/4-inch-thick cookies and place them 1/2 inch
apart on baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 13 to 14 minutes,
rotating the pans halfway through. The bottoms of the cookies should
look golden brown when done. Let the cookies stand on the baking
sheets for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool.</TE>

<LD>Although Three Cup Chicken is named for its three liquid
ingredients--sesame oil, rice wine and soy sauce--its enticing aroma
is what attracts your attention.</LD>
<LD>   Scents of ginger and basil waft from this version of the
traditional Taiwanese dish.</LD>
<LD>   Such a fragrant meal seems like it would take awhile to prepare,
but this comes together quickly. Buy chicken parts rather than a
whole chicken, if you prefer. Serve the chicken over steamed jasmine
rice.</LD>
<TE>   Sauteed pea sprouts are a nice side dish; saute them briefly in a
little sesame oil and minced garlic. The sprouts are sold at Asian
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh fruit is a cooling finish.</TE>
<TE>   Shaoxing wine, Chinese rice wine, is found at Asian stores.</TE>

<LD>"One wine that I really like is the 1999 Galante Cabernet Sauvignon
'Rancho Galante.' It's got lovely balance and a full rich flavor.
It's lovely for drinking right now, but it'll age too. It's smooth
and a terrific dark red color--lip-smacking good."</LD>

<HD>Grilled Salmon That Deserves an Encore</HD>

<AU>CHRISTY HEDGES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grilled salmon is wonderful for dinner, of course, but I like to have
some leftover. It works so well in salads such as this one, inspired
by the haricots verts--French string beans--being sold at farmers
markets and specialty stores.</LD>
<LD>   The colors of this salad are particularly vibrant, especially when
you take care to blanch the green beans to set the color.</LD>
<LD>   For a quick and easy way to grill salmon, brush filets with oyster
sauce, dot with butter and cover with a few slices of lemon. Wrap the
fish in foil and grill until flaky.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salmon and Haricots Verts Salad</TE>
<TE>   With Lemon Herb Dressing</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds haricots verts (French string beans)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   1 (6-ounce) package cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, pressed or minced</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fresh thyme, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced orange bell pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced yellow bell pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup diced red onion</TE>
<TE>   1 pound grilled salmon, cut or flaked into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   Butter lettuce, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Lemon slices, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Bring water to boil in a 6-quart pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt.
Fill a large bowl with water and ice.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch off the stem ends of the haricots verts. Add to the pot and
cook until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. The beans will turn bright
green and retain a slight crunch. Drain and immediately plunge the
beans into the ice water. This will set the color and stop the
cooking. When the beans have cooled, remove and drain.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook the mushrooms until they
have released their juices and are lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes.
Set aside to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Whisk together the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of
salt and the pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Add the rosemary
and thyme. Whisk until the dressing holds together, about 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   Toss together the haricots verts, the orange and yellow bell
peppers, onion, mushrooms and the dressing in a large bowl. Add the
salmon and mix gently. Serve on a bed of butter lettuce and garnish
with thin slices of lemon.</TE>

<HD>Commonly Good</HD>
<DH>Every culture has its own chicken soup, and L.A. is home to
some of the best</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They say chicken soup is good for the soul and zings bodily ills like
a shot of penicillin. But what kind of chicken soup are they talking
about? Is it chicken with noodles, rice or matzo balls? Or could it
be pho ga, tom yam kai or sopa de gallina india?</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, it could be any of the above. Chicken soup in this
city is as diverse as its inhabitants, who come from all over the
world. Thais, Vietnamese, Chinese, Mexicans, Filipinos, Salvadorans,
Indonesians and many others have stirred their own flavors into the
pot.</LD>
<LD>   The noodles twined in the broth might be fine rice noodles. The
rice could be rosy Mexican rice. Instead of carrots, celery and
potatoes, the vegetables could be straw mushrooms, chayote or green
papaya. Fish sauce and hot chiles may replace salt and pepper. Lime
juice, coconut milk and turmeric transform the broth. Cilantro, mint
and basil add new herbal flavors.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, these soups taste so different from one another, it's
hard to tell that they have anything in common. But each is a
variation on the same theme: chicken broth, vegetables, meat and
spices. And each is the quintessential example of home cooking,
wherever home may be.</TE>
<TE>   To get an idea of the range, we made a chicken soup tour of Los
Angeles, starting with the simple classic with noodles and moving on
to more exotic variations.</TE>
<TE>   Our first bowl is an elite version of chicken vegetable soup from
the Grill on the Alley in Beverly Hills. The full, mellow aroma of
the Grill's broth is amazing--just inhaling it makes you feel soothed
and nourished. The chicken is juicy. The vegetables, nudged upscale
by shallots and leeks, are painstakingly cut into fine shreds. Bits
of macaroni add substance. It's real comfort food, and the power
people who lunch at the Grill jam in on Mondays to get it. The only
other day it's served is Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The soup comes with a big, crusty heel of sourdough bread and a
slab of sweet butter, which is enough for lunch. The appointments are
first-rate. You feel naughty scattering crumbs on the starchy white
tablecloth and wonder if the waiter is miffed because you haven't
ordered anything else. Nevertheless, this aristocratic bowl of soup
is just $5.75.</TE>
<TE>   Starring: The Matzo Ball</TE>
<TE>   Our dinner stop is Nate 'n' Al's a few blocks away on Beverly
Drive. This restaurant and deli also draws a power crowd. The man at
the next table is on his cell phone chatting in film jargon. The
good-looking blond guy across the room shows off his biceps with a
black T-shirt and wears sunglasses, although it's dark outside.</TE>
<TE>   Like scads of Hollywood famous and other key players, the
cell-phone talker is spooning up Nate 'n' Al's celebrated chicken
soup with matzo balls. There is no meat in the soup, just broth,
dominated by two huge matzo balls so fluffy and light it's a wonder
they don't float out of the bowl. You can't find more soothing food
than this.</TE>
<TE>   And you can't help but feel good in a place where the waitresses
check on you as if they were Mom. They look comforting in their
old-fashioned uniforms, white socks and sneakers. I tell my waitress
I have a cold and ask if the soup will help. "I hope so," she
replies. "Jewish penicillin--isn't that what they say? I hope you
feel better soon."</TE>
<TE>   Nate 'n' Al's provides rye bread, sauerkraut, kosher dills and
"half-done" (partially cured) dills with the soup. It's quite a meal
for $5.25.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico: Bright Flavor</TE>
<TE>   On Day 2, we head to Glendale for lunch at La Cabanita on Verdugo
Road. This Mexican restaurant has created a stir with its caldo de
pollo, a beautiful bowl of chicken and vegetables topped off with a
golden slice of corn on the cob, cilantro and sliced avocado. Along
with green beans, carrots, tomatoes, potato, zucchini and chayote,
the bowl contains a spoonful of the same red rice that accompanies
most main dishes.</TE>
<TE>   A basket of hot, handmade corn tortillas accompanies the caldo,
and a little container of lime wedges and chopped onion is tucked
against the bowl. To eat it Mexican style, squeeze lime juice into
the soup and add onions and salsa to taste. There are two salsas, a
dark one of tomatoes and chile de arbol and a bright green blend of
serrano chiles and tomatillos.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Francisco Jimenez says the recipe is from his mother, Maria
Vazquez. They're from Mexico City. If you can swing it, go for lunch
during the week, when the caldo is $5.95 and comes with a plate of
rice and black beans and a soft drink. At night and on weekends, it's
$7.95 without the extras.</TE>
<TE>   Philippines: A Ginger Zing</TE>
<TE>   On the way back to Los Angeles, it's easy to swing into what
street signs designate as "Historic Filipinotown." This area along
Temple Street approaching downtown still includes a few Filipino
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Nanay Gloria, at the back of a corner mall, is set up for takeout.
Dishes in the steam table include chicken tinola (tinolang manok in
Tagalog), which is ginger-flavored broth with chicken chunks, spinach
and chayote. The original is made with green papaya and chile pepper
leaves, but even some cookbooks published in Manila authorize the
substitutions. What stands out about Nanay Gloria's soup is its
richness. Stored overnight in the refrigerator, the broth partially
gels. A big serving is $4.</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador: 'Rancho' Style</TE>
<TE>   Dinner on Day 2 takes us to El Zunzal, a small Salvadoran chain
restaurant on Olympic Boulevard in Koreatown. It's a cheerful place
with yellow-print tablecloths, golden walls and artificial yellow
tulips on the tables. One of the dishes in the illuminated menu
behind the counter is sopa de gallina india--Salvadoran chicken soup.
"Gallina" means hen, and "india" indicates freshly killed
poultry--chicken "from the rancho," the woman behind the counter
explains</TE>
<TE>   This is rustic food: big chunks of zucchini, potato and onion as
well as green beans, celery strips, bell pepper, tomato and a few
limp leaves that I'm told are mint. Spoon around the bowl and you
uncover chicken gizzards and perhaps a piece of bone, but no meat.
That's on a separate plate. After being boiled to make the broth, the
chicken is browned on a grill and set on a pile of rice beside a
salad of shredded cabbage, sliced radish, tomato, cucumber and a lime
wedge.</TE>
<TE>   This $6.99 meal also includes thick, hot, freshly made tortillas.
You can hear the slap slap slap as they are patted into shape in the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand: Chile and Citrus</TE>
<TE>   On Day 3, the lunch destination is one of the most authentic Thai
restaurants in the city, Sunshine Thai in North Hollywood. Here, the
chile pastes that season soups, curries and other dishes are made
from scratch in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Our soup is tom yam kai, which is the chicken version of hot and
sour shrimp soup (tom yam goong). The heat comes from small dried
Thai chiles, the sourness from lime juice. The key seasonings are
lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and fish sauce. Cilantro,
straw mushrooms and chicken bob about in the broth, which is colored
orange with nam prik pao, a chile-shrimp paste made at the
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The soup arrives in a chimney pot, just as it would in Thailand.
Flames briefly flare up the chimney as the fuel inside is ignited.
It's $8.50 for a large serving, $5.95 for a small one.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam: A Noodle Elixir</TE>
<TE>   The fourth and last day of the tour starts with lunch in
Chinatown, not in any of the well-known spots but in a tiny
Vietnamese cafe hidden inside a shopping plaza. Hoan Kiem has only
six tables, and they fill quickly, so you may have to wait for a
seat. The big demand is for the restaurant's only soup, pho ga.</TE>
<TE>   This is a Vietnamese rice noodle soup with chicken. If you happen
to have a cold, it's a must--no other soup offers the medicinal punch
of this one.</TE>
<TE>   First, you're handed a foam cup of hot tea. Then comes the bowl of
hot broth with shreds of chicken, cilantro, green onion and flat rice
noodles. A side plate contains a lemon wedge, bean sprouts, more
cilantro and jalapeno slices.</TE>
<TE>   Squeeze in the lemon juice, dump the other things into the soup,
then add a dash of Sriracha hot sauce from the squeeze bottle on the
table. That's enough hot chile to burn out any cold, plus lemon juice
for vitamin C. You get all this for $3.20, which includes tax.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia: Coconut Broth</TE>
<TE>   The tour ends with soto ayam at Ramayani on Westwood Boulevard,
one of very few Indonesian restaurants remaining in Los Angeles.
There are many different styles of soto, and Ramayani's version is
especially pretty: a bowlful of pale yellow chicken broth is colored
with turmeric and lightened with coconut milk. Hard-boiled egg slices
circle the rim of the bowl. In the center are pieces of chicken and
crunchy bits of fried onion. Bean sprouts and wiry fine rice noodles
fill out the soup.</TE>
<TE>   Subtly seasoned with lemon grass and kaffir lime leaves, soto is
gentle--until you add a hot sambal from the condiment jars on the
table. Sambal terasi is a bright green mixture of fresh chiles,
shrimp paste and lemon juice. Sambal bajak, which seems nicer in the
soup, is an oily red chile paste flavored with garlic, onion, dried
shrimp and sugar. Made at the restaurant, the sambals are on sale in
a small shopping area at the front, along with a variety of snacks
and Indonesian ingredients such as the sweetened soy sauce called
kecap.</TE>
<TE>   Soto ayam--"ayam" means chicken--is $7.95. There are two other
sotos on the menu, soto betawi, which contains beef, tripe and
chitterlings, and soto madura, another soup with variety meats. Just

<LD>It's obvious what the specialty is at Hawa Chicken Restaurant, a
Lebanese place that opened early this year in downtown Los Angeles.
Hawa serves chicken whole, halved, quartered or in little pieces
sliced off a vertical spit--that's called chicken shawarma. Like most
Hawa combinations, shawarma comes with hummus, a chunky tomato and
cucumber salad and rice pilaf with strands of toasted vermicelli.
Pita bread is part of the package, and so is a small container of
garlic sauce. Creamy and potent, it makes the subtly spiced chicken
even more delicious.</LD>

<HD>Glory Grows in a Patch of Desert</HD>
<DH>Red Mountain, a tiny Washington appellation, is producing
wines larger than life</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is barely more than a green streak across the shoulder of a barren
ridge. But that small swath of vines makes up Washington's newest
appellation, and it is the source of some of the state's most
extraordinary wines.</LD>
<LD>   It is called Red Mountain. And while the "mountain" part is a bit
of an exaggeration--it is, after all, the state's smallest
appellation--the area is rich in reds. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and
Syrah all thrive in this eastern desert environment.</LD>
<LD>   Established in 2001, Red Mountain is home to only a few wineries,
notably Terra Blanca, Hedges and Kiona. The area's cachet is largely
based on the reputation its fruit has gained among wine producers
beginning with the first crop in 1977. McCrea Cellars, Andrew Will,
L'Ecole No. 41, Canoe Ridge, DeLille Cellars and Betz Family Winery
are just a few names on the lengthening roster of wineries offering
Red Mountain-designated wines.</LD>
<TE>   Red wines made from Red Mountain grapes are intense and
structured, larger than life. They can have an almost withering
intensity, like Terra Blanca Syrah, or be relatively gracious, like
Kiona's fine-grained Cabernet Sauvignon, but their
signature--perfectly exemplified by Hedges Cellars Red Mountain
Reserve, a Cabernet-Merlot blend--is monumental depth and structure
with almost uncannily precise definition on the palate.</TE>
<TE>   More like a sagging butte than a mountain, Red Mountain is one of
several free-standing ridges that were once part of a single long
ridge. It was formed as an anticline, or uplifted fold in the earth's
crust created by plate tectonics. The longest part of the fold is
called Rattlesnake Mountain. Red Mountain, Badger Mountain, Goose
Hill and several other detached segments are known as the Rattles.</TE>
<TE>   The hills are separated by channels cut over time by the
meandering Yakima River. Red Mountain's 710 acres of vines within a
small AVA area of about 4,000 acres, facing the megalithic Horse
Heaven Hills southwest across the Yakima's present course, are
perfectly situated to benefit from weather moving up the valley:
heat-tempering marine winds flowing where the waters once moved.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the riparian green along the Yakima and its
tributaries, the country is arid. Summer nights are often lit by
wildfires moving across vast slopes of dry grassland. Rainfall
averages a scant 6 inches during the growing season, compared with 14
in the Walla Walla Valley, just a 45-minute drive southeast.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Versus Valley</TE>
<TE>   Red Mountain wines play a nice counterpoint to those from the
Walla Walla Valley. To put it another way, a typical Red Mountain red
wine is an elegant version of big, while a typical Walla Walla red
wine is a big version of elegant. Both appellations are growing
grapes in a desert, but with plenty of irrigation. And both are
subject to an extreme climate, but in a situation where the extremes
are moderated at a distance by a marine influence.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Mountain winegrowers are working on a remarkable
viticultural platform. The region's landforms were arranged in the
not-so-distant past by a long series of cataclysmic floods of a
volume and ferocity impossible to grasp fully. The simple facts alone
tell an awesome tale: Over the course of thousands of years, at least
40 floods submerged some 16,000 square miles under hundreds of feet
of water. At times the site of present-day Portland, Ore., was 400
feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   From a plane or helicopter it's not hard to pick out vast areas of
ripple-like ridges and meandering channels that look like the
intertidal zone on a sandy beach. That's what geologist J. Harlen
Bretz saw in the first decades of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "These remarkable records of running water on the Columbia Plateau
and in the valleys of Snake and Columbia rivers cannot be interpreted
in terms of ordinary river action and ordinary valley development,"
wrote Bretz in one of his many academic papers on the subject.
"Enormous volume, existing for a very short time, alone will account
for their existence."</TE>
<TE>   The floodwaters transported more than 50 cubic miles of soil and
rock from as far as Montana, including 200-ton boulders carried in
floating chunks of glacial ice. Those materials were deposited,
arranged and rearranged into a variety of landforms--some of them
ideal for growing grapes.</TE>
<TE>   The materials were deposited a little differently in the two
future appellations. The Walla Walla Valley trapped the water,
allowing sediment to filter down in orderly layers. The ridge of
which Red Mountain was a part formed an obstacle to the floods, so
that soil and rock were deposited more violently and randomly by
swirling, sloshing waters. Between the floods (which occurred roughly
twice a century), windblown volcanic materials, mostly a
fine-textured loam called loess, were laid over the flood deposits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a layer cake," explains Terra Blanca founder Keith Pilgrim.
"You have fine sand and silt layered with cobbles ranging from marble
size to Buick size. A lot of them are coated with calcium carbonate.
And that high-carbonate soil has a signature, a chalkiness on the
back of the palate. Once you taste it, you'll pick out Red Mountain
wine from here on out."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps; that's the kind of character that becomes clear only over
time. There's certainly a distinctive high-toned earthiness and fine
texture behind the vibrant blueberry and black fruit flavors in Terra
Blanca Merlot, and the same quality can be detected in the darkly
herbaceous flavor in Onyx, Bordeaux-style blend.</TE>
<TE>   Grower Jim Holmes, a former research engineer, planted the first
vines on Red Mountain in 1975, when land was $200 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no fences, houses, or roads," he recalls. "No power.
We were off the grid."</TE>
<TE>   He and his partner, John Williams, called the vineyard Kiona. In
1980 they made the first Kiona wines in Holmes' garage in nearby West
Richland. They subsequently split the business. Williams took Kiona,
and his son, Scott, is now in charge of the vineyard and wines.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes took the original vineyard, called Ciel du Cheval ("horse
heaven"), which he continued to expand. Among several other
varieties, he planted Syrah in 1994, at the same time that Pilgrim
was planting Syrah on the nearby Terra Blanca estate. Ciel du Cheval
is now about 120 acres.</TE>
<TE>   DeLille Cellars buys Ciel du Cheval grapes for "Doyenne" Syrah, a
massive yet elegant red. DeLille founder Chris Upchurch notes, "Lots
of places make big, rich red wines. But not many have this kind of
balance, the velvet hammer effect."</TE>
<TE>   A Glimpse of the Future</TE>
<TE>   Red Mountain's full potential has yet to be revealed. Clues to the
future are gradually being revealed by experimental plantings such as
the two-acre plot at Terra Blanca, where multiple clones of such
varieties as Tempranillo, Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Dolcetto grow side
by side.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington is a young growing region," says Pilgrim, "and one of
the things to be determined is which grapes work best in which
locations."</TE>
<TE>   A treat is in store for wine fans--we can all taste along as Red
Mountain continues to emerge.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2000 Fonterutoli 'Poggio alla Badiola,' Tuscany, Italy.
Castello di Fonterutoli</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The seat of the Mazzei family since, oh, 1435--produces some killer
Tuscan reds. But along with beautiful Chianti Classicos and riservas
and its highly sought-after flagship wine, Siepi, the estate makes
Poggio alla Badiola from younger vines, in a younger style.</LD>
<LD>   This cheerful, juicy wine tasting of earth and berries is almost
entirely Sangiovese (94%), with a soupcon of Cabernet Sauvignon and
Merlot. It has the soft tannins and silky texture that make for easy
drinking. Slightly chilled, it's a perfect barbecue wine. And by
today's standards, it's quite a bargain.</LD>
<LD>   About $10. Available at Baron's in Del Mar, (858) 481-2323;
Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey, (310) 306-2822; Wally's in West
Los Angeles, (310) 475-0606; Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454;
and Woodland Hills Wine Co. in Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111.</LD>

<HD>Bodies of Work</HD>
<DH>Artist Joanne Gair's skill at turning a person into an
elaborate canvas is the flowering of a unique sensibility</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Artist Joanne Gair apologizes to a guest who complains of sensory
overload in her presence. "I have that effect on people," she says.
She is a ball of fire in Chinese pajama pants; she is a whirling
dervish, a Nepalese tonka with a million faces, a human mandala.</LD>
<LD>   Heidi Klum, Naomi Campbell, Madonna, Christina Aguilera, Demi
Moore, Elle Macpherson, Cindy Crawford (shall we go on?)--she's
painted them all. Their bodies are Gair's canvas. "I'm an
illusionist," she demurs of her body painting, revered in the world
of makeup artists.</LD>
<LD>   On Moore, she painted a man's suit for the cover of Vanity Fair in
1992. Her work on a Madonna video was award-winning. She can command
$5,000 a day. Her most famous work, "Disappearing Model," was in
"Ripley's Believe It or Not in 2000." It is an astonishing piece of
trompe  l'oeil in which it is barely possible to pick out the face
and body of the model from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the
wallpaper. In this, it has, like much of Gair's work, an eerie
beauty. It is the ghost in the machine, the human inside the art, the
ultimate self-expression completely erasing the personality of its
canvas.</LD>
<TE>   At Smashbox studio on a recent day in Culver City, she is painting
roses on a 22-year-old model, Cassie Lane from Australia, for the
opening of an exhibit of her work at PhotoImpact gallery in Hollywood
that night. The exhibit of Gair's work (shot by such photographers as
Annie Leibovitz, Eva Mueller, Herb Ritts and Bruce Weber) will run
through the month, and Gair is working hard to make the opening
unforgettable.</TE>
<TE>   Lane sits half-naked in a chair she will occupy for eight hours
while Gair, with her team of six artists, paints roses and tattoos
and jeweled boots on her legs. "I've never felt so comfortable
topless," says Lane, who with Gair, will be escorted by three bikers
to the show. Gair uses her favorite tool of the trade to decorate
Lane: a Sharpie marker. Lane, in curlers and roses, is sucking a
cigarette and drinking a glass of chardonnay while Mark Garbarino, a
prosthetics artist and special effects man, studiously paints her
breasts.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the street in front of PhotoImpact is crowded. A
bartender has set up shop on the sidewalk. The dramatically beautiful
Ford model Jana, the first model Gair ever painted, towers above the
crowd. She appears twice in the collection. Inside, people of all
ages walk the halls and admire the photos. It's one big fashion
family.</TE>
<TE>   It's a marvelous evening for fashion gossip. "She's gotten huge!"
someone whispers to hairstylist Peter Savic, about a colleague who
has recently been seen in a size 16. "A real heifer-model." A Hells
Angel biker drinks bottled water and makes a call on his cell phone.
Call so-and-so at Ford Classic models, someone advises Frankie Lee
Slater, founder of the Art of Living Foundation in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to model what's possible," a woman says obliquely.
Meanwhile, the bartender breaks into a flailing fit. "I can't stand
still in front of a naked woman!" he shouts, abandoning his post to
watch the entourage arrive on their Harleys.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of body decoration, which includes piercings,
elongated ear lobes, ritual scarring and foot binding, body painting
is pretty tame. White-faced geishas, glam rockers like David Bowie,
heavy-metal rockers, New Guinea tribesmen made up to look like birds
of paradise, Native Americans, Indian mehndi designs--these are the
forebears of the look Moore and, now, Lane have sported. Lane is not
unfamiliar with the world of tattoos. She has a few herself, not to
mention a pierced tongue. In fact, she likes her body painting so
much that she keeps it on for two days after the opening.</TE>
<TE>   What was it like living as an artwork? She went to a few clubs,
staying pretty much in the Hollywood area. "It's been fun being the
center of attention," she says, but not as much of a crowd-stopper as
you might expect. She went to a supermarket "but no one stared. You
know L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Gair, 44, lives behind the Chateau Marmont in a house that makes
the word "eclectic" an understatement. Her house has so much
iconography from around the world that if someone was the slightest
bit religious he'd feel immediately guilty. Ganesh at one end of the
room and Jesus on the other. Votive candles everywhere, a painting of
the feet of Christ, a Hopi necklace draped on the shoulders of Shiva;
Mexican tiles and Moroccan lamps. It's a tattooed house, every alcove
occupied by a prayer to someone's god.</TE>
<TE>   "My life is like the movie 'Sliding Doors,' " says Gair, who like
many in her business keeps her own face unadorned. She might have
ended up, for all her fancy upbringing, serving pate to dinner
guests, but she chose another path. "Kiwi Joe," as friends call her,
grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, the daughter of politician/diplomat
George Gair. She taught dance in 1977 at a primary school, which is
where she first began drawing on people with Sharpies and ballpoint
pens. The first time she painted a Maori ritual face mask, called a
moko--which is traditionally worn by men--on Jana in 1985, it took
her several days. It's taboo to paint a male moko on a woman. "You
have to earn your moko," Gair says, explaining that a local Maori
priest told her she had earned the right. Who knows why? Because he
sensed a purity in her native heart? Because he felt her respect for
his culture? It's true, New Zealand is Gair's muse. The color, the
ritual, the intimacy with nature.</TE>
<TE>   Gair left New Zealand when she was 21, passed through England,
spent a day and a half in Japan and arrived in Los Angeles, where she
went straight away to the Chanel and Gaultier salons. Already a name
as a makeup artist, Gair told them if they wanted her they could have
her; if not, she'd be on the next plane home. They said yes. Soon
enough, people in Auckland began stopping her public-figure father
and asking if he was related to the famous makeup artist.</TE>
<TE>   She says she's ready to return to New Zealand, where her work was
on exhibit in the Auckland Museum last spring. "This is not a
balanced environment," she says of L.A. "There's so little capacity
for love here." (Gair talks like this. You just have to learn what
she calls "the language of passion.") "New Zealand is all about
family and community, from the Slavic influence to the Maori village
culture--it's all about stories, ancestors and color."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to sell her house and everything in it, if only to get
away from the 27 unfinished projects that track her every move;
there's the Kama Sutra shower, the Venetian candelabra and the crates
in the wine cellar that are filled with shards of stained glass from
Viennese graveyards.</TE>
<TE>   Body painting is physically exhausting--it can take a full day,
sometimes longer, to paint someone--and painters don't get a lot of
respect in the fashion world. And when the work is praised, the
photographer usually gets the credit. But the makeup world, in which
she reigns, crosses a surprising number of mediums--from music to
television to film to stills. And it is somewhere in that
cross-section that she may land. "I'm a multimedia girl," she says
proudly.</TE>
<TE>   This is the conundrum: Body painting appeals to her eclectic and
sensuous nature, but its very eclectic-ness engenders a ton of
materials and paperwork and permissions and people, all of whom Gair
tries to please. Now she wants out from under. She wants a clean room
and a blank canvas. Or a blank roll of film. Or a blank page.</TE>
<TE>   "The world wants to nail you into something, wants to make you
fill a little niche. I won't have it," she says. "I won't be painted
into a corner." She stamps her foot. Or is it a ritual dance?</TE>

<LD>E-mail from college, Oct. 6, 2002:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Mom,</LD>
<LD>   Did you know Dad was, like, coming to visit me here at college?
Well, cancel the Amber Alert, he's here with his blue toolbox and a
six-pack.</LD>
<TE>   "Helps me work with my hands," he says as he puts the six-pack in
the fridge.</TE>
<TE>   Mom, what's going on? I ask him what he's doing here, and he says
some men were just born to travel and explore, and he is one of them,
though there isn't anything left to explore really, except our
overstuffed garage, and he's kind of afraid to go in there.</TE>
<TE>   He says you told him to come down here to install my bookshelves
or something. Right now, he's pounding on the wall with his fist,
sort of like he used to when he did our taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dad, what are you doing?" I ask him.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking for studs," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too, Daddy!" I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't joke," he says and starts digging in his tool kit like some
country doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Can you believe this? He says that when he left home, you were
lying on the couch complaining about your back and the dog was curled
up next to you.</TE>
<TE>   Dad said he hasn't been able to hug you in, like, two months. It's
awkward to hug a pregnant woman, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, she quit drinking," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, pregnant women usually do," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish someone would've warned me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then he hands me all these letters from Columbia House that have
been stacking up back home. He says he tried to warn me about
Columbia House.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a life sentence," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "No Daddy, it's just a record club," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   When I say this, he exhales really deep, you know, like he does
instead of cursing. Big heavy sigh. The way he did when I got that
second speeding ticket.</TE>
<TE>   If you ask me, I think it's freaking him out, this pregnancy. I
mean, totally freaking him out.</TE>
<TE>   Mom, I just can't picture Dad putting snap-crotch pajamas on some
baby. Can you? Or getting up at 2 a.m. to help with the bottle. I
just can't.</TE>
<TE>   Have you ever seen him try to wrap a Christmas present? Or button
a dress shirt? I'm not sure he even has opposable thumbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Babies are easy," he says when I bring it up.</TE>
<TE>   "Um, Dad?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sweetie?"</TE>
<TE>   "Babies aren't easy," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, OK," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Dad says he really likes it here at college. He says the college
years were the best times of his life, "if you don't count right now,
of course."</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, pitchers of beer were a buck," he says. "And you could
get a taco for a quarter."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow Dad, you have some great memories."</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have these things called toga parties," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "You and Caesar?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a year ahead of me," he says. "But the guy could really
party."</TE>
<TE>   Then he finds the wall stud and gets out his electric drill. It
takes him, like, half an hour to find the drill bit thingy he needs
to poke a hole in the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I probably could've done this professionally," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hang bookshelves," he says. "I'm pretty good at it."</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell," I say.</TE>
<TE>   As he hangs the bookshelves, he tells me all this personal stuff,
like how his AYSO soccer team lost two games in a row, and he thinks
he's lost his coaching mojo.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried everything," he says. "I've switched kids around, I've
added extra practices. I think I've lost my mojo."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you should just, like, relax a little," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "At soccer?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a game, Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, the NFL is just a game," he says. "AYSO is bigger than
that."</TE>
<TE>   He says the reason he's really down here is because he just needed
a little break from his demanding suburban lifestyle, that's all. He
might stay awhile, he's not sure. He might just hang out for a few
months putting up bookshelves and teaching college kids how to shoot
pool.</TE>
<TE>   "By then, I'd be really good at bookshelves," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Great, huh? I work all my life to get away to college, and here
comes Dad with his toolbox and dopey quotations from dead people.</TE>
<TE>   "Truth is just common sense clarified," he tells me at one point.</TE>
<TE>   We weren't even talking about truth. He just blurts it out, all
this stuff about truth.</TE>
<TE>   "That's nice, Daddy," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   "Huxley said that," he says. "Thomas Huxley."</TE>
<TE>   Dad says a college campus is a good place for a "binge thinker"
like him, that maybe he could teach a class on soccer and hanging
bookshelves and all the other things you need to know about in the
real world.</TE>
<TE>   "I could teach Real World 101," he says. "Believe me, I've been
around."</TE>
<TE>   Mom, what's he really know about the real world? He's lived in the
suburbs his whole life. He coaches soccer. When I mention this, he
gets all defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, believe me, there's nothing more real than a suburb," he
tells me.</TE>
<TE>   Jeeesh.</TE>
<TE>   He says he knows a lot of quotations I could maybe use in my term
papers. Great people from throughout history. Ernie Banks. Groucho
Marx.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't find a door, build one," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Um, Voltaire?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, Milton Berle," he says, then starts putting his tools away.</TE>
<TE>   "That's great, Daddy," I say. "Now, can you maybe fix the toilet?"</TE>
<TE>   "I could probably fix toilets for a living," he says proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "Good for you, Daddy," I say.</TE>
<TE>   While he fixes the toilet, he starts singing. That's right,
singing. Some song from Simon &amp; Schuster. Garfunkel. Whatever.</TE>
<TE>   "And here's to you, Smokey Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you
could know ... woah, woah, woah."</TE>
<TE>   He says singing helps him work like this. There's not enough
singing in the world, he says. Singing makes people happy.</TE>
<TE>   "In college, there should be more singing," he says, then starts
singing drinking songs from the 14th century.</TE>
<TE>   If you ask me, I think he'll be home pretty soon.</TE>

<HD>Book Lovers Will Have Plenty of Tempting Choices This Month</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Columbus Day and Halloween are celebrated in October. And the Cuban
missile crisis, the anthrax mailings and the battle of el Alamein
occurred in October. No surprise, then, that each of these happenings
is featured in a nonfiction book that is also coming out this month.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, fiction fans can choose from among new hardcover novels
by Joyce Carol Oates, Milan Kundera, Fern Michaels, Dave Barry and
others.</LD>
<LD>   We learn early in life that Christopher Columbus first came to
America in 1492--but what else do we know about him? In "Columbus in
the Americas" (Wiley), William Least Heat-Moon examines his strengths
and weaknesses as navigator and leader. Drawing from Columbus' logs
and other firsthand accounts, the book reveals how Columbus refused
to believe that he had not landed in the Far East. It also reveals
his harsh plan for the New World natives.</LD>
<TE>   In "Death Makes a Holiday" (Bloomsbury), David J. Skal has scared
up a cultural history of Halloween, which has evolved from a
small-scale celebration into a huge seasonal marketing event. The
book discusses the origin of trick-or-treating and jack-o'-lanterns,
and the role the Irish potato famine played in bringing Halloween to
America. Skal examines current customs, Halloween in movies, urban
legends, witches, masks, costumes and haunted houses.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1962, the Cuban missile crisis made the Cold War hotter
than it had ever been. The discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in
Cuba prompted a U.S. naval blockade of the island. An officer on one
of those ships was Peter Huchthausen, author of "October Fury"
(Wiley). In his book, he shares his experience and offers accounts of
Soviet and U.S. officers and sailors during those tense times.</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax mailings of October 2001 were the first major
bioterrorism event in U.S. history and the second-largest FBI
investigation. In "The Demon in the Freezer" (Random House), Richard

<LD>   Carlee and her big brother Chase were all ready for Halloween.
Carlee was dressed as a cheerleader with bright white pompoms. Chase
was a scary skeleton. Their friend, Otto the Auto, drove up to their
house while they were waiting for their mother to lead them around
the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "You two look great in your costumes," Otto said.</LD>
<TE>   "Thanks, Otto. Did you notice that my skeleton bones glow in the
dark?" Chase asked. "I wanted to wear the mask that goes with my
costume, but my mom wouldn't let me. She's going to make up my face
instead."</TE>
<TE>   "Your mom is right," Otto said. "Wearing makeup instead of a mask
is much safer and can be just as scary."</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think of my costume?" asked Carlee.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the cheeriest cheerleader I've ever seen," Otto replied.
"And with those white sleeves and bright pompoms, drivers will be
able to see you easily."</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Mom if we could have dinner early so that we could
trick-or-treat before it gets dark," Carlee said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very good idea," Otto said. "When it's dark drivers have
a hard time seeing you."</TE>
<TE>   "My mom and I planned our route so that we'll cross the street
only at corners and on blocks where there are street lights, in case
we're still out when it gets dark," Chase said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm impressed," Otto said, laughing. "For a skeleton, you have a
lot of brains."</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit

<HD>Her Empire Is Crafted by Hand</HD>
<DH>Kellene Giloff has turned a love of art and piecework into
publishing business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kellene Giloff plunges into her overflowing stash of flattened shoe
boxes, vintage adding machine keys, floral cellophane wrap and
torn-out magazine pages with the zeal of a child encountering a new
box of crayons. What some see as trash, she sees as limitless
possibilities for art. "Look at these," she says, smoothing out some
copper and gold metallic Godiva chocolate wrappers. "I just had to
keep them. They're so beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   Her affinity for scraps is understandable to readers of the many
craft magazines she has published since the first, the Stampers'
Sampler, debuted in 1994. Somerset Studio is a bimonthly devoted to
stamping, paper crafts and calligraphy. The quarterly Inspirations
features projects using Giloff's own Stampington line of stamps.
Belle Armoire, introduced last year, is a quarterly dedicated to
wearable art and jewelry, and the new Legacy is another quarterly
that draws on family history and heirlooms as the basis for
scrapbooks, art journals and quilts. Set to hit newsstands next year
is Art Doll Quarterly, on handmade dolls. It grew out of "The Art
Doll Chronicles," a book published this year by parent company
Stampington that details the efforts of nine artists collaborating on
a series of dolls.</LD>
<TE>   Although publications such as Crafts Magazine and Doll Crafter
have been on the stands for years, the 42-year-old Giloff has
introduced a sophisticated sensibility to paper arts  that reflects
an evolution from cutesy country teddy bears to the use of images
taken from paintings, botanical illustrations and hand-carved
designs, as well as vintage photographs, Victorian ephemera and found
objects. Recent themes have included "Gone With the Wind," Tuscany,
the circus and India. The magazines' showcasing of collage and
assemblage in lush photographs of note cards, journals and shadow
boxes has not only become a signature style, but it has also nudged
craft and fine art closer together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer just homespun crafts," Giloff says, sitting in her
office in a nondescript Laguna Hills business park. "I think we've
given people a new perspective on what crafting is about. When I was
planning Somerset Studio, I was talking to [multimedia artist] Rona
Chumbook, and we never talked about collage as much as the romance of
paper. When I started stamping, there was just glossy cardstock, and
all of a sudden there were these new papers, and I was enthralled
because I could tear off a piece of handmade paper and add it to my
stamped image and all of a sudden it was a new thing."</TE>
<TE>   Giloff, a petite woman with ginger hair who seems in perpetual
motion even when sitting still, says it was her love of stamping--and
an entrepreneurial leaning--that led her to start a line of rubber
stamps and launch her first magazine a year later. She had been the
director of sales and marketing for a Salt Lake City hotel, but she
found it wasn't a perfect fit. "For at least 20 minutes a day," she
says, "I'd sneak a note pad and write down ideas for businesses I
wanted to start."</TE>
<TE>   When she and her husband, a hotel manager, moved to Orange County
in 1986, Giloff started her own event-planning business, but she was
dismayed by the long hours and lack of tangible results. Inspired by
Alexandra Stoddard's book "Living a Beautiful Life," she stopped in
at a local rubber stamp store one day to look for "beautiful
stationery to write beautiful letters." Giloff was struck instead by
a wall of stamps and grilled the sales staff about how to use them.
She walked out with $400 worth of supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Caught up in her stamp infatuation, she found something missing:
Noncute stamps. Giloff located images that were more to her liking,
including Victorian women and grapevine wreaths, had an artist tweak
them, then turned them into a line of stamps called Stampington,
which she sold to stamp stores. But she still wasn't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go to a stamp store and look at all their samples," she
recalls, "but I wanted more. I thought there must be a way stampers
could share ideas."</TE>
<TE>   After crunching some numbers, she realized she could put together
a full-color publication featuring handmade cards. Rubberstampmadness
magazine had beaten her to the punch on the subject matter, but it
took a more general approach to the craft. For the first two years,
she put out Stampers' Sampler solo, acting as publisher, writer,
editor and art director.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to offer crafters even more inspiration and to run a
magazine with advertising, Giloff started Somerset Studio after
buying Chumbook's newsletter, "Paper Crafters." The magazine, which
has a circulation of 65,000, has propelled artists such as Claudine
Hellmuth, Lynne Perrella, Nina Bagley and Michelle Ward from virtual
obscurity to superstar status in the crafting world.</TE>
<TE>   As Giloff's miniempire has expanded, so has crafting. The
$25.7-billion-a-year industry churns out an immense array of products
available at chain and independent craft stores and online retailers.
Crafters also have access to rubber stamp and scrapbook conventions,
instructional TV shows, craft-themed cruises and festivals such as
Artfest in Washington and Art Continuum in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Kat Okamoto, owner of the Carson-based A Stamp in the Hand rubber
stamp company and sponsor of several stamp conventions around the
country, recalls seeing Somerset when it debuted and thinking, "
'This is great. Now it's going to make people look at stamping in a
totally different way.' She hit it at the perfect moment," Okamoto
says. "She was seeing what was happening in the industry as different
companies were working in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   Giloff hasn't always hit it. Ageless, a lifestyle magazine
launched in 2000 for women 55 and older, flopped after three issues.
She chalks it up to timing and not being able to pull in national
advertisers, but she still winces when she thinks of it. "I have this
whole file folder with articles on why it's good to fail," she says,
laughing. "I had to read them a few times."</TE>
<TE>   Although Somerset is highly regarded by many crafters, artists and
professionals in the industry, the magazine is sometimes taken to
task for espousing the collage look so much that issue after issue
tends to look the same. Giloff's response is to recommend that
readers study each card, book or canvas for details that make them
unique.</TE>
<TE>   "After the whole Ageless nightmare, I'm still ready to step in
there and take chances," says Giloff. "I'll be in a meeting with my
staff and I'll say, 'You know, we ought to do a magazine about ... '
And everyone groans, because it's like we're running so fast just
trying to keep up."</TE>
<TE>   Giloff has plans for even more new projects, including a book
similar to "The Art Doll Chronicles" that focuses on collaborative
art journals. And pieces of her extensive collection of vintage
images and ephemera will be turned into a clip-art book.</TE>
<TE>   Running her business and maintaining a family life have
unfortunately left little opportunity for artistic endeavors. "I
don't have time to do crafts," she admits with a sigh. "I don't even
have a crafting room at home. I have a whole drawer of things I'd
love to turn into memory books. It's sitting there ready to go."</TE>

<HD>Author Could Use Some Magic in Summoning Book 5</HD>
<DH>With another delay in publishing, Rowling is on the
defensive with fans</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no double-edged sword more deadly than a literary franchise.
Arthur Conan Doyle got so sick of his, he mercilessly tossed Sherlock
Holmes into a waterfall, only to resurrect him a few years later to
satisfy the baying multitudes.</LD>
<LD>   When Louisa May Alcott died in 1888, her right hand was
permanently crooked and crippled by the penning of thousands of pages
for her young and voracious readers, and she reluctantly married off
her Jo March because the girls of her day could not stand the idea of
their heroine remaining single.</LD>
<LD>   Winding through her proposed seven-book Harry Potter series, J.K.
Rowling is getting a taste of the headache that follows the elation
of success. Because the previous four novels had been published in
the summer at two-year intervals, many readers expected to have
finished reading the fifth book by now. But for the second time,
Bloomsbury Publishing has announced that the publication date for
"The Order of the Phoenix" has been pushed back, this time possibly
as far off as next autumn.</LD>
<TE>   For a moment the world shook from the stomping of childish feet,
some of them actually belonging to children. Harry has worked its
magic beyond the young-adult section of bookstores--he has earned
millions of dollars for many people in the publishing, film and
merchandizing industries.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are millions of kids and young adults waiting
breathlessly to see what happens to Harry, Hermione, Ron and the
denizens of Hogwarts, but the folks at AOL Time-Warner also are
pretty darn curious. With plans to shoot the movies almost as quickly
as the books arrived, director Christopher Columbus cast actors who
would age along with the characters.</TE>
<TE>   So, ticktock, Ms. Rowling, ticktock.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespeople for Bloomsbury in Britain and Scholastic Inc. in the
U.S. have repeatedly pointed out that the fourth book, "The Goblet of
Fire," was a monster--more than 700 pages--and literature cannot be
churned out like so many widgets.</TE>
<TE>   Surfacing for a couple of brief interviews, Rowling has also
defended herself, saying that she never committed to a deadline for
the new book and so it cannot be considered "late." Furthermore, she
does have a child and a life outside Hogwarts: Last December, she
married for the second time and recently announced she is four
months' pregnant. And sick children write her letters, she recently
told the Wall Street Journal, and she feels obligated to answer them.</TE>
<TE>   She was also preoccupied with legal matters. At the end of
September, she received a summary judgment that found she had not
infringed on or copied from the works of American author Nancy
Stouffer. The decision, she said, was a huge relief and allowed her
to finally focus on her work in progress. She has scotched rumors
that she is suffering from writer's block. Recently, she has said the
book has a beginning, middle and an end. All that remains, she said,
is a little "tweaking."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, her young fans continue to fill the Internet with Web
pages devoted to alternative plots, do-it-yourself sequels and
arguments over whether it's OK to be mad at the author. When the Web
site BBC Newsround asked readers "Are you fed up waiting for Harry
Potter?" the responses ranged from the sympathetic to the truly
harsh:</TE>
<TE>   "I think the only reason book five is releasing so late is because
of all the pressure put on JK. I think JKR should take all the time
she needs."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's OK that the book isn't out till 2003, this must mean
that JK is writing a really good book. In the meantime, we can just
read the first 4 over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   "She is probably too busy counting her money to do any writing
this year!"</TE>
<TE>   "Although she is a brilliant writer I can't see why she's taken
over two years when usually she manages to do it in one. Very few
authors take this long when writing a part of a series. 'Order of the
Phoenix' has been overdue since last November and, personally,
waiting a year was too much for me. Two is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, it seems hardly fair to push the poor woman. She is
trying to write a book that not only advances our understanding of an
alternate universe but also captures in tone and style her maturing
characters. And there's no denying that the world is watching.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, in the words of mobster Hyman Roth, whose own literary
father, Mario Puzo, knew a thing or two about the literary franchise:
"This is the business we have chosen."</TE>

<LD>What is wrong with these people? Don't they know that I am a nice
person? I like to laugh--not at people but with them. My mom says
that is an important thing to remember.</LD>
<LD>   And I can sing and dance; I played one of the major orphans in
"Annie" last year at my school. Oh, gee, I shouldn't have thought of
my old school. I really, really miss it. I miss my friends Margaret
and Kathleen. And my teacher, Mrs. Wells.</LD>
<LD>   Doesn't anybody know that I like to draw? And I like music and
movies and dogs and cats too. And my favorite food next to pizza is
pizza.</LD>
<TE>   I don't know what to do, or what to say. I am so tired of being
all alone. If things don't get better really soon, I think I'm going
to run away. But the only place I'd want to run away to would be
home.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ms. Howard called on me in spelling, and I got the word
right. She said, "Good work, Elaine!" and I felt really better.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I look different or funny or something. Maybe my clothes
look like where I've come from and not where I am now. They were fine
in my old school ... but then everything was fine in my old school.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder why people think it's OK to ignore you like you aren't
even there. I was on the playground this afternoon, and I decided to
be brave. I walked up to a group of kids who were talking about
stuff, and I didn't interrupt or anything. I just waited for a place
to jump in and say something. But when I did, they just looked at me
like I had grown three more heads, so I walked away. Tomorrow has got
to be better.</TE>

<HD>Men's Book Club Spurs Debate, Discussion--During Halftime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>I seldom accept speaking engagements, but I recently got an
invitation I couldn't turn down. It was from the Men's Book Club of
Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, you heard correctly, Oprah: a literary discussion group
founded by, conducted by, and dedicated to the intellectual
stimulation of ... men. I am sorry if this notion does not dovetail
with some people's image of my gender as a parliament of louts, boors
and vulgarians. Wake up and smell the Kafka, ladies.</LD>
<LD>   Charlottesville is nearly a three-hour drive, so I needed to time
it just right. The Men's Book Club conducts its meetings, start to
finish, during halftime of "Monday Night Football."</LD>
<TE>   I was there to discuss a book I wrote four years ago. The
invitation was extended by the president of the club, who is, of
course, a guy. I admit I was initially a little worried because his
name is "Ashley." Worse, he had confessed that he was named after
Ashley Wilkes, the character from "Gone With the Wind" who displayed
all the manliness of a bra. (Ashley was played by an actor named
"Leslie.")</TE>
<TE>   But I was worrying for nothing. Ashley Schauer is all guy. As soon
as I arrived, he explained the guiding principle behind the Men's
Book Club's literary selections: Since discussion is statutorily
limited to 15 minutes, he said, each book must be really
thin--skimmable in its entirety "over two bowel movements, max." He's
an ophthalmologist.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most of the 10 members of the club are doctors. This
unnerved me a little, since my book, which is about medicine, is
written by someone who knows nothing about medicine. Some stores
actually shelve it with the medical books, which is a mistake. My
book is a medical book only in the sense that "Where's Waldo?" is a
detective novel. (One chapter is titled "Hiccups Can Mean Cancer.")</TE>
<TE>   Our discussion began with stopwatch precision, literally at the
sound of a gun. Halftime. Gastroenterologist David Balaban
immediately presented me with the abstract of a medical paper
documenting the tragic case of a man who, while undergoing a routine
colonoscopy, exploded. The electric current from the colonoscopy
snake had apparently ignited the man's interior gases, killing him as
profoundly as if he had swallowed a cherry bomb. (The procedure has
since been changed.) Surely, there is no solace to be found in such a
tragic story, but I should point out that the victim was French.</TE>
<TE>   I had expected to field questions about my book, but the
discussion--conducted rapid-fire as people nervously eyed the TV
screen for signs of a resumption of play--consisted mostly of doctors
reading portions of the book aloud, and adding medical observations.
For example, eye specialist Schauer confirmed my contention that when
a person looks at a standing woman, the image is projected upside
down on the retina, meaning her skirt falls over her head, exposing
her underpants. Schauer then somehow extended this observation to a
discussion of his favorite topic, the hazards of water balloons on
the human eye. He produced an actual epidemiological report,
comparing the kinetic energy in a water balloon launched by a
slingshot with the kinetic energy of other potential eye hazards,
including a champagne cork, a paintball, a Scud missile and the
Hale-Bopp comet.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Scott, a University of Virginia medical school administrator,
reported on the recent case in the hospital's emergency room in which
a head-injury victim arrived, conscious but with his head swathed in
bandages. Doctors slowly unwrapped him, watching in horror as his
brain meat kept peeling off and plopping onto the gurney. After a
minute or two of this stomach-churning procedure, someone noticed
hair under the meat. The victim's wife explained that she had heard
you were supposed to apply a steak to a wound, but she'd only had
ground round.</TE>
<TE>   At this point someone yelled, "No fumble! He was down on contact!"
and the meeting of the Charlottesville Men's Book Club was adjourned.
From a literary standpoint, Oprah, I can report that the Patriots
won, 30-14.</TE>

<HD>Major Gifts From Gordon Parks, Mick Jagger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're from different generations and work in different fields. But
Gordon Parks and Mick Jagger have something in common this week: Both
acknowledged their roots with big donations.</LD>
<LD>   Writer and photographer Parks is donating a collection of his
work--photographs and poems valued at $100,000--to the new Mercy
Health Center, which opened two months ago in his hometown of Fort
Scott, Kan.</LD>
<LD>   It will be Parks' first exhibition in Fort Scott, about 60 miles
south of the Kansas City area.</LD>
<TE>   One work, a poem titled "Homecoming," reflects the peace Parks has
made with the town where he was born in 1912, and where he learned to
face racism at an early age.</TE>
<TE>   The Mercy Health Center Foundation will dedicate the exhibition to
Parks' parents, Sarah and Andrew Parks, who are buried along with his
siblings in Fort Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who directed movies including 1971's "Shaft," is still
working at 89. Last month, he released a book, "A Star for Noon,"
which is accompanied by a compact disc of his compositions.</TE>
<TE>   Jagger, meanwhile, donated $150,000 to provide free string and
wind instrument training for youngsters at England's Dartford Grammar
School, which he attended.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we should encourage children to sing and play
instruments from an early age," Jagger, 59, said from the United
States, where the Rolling Stones are on tour.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so important that they have somewhere like this where they
can share their musical ideas and vision and be able to practice for
as long as they like."</TE>

<LD>Chuck D looked like a man ready to box. The rapper stood at the
center microphone at the House of Blues on Monday, hidden beneath the
hood of his yellow jacket as the rest of Public Enemy erupted into
the fist-pumping "Put It Up."</LD>
<LD>   The night was just beginning, and already Chuck D was setting a
new agenda, challenging all the "patriotic MCs on bent knees."</LD>
<LD>   That's the kind of message one expects from Public Enemy, still
fiery and fearless nearly two decades on. Soon a man in a George W.
Bush mask wandered the stage to the rock riffs and heavy beats of
"Son of a Bush," which ended with Chuck D leading the crowd in a
chant of "I ain't going to no war!"</LD>
<TE>   Instead of the apocalyptic sonic boom of the original Bomb Squad,
Public Enemy now fuels its raps and turntables with live guitar, bass
and drums. The result on Monday was a new kind of energy, with a
charged, fresh reinterpretation of Public Enemy's best-known work.</TE>
<TE>   Flavor Flav was missing Monday, in jail for a probation violation
stemming from neglected traffic problems. But PE forged ahead, only
occasionally missing the presence of his hyperactive, gadfly vocals.</TE>
<TE>   "You in the front might not be able to last that long," Chuck D
warned fans. "It's going down."</TE>
<TE>   It was during "Fight the Power" that Public Enemy showed where
these live players just might lead the group. As fans bounced and
shouted along, the band stretched out into a throbbing funk groove,
and Chuck D slipped into a surprising James Brown vibe (minus the
crazy dance steps), this time preaching another message, embracing
the beauty of "soul power!"</TE>

<HD>School Shootings Examined in Films Born of Anguish</HD>
<DH>Movies* A Michael Moore documentary, honored at Cannes, and
a cable TV drama were created in the aftermath of campus violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood's infatuation with firearms is getting a dramatic twist in
two new films--a documentary feature and a cable TV drama--that
attempt to tarnish the titillating appeal of guns in American culture
by examining the phenomenon of school shootings.</LD>
<LD>   It remains to be seen whether Michael Moore's documentary "Bowling
for Columbine," which opens Friday in Los Angeles and New York, and
Showtime's "Bang Bang You're Dead," which premieres Sunday, draw
large audiences. But both projects enjoyed a remarkably smooth and
swift path to production and distribution, in large part because of
executives' strong support of their anti-gun-violence message.</LD>
<LD>   "Bang Bang You're Dead" is built around William Mastrosimone's
40-minute play that has been downloaded by 100,000 schools across the
globe since it was posted on the Internet in 1999. In the play, a
student gunman is revisited by the ghosts of his victims, forcing him
to confront the consequences of his rage.</LD>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, Showtime's president of programming, Jerry
Offsay, gave the green light to Mastrosimone's proposal to embed his
small but popular stage production in a feature-length drama.</TE>
<TE>   Mastrosimone created a depressed protagonist named Trevor who had
threatened to gun down the football team the previous year and who
returns to school an outcast. His only friend is the drama teacher,
played by Tom Cavanaugh (NBC's "Ed"), who casts Trevor as the lead in
the school play, "Bang Bang You're Dead." Through daily rehearsals,
Trevor, who is played by the pasty-faced Ben Foster, must reintegrate
himself into school while coming to grips with his past desire for
vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor's behavior and Foster's physical appearance bring to mind
Kip Kinkel, the 15-year-old student from Thurston High School in
Springfield, Ore., who killed his parents in May 1998 and then took
his .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle to school, where he killed two
students and wounded 24 other people. Kinkel is now serving a
112-year prison sentence. The resemblance is no coincidence, because
it was Kinkel's rampage that brought the issue of gun control into
Mastrosimone's home.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the attack, Mastrosimone's son came home and
reported that a classmate had written on the blackboard, "I'm going
to kill everyone in this class. And the teacher too." Mastrosimone,
55, wrote "Bang Bang You're Dead" that night, keeping in mind the
limitations of a school drama department budget. The play can be
performed with 11 actors, almost no costumes and few props. He was
planning to mail it to the drama teachers at his son's school and the
one at Thurston High in Oregon, but his assistant, who was Internet
savvy, persuaded Mastrosimone to post it on the Internet, where it
immediately got thousands of hits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a mission I did as a parent, not as a screenwriter," says
Mastrosimone, who was nominated for an Emmy for 1994's "The Burning
Season."</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel that these are not psychotics. I feel the media has
been hasty in branding them," Mastrosimone says. "They're normal kids
who have been pushed to their limits, pushed to fantasize about
trying to get back."</TE>
<TE>   Like Mastrosimone's play, Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" was
informed by a school shooting. It was April 1999, and Moore walked
into his office to see his employees gathered around a TV watching
coverage of the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
Two student gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher and then turned
the guns on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought was not to make a movie but to run against
Charlton Heston as head of the NRA," Moore says, referring to the
National Rifle Assn., which Heston has headed since 1998, "but that
sounded like too much work."</TE>
<TE>   Moore is a lifelong gun user and a member of the NRA, but he is at
odds with the culture of fear he says both the government and the NRA
have cultivated. The film climaxes when Moore accompanies two
students who were disabled by gunshot wounds at Columbine to the
corporate headquarters of K-Mart; the shooters had purchases their
bullets at their local K-Mart. The encounter yields surprising
results.</TE>
<TE>   "Bowling for Columbine" (named because the two student gunmen went
to the local bowling lanes before heading to school) was made with
$2.2 million from a Canadian film company, and Moore insists that
despite its heavy message, his goal was to make it entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   "If I just wanted to make a political statement, I'd run for
political office. I'm a filmmaker," he says. But then, as befits his
reputation as a provocateur, he notes, "If I only reach the people
who believe in what I'm saying, then I'm OK, because they're the
majority. Every poll shows that. Every poll shows that people believe
in gun control."</TE>
<TE>   Mastrosimone says his goal in penning "Bang Bang You're Dead" was
to get a message to the most troubled students in the audience and
possibly prevent future violence. "I aimed it at a person
contemplating murder," Mastrosimone says. "I did that by having a
person in the first scene bragging about the people he killed, so
anyone in the audience [who was thinking the same thoughts] would
immediately identify with him."</TE>
<TE>   His film comes with loads of parental advisories, but the network
also put together a study guide for schools, which was endorsed by
the Assn. of School Psychologists. On Thursday, Showtime and the
National Education Assn. are screening the film in Washington, D.C.,
for educators and high school students.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a problem, whether or not there are guns accessible to
those terribly damaged kids who feel that they have no recourse but
to lash out against their cohorts in that way," Showtime's Offsay
says. "I am anti-gun. But to say this is a movie about
anti-gun-violence simplifies it far too much."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately following Sunday's television premiere of "Bang Bang
You're Dead," Showtime will broadcast a panel discussion on
preventing school violence hosted by journalist Linda Ellerbee. Also
in attendance will be Mastrosimone and William S. Pollock, assistant
professor of clinical psychology at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   While Mastrosimone's project is based on real events, "Bowling for
Columbine" is a mosaic of facts coupled with Moore's highly
subjective explanations of the causes for epidemic gun violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Canadians have this ethic to help people," Moore says. "Our
ethic is every man for himself. If you're poor, we're going to punish
you for being poor. This creates a lot of violence."</TE>
<TE>   But the NRA doesn't see it that way. Organization spokesman Andrew
Arulanandam accuses Moore of "trying to inject himself into the
political process."</TE>
<TE>   "To that I would say that Michael Moore is politically
insignificant," Arulanandam says.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of Moore's film's impact on politics, it has already
had one on the film community. The organizers of this year's Cannes
Film Festival made it the first documentary to be accepted into the
main competition in 46 years. It eventually won a special honor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just entertainment; it's a news item," says Bingham Ray,
president of United Artists, who attended a morning press screening
at Cannes and negotiated a deal by nightfall. "It's Michael's take on
things, which began just as a film about the shootings at Columbine,
but it was broadened as he gave it more thought.'"</TE>
<TE>   From a commercial standpoint, Ray is betting that Moore carries
appeal to audiences who would not normally be drawn to a documentary.
He's known for his popular 1989 movie "Roger and Me," which won the
National Society of Film Critics Awards, and his nonfiction book
published this year, "Stupid White Men ... and Other Sorry Excuses
for the State of the Nation!" that remained on the New York Times
Bestseller List for 30 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael has become, I believe, through his own dint of intensity,
a brand name. He's become a force of nature," Ray said. "I didn't
advocate getting this film to change the world, but it can open some
eyes, ask some questions and perhaps do some good and entertain them,
promote them and challenge them."</TE>
<TE>   "Bang Bang You're Dead" will be shown at 8 p.m. Sunday on
Showtime. The network has rated it TV-PGVL (may be unsuitable for
young children, with advisories for violence, language and adult
themes).</TE>
<TE>   "Bowling for Columbine" opens Friday in L.A. and New York and will
premiere in other cities over the next few weeks.</TE>

<HD>Too Evil to Be True-- and That's a Good Thing</HD>
<DH>Movies* With real crime rampant, why do fans line up for
movies like 'Red Dragon'? In part, it's a way to escape grim reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CARO</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Which of the following is not the plot of a movie in
production or development?</LD>
<LD>   (a) A female investigator hunts a serial killer whose victims are
her past boyfriends.</LD>
<LD>   (b) An FBI agent hunts a serial killer who may be his colleague.</LD>
<TE>   (c) An FBI agent hunts a serial killer who may be his identical
twin.</TE>
<TE>   (d) A student interviews a serial killer to help him get into
Harvard's psychology program.</TE>
<TE>   (e) An FBI Internet crimes investigator hunts a serial killer who
posts his murder scenes on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Trick question; they're all real.</TE>
<TE>   How about the one in which a hypnotist reads a detective's mind
and finds clues about a serial killer seeking immortality? Or the one
in which an investigator cracks the case of a serial poisoner in a
California medical center?</TE>
<TE>   Yup. Yup.</TE>
<TE>   Would you believe a serial killer sticking mirror shards into his
female victims' eye sockets so they can "watch" him gradually
transform into a supernatural being? That movie, "Red Dragon," broke
October box office records last weekend with a take of $36.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when you can't turn on the news without seeing reports
about abducted kids and terrorist cells, those in the entertainment
community figure we still want to spend our leisure time with
murderous creeps. They may be right.</TE>
<TE>   Some movie fans might reasonably have viewed "Red Dragon," the
presumed last Hannibal Lecter thriller, as a sign that the
serial-killer tank is just about empty. This is, after all, a
"prequel" that's really a remake of a 16-year-old movie ("Manhunter")
based on Thomas Harris' first novel in the series (which continued
with "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal"). But, no, just as in
the movies themselves, these serial killers won't die.</TE>
<TE>   "They never cease," marveled filmmaker John McNaughton, who helped
get this current ball rolling with his chilling 1986 cult film
"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer." "I just read one script where a
serial killer comes back from the past or the future or some place,
and is back in the habit of carving sevens on the eyeballs of his
victims."</TE>
<TE>   Serial killers certainly exist in our society, but they're not the
raging epidemic that media coverage and entertainment portrayals
might have you believe. FBI Special Agent Chase Foster called them
"statistically insignificant," noting that last year about 18,000
homicides were committed in the U.S., while the FBI investigated 43
possible serial killers.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, serial killer movies must be considered their own
genre, one that follows a particular set of rules: Some terribly
nasty person is killing not-quite-random victims according to a
mysterious pattern, and the investigator must get inside the
murderer's head and nab the suspect before the next victim is offered
up for slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Serial killer movies aren't new: More than 20 variations on the
Jack the Ripper story have been filmed, from Alfred Hitchcock's 1926
silent "The Lodger" to the Hughes brothers' "From Hell" last year.
What's changed, aside from such films' frequency, is their stature.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be these types of movies were the B movies," said Mike
Zam, who runs New York University's screenwriting program. "In 1944,
Barbara Stanwyck was reluctant to play a killer in 'Double
Indemnity.' These are the A movies now."</TE>
<TE>   "The Silence of the Lambs," from 1991, bestowed respectability on
the genre with its Oscars for best picture, actor (Hopkins), actress
(Jodie Foster) and director (Jonathan Demme). David Fincher's darkly
stylish "Seven" (1995) was another milestone, a dread-drenched
thriller that lured $100 million from North Americans who watched
Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt try to nab Kevin Spacey before he could
complete a killing cycle based on the deadly sins.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in "Blood Work"
(serial killer murders potential heart donors to aid ailing FBI agent
and thus renew rivalry), Bill Paxton directed himself and Matthew
McConaughey in "Frailty" (serial killer as byproduct of abusive
father) and "feardotcom" went the more traditional exploitation-film
route (victims log onto serial-killing Web site).</TE>
<TE>   Denzel Washington has starred in two serial killer movies ("The
Bone Collector" with Angelina Jolie, "Virtuosity" with Russell
Crowe), as have Freeman and his "Kiss the Girls" co-star Ashley Judd,
who currently is filming "Blackout" (the ex-boyfriend killer) with
venerable director Philip Kaufman ("The Right Stuff").</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner are producing "Suspect
Zero," starring Aaron Eckhart, Carrie-Anne Moss and Ben Kingsley in
the story of an FBI agent suspicious of his colleague. And Goran
Visnjic of "ER" will be the hypnotist of "Hypnotic."</TE>
<TE>   "They're showy parts often, so they attract big stars, and big
stars attract audiences," Zam said.</TE>
<TE>   Serial killers have been inhabiting the small screen as well. A
news release from "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" notes that
"this year, episodes will address such important issues as elder
abuse, child smuggling, a female serial killer disguised as a
prostitute...."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Lawrence played that murderer in the series' season
premiere, becoming at least the fourth in a string of "SVU" serial
killers that included Richard Thomas (John Boy of "The Waltons") as a
multiple murderer crazed by syphilis.</TE>
<TE>   Such characters are compelling, "SVU" executive producer Neil Baer
said, "because they represent our deepest, darkest desires and
thoughts, and they act them out. They act out things that maybe have
crossed people's minds, and we're fascinated about what makes them go
over the edge, what makes them do it."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins used similar reasoning in a recent interview (excerpted
last week on the Internet Movie Database www.imdb.com) as he tried to
assuage moviegoers' guilt over enjoying Hannibal Lecter.</TE>
<TE>   "He represents the unspeakable part of ourselves, the fantasy,
desires and dark areas of our lives that are slightly unacceptable to
us but actually healthy, if only we acknowledge them," Hopkins said.
"Perhaps we'd like to be as daredevil as him. But admiring him
doesn't mean we're deeply disturbed, sick people. It means that we're
human."</TE>
<TE>   One reason for admiring serial killers is that they're portrayed
as super-intelligent and super-methodical, and they strike against
authority in a way ordinary mortals can't. Yet isn't the idea of an
enjoyable serial killer a bit ... off?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that this subject is something that you can or
should take real lightly and treat as entertainment per se," Demme
said in an interview. "I would include 'Silence of the Lambs.' If
you're going to enter the world of serial killers for entertainment
purposes, I think there's a responsibility to tell the full story,
and as far as I can tell, not many of the movies have."</TE>
<TE>   That full story, Demme noted, usually involves a history of child
abuse, which "Lambs" touches on with killer Jame Gumb (Ted Levine)
and "Red Dragon" more overtly addresses with Frances Dolarhyde (Ralph
Fiennes), whose background is ignored in "Manhunter." "Red Dragon"
writer Ted Tally and director Brett Ratner also make a point of
reminding us just how evil Lecter is.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even though the new movie is more serious-minded and less
grotesque than last year's "Hannibal," years and years of exposure to
real and fictional serial killers have dampened our ability to react
with full horror. "In Cold Blood," the 1967 film adaptation of Truman
Capote's book about two young killers who murder a family, prompted
viewers to reflect on the nature of violence more than any of the
current movies do.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a stronger sense of moral outrage about these films and
about the prevalence of violence in society" with "In Cold Blood,"
Penn State University film studies specialist Kevin Hagopian said. "I
think that the serial killer films of today take the fact of violence
in society as kind of a given."</TE>
<TE>   "There are serial killers, I guess, in all countries," Demme said.
"We make movies and go get entertained by that instead of as a
society really going, '[Gasp] what are we going to do about that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Few inside or outside the entertainment industry figure that the
production of serial-killer entertainment is tied in any way to the
news or national mood. At the same time, not everyone discounts the
notion that such movies might have a certain resonance now.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we mean when we say 'evil'?" asked Robert J. Thompson,
Syracuse University media and popular culture professor. "What does
the president mean when he says 'axis of evil'? These questions are
very much on our mind right now. These movies, I think, are the way
that we dramatically try to feel around what those definitions of
evil are and how they relate to the human spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Yet few serial-killer films portray real figures. First Look
Pictures did release the features "Dahmer," "Ed Gein" and "Ted Bundy"
this year, but they have had very limited theatrical lives.</TE>
<TE>   They're also less graphic than First Look's fictional
serial-killer movie "Hypnotic," due in March 2003. "That film is
indeed gory," First Look Senior Vice President Bill Bromiley said.
"That is a very on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller."</TE>
<TE>   McNaughton's theory is that the country doesn't want to confront
realistic serial killers any more than it wishes to address other
looming threats.</TE>
<TE>   "In the aftermath of Sept. 11, I think the shock of it is such
that no one is facing it in any way that's serious," McNaughton said.
"What I see in the scripts I'm seeing is denial, some of the most
meaningless and stock stories that one wonders why anyone would
bother to tell them. People are hiding from the truth now, whatever
it might be. It's too horrible to face."</TE>
<TE>   So the most heinous of real-life criminals ultimately serve the
cause, in Bromiley's words, of "pure escapism."</TE>
<TE>   "When things are not going well in society or family life, people
need entertainment," he said. "They need to be taken to another
world. For some people that means a romantic comedy, and for some
people that means going to see a serial killer thriller film."</TE>

<HD>New Orchestra Forms to Fill San Jose Void</HD>
<DH>Arts* Silicon Valley ballet started the group, which will
include musicians from the troubled San Jose Symphony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to fill the void left by the financially troubled San
Jose Symphony--which ceased to present concerts earlier this year and
plans to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the month--a
new orchestra, Symphony San Jose Silicon Valley, has been formed.</LD>
<LD>   The new 75-member orchestra will operate under the same management
umbrella as the Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley. About 45 of the
musicians who will join the new orchestra regularly accompany the
dance company during its performances. Many of those musicians also
performed with San Jose Symphony, since both the ballet and San Jose
Symphony were part-time employers.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Bales, executive director of Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley
and now of the new orchestra, said Symphony San Jose Silicon Valley
will be led by guest conductors in its first season, which begins
Oct. 17 at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been a community with no symphony services for most of the
last year, and that's not acceptable," Bales said. "While we hope San
Jose Symphony finds a way to emerge from its financial difficulties,
we don't expect that to happen this year, or even the next."</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Bales said, he does not see the new orchestra as
competition for San Jose Symphony while that 123-year-old orchestra,
the oldest in the West, struggles to reorganize. "We expect the
venture that we've embarked on will be the lead provider of symphonic
performances in the foreseeable future," he said. As for what will
happen if or when San Jose Symphony returns to performing, Bales
said: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose Symphony is trying to raise $150,000 to save its music
library from liquidation; if the money can be raised, the company can
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows for
reorganization, rather than Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which would require
liquidation of all company assets and make a rebirth of the symphony
virtually impossible. Symphony leadership was unavailable for comment
on what the start-up of the Symphony San Jose Silicon Valley might
mean to their fund-raising and reorganization efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Bales said that the ability to share administrative services with
the established ballet company, as well as the opportunity to tap
into an available pool of local musicians, makes starting a new
orchestra viable even in the Silicon Valley, which has been hard-hit
by recent stock market losses.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-member Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley, under the direction
of Dennis Nahat, presents 40 performances a year on an annual budget
of $6.5 million. In its first season, the new orchestra will perform
seven programs in 11 concerts, adding $800,000 to the annual budget
of the umbrella organization. Bales said the new employment
opportunity may keep former San Jose Symphony musicians from leaving
the area, noted for its high cost of living. "We already have an
association with them, and we can offer them more work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For 15 years, Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley operated as a partner
with Cleveland Ballet, with separate administrative staff and boards
of directors. Dancers shuttled between the cities, performing as San
Jose-Cleveland Ballet on the West Coast and as Cleveland-San Jose
Ballet in Ohio. The two entities cut costs by sharing dancers as well
as sets and costumes. Two years ago, Cleveland Ballet went out of
business and the dance company became a single-city entity with a new
name.</TE>
<TE>   Bales said the company's experience in that partnership should
serve it well in organizing a new symphony orchestra. "With the
ballet company, we had a two-city organization with one artistic
company. Now, we will have a one-city operation with two artistic
companies," Bales said.</TE>

<HD>A Man for All Roles</HD>
<DH>Jason Cottle takes on a dozen different parts in 'Nickel
and Dimed,' at the Mark Taper Forum</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a red-vested waitress named Theresa recently served actor Jason
Cottle French fries and lemonade at a Los Angeles Denny's, let the
record show: He left a good tip. Cottle plays a dozen different roles
in the Mark Taper Forum's current production of "Nickel and Dimed,"
which is based on Barbara Ehrenreich's first-person account about
trying to make ends meet on a minimum wage.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening scene, Cottle plays a Czech busboy at "Jerry's," a
chain restaurant where staffers work feverishly and still come up
short at the end of the day.</LD>
<LD>   "I hadn't heard of the book," says Cottle, "but I read it before
my audition and was blown away. It's such a brutal view of these
people who get knocked down and knocked again. There's millions of
people who work so hard they're exhausted--and they still don't have
money."</LD>
<TE>   In "Nickel and Dimed," Cottle, officially credited as "Ensemble,"
portrays one woman and all of the male characters. Slipping in and
out of accents, attitudes and costumes, he materializes on stage as
the eager-to-learn-English dishwasher, a boor from Montana, an
erudite New York magazine editor, a man with a hacking cough, a bossy
Boston maid-crew supervisor, a rich housewife, a spaced-out nursing
home attendant, a middle manager at a Minnesota discount chain, a
neck-brace-wearing mall rat and a fast-food-crew supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time you do this play, you're like, 'I have no idea
what I'm doing now, or who I am or where I'm going,' " says Cottle,
31. "That's become easier. What's still hard is that this show is not
like 'Hamlet,' where you have a natural progression as one character:
Horatio comes in, you're going to see the ghost, I know who killed
him, 'Oh my gosh, my mother,' the grave scene, and it keeps building
and building. Or with Chekhov, you have the rhythm of his language to
carry your through. But in 'Nickel and Dimed,' there's all these
different sequences and the rhythm changes each time, so you have to
stop and start, stop and start. There's so many of these little
scenes, you feel like you never really land on stage."</TE>
<TE>   Cottle says he's developed a kind of shorthand for each role.
"I've got a few minutes here or there to try to get into caricature.
Ideally, there's some kind of hook that really gets you into the
scene. Like when I'm going to play the rich lady, I'll find myself
primping and kind of teasing the stagehands while I get ready. Or the
Mall-Mart manager, all of a sudden I find myself being a jerk,
eyeballing people suspiciously and checking my tie."</TE>
<TE>   As for "Pete," the nursing home attendant whose
stream-of-consciousness monologue routinely provokes an ovation,
Cottle says, "For me, Pete is this open expression"--he lets his jaw
go slack and begins free-associating about table condiments--" 'Oh
yeah, there's the creamer over there, I had some cream one time. I
know a guy who manufactured cream, yeah, he had, like, a huge
building.... ' "</TE>
<TE>   Back to being himself, Cottle says, "Stuff keeps flowing out of
him because he's a little bit off, and that's the way he tries to
make connections with people."</TE>
<TE>   Costumes in "Nickel and Dimed" efficiently telegraph each
character's status to the audience but don't allow for
down-to-the-last-detail perfection. "The wardrobe is more a
suggestion," Cottle explains. "When I play the rich lady for example,
I'm still wearing boxers underneath so that doesn't fit quite right
with the character; it doesn't feel like a complete changeover."</TE>
<TE>   Which is OK, Cottle says. "This show is not so much about the
character--it's about the story."</TE>
<TE>   As a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, Cottle collected a
few minimum-wage memories of his own. He'd grown up in Massachusetts
and earned a bachelor of fine arts in theater at UC Santa Barbara.
When he moved to Hollywood to pursue show business, Cottle followed
an age-old acting tradition and began working at a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this place in Santa Monica, where I was a busboy and
tended the register and also made coffee drinks," Cottle recalls. "I
always felt like 'Alice in Wonderland' where my head is like 90 feet
above the ground because I was always drinking the drinks I'd screwed
up--I'd be sweating, my heartbeat was 'boom, boom, boom' from
drinking these coffee things that I could never master."</TE>
<TE>   Cottle also worked at a Mailboxes Etc. "That was really fun," he
says tersely.</TE>
<TE>   Then he began landing small roles in films like "Wag the Dog" and
"The Wedding Singer." Since moving to Seattle in 1999, Cottle's
facility with accents has generated a steady stream of voice-over
work. He's also become a fixture on the local theater scene and
recently starred as Hamlet with the Seattle Shakespeare Company.</TE>
<TE>   So by the time Seattle's Intiman Theatre cast him in May in its
original production of "Nickel and Dimed," Cottle believed the menial
gigs were behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird at rehearsals playing this busboy and wiping tables,
and someone's telling me, 'You need to wipe that quicker,' and 'Pick
up that glass!' And I'm thinking, 'This is ... what? The reason I
went into theater was so I wouldn't have to do this stuff! My job is
supposed to be, you know ... "--Cottle assumes the voice of a
pretentious director--" 'Just put on some tights and be sad here.'
Those rehearsals definitely reminded me why I hope I'll continue to
get acting work."</TE>
<TE>   Cottle isn't out of the woods just yet. During every performance,
he and his "Nickel and Dimed" cast mates (Sharon Lockwood, Kristin
Flanders, Cynthia Jones, Cristine McMurdo-Wallis and Olga Sanchez)
help schlep props around during scene changes. "When I'm moving this
bed for the 19th time, I'm thinking, 'This stinks.' I'm just moving a
bed. There's nothing theatrical about it, I'm bending over and you're
seeing my butt. It's not acting. You're just seeing some guy getting
paid to move a bed. No joke, you're seeing the real thing."</TE>

<HD>'Birds' Rule the Bat Cave</HD>
<DH>Batman seems to have flown the coop, but this Gotham is
home to a dynamic trio in the WB network's fun new series that is
drenched in superhero noir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fleeing man is fatally injured when running into a truck. "Don't
let them get me," he cries out. Then the rats come.</LD>
<LD>   If the WB's "Birds of Prey" flies, it won't be because its first
half is easily fathomed by those unfamiliar with the DC comic book of
the same name. Why would it succeed?</LD>
<LD>   Try self-mocking humor and gorgeous dominatrixes in leather.</LD>
<TE>   Take notes:</TE>
<TE>   The setting is New Gotham, where Helena (Ashley Scott) calls
herself Huntress while operating from a high-tech secret lair (what
you know as a cave) with her legal guardian, Barbara (Dina Meyer),
who calls herself Oracle and tools around in a motorized wheelchair
after a bullet from the Joker ended her career as Batgirl. By the
way, Huntress is the daughter of Batman and the late, great Catwoman,
and she regularly spills her guts to the Jokeresque shrink Harleen
Quinzel (Mia Sara). And Oracle is the daughter of that bounder,
Commissioner Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her disability and being needed to run the technology at
Cave Central, Oracle is no shut-in, and she hits the streets of New
Gotham with her young ward. Huntress is a sort of punked-out La Femme
Nikita with attitude to burn, and the rigors of crime control are
making her testy.</TE>
<TE>   "Would it kill you to go to the grocery store once in a while?"
she grouses to Oracle. "You try fighting the forces of evil when your
blood sugar is low."</TE>
<TE>   Now, they are about to become a trio, for arriving from the
boonies is Dinah (Rachel Skarsten), a teenager whose telepathic gifts
include the power of touch. "This is beyond weird," says Dinah.</TE>
<TE>   Amen. Even though the caped Big Guy himself is somehow absent from
New Gotham, "Birds of Prey" follows in the great tradition of
superhero noir. It's grim, dark, smoky and, most important, ripping
good fun as these butt-kicking Dynamic Dolls have themselves some
nights on the town.</TE>
<TE>   And who is minding Wayne Manor? Why, Alfred the butler, of course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Birds of Prey" will be shown at 9 p.m. Wednesdays on the WB. The
network has rated it TV-14LV (may be unsuitable for children under
the age of 14, with advisories for coarse language and violence).</TE>

<HD>In This Case, 'So-So' Makes Headlines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Keep it simple" is a frequent refrain in the media and politics, a
mind-set that dictates boiling ideas down to snappy sound bites or
headlines in order to grab an easily distracted audience.</LD>
<LD>   This doctrine has seemingly guided recent coverage of ABC and
Disney. Before the TV season, the press was ready, even eager, to
write one of two compelling, easy-to-follow stories: ABC hits rock
bottom, with Walt Disney Chairman Michael Eisner cast as the ogre
(remember speculation he inspired "Shrek"?) who mismanaged his
early-career stamping ground into ruination; or Eisner and his
minions magically rescue ABC, mollifying cranky stockholders with a
storybook turnaround worthy of an electrical parade down Disneyland's
Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   Yet two weeks into the fall TV campaign, all you can say
definitively is that ABC is by no means a complete disaster, as some
pundits and rivals anticipated, nor an out-of-the-woods success, as
its daily press releases seem to imply.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, "so-so" and "OK" don't make for sexy headlines,
especially with all the networks in frantic public relations spin
mode--a smokescreen journalists sometimes inhale in our rush to
identify trends, given that such spin invariably mixes heavily
scented potpourri with a substance that helps your lawn grow.</TE>
<TE>   About the only more creative claims, in fact, are found in network
promos, which make remarkably liberal use of the word "hit," as in
ABC running ads referring to "MDs"--which ranked No. 70 last week and
third in its time slot--as a "new hit drama."</TE>
<TE>   Newsflash: Labeling "MDs" a hit at this point is tantamount to
calling the tallest of the seven dwarfs a giant.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the fate of broadcast networks and those who earn big
fat salaries from them still hinges on building nights--think NBC's
"Must-See TV" Thursday roster, or CBS' Monday--which can then (in
theory, anyway) dispatch their progeny to other nights. The trick is
to be a powerhouse in a couple of places and keep the lights on
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   So taking inventory of ABC's lineup and seeking to separate fact
from fiction, one finds a few bright spots, some places for cautious
optimism, problem areas and a couple of black holes where the network
could run bar mitzvah videos or an accordion player in a Mickey Mouse
suit and deliver roughly the same audience for a lot less money.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, "Alias" appears to have locked in a modest but loyal
following--despite the encroachment of HBO's "The Sopranos" on all
the networks' turf--and "The Practice" is weaker than in its heyday
but still formidable. "Monday Night Football" remains ABC's
most-watched show.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most significant, the network has so far established a
respectable presence Tuesday and Wednesday nights, with the new
sitcoms "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" and "Life
With Bonnie" exhibiting promise and the Damon Wayans vehicle "My Wife
and Kids" cementing its hit credentials versus "The Bernie Mac Show."
The second edition of "The Bachelor," God help us, also appears to be
drawing from the available pool of gullible women age 18 to 49.</TE>
<TE>   Even ABC's legitimate crowing regarding those nights should come
with a brief disclaimer. Fox, after all, has virtually sat out the
ratings game while televising playoff baseball, preempting programs
that would compete more directly for the attention of women and
younger viewers, thus freeing them to graze in the fields of others.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the week ended there, ABC would be OK. No such luck.</TE>
<TE>   It's still early, of course, but ABC is reeling Thursdays under
fire from NBC and CBS, has minimal traction Fridays and, like NBC,
runs a low-impact Saturday movie only as good as the titles
available.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinotopia" hasn't premiered yet, but ABC's experience with its
new dramas--"MDs," "Push, Nevada" and "That Was Then"--also
underscores that while the major networks can still reach staggering
highs, as in 30 million people watching "Friends" or "CSI," the lows
have never been lower. Simply put, now that the average home receives
nearly 90 channels, people don't show up strictly by default.</TE>
<TE>   Suffice it to say that if ABC officials could go back in time, the
premise "That Was Then" posits, they would have passed on that show
and been a bit less starry-eyed about "Push," a project from actor
Ben Affleck's production company that proves there are indeed
programs people wouldn't watch for a million bucks.</TE>
<TE>   (Someday, too, someone will rationally explain how networks can
sift through hundreds of scripts, produce 30 series prototypes, wean
them down to seven through focus-group testing and still introduce a
couple so roundly rejected by viewers they have to consider yanking
them after two telecasts.)</TE>
<TE>   Add it all up, divide by seven, and ABC has made a little headway
in addressing problems and planting seeds for the future but still
has a long way to go. The network certainly isn't the Cinderella
story the studio's Anaheim Angels have become, but as rebuilding
processes go, the game is far from over and at least the network
didn't fall on its face taking the field, which seemed a distinct
possibility based on how ABC stumbled last year.</TE>
<TE>   As for viewing the network's performance as a referendum on
Disney's stewardship, while the live-for-today exhaustion of "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" still haunts ABC, just looking at the
fall, it's premature to ride the bums out of town on a rail or carry
them off in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   But that sort of mealy-mouthed appraisal doesn't exactly sizzle as
a press release or banner headline--in the same way gubernatorial
candidates Gray Davis and Bill Simon wouldn't air ads that say
"Mediocre Leadership for California" or "Gray Davis: Because We're
Doing OK, Considering," as refreshing as that might sound.</TE>
<TE>   So what does ABC's back-to-school progress report say at this
stage? Actually, it isn't terribly different from overall grades for
the TV industry in general, which basically read as follows: Not bad.
Not great. Needs improvement. And not as simple as ABC.</TE>

<LD>   ABC Lands Pair of 'Eloise' Movies</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 50 years after they were first published, the "Eloise"
children's books about a mischievous 6-year-old girl are being made
into films. ABC has ordered two for its "Wonderful World of Disney"
series: "Eloise at the Plaza," for airing this season, and "Eloise at
Christmastime," for next year.</LD>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Sofia Vassilieva will star as the title character,
who lives at the Plaza Hotel in New York City; Julie Andrews will
portray her nanny. The films will be shot back-to-back in Toronto and
New York, beginning next month.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had many offers, "Eloise" creator Kay Thompson never
allowed her books to be made into movies. But when she died in 1998,
the rights went to her estate, which passed them to the publisher,
Simon &amp; Schuster, which obviously wasn't so reluctant.</TE>
<TE>   KTTV News Exec Adds KCOP to His Duties</TE>
<TE>   Jose Rios, vice president of news at KTTV-TV, will take charge of
the news operation at KCOP-TV starting next week. Both stations are
owned by News. Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In making the announcement, David Boylan, vice president and
general manager for KTTV and KCOP, said, "Jose Rios has been
instrumental in creating the strong newsroom we have today at Fox 11.
He is the ideal person to oversee our two news operations."</TE>
<TE>   Rios has been running the newsroom at KTTV for 10 years. He
previously worked at KCBS-TV for 13 years, the last two as news
director.</TE>
<TE>   Rios said both stations will benefit from the combination of
resources but also pledged that "each station will maintain its own
individuality in much of its coverage and its on-air presentation."</TE>
<TE>   Two other L.A. stations, Viacom's KCBS and KCAL-TV, also are being
overseen by a single news director, Nancy Bauer Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman's 'Home Office' Burglarized</TE>
<TE>   David Letterman had a little problem at the home office in
Manhattan: A thief made off with $4,000 from a desk inside the Ed
Sullivan Theater, police said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, an employee at Letterman's "Late Show" found a desk
drawer forced open and $4,000 cash missing, police spokesman Sgt.
Kevin Hayes said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A surveillance camera reportedly caught the burglar slipping into
the office on Sunday afternoon, but police have made no arrests. The
thief, wearing a hooded sweat shirt, managed to cover the camera
before opening the desk.</TE>
<TE>   The offices are upstairs from the Broadway theater where Letterman
tapes his nightly show for CBS.</TE>

<TE>   Teri Garr to Reveal She Has Multiple Sclerosis</TE>
<TE>   Actress Teri Garr ("Tootsie," "Young Frankenstein," "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind") has scheduled a news conference in New
York today to announce that she has multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   A news release about the event from MS Lifelines, a patient
service program, said Garr has had symptoms for 19 years, and quoted
her as saying, "I didn't tell people because I didn't want pity and I
was afraid I wouldn't get work. But others with MS need to know they
are not alone. We don't have to be victims."</TE>

<TE>   More Disney Sequels Starting on Home Video</TE>
<TE>   As it has done with other franchises, Disney is making sequels to

<TE>   The animated "101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure" will
feature the voices of Jason Alexander, Barry Bostwick and Martin
Short. It will be released on video and DVD Jan. 21. That will be
followed March 11 by the live-action "Inspector Gadget 2," starring
French Stewart of "3rd Rock From the Sun" in the lead role.</TE>

<TE>   Symphony's Song Titles Get X-Rated Twist</TE>
<TE>   Many classical music organizations are struggling financially
these days, but officials at the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra swear
they didn't turn to pornography to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody did, however. New Zealand police are trying to find out
how song titles on a promotional CD for the orchestra were replaced
with hard-core pornographic texts before they reached 8,000 people.
The substituted words were heard when some Internet-based media
players were used to listen to the disc, according to Melbourne's the
Age.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't know whether it was malicious or if it was some
school holiday prank by some techno whiz-kid," an orchestra
spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>The Edgier Side of the Edge of the World</HD>
<DH>Theater* This year's festival of productions in
sub-100-seat venues puts the emphasis on innovation, organizers say.</DH>

<LD>The subtitle of this year's fourth annual Edge of the World Theater
Festival is "Breaking New Ground." So what's new with this
agglomeration of 48 productions in 37 sub-100-seat venues?</LD>
<LD>   The festival, opening Thursday and playing through Oct. 20, is
becoming more selective. This year, about 10 applicants were
rejected, compared to only two last year and none the first two
years, said Ray Simmons and Amy Edlin, two of the festival's three
executive directors.</LD>
<LD>   The festival wants "edgy" work--though its directors admit that
the definition of the word is elusive. They have even devoted a
round-table session Oct. 20 to a discussion of what "edgy" means.</LD>
<TE>   Without naming names, Edlin and Simmons said the shows that were
rejected by the curators--Katharine Noon and the third festival
executive director, Christopher DeWan--didn't seem innovative or
uniquely theatrical. Among examples cited were sitcom-style plays, a
show in which one actor plays five characters and other performances
that weren't actual "plays."</TE>
<TE>   This year's festival is marginally more centralized than the
spread-out proceedings of the past. More than half of the shows are
in Hollywood and Silver Lake--enough that City Councilman Eric
Garcetti, who represents that area, arranged a $1,000 city grant for
the festival. One idea being floated is that the festival may look
for one or two theaters next year, in which a large chunk of festival
programming would be presented nearly around the clock. This year,
weekday programming begins no earlier than 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the trend toward centralization, festival organizers are
attempting to reach out to other neighborhoods by holding the four
round-table sessions at venues in other areas: 24th Street Theatre
just north of USC, Inglewood Playhouse, Autry Museum of Western
Heritage on the northeast corner of Griffith Park, and Armory
Northwest in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous festivals, this year's has formal nonprofit
status, complete with a board of directors and the three executive
directors. In the past, most festival decisions were made by a group
of 13 people, "each with very strong opinions," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   The budget, however, remains tiny--only $11,000, mostly spent on
printing. Theatre LA, the service and advocacy organization that
represents most L.A. theater companies and producers, contributed
$3,500. Other sources of revenue are application fees and sales of
"passports"--$15 passes that provide admission to any festival show
for an additional $5 per show, plus discounts at 21 restaurants, many
of which are near festival venues. The individual theaters keep
two-thirds of the passport revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Past festivals have raised questions about whether the festival
period is different from a normal 10 days in L.A.'s sub-100-seat
theater scene, which produces more than 1,000 shows each year. "In
L.A., there's a festival going on every week," Simmons said. But
Edlin and Simmons pointed to a handful of productions they said were
created for the festival and others that were scheduled to coincide
with the festival.</TE>
<TE>   Little progress has been made in diversifying the festival along
ethnic or racial lines. Only one minority-specific company, the Asian
American Lodestone Theatre, is taking part. Simmons and Edlin said
they sent applications to a number of other companies that weren't
made up predominantly of white artists but received no responses.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons and Edlin are unabashed in their hope that their audience
is younger than normal theater audiences. "Otherwise it's a dead art
form," Simmons said.</TE>

<LD>Retiree Jerry Cohen's savings are slipping away as he cares for his
ailing wife, Harriet, at home. If he put her into a nursing home
instead, Medicaid would pick up most of the cost. "It just doesn't
make any sense. Any rational person can realize a home environment
with a caregiver is best," says Cohen, who echoes the experience of
many when he adds, "I love her now more than when I first met her."</LD>
<LD>   The struggles and rewards of caregiving are given equal treatment
in "And Thou Shalt Honor ..." (9 p.m., KCET), a thoughtful two-hour
documentary by Harry Wiland and Dale Bell. Narrator Joe Mantegna, who
looks after his mom in suburban Chicago, is one of 30 million (and
counting) Americans caring for an elderly or disabled parent, spouse
or friend.</LD>
<LD>   The filmmakers explore the topic through stories and interviews
from across the U.S., marred only by syrupy music.</LD>
<TE>   One woman who cares for her parents and a blind sister says that
it's "like herding cats," and that she needs three arms for the job.
In another family, after the mother suffered a stroke, her three
adult children devised an imperfect but workable plan: She spends
four months a year with each sibling. Meanwhile, a stubbornly proud
mother who lives alone in New York City refuses any help from her
children in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Those in nursing homes, the film makes clear, depend on the
kindness of overworked strangers, including a 28-year veteran who
makes less than $10 an hour to hold the hands of the dying, among
other duties. But William Thomas, founder of the Eden Alternative in
upstate New York, and others are trying to reinvent the nursing home
as an environment full of children, animals and plants.</TE>
<TE>   A lively idea, in a film that celebrates the circle of life.</TE>

<LD>The second week of the fall television season saw a pattern begin to
take hold: CBS was first in overall viewing behind its Monday and
Thursday lineups and NBC enjoyed a clear advantage among young adults
sought by advertisers, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by
Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Several new programs have cooled a bit after initial sampling,
with some of the better performances based on time periods and
competition delivered by NBC's nostalgic "American Dreams" on Sunday
and CBS' crime-fighting "Hack," which has won its time slot on
successive Fridays.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' weekly victory came despite exceedingly plain results for the
movie "Hell on Heels: The Battle for Mary Kay," starring Shirley
MacLaine. "Becker," in its move to Sunday, also underscored how some
shows skew to an older audience, as the Ted Danson comedy ranked No.
32 in overall viewing--thanks largely to adults over 55 who tuned
in--but finished No. 69 among adults age 18 to 49, the demographic
most closely tracked by media buyers.</LD>
<TE>   Also under the microscope is NBC's second-year comedy "Scrubs,"
which gave up 35% of the audience that watched "Friends" in the
preceding half-hour, comparable with other shows that occupied that
precious patch of Thursday real estate last season.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "The West Wing" appears to have lost some of its
constituency, attracting its smallest audience for a new episode
since the program's first year.</TE>

<DL>INCIRLIK AIR BASE, Turkey</DL>
<LD>After 12 years of trade sanctions and of Western fighter jets
patrolling and bombing northern and southern Iraq, Saddam Hussein
still has an integrated air defense system with radar, missiles and
artillery that poses a daily threat to American pilots, U.S. military
officials here say.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one is claiming that those air defenses are especially
sophisticated, or that the U.S. Air Force could not overwhelm them in
the event of a full-scale war, their existence serves as a testament
to Baghdad's disdain of terms imposed on it and to its determination
to continue fighting. In the four years Iraq has been shooting at
American warplanes, it has not hit one. But it keeps trying.</LD>
<LD>   "They are always trying to shoot somebody down," said Capt. Pat
Driscoll, an F-15 pilot who patrols the northern "no-fly" zone over
Iraq and who flew in the southern zone last year. "It happens almost
daily. Lately, it has been happening more frequently."</LD>
<TE>   The United States, along with Britain and formerly France, has
been patrolling the skies of northern and southern Iraq since the end
of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, with the stated goals of enforcing the
no-fly zones and monitoring Baghdad's compliance with U.N.
resolutions. Iraq rejects the patrols as a violation of its
sovereignty and, since 1998, has been firing back. Hussein has even
placed a bounty on the head of any American pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, this has been a low-intensity conflict that has
attracted little attention outside Iraq--although since 1998 alone,
U.S. forces are said to have flown more than 30,000 sorties over the
north, firing into Iraqi territory 171 times. But with Washington
considering an invasion, and with the Air Force certain to shoulder
the burden of an opening offensive, the lessons learned from
Operation Northern Watch and its counterpart, Operation Southern
Watch, are crucial to military planners. Incirlik in southern Turkey
is the base for the northern operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the biggest thing we've learned is we've stayed in touch
with our adversary," said Col. John "Buck" Burgess Jr., an F-16 pilot
and commander of air operations at the base. "We watch his tactics.
We know how he operates. That's as much a reason for being here as
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   But there is a flip side, Burgess acknowledged: Hussein's forces
have had the same opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "He does the same to us, I have to say," Burgess said during an
interview inside his steel-and-concrete-fortified command center. "He
has gone to school on our operations. He has seen us for nearly 12
years. You have to know he is watching everything that we do."</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Iraq change its tactics routinely--it does all it
can to thwart any response by U.S. pilots. Military officials are
careful not to reveal too much, saying they don't want Iraq to know
all they have learned. But during a series of interviews over two
days, they offered some examples of what American forces have
experienced--and what they might expect in the event the U.S. moves
ahead with plans for an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "He still has weapons systems," said Brig. Gen. Robin "Scottie"
Scott, commander of Operation Northern Watch. "He has an integrated
defense: surveillance radar with target tracking. It is sophisticated
enough they are able to engage us whenever we are in the area."</TE>
<TE>   The northern no-fly zone is relatively small, about the size of
Maryland. Although much of it is controlled by the Kurds in a
semiautonomous region, Hussein maintains a grip over a broad swath of
territory that starts in the north near the border with Syria and
extends south to the city of Mosul and then east beneath
Kurdish-controlled Sulaymaniyah.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has complicated the ability of U.S. pilots to respond largely
by placing its antiaircraft artillery batteries and surface-to-air
missile sites near populated areas--a strategy that could also tie
the Pentagon's hands in the event of an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Army Col. Steve West, chief of staff for Operation Northern Watch,
said some of the heaviest concentrations of antiaircraft weapons in
the north are around Mosul and near Ayn Sifni and Saddam Lake. But
what is especially problematic, he said, is the precise location of
any given weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's next to a building; it's next to a mosque; it's next to a
soccer field where kids are playing. We have a right to defend
ourselves, [but] we are gravely concerned about collateral damage,"
West said.</TE>
<TE>   With an increased number of passenger flights in the no-fly zone,
which are allowed, there is some concern that Iraq will shoot down a
passenger liner and then blame the U.S. to win a public relations
victory, West added. He said the Air Force goes to great lengths to
distinguish between military and passenger aircraft and noted that
there has not been a violation of the no-fly zone in the north for
more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the main concern is the shots being taken at U.S.
jets. Pilots said they are fired on by weapons hidden in orchards,
again making it difficult to respond without the potential for
injuring civilians. They also said Hussein's forces try to lure them
into areas with heavy concentrations of antiaircraft weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "They are doing whatever they can to shoot us down," said
"Drifter," an F-16 captain who asked to be identified only by his
call name to protect his family. He said that while he is flying, he
frequently sees muzzle flashes on the ground and explosions around
him.</TE>
<TE>   Incirlik is of vital strategic importance to the United States.
Because Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
the military infrastructure is compatible with the U.S. operations.
The base is located near such potential hot spots as Iran and Syria,
and is about 570 miles from Baghdad. Flying time to the Iraqi border
is about an hour because pilots travel east over Turkey to avoid
violating Syrian airspace before heading south.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 4,000 personnel are stationed at the base, less than
half of them assigned to Operation Northern Watch; Incirlik is also
used for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. And although the
northern operation technically is a combined task force, the U.S.
component far outnumbers all others: There are 1,161 U.S. personnel,
215 Britons and 41 Turks.</TE>
<TE>   The base is equipped with American, British and Turkish war
technology--from air-to-surface and air-to-air fighters to jets used
for electronic warfare. But although officials say the composition of
their resources gives them unrivaled air superiority, a lot of the
equipment is old or outdated.</TE>
<TE>   Air tankers used for midair refueling were built in the late 1950s
and early '60s. Some flew missions over Vietnam. The main computer
inside the AWACS, America's cutting-edge airborne radar system, was
built in the '60s and still uses vacuum tubes. Even some of the
fighter jets, like Driscoll's F-15, are nearly 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that some of the systems, like the tankers, have
been upgraded over the years and that others, like the AWACS
computer, still do the job well.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond the equipment for Operation Northern Watch, there is no
sign of a military buildup at Incirlik, and officials say their
mission has not changed since Washington began to talk about a
military strike against Iraq. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
said recently that he had ordered U.S. aircraft to strike at more
"fixed" air defense targets such as buildings and command and control
centers, but officers here say they have not received any new orders.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a discernible change in mood. Some said that
since the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., they have sensed a new public
awareness back home and appreciation of the military's work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more of an acknowledgment of us and more of an
understanding we are here and everywhere," said Capt. Bob Shelton,
who recently piloted a tanker jet as part of Operation Northern
Watch. "In 1991, there was Desert Storm, and people think it just
went away. We have been here ever since, keeping a presence. We have
guys getting shot at every day. Even my parents didn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from Hussein's efforts, it appears that an equally grave
danger to American forces in the region is the repetitive nature of
their assignment. Complacency can kill. The Air Force is very
concerned, for example, about maintenance. Even a single pebble on
the runway can damage the engine of an F-15 or F-16.</TE>
<TE>   As Washington and much of the world debate the merits and
disadvantages of waging war against Iraq, the dueling by Iraqi
gunners and U.S. pilots will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in a war," Scott said. "We're in combat."</TE>

<HD>Lantronix Adjusts Loss by $2.2 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Dow Jones/AP</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lantronix Inc. said in its annual report filed Tuesday that it
increased its loss for the fiscal year ending June 30 by $2.2 million
because independent valuations of some assets resulted in additional
impairment charges.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine company, which makes servers to control devices like
bar-code scanners via the Internet, had reported in September a loss
of $91.3 million on revenue of $57.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   The $2.2 million adjustment included a $1.3-million impairment
expense, $600,000 from reserves for bad debts and $300,000 from
unrecorded liabilities.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Lantronix closed Tuesday at 39 cents on Nasdaq, down 4
cents. The stock is hovering near the 52-week low of 25 cents hit on
Oct. 1. Lantronix said it completed the first phase of a turnaround
plan, which involves an estimated 22% work force reduction. It
expected to record a first-quarter restructuring charge of $3 million
to $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the annual report, Lantronix said that Steve Cotton, its
former chief financial officer and chief operating officer, sued the
company, alleging breach of contract, wrongful termination,
defamation and other charges. Lantronix ended Cotton's employment in
May, but gave no reason for the termination.</TE>
<TE>   The annual report also said two former employees, Donald and Diane
Dunstan--cofounders of US Software Corp.--sued the company alleging
securities violations, fraud and negligence.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the company's chairman and chief executive resigned after
the company disclosed that revenue for the past two years was less
than previously reported.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the hardware and software maker restated its fiscal year
2001 financial statements to reflect a new revenue-recognition policy
it adopted for distributor sales.</TE>
<TE>   Lantronix is also being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission about events leading to the restatement.</TE>

<LD>SSP Solutions Inc. ended its development agreement with Wave Systems

<LD>   As a result of the settlement, Irvine-based SSP Solutions expects
to record a gain of about $1.2 million in its third quarter and to
remove $3.3 million in liabilities from its balance sheet.</LD>
<LD>   In a press release Tuesday, SSP said the settlement will improve
working capital and increase stockholders' equity, and is one of
several moves during the third quarter to improve its balance sheet
and lower operating costs.</LD>
<TE>   SSP expects to issue third-quarter results on or before Nov. 15.
The company reported a loss of 52 cents a share in the year-ago

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The increase in U.S. office vacancies slowed in the third quarter as
companies put less space up for sublease and development fell,
according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</LD>
<LD>   About 14.4% of downtown office buildings were vacant as of the end
of September, compared with 14.1% at the end of June and 13.2% in
March, the property broker said. The amount of space available for
sublease fell for the first time since 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The report signals that vacancies may be peaking after the rate
rose from a low of less than 9% in 2000, landlords and analysts said.
The number of office jobs grew for a seventh month in September even
as nonfarm payrolls fell, according to the Labor Department.</LD>

<HD>Musicians Sue Vivendi Over MP3.com Service</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Vivendi Universal unit has been sued by musicians Bob Dylan, Billy
Joel and James Taylor, who say MP3.com Inc. had no right to transmit
more than 700 of their songs over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The suit targets an online music distribution service that MP3.com
launched before it was acquired last year by Vivendi. The company
paid out more than $100 million to settle copyright suits with all
five major record labels. MP3.com gained licensing agreements with
the labels to provide access to their music.</LD>
<LD>   The artists say they retained the copyright to hundreds of
original compositions recorded by them or other artists. Plaintiffs'
attorney Michael Elkin said that even though MP3.com stopped
infringing on his clients' music in May 2000, Dylan, Joel and Taylor
can still sue over previous infringements. They're seeking $150,000
for each infringement.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi declined to comment.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said it has recalled 424,164 Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable cars with adjustable pedals because the brake and accelerator
pedals on about 10% of the models are too close.</LD>
<LD>   Simultaneously stepping on the brake and the accelerator could
unintentionally increase the vehicle speed or make it more difficult
to stop, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
said.</LD>
<LD>   The recalled vehicles are model year 2000 and 2001 vehicles and a
small number of 2002 models, Ford said.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Toyota Motor Corp. recalled 59,394 of its Echo compact
cars because snow could accumulate in the rear wheel well and
eventually could damage the brake line during driving, NHTSA said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. Chief Executive Richard Selden said U.S.
regulators might have more extensive concerns about its experimental
Replagal medicine for Fabry disease than the company indicated last
week.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology company is trying to win U.S. clearance of
Replagal for conditions related to a rare genetic disorder that
destroys major organs and causes severe pain. Transkaryotic has said
the Food and Drug Administration found the company's pain-reduction
study results insufficient to support approval.</LD>
<LD>   The company said last week that it would pursue Replagal clearance
based on research evaluating whether the drug helps protect kidney
and heart function, a secondary goal of its studies. Selden said
Tuesday that the FDA disagrees with Transkaryotic's interpretation of
those findings, though the company expects to have a chance to
persuade regulators at an FDA panel hearing this year or early 2003.</LD>

<LD>MSC Software Corp., a Santa Ana developer of simulation software used
in product testing, said it would report a loss for the third quarter
and lower-than-expected revenue because of weakness in the economy.
The firm also is cutting 8% to 10% of its work force.</LD>
<LD>   MSC expects a loss, excluding costs, of 5 to 7 cents a share, less
than the 12-cent profit estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call.</LD>
<LD>   MSC has cut about 100 jobs from its work force of 1,500 in the
last two quarters and will make additional reductions, spokesman Todd
Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   MSC shares rose 15 cents to $7.60 after the close of regular
trading. Earlier, the stock rose 35 cents to $7.45 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>   U.S. airlines said seat and flight capacity last month was 9%
lower than in 2000 because carriers reduced flights after the

<HD>SEC Sues ACLN for Alleged Fraud</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Three former executives at Belgian shipping
firm also face civil charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEIL ROLAND</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ACLN Ltd., a Belgian-based company that maintained its U.S. investor
relations office in Los Angeles, was charged Tuesday with "an
exceptionally bold and elaborate financial fraud" in a Securities and
Exchange Commission suit.</LD>
<LD>   The transport firm, which said it shipped used cars to Africa from
Europe and sold new cars in Africa, was "little more than a shell
company" whose executives defrauded investors of millions of dollars
by cooking the books from 1998 to the third quarter of 2001, the SEC
said.</LD>
<LD>   The company's stock, which traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
was suspended in March by order of the SEC--the first time the agency
had ordered such a halt for a Big Board stock since 1975.</LD>
<TE>   ACLN reported profit of $42.4 million on $168 million of revenue
in 2000, much of which it credited to a new-car exporting business
that never existed, the lawsuit contends.</TE>
<TE>   The company never owned a car-carrier ship that it said was its
largest physical asset, and reported $117 million in bank deposits
last year when its balance was less than $2 million, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   ACLN's shares, which traded as high as $50 on the NYSE in
September 2001, fell 5 cents to 25 cents Tuesday in over-the-counter
trading. The stock once was recommended by brokerages including J.P.
Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also filed charges against three former executives who it
said controlled the company and exploited the fraud through stock
sales. The executives--former ACLN Chairman Joseph Bisschops, former
Chief Executive Aldo Labiad and former Chief Operating Officer Alex
de Ridder--sold $80 million of company stock at inflated prices, the
suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Bisschops and de Ridder also are targets of criminal
money-laundering investigations by Belgian authorities, SEC assistant
enforcement director Richard Sauer said. Bisschops is a fugitive, and
Labiad and De Ritter live in Belgium, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear if ACLN and the three former executives will
contest the U.S. civil fraud charges, Sauer said. Lawyers for the
company and Labiad didn't respond to requests for comment. The two
other defendants don't yet have attorneys, the SEC official said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC and other authorities have frozen $45 million in bank
accounts in Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco. The
agency said it will try to distribute this money to defrauded
shareholders, many of whom live in the United States. It also is
seeking to fine the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to suing the ACLN executives, the SEC said it settled
civil fraud charges against the Cyprus affiliate of BDO
International, ACLN's former auditor, and two former BDO partners.</TE>
<TE>   They failed to conduct "even the most basic audit procedures," the
SEC said. ACLN is incorporated in Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   BDO agreed to pay $62,196 of fees received from the company, and
BDO's partners--Minas and Christakis Ioannou--accepted a permanent
ban on auditing public companies trading in the U.S., the SEC said.
The Ioannous did not admit or deny the charges.</TE>

<HD>Speaking Up for Silent Films</HD>
<DH>Courts: If one man in entertainment industry gets his way,
a copyright extension will be struck down, freeing old movies, books
and songs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Supreme Court hears arguments this morning about whether to
strike down a law that extended copyrights by 20 years, Michael Agee
will be one of the few people in the entertainment world rooting for
the justices to kill the protection.</LD>
<LD>   "A film is an expression of ideas, and copyright in effect builds
a fence around those ideas," said Agee, who runs Hal Roach Studios, a
fabled silent-movie operation, as a one-man enterprise on behalf of
an investment group. "Do we want a society where every thought, every
expression, every story is owned by someone?"</LD>
<LD>   To most of Agee's colleagues in the film business, the answer is a
resounding "yes."</LD>
<TE>   If the court finds the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act
unconstitutional, it will cut the term from 95 years to 75, which is
what it was before the Bono Act became law in 1998. Material from the
mid-1920s immediately will start entering the public
domain--everything from music by Irving Berlin to stories by Ernest
Hemingway to novels by Virginia Woolf.</TE>
<TE>   The cache also includes 60 Laurel and Hardy shorts to which Roach
Studios owns the rights. If the Bono Act disappears, any fan or film
company could issue its own versions of the comedy classics. Over the
last decade, Roach has sold about 60,000 videocassettes and 50,000
DVDs of the duo's silent films. Roach also would lose any potential
income from documentary makers who want to use Laurel and Hardy
snippets.</TE>
<TE>   But Agee, who lives in Yorba Linda, doesn't care about that.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old film buff, a cousin of critic and "African Queen"
screenwriter James Agee, is more than a casual supporter of Stanford
professor Larry Lessig's attempts to overturn the Bono Act. With the
help of a Duke University law professor, Agee filed a 30-page
supporting brief with the Supreme Court. It argues that Hollywood's
attempt to uphold the law is encouraging a form of cultural
murder--"the irrevocable physical decomposition of a large fraction
of the golden years of American cinema."</TE>
<TE>   It's a lonely position. Just about every artists' group in the
country, it seems, has filed briefs arguing that the law should be
left untouched: the Motion Picture Assn. of America, the Songwriters
Guild of America, the Recording Artists Coalition, the Recording
Industry Assn. of America, the Nashville Songwriters Assn.
International, the Directors Guild of America, ASCAP and BMI.</TE>
<TE>   What's at stake is not only money--the reissue of classics funds
the production of new films, the MPAA notes--but the question of
whether American culture should have a gatekeeper deciding which
long-ago artistic works are allowed to be available.</TE>
<TE>   A footnote in the MPAA brief, for instance, asserts that what
happened with Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" shows "copyright
protection promotes preservation and distribution." When the film was
believed to be out of copyright in the 1970s, the motion picture
association says, the copies shown were "horrid." It was only when
Paramount gained control of the film by exploiting the copyright in
the underlying short story that the picture quality was restored and
the film returned to its full length, the industry group argues.</TE>
<TE>   But this take on history, supporters of the public domain point
out, skips over how the once-obscure movie became a beloved
touchstone in the first place: television stations showed it
repeatedly during the years when it was believed to be out of
copyright.</TE>
<TE>   "Other lost classics would find new life in the public domain
because they can be made available by anyone," Agee said. "There are
works out there that people haven't thought about for decades. But if
there's a dime to be made, people will put them out. Dimes don't mean
anything to billion-dollar corporations, but they will to smaller
players."</TE>
<TE>   Many Films Are Lost</TE>
<TE>   Only 20% of the films made in the 1920s still exist, according to
the Library of Congress. Sometimes, destruction came at the hands of
the studios, who wanted to salvage the valuable silver from the
nitrate reels. In other cases, the films wasted away from simple
neglect.</TE>
<TE>   An unknown but higher proportion of the era's blockbusters, the
full-length feature films, survive. Some are readily available, and
some are available only with difficulty in secondhand versions. Many
languish unseen in studio vaults, in the holdings of amateur and
professional archivists and at the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Even Harold Lloyd's "Safety Last," which has the iconic scene of
the hero dangling from a clock--probably the most famous image from
the silent era--is generally unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   So are Michael Curtiz's "Noah's Ark" and Clarence Brown's Klondike
tale "The Trail of '98," both epics that were the "Titanic" of their
day. Capra's "Power of the Press," starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as
a cub newspaper reporter, also is highly regarded but extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to see.</TE>
<TE>   The motion picture association's brief takes direct aim at Agee's
assertions, saying it instead will "offer the Court a real-world
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   First of all, the brief says, the industry is doing all it can to
preserve what still can be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "Studios have started to devote millions of dollars each year to
preservation and restoration," the MPAA says.</TE>
<TE>   One acknowledged role of copyright is to act as incentive: The
creator of a successful work enjoys certain benefits, usually
financial, that inspire someone else to create. But if the studios
don't own the original works, the MPAA brief argues, they probably
won't be able to produce derivative works such as anniversary
editions.</TE>
<TE>   An example cited in the brief is Warner Bros.' 50th anniversary
edition of Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane," which is not only restored
but includes newsreel footage of the premiere and running commentary
by director Peter Bogdanovich and critic Roger Ebert. Nor would
Warner Bros. spend $350,000 to restore "Casablanca" if it didn't own
it, the motion picture association says. (To reacquaint the justices
with these classics, the MPAA sent DVDs to the court.)</TE>
<TE>   "Petitioners," the brief notes, "may take issue with this logic."</TE>
<TE>   Boy, does he. The camera negative of "Citizen Kane" was rendered
for its silver content in the mid-1970s, Agee said. It's only because
a Library of Congress vault custodian made a copy that Warner Bros.
had first-generation material to restore.</TE>
<TE>   "The brief conveniently fails to note that all of these classic
studio films which have supposedly been preserved have mainly been
preserved at the taxpayer's expense by the Library and the American
Film Institute," Agee said.</TE>
<TE>   At Universal Studios, silent films were burned whenever fuel was
needed for a fire scene. Yet they still control the rights.</TE>
<TE>   A Call for Public Access</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brownlow, an Englishman who is the leading historian of the
silent era, believes that all silent films should have long ago
entered the public domain.</TE>
<TE>   "These films are your history," he said. "Quite apart from their
value as entertainment, they present an image of America that isn't
just a period confection. It's the real thing. This is the way people
lived, the way they looked, and it's absolutely priceless. To think
it's being allowed to rot is a cultural crime."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brownlow doesn't think overturning the Bono Act will usher
in a golden age of rediscovery.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, there's the problem of music.</TE>
<TE>   Many hobbyists who would want to reissue a treasured silent film
couldn't afford the full orchestral treatment it would demand. But at
least the law's removal would greatly ease the way for documentary
makers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to pay the studios absurd amounts, up to $10,000 a
minute, to excerpt films they've forgotten they own," Brownlow said.</TE>
<TE>   The historian immediately thought of one silent film he'd like to
reissue if the Bono Act were struck down, but he was silent on what
it is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd better not mention the title. I have the only print of it,"
Brownlow said. "The studio holds the rights, and they don't want to
do it themselves. So many minor works are hidden because of
copyright."</TE>
<TE>   Agee, too, has a few films he'd like to bring back, including "The
Winning of Barbara Worth," the last of the silent epic westerns that
marked Gary Cooper's debut.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many silent movies that are in people's basements,"
Agee said. "They can't show them and don't know who owns them."</TE>
<TE>   As for his Laurel and Hardy films, Agee acknowledged that Roach
could face competition, but he's confident that his studio's clean,
crisp versions would win out.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "Anything I lose, I could make up by putting out
other films.... Even if I lost everything, I'd still be opposed to
this law."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Business Loans Up 34%</HD>
<DH>Banking: Regulators point to telecom woes, allegations of
corporate fraud and the terrorist attacks as causes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a further sign of economic weakness, the number of large business
loans showing symptoms of stress, including default, shot up 34% this
year to $236.1 billion, U.S. banking regulators said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The troubled telecommunications sector, corporate fraud
allegations, the tepid economy and repercussions from the Sept. 11
attacks were blamed for the surge.</LD>
<LD>   The Shared National Credit Review of syndicated bank loans--which
examines loans of at least $20 million shared by three or more
banks--is an annual snapshot issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency. The review is based on bank data during May and June
and in some cases the first quarter of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   A record $19.6 billion in credits were classified as losses, up
145% from the previous year's losses of $8 billion, the regulators
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of those losses, 39% were associated with the stumbling
telecommunications and cable industries. Those sectors contributed
75% of the increase in adversely affected loans, regulators added.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, adversely rated big loans grew at a slower pace
than in 2001, when they surged by 86%, regulators said in their
annual review.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in troubled loans is a hangover from days of easier
credit during the economic boom of the 1990s, analysts said. But for
all their troubles, banks are much better diversified than in past
recessions, having spread risks by splitting loans with other banks
or by packaging loans to sell as securities to investors, thus
reducing the likelihood of bank failures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's evidence of a much more robust financial system than it used
to be," said Christopher Low, chief economist for FTN Financial.</TE>
<TE>   The news came as little surprise to investors, who already had
absorbed a string of profit warnings from banks that have been forced
to add loan-loss reserves after recent examinations by regulators.
Concerns about lending to large corporations were the main factor in
driving down a Bloomberg index of 52 bank stocks by 23.5% in the six
weeks ended Monday, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The actual release of the government loan figures prompted what
analysts called a "relief rally" Tuesday, sending the Bloomberg bank
index up more than 4%.</TE>
<TE>   "The stocks had just imploded over the last 30 days," said Hoefer
&amp; Arnett banking analyst Richard X. Bove.</TE>
<TE>   "So today they got a breather--it's a perfect example of sell on
rumor, buy on fact."</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday that despite
charge-offs, classified loans and delinquent credits at commercial
banks, banks remain healthy on strong profits and high levels of
capital and reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Greenspan and other observer warned that more losses may be
ahead for banks.</TE>
<TE>   "My worry is that's not the end of the story," said Alan Ruskin of
4CAST Inc. about the loans report. Bad loans may spread beyond the
hardest-hit industries such as telecommunications, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And though banks still have plenty of credit available, they may
be tightening lending standards for some businesses and consumers as
losses mount, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have economic and credit circumstances such as this,
there are going to be borrowers who don't deserve to get credit under
the same terms and conditions they might have gotten a few years
ago," said David Gibbons, deputy comptroller of the currency for
credit risk.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer E. Scott Reckard contributed to this report,
and Reuters was used in compiling it.</TE>

<LD>The port closure isn't hurting all businesses that depend on
international trade: Through luck as much as pluck, many local
garment manufacturers, off-price apparel sellers and discount stores
have found ways to eke out gains.</LD>
<LD>   David Glasberg, president of Vernon-based U.F.N. Textile Group
Inc., said that after a very slow summer his phone started ringing
with orders from nervous retailers looking to quickly diversify their
sources of supply.</LD>
<LD>   Online discount fashion seller Bluefly Inc. is looking forward to
a windfall of new designer looks as department stores and other
retailers cancel late orders.</LD>
<TE>   And at Commerce-based 99 Cents Only Stores, executives are hoping
that proximity to the ports will enable them to buy time-sensitive
goods such as Halloween products that might not get to full-price
sellers in time.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that because of what's happening at the ports, we'll
have a greater selection of merchandise and at prices that will be
more attractive," said Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of
Bluefly. "It's unfortunate, but that's the nature of the off-price
industry. We tend to benefit when other players in the industry
suffer."</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S. economy as well as countless companies and workers
across the globe, the shutdown of West Coast ports has taken a
painful toll, costing an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion a day and
prompting canceled sales, factory closures and job layoffs across the
country. Even with ports expected to reopen tonight, many
manufacturers and retailers worry that a logjam at the docks will
prevent them from getting their products in time for planned
promotions and peak selling days.</TE>
<TE>   Other importers and retailers could find themselves oversupplied.
Unsure of when the ports would be back in business, some companies
duplicated orders for key parts or products and shipped them out via
air freight, meaning they soon may be faced with double the number of
necessary items.</TE>
<TE>   But one company's excess is another company's bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   The close-out industry, including 99 Cents Only, Big Lots Inc.,
Ross Stores Inc. and others, has built its business on buying
unwanted merchandise from manufacturers and retailers for a fraction
of the original price, saving those companies from total losses when
their goods are canceled or don't sell.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened at the ports will certainly be a benefit to the
close-out sellers," said Todd Slater, a retail analyst with Lazard in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the off-pricers are going to be swimming in a sea of
available and probably very compelling merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   Big Lots, the nation's largest close-out seller with 1,375 stores,
said it anticipates being able to pick up some of the fallout from
the port crisis, although much of the excess might not be apparent
until after the holiday season, said Al Bell, Big Lots' vice
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio-based company, which recently renamed its Pic 'N' Save
stores Big Lots, has been able to avoid delays in most of its direct
imports, Bell said, by shipping through the Panama Canal to the East
Coast.</TE>
<TE>   With Thanksgiving falling six days later this year than last,
retailers were already facing a shorter holiday selling season. If
key products are delayed as a result of the backup on the docks, that
means even less time in front of the shopping public and more
likelihood that goods will eventually filter down to the discount
sellers, Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   At 99 Cents Only, President Eric Schiffer is hoping that his
stores will be able to pick up some of the excess merchandise at the
ports sooner than that. In addition to delayed holiday items,
Schiffer said, the company also can quickly turn around products that
were intended for overseas buyers but have since been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "These unusual situations create unique opportunities for us, and
we're on the lookout for those," Schiffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses counted their gains long before disruption
occurred at the ports. Local sewers and knitters started getting new
accounts last winter, when retailers and designers first got wind of
possible port troubles and wanted to ensure their goods would make it
on time, Ilse Metcheck of the California Fashion Assn. said.</TE>
<TE>   U.F.N. Textile's Glasberg said orders for fabric and clothing
started pouring in as nervous retailers who rely on Asian-made goods
looked to quickly diversify their sources of supply.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-area apparel makers, which specialize in rapid
production, have seen that happen before. After the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks last year, some local shops saw a temporary surge
in orders when foreign-made goods got bottled up at the ports. But
the domestic industry can't continue to exist indefinitely waiting
for disasters, Glasberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "A few days ago they ignored me. Now I'm the good guy," Glasberg
said. "I hope this makes the big retailers realize that there are big
risks to producing everything overseas."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Landfield, a Los Angeles apparel broker who distributes
close-out goods, said businesses such as his may do well in the
aftermath of the ports closure, but added that the gains probably
will be short-lived and less than satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't wish this on anyone, but we will probably be very
busy," he said.</TE>

<HD>MWD's Vote Endangers Cadiz's Future</HD>
<DH>Water: The cancellation of a Mojave storage project is
another financial blow to the Santa Monica firm, whose stock has
plunged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The demise Tuesday of Cadiz Inc.'s plan to build a
multimillion-dollar water storage project in the Mojave Desert places
the company under a huge financial strain that raises the question of
whether it can survive.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which was to be built in partnership with the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, was to generate
an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in revenue for the company
over the next 50 years. It also was to become the centerpiece of its
transformation from a modest agricultural producer to a global water
resource enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   The MWD board voted Tuesday, however, to abandon the project,
citing, among other concerns, the company's questionable financial
strength and doubts that the district could be adequately protected
against the possibility of a Cadiz default on its joint obligations.</LD>
<TE>   Cadiz suggested in a statement Tuesday night that the MWD may have
violated its contract with the company by killing the project before
formally reviewing its environmental impact report.</TE>
<TE>   "From our perspective, they are obligated by the contract to
complete the environmental review process," said Cadiz spokeswoman
Wendy Mitchell. Mitchell would not say whether the company was
planning litigation, a bankruptcy filing or any other action.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reviewing all of our options right now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   MWD lawyers maintained, however, that the board's action was
"legally defensible."</TE>
<TE>   Cancellation of the project comes at an exceptionally perilous
moment for Santa Monica-based Cadiz. An interest payment of $7
million to bondholders is due within a week. A bank loan of about $35
million is due at the end of January. That loan from ING Baring Bank
has customarily been rolled over each year on the expectation that it
would eventually be paid off from water project revenue--now a dashed
hope.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders are likely to feel as pained as debt holders. Cadiz
shares fell 76% on Nasdaq on Tuesday, closing at 36 cents, on
stunning volume of 5.6 million shares--even before the MWD vote was
taken. A similar fall presumably awaits the stock today. The stock
traded at more than $8 as recently as June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the project also places a harsh light on Keith
Brackpool, the company's chairman and chief executive and the leading
promoter of the water project.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool made himself a prominent figure on the California
political scene by contributing liberally to Democratic candidates,
especially Gov. Gray Davis, who received more than $235,000 from
Brackpool and Cadiz over the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   He placed such party stalwarts as former Rep. Tony Coelho on the
Cadiz board and hired Bruce Babbitt, the former Democratic governor
of Arizona and Clinton administration Interior secretary, to head a
subsidiary devoted to developing water resource clients in the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   This gave Cadiz a high profile when it was promoting its pet
project to the politically sensitive MWD in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But investment professionals say Brackpool also kept many
bondholders and shareholders mollified as the water project faltered
by minimizing the bureaucratic and political challenges it faced.
This included overstating its prospects before the MWD, critics say,
even as the water district's professional staff soured on the plan
and political opposition grew.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith tells a great story," said one investment advisor. "The
holders listened to him and got caught with their pants down."</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz said Brackpool wasn't available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool was supported by a small cadre of investment analysts
who continually promoted the stock even as its financial and
political position deteriorated. These included Debra Coy, a water
industry analyst at Schwab Washington Research Group, a unit of
Charles Schwab &amp; Co., and Michael Crawford of Los Angeles-based B.
Riley &amp; Co., both of whom kept "buy" recommendations on the shares
through the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout that period, however, the company's deteriorating
financial position was becoming obvious.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Cadiz announced that a proposed merger of its
money-losing Sun World agricultural operations with a company owned
by Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud had fallen
through, depriving Cadiz of an opportunity to restructure its
crushing debt of more than $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the company disclosed that Brackpool and former Cadiz
Chairman Dwight Makins had both sold large positions in Cadiz stock;
Brackpool said his shares had been sold without his knowledge by a
bank that held them as collateral.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the company continued to lose money and net worth. In
the second quarter ended June 30, Cadiz lost $6 million, and its
shareholder equity--its assets compared with liabilities--shrank to
$8.9 million from $17 million at the beginning of the year.</TE>

<CX>   Cadiz shares--A story in Wednesday's Business section incorrectly
reported that Debra G. Coy, an analyst for Schwab Washington Research
Group, had maintained a "buy" recommendation on shares of Cadiz Inc.,
which have fallen by more than 97% since June 30. Although Coy stated
as recently as July 8 that the stock had "significant upside
potential," her firm by policy does not issue formal "buy" or "sell"
investment recommendations.</CX>

<HD>Countrywide Lends Record Amount During September</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the nation's largest independent
mortgage lender, said Tuesday that it funded a record $25.3 billion
in home loans last month as many property owners raced to refinance.</LD>
<LD>   The Calabasas-based company exceeded its previous record--set in
August--by 19% and topped results from the same period a year ago by
143%.</LD>
<LD>   "It was stronger than I expected," said Richard Eckert, a research
analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, who had
predicted Countrywide would lend about $22 billion.</LD>
<TE>   With mortgage rates dropping to the lowest levels since the 1960s,
the majority of mortgage applications are coming from consumers eager
to refinance. The lender registered a record $17.5 billion in
refinancing and home equity loans in September, compared with $6
billion in the same period a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The value of loans for purchasing homes rose 80% over September
2001 to $7.76 billion, the third-highest mark ever. The value of
loans in the process of being completed totaled $51.2 billion in
September, the company said, compared with $21 billion a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   News of the monthly results pushed up Countrywide's shares $2.80
to $45.42 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar, DirecTV Make Final Plea</HD>
<DH>Cable: In an effort to gain FCC approval for a merger,
executives offer to give up satellite slots to create a new rival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top executives from EchoStar Communications Corp. and rival DirecTV
made a final plea Tuesday to the Federal Communications Commission,
trying to persuade commissioners not to block their proposed
$15-billion satellite TV merger.</LD>
<LD>   But they received a cool reception from government regulators, who
remain highly skeptical about the deal, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen and DirecTV Chief Executive Eddy
Harenstein met with FCC officials and talked about giving up enough
satellite slots after the merger to allow for the creation of a new,
rival nationwide satellite television provider, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   The meetings were a follow-up to a letter the companies sent to
the FCC on Monday, promising to discuss "major revisions" in a
last-ditch effort to win approval for the deal.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of FCC commissioners, including Chairman Michael K.
Powell, have been poised to vote against the merger, and a staff
recommendation found that the deal would not be in the public
interest, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest concerns of government regulators is that an
EchoStar-DirecTV merger would combine the nation's two major
satellite television companies, eliminating competition in many rural
markets that do not receive cable.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar and DirecTV, a unit of El Segundo-based Hughes
Electronics Corp., also presented research to the FCC reemphasizing
their assertion that cable TV rates would hold steady if the merger
were approved. The companies have long said that their merger would
help them to better compete against local cable operators by offering
high-speed Internet access and local broadcast channels. Without the
merger, they say, neither company has enough satellite slots to offer
local channels in every U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed that cable TV prices rose by 11.3% between
January 2000 and January 2002 in areas where satellite TV providers
did not offer local service and 2.3% in areas with local service.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, said the figures
suggest that the best chance of reining in cable rates is to permit
the satellite merger, but to impose tough conditions, such as
requiring that satellite TV companies offer all local broadcast
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmelman also met Tuesday with FCC officials to discourage them
from killing the deal and to consider EchoStar's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers would be better off with a good consent decree [that
imposed conditions on the deal] than by blowing the merger apart,"
Kimmelman said.</TE>
<TE>   But EchoStar has not detailed what it might be willing to offer.
And in the past, EchoStar officials have resisted giving up any of
its satellite signals, saying it needs all its slots to compete
against cable.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Cablevision Systems has offered to take over some
of the EchoStar-DirecTV slots and create a new nationwide satellite
provider.</TE>
<TE>   But there are questions about whether the company has the
financial resources to become a viable rival to a combined
EchoStar-DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also is reviewing the deal to see whether
it violates antitrust law.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar closed Tuesday at
$17.21, up 19 cents on Nasdaq. Hughes' shares fell 20 cents to $8.72
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>4 Title Companies Settle Suit Alleging Overcharges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fidelity National Financial Inc. and three other title companies
agreed to a $50-million settlement in a suit claiming they charged
hidden fees during escrow and title services, California officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The companies will pay more than $40 million in refunds and
settlements to customers who purchased, sold or refinanced homes
between May 19, 1995, and Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The companies also will pay more than $6.8 million in penalties as
well as additional fees associated with the settlement. California's
attorney general and San Francisco officials said that the companies,
among other things, billed consumers for services such as overnight
mail, courier and notary fees without disclosing the markup charge.</LD>
<TE>   The companies didn't admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
"Consumers usually expect to pay a lot of fees in the process" of
purchasing or refinancing a home, Terrence Hallinan, San Francisco's
district attorney, said in a statement. "But they don't expect to be
misled into paying more than they should."</TE>
<TE>   A call to the general counsel at Irvine-based Fidelity National,
the largest U.S. insurer of property titles, wasn't returned.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the company purchased Chicago Title, which also is part
of the settlement. First American Corp. in Santa Ana, the nation's
second-largest title insurer, also didn't return a call.</TE>
<TE>   A call to LandAmerica Financial Group Inc. in Richmond, Va., went
through to a recorded message. LandAmerica owns Commonwealth Land
Title Insurance Co. and Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., which are both
defendants in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   A call to Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp., owner
of Stewart Title, went through to voicemail.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was approved by Sacramento Superior Court Judge
Loren E. McMaster.</TE>

<HD>Skittishness About TXU, Ford Trigger Heavy Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Securities: Utility firm drops as much as 39% and automaker
loses 9% on shaken confidence in their financial health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors continue to exhibit extraordinary skittishness over the
financial condition of some of the nation's biggest companies.</LD>
<LD>   That was hammered home for two big names Tuesday:</LD>
<LD>   * Shares of TXU Corp., a major energy services company, plunged as
much as 39% on liquidity concerns before trading was halted, and TXU
made a statement saying that its financial condition is "strong."
That helped the stock rebound, though it still closed down $5.46, or
24%, at $17.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   * Ford Motor Co. stock dropped nearly 9%, down 75 cents to a
10-year low of $7.75 on the NYSE, after brokerage Credit Suisse First
Boston downgraded the shares, citing concerns about Ford's ability to
maintain its investment-grade credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   Shocked by the surprise bankruptcy filings of such giants as Enron
Corp. and WorldCom Inc. in the last year, many investors are bailing
out of stocks if there is even a remote hint that a company could
face financial difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   TXU said it did not know why its stock lost so much ground early
Tuesday. The price has been plunging for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts attributed the heavy sell-off Tuesday to a ratings
cut of TXU's European unit to "junk" status by Fitch Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But the drop also came a day after TXU held a meeting with
analysts in New York that yielded more questions than answers about
the firm's decision last week to slash its profit forecast through
next year by more than a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and investors also were frustrated by management's
refusal to clarify the financial position of its European operation.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's recent change in guidance this late in the year
combined with a widespread lack of confidence in the [utility] sector
... has caused a severe lack of investor confidence," said Paul
Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates.</TE>
<TE>   TXU has long been considered a stalwart of the utility sector,
even amid all the problems of the last year after Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dallas-based company last week slashed its profit outlook
through next year because of low power prices and fierce competition
in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   TXU said Tuesday that it has "ample liquidity," but credit analyst
Robert Rubin at Deutsche Bank said the firm's financial flexibility
"is not particularly strong."</TE>
<TE>   Utility investors also were spooked Tuesday by Allegheny Energy
Inc., which said it was in default under its credit agreements and is
talking to its lenders to obtain extra funding. That stock fell $3.72
to $3.80 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   In the auto sector, brokerage CSFB's suggestion that Ford's credit
rating could be cut to junk status sent investors fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and its finance arm are the largest U.S. issuers of corporate
debt. A downgrade to junk status would be nothing short of disastrous
for Ford, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Fears about Ford's credit rating have been exacerbated by mounting
concerns about its pension fund liabilities and by worries about the
profitability of its luxury car division, which includes Volvo, Land
Rover and Jaguar, CSFB said.</TE>
<TE>   The CSFB report pushed prices of Ford's bonds down sharply, even
though the brokerage said it thought the chances of a rating cut were
low. Indeed, credit-raters Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp;
Poor's both said Tuesday that speculation about a downgrade of Ford
was inconsistent with their ratings view.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our view that Ford is basically a sound company," said S&amp;P
auto analyst Scott Sprinzen.</TE>

stock market losses, Tuesday began pushing a pair of tax cuts for
investors whose retirement accounts and stock portfolios have been
mauled by the bear market.</LD>
<LD>   Although the bills cleared a committee hurdle and probably will be
passed by the GOP-controlled House, their chances in the Senate
appear slim, given that the Democrats running the Senate contend that
the bills' main purpose is a campaign message.</LD>
<LD>   The House GOP legislation would increase the amount of net capital
losses that investors can use to offset ordinary income each year
from $3,000--a level first set in 1978--to $8,250. The change would
be effective from the beginning of 2002, meaning investors could
deduct a higher level of losses suffered this year on tax returns
they will file in April.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats said this could spark a stock sell-off because investors
must sell losing stocks and mutual funds--thereby "realizing" the
capital loss--before they can use the losses to reduce their taxable
income.</TE>
<TE>   Such a sell-off would further depress the markets this year,
Democrats say, and would primarily benefit wealthier taxpayers with
annual incomes above $150,000 for married couples. In addition, some
lawmakers noted that current net losses in excess of $3,000 already
can be used to reduce tax bills in future years.</TE>
<TE>   "I just question whether this is necessary," said Rep. Gerald D.
Kleczka (D-Wis.). "We just keep passing these tax bills and passing
them, and we don't give a hoot about the economy."</TE>
<TE>   The second GOP bill would gradually raise the age at which
retirees must begin mandatory withdrawals from 401(k) and individual
retirement accounts from 70 1/2 to 75 by 2007, adding a few years to
rebuild lost value. It also would increase, in 2003, tax-advantaged
contribution limits to $5,000 for IRAs and $15,000 for 401(k)s.
Current law raises the limits to those levels over the next few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said the age limit, in place since 1962,
is a hardship for the increasing number of people who want to work
beyond age 70 1/2 without losing value in their retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 3% of people with retirement accounts contribute the
maximum amount, raising questions about how much the higher limit
would help. And Democrats noted that senior citizens without other
sources of income would be unlikely to wait until age 75 to begin
withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   The combined cost of the bills, about $65 billion over 10 years,
also is an issue. The federal budget ended fiscal 2002 on Sept. 30
about $167 billion in the red, supplanting previous projections for a
surplus. Neither House bill contains spending cuts or tax increases
to offset the cost.</TE>
<TE>   With voters heading to the polls Nov. 5 with control of Congress
at stake, Democrats contend that the GOP is pushing the bills only as
a last-minute effort to appear sensitive to voters' rising worries
about unemployment, shaky pension funds and the deep stock market
swoon.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans counter that the bills would provide a needed measure
of relief for savers.</TE>
<TE>   "While the fundamentals of our economy are solid, there is more we
can do to help build the confidence and restore the losses of
America's investors," said Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield),
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which approved both
bills along party lines Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Joint Effort on Cancer Drug Ended</HD>

<LD>Seattle Genetics said Tuesday that Genentech ended a three-year
collaboration on a possible cancer drug, but analysts said the move
would have little effect on either company.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle Genetics said it would continue development of SGN-14, a
genetically engineered antibody, on its own. It considers the
molecule a potential treatment for certain cancers of the blood, such
as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   Neither company offered a reason for ending the collaboration.
Genentech handled preclinical development of the molecule, a process
that typically involves tests in animals. Genentech previously told
investors that it planned to begin testing the experimental drug on
humans this year.</LD>
<TE>   In a research note, CIBC World Markets analyst Matthew Geller
called the news a "minor negative" for Seattle Genetics, which has
two other experimental cancer drugs in clinical trials. He said a
second collaboration between South San Francisco-based Genentech and
Seattle Genetics would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Genetics shares fell 18 cents to $2.64 on Nasdaq, and
Genentech shares rose $1.09 to $32.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates owns 11.8% of Bothell,
Wash.-based Seattle Genetics, and Paul Allen, who also founded
Microsoft, owns 9.1%.</TE>

<HD>Slower Increases in Home Prices Seen</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Pace will be 6% to 6.5% in second half of
year, down from 7.6% to 7.9% in the first, Freddie Mac says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Average U.S. home prices are expected to rise at an annualized pace
of 6% to 6.5% in the second half of this year, slower than a 7.6% to
7.9% increase during the first six months, home finance company
Freddie Mac said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The slower home appreciation in the latter half is still
"respectable" and should help "to maintain housing as a wise
investment for families and a sturdy prop for the current fragile
economy," Freddie Mac said.</LD>
<LD>   Continued healthy increases in home prices are considered crucial
at this juncture of an uneven economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Homeowners, whose stock investments have been hammered, have
enjoyed a rapid rise in home equity. They have profited either from
selling their houses or from taking out loans against the higher
value on their homes.</TE>
<TE>   A firm U.S. housing market, along with the lowest mortgage
interest rates in 36 years, probably will push home sales and
mortgage loan supply to record highs this year, Freddie Mac said.</TE>
<TE>   If low interest rates continue into 2003, home sales could eclipse
this year's levels, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Combined new- and existing-home sales are expected to reach 6.5
million units in 2002, surpassing last year's record 6.2 million
units. Total home sales could climb to 6.7 million units in 2003,
Freddie Mac said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, mortgage lenders are poised to issue $2.2 trillion in
new mortgages this year, up from last year's record $2.1 trillion. In
2003, mortgage origination could reach $2.2 trillion, Freddie Mac
said.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages--the most popular
U.S. home loan product--are expected to average 6.3% in the third
quarter and 6% in the fourth quarter, down from 7% in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac forecast that 30-year mortgage rates would average
6.1% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates have continued to plummet over the last four weeks.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes dropped half a percentage point,
driven by a weak economy, low inflation, a poor stock market and
demand for safer securities, fueled by fears over a U.S. military
strike against Iraq, Freddie Mac said.</TE>

<HD>More ImClone Directors to Testify</HD>
<DH>Investigation: A House panel wants to hear from outside
board members about oversight, possible conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA ZIMM</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an unprecedented public move, some of ImClone Systems Inc.'s
outside directors will face questions Thursday from a House panel
investigating the biotechnology company.</LD>
<LD>   The Energy and Commerce subcommittee wants to determine whether
there are conflicts of interest and who had oversight when ImClone's
failed application of its cancer drug Erbitux was disclosed publicly
in December.</LD>
<LD>   The rejection by the Food and Drug Administration triggered an 88%
drop in the share price and at least three government inquiries.</LD>
<TE>   The panel, led by Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), is turning to
the board of directors to find out when insiders realized that
Erbitux probably would be rejected and whether company executives
misled investors. Boards are coming under increasing scrutiny for
their roles in oversight after the collapse of energy trader Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a drug purported to be a new miracle for cancer," said
Greenwood. "Was this drug really promising, or was this a case where
you needed an elixir and a couple of good docs on your board so you
could sell a lot of stock?"</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood's subcommittee will ask directors who aren't ImClone
executives to testify and call back Chief Executive Harlan Waksal and
FDA officials, Greenwood said. The Justice Department and Securities
and Exchange Commission also have undertaken inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based ImClone on Tuesday fell 5 cents to $7.14
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel D. Waksal, ImClone's former chief executive and Harlan
Waksal's brother, was indicted in August on charges that he tipped
off relatives about the coming rejection of Erbitux's filing,
enabling them to sell shares before the information was made public.
Waksal also was charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly
ordering documents and computer files destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   In August, committee investigators asked ImClone to hand over
additional records, including evidence of document destruction,
related to alleged insider trading by Samuel Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 10, the committee asked U.S. prosecutors to investigate
whether Martha Stewart lied to lawmakers about her sale of ImClone
shares, ending the committee's three-month insider-trading
investigation of Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone spokesman David Pitts said the company is "cooperating
fully" with the investigation. Charles Koob, the attorney for ImClone
board members, did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee also will ask FDA officials whether the agency
should restrict promotion by drug makers of products awaiting
approval, Greenwood said. Agency representatives will appear in a
separate panel from the ImClone directors.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take up the issue of pre-market promotion," Greenwood
said. "Once you get a drug approved, you have a tight label and can't
make any claims not specified in the label. Before you get approved,
you get a lot of leeway. We want to explore whether there should be
limits."</TE>
<TE>   The committee has asked about directors' sales of shares,
financial contracts some directors had with the company, possible
insider trading and the effectiveness of corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a whole host of issues about the board's
engagement or lack of engagement," Greenwood said.</TE>

<LD>Companies stung with losses from the port lockout might be looking to
sue for relief or damages, but the legal hurdles for getting help
won't make it easy, experts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge Tuesday denied Dole Food Co.'s request for an
emergency order to retrieve 8.3 million pounds of bananas stranded at
the Port of Los Angeles, said Craig de Recat, a lawyer for Dole. It
couldn't be immediately determined why the request was rejected by
U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Dole, the giant fruit and vegetable concern based in Westlake
Village, wasn't even seeking damages but merely wanted to get its
bananas--valued at $1.7 million--to markets before they spoiled.</LD>
<TE>   Other companies such as retailers, automakers, railroads, farmers
and truckers said they've suffered millions of dollars in losses
because of the dispute that shut down 29 West Coast ports. So far,
companies such as Union Pacific Corp., Chiquita Brands International
Inc. and Sunkist Growers Inc. said they didn't plan legal action to
offset the losses.</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing federal law in these cases--the Carriage of Goods
by Sea Act--provides sizable protection for the shipping lines and
port operators in the event of a lockout or strike, said Robert
Force, head of the Maritime Law Center at Tulane University in New
Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions, however, especially if the harmed company
can prove that the shipping lines or their agents caused the
shutdown, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a blank check whereby the vessel owner or the carrier
can throw up their hands and say, 'It's a strike or lockout,
therefore we're off the hook,' " said A. Robert Degen, a maritime
lawyer with Fox Rothschild O'Brien &amp; Frankel in Philadelphia. "You're
going to have to look at what the individual contract says."</TE>
<TE>   The lockout was called by the port operators' trade group, the
Pacific Maritime Assn., but only after the PMA alleged that the
unionized dockworkers engaged in an untenable work slowdown. Thus,
any company suing for financial damages also would have to grapple
with labor laws that probably would come into play, further
complicating their ability to recover any money, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Dole, in requesting a court order allowing the company to move its
bananas out of port, contended that keeping the produce there was a
violation of the federal Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. The company
also said that if its stranded bananas became worthless, Dole might
be exposed to customer lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Dole rival Chiquita Brands was able to reroute one of its banana
boats, which had been docked off the coast of Long Beach, to
Ensenada, Mexico. There, the 180,000 boxes of bananas from Guatemala
were put on trucks for delivery to West Coast markets, said Chiquita
spokesman Mike Mitchell.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Rise on Positive News About Ports</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Solid earnings from PepsiCo and prospect of
end to the shipping impasse drive the day's gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks advanced Tuesday as investors cheered federal action on the
West Coast port lockout and solid earnings from companies such as
soft-drink giant PepsiCo. But the market gave up big early gains.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks rose after President Bush said he would ask a court to
force the reopening of West Coast ports after a 10-day lockout that
has cost billions of dollars and stunted international trade.</LD>
<LD>   "Any progress that they can make to solve the strike [lockout]
will be very positive for the marketplace," said Bob Basel, a trader
at Salomon Smith Barney.</LD>
<TE>   After U.S. markets closed, a federal judge approved Bush's request
to reopen the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Major stock gauges have tumbled to multiyear lows in recent days
on fears of a possible war with Iraq and concerns about the economy
and corporate profits. These worries linger, but traders said some
unexpectedly positive earnings forecasts and the prospect of a quick
resolution to the shipping impasse drove the day's gains.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed Monday at its
lowest point since October 1997, rose 78.65 points, or 1.1%, to
7,501.49.</TE>
<TE>   That broke a four-session losing streak, although the Dow failed
to hold an early 199-point gain.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 13.27 points, or 1.7%, to
798.55. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which closed
Monday at levels last seen in August 1996, added 9.81 points, or
0.9%, to 1,129.21.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gains in major indexes, losers outnumbered winners by
17 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 17 to 16 on Nasdaq.
Trading was heavy, with NYSE volume at its highest level since July.</TE>
<TE>   Leading clothing retailers, considered to be among the most
vulnerable to the West Coast port dispute, rallied, some rising as
much as 9%. Gap added 75 cents to $9.59, Limited Brands jumped $1.01
to $13.91 and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch climbed $1.48 to $17.40.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer, gained $2.25 to
$52.60, and Home Depot, the largest home improvement store chain,
advanced $1.04 to $25.25, rebounding from sharp losses Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors still are on edge as third-quarter earnings trickle in
this week, heightening tensions in a market troubled by the slow pace
of corporate profit growth.</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo jumped $5.32, or 15%, to $41.10 after the company said its
third-quarter profit rose as most of the food and soft-drink
company's units posted gains in sales and profits. Rival Coca-Cola,
the world's No. 1 soft-drink company, rose $1.99 to $52.12.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold stocks lost ground as major market indexes climbed and
investors yanked cash out of so-called safe havens. Gold fell $3.70
to $318.20 an ounce in New York trading. The Amex index of
gold-mining stocks tumbled 4%, led by Goldcorp, down 44 cents to
$9.57, and Echo Bay Mines, off 10 cents to 90 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Pfizer, the biggest drug maker, advanced $1.40 to $29.70 and
Merck gained $1.87 to $46 after Stewart Adkins, an analyst at Lehman
Bros., said U.S. drug stocks are "very, very cheap." He boosted his
rating on the industry by two steps, to "positive" from "negative,"
citing optimism that industry profit growth will resurge in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   * Utilities were the biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500 as TXU plunged
again on concern about the company's finances. TXU shares fell $5.46,

<HD>Microsoft Eases Up on Digital Recordings</HD>
<DH>Technology: Studios are upset because the firm's TV
software may allow users to record premium programs and violate
copyright protections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to battling video piracy, Microsoft Corp. can't seem to
find a happy medium.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the company trotted out a new version of its operating
system, dubbed Windows XP Media Center edition, which enables
consumers with specially equipped computers to make digital
recordings of TV shows. But the software drew catcalls from reviewers
because it automatically slapped all recordings with electronic locks
that limited their use.</LD>
<LD>   Stung by the criticism, Microsoft agreed to apply the locks more
sparingly and implement one of the standard copy-protection
techniques used by Hollywood. But the change, expected to be
announced today, quickly peeved studios because it may let consumers
record premium programs such as pay-per-view movies in violation of
built-in copyright protections.</LD>
<TE>   "We have some real concerns about content that enters an
unprotected input into a personal computer, where the rights
associated with the content are not being obeyed," said Brad Hunt,
chief technology officer with the Motion Picture Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the studios liked Microsoft's restrictive version
better.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2 research firm
said Microsoft's new approach is more in tune with consumer
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers consider broadcast TV disposable to begin with,"
McNealy said, citing a recent GartnerG2 study that found almost
two-thirds of the people surveyed believe it's legal to give a copy
of a recorded TV program to a friend--something they may not have the
right to do. "I think allowing this kind of portability of broadcast
TV is in sync with consumers' expectations."</TE>
<TE>   The Windows XP Media Center software, due on some high-end PCs
later this year, is designed to store, organize and play music, TV
programs, pictures and homemade videos. The initial Media Center PCs
from Hewlett-Packard Co. are expected to hold at least 40 hours of
programs on its high-capacity hard drive and burn countless hours
more onto disc with their built-in DVD recorders.</TE>
<TE>   To guard against piracy, Microsoft initially designed the software
to scramble any recorded TV program--even the ones burned onto DVDs.
The scrambling would have prevented the discs from being played on
any PC other than the one that recorded them, requiring all stored
shows to be viewed on that PC.</TE>
<TE>   Murari Narayan, marketing director for Microsoft's Windows eHome
Division, said the criticism from customers and analysts persuaded
the company to change its software before it hit the market. Now, he
said, Media Center PCs will look for a standard anti-copying signal
used by broadcasters and scramble only the programs designated for
protection.</TE>
<TE>   That standard--known as Copy Generation Management System, or
CGMS--lets broadcasters and program owners set three different rules
for shows: unlimited copying, copy once or no copying. Under
Microsoft's approach, any program marked "copy once" or "no copying"
could be recorded onto the hard disk but not played on any other
device.</TE>
<TE>   Any other program could be recorded onto unscrambled DVDs in a
Microsoft format that could be played on any PC running the latest
Windows software, Narayan said. By the end of the year, he added,
consumers will be able to record those programs onto standard DVDs
that would work in any DVD player.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're enabling is the content provider to actually set the
[recording] policy," he said. "We are simply a device that respects
their policy.... We are giving them an option, we are giving them a
solution."</TE>
<TE>   But in the MPAA's view, Microsoft is giving them a problem. To the
studios, "copy never" doesn't mean "store for an unlimited time on a
hard drive"--particularly not when the program is a pay-per-view
movie that's not supposed to be recordable.</TE>
<TE>   "We have high-value content that has rights associated with it ...
and we would like devices to respect the rights associated with those
CGMS bits," Hunt said.</TE>

<HD>Saban in Talks to Acquire Muppet Maker Henson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire investor Haim Saban is in talks to buy Muppet maker Jim
Henson Co. at a steep discount to what Germany's EM.TV &amp;
Merchandising paid for it, people close to the situation said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides are still haggling over the price, but it is broadly
in the vicinity of about $100 million, the sources said. EM.TV paid
$680 million for Hollywood-based Henson in February 2000.</LD>
<LD>   There may be other suitors for the makers of Kermit the Frog, Miss
Piggy and Big Bird, the sources said, but the EM.TV unit has been on
the block for more than a year.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for Munich-based EM.TV and Saban declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Saban, who made his fortune with children's figures the Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers, has bargaining help. Nancy Schultz, who served
as Henson's chief financial officer for a short time and who advised
Henson when she was with PricewaterhouseCoopers, works for Saban
Capital Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Henson produces movies such as "Muppets in Space," and its
creature shop makes well-known puppets and creates special effects.
It won an Oscar for the special effects in the 1995 film "Babe."</TE>
<TE>   When the company's namesake, Jim Henson, died 12 years ago, Walt
Disney Co. pulled out of a deal to buy the company, believing Henson
embodied the empire he founded in 1958. Henson's son, Brian, ran the
business until he and the family sold it to EM.TV.</TE>
<TE>   EM.TV, which has been trying to raise money by unloading non-core
assets, last year sold Henson's stake in Crown Media Holdings Inc.
for about $100 million. Sesame Workshop also bought the Sesame Street
Muppets characters from Henson last year.</TE>
<TE>   Saban, who also is bidding for insolvent German media group
KirchMedia, made about $1.5 billion last year when he and partner
News Corp. sold cable network Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $3
billion.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hears Arguments in NextWave Licensing Case</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Decision on FCC's seizure of unused licenses would
affect wireless networks in crowded markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday about whether the
government was out of line when it seized unused wireless licenses
from a young company that had promised to provide better, cheaper
cell phone service.</LD>
<LD>   The case is important because it affects the future of wireless
networks in many overcrowded markets.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission and NextWave Telecom Inc.
have been battling over the wireless licenses since the Hawthorne,
N.Y.-based company won them in an auction in 1996, then filed for
bankruptcy protection two years later without paying the full $4.7
billion it bid for the frequencies.</LD>
<TE>   Some justices seemed skeptical of claims that FCC rules allow it
to cancel licenses owned by a company that is reorganizing its
finances. The agency's motivations are a central question because it
says its regulatory needs let it bypass the normal bankruptcy rules.</TE>
<TE>   Justice David H. Souter said the FCC let NextWave keep its
licenses for months without making payments, then seized and resold
them when the commission had buyers willing to pay much higher
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that at each point where the FCC made a decision, it
made an economic decision rather than a regulatory decision," Souter
said.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC sold the licenses last year at a second auction to Verizon
Wireless Inc., VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and other companies for
nearly $16 billion, but an appeals court nullified the second sale.
The Supreme Court will decide whether the lower court was right.</TE>
<TE>   The high court is expected to take at least several months to
decide the case, which involves wireless licenses for Los Angeles,
San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Washington and dozens of
other markets.</TE>
<TE>   The licenses, all but a few of which are in dispute, would give
NextWave access to the 10 largest U.S. markets and 172 million
potential customers.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an unusually big mess," said Howard Shelanski, a UC
Berkeley law professor. "Consumers should be concerned because any
available spectrum could bring them lower prices for existing
services and new kinds of wireless services."</TE>
<TE>   NextWave's lawyer, Donald Verrilli Jr., said bankruptcy laws
protect companies that are reorganizing their finances from having
assets seized.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Department lawyer Paul Clement argued that the FCC was
acting to protect the integrity of its auction process. The agency is
seeking to "allocate the spectrum to the party who values the
spectrum the most highly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Antonin Scalia pointed to a provision in the federal
bankruptcy code that says government agencies can't revoke a license
"solely because" the company in bankruptcy proceedings "has not paid
a debt that is dischargeable in the case."</TE>
<TE>   "I consider this a classic case for what this provision of the
bankruptcy code was directed to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five other justices also aimed skeptical questions at Clement.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being followed closely by the industry, and not just
because highly coveted licenses are at stake, said Rebecca Arbogast,
a Washington-based telecommunications analyst for Legg Mason.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a question of who's going to be left holding the bag and
who makes out like a bandit."</TE>
<TE>   A victory for NextWave would clear the largest legal obstacle it
faces, freeing the company to finish building its network or sell the
licenses to a larger company.</TE>
<TE>   NextWave shares, which had lost about 90% of their value in the
last year, rose 40 cents, or 26%, to $1.95 on Tuesday in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's argument, the justices said they were mindful that
the outcome of the case could affect other situations in which
someone has a government license and encounters financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia gave the example of a driver's license being taken from
someone whose fines were part of a bankruptcy proceeding.</TE>

<HD>Moody's Lowers Credit Rating of PG&amp;E Unit</HD>
<DH>Utilities: The downgrade of National Energy Group is the
second in two months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded the credit rating for
PG&amp;E Corp.'s energy-trading subsidiary, PG&amp;E National Energy Group,
for the second time in two months.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's also warned that further downgrades are possible, citing
concerns about the company's ability to extend a $400-million credit
line past its Oct. 21 expiration date.</LD>
<LD>   The action drops the rating on the company's senior unsecured debt
and credit line from Ba2 to B1--four levels below investment grade.</LD>
<TE>   "The rating action and review for possible downgrade reflects
NEG's weak operating performance, low operating cash flow relative to
its debt and tight liquidity," according to a Moody's statement. A
Moody's spokesman was not available for additional comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Francisco-based PG&amp;E fell 51 cents, or 5%, to close
at $9.36 on the New York Stock Exchange, less than half of the $23.75
level it hit in May. The company's Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. utility
is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection.</TE>
<TE>   In early August, both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's credit-rating
service cut the energy-trading unit's credit rating to "junk" status,
forcing the company to begin renegotiating more than $1 billion in
credit agreements with lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent downgrade "does not trigger any incremental
financial obligations at the corporation or at PG&amp;E [National Energy
Group], beyond those associated with previous rating agency
downgrades," the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said the continuing credit-rating decline highlights
the company 's weakened position as it faces two deadlines this
month--both of which are already the result of extensions.</TE>
<TE>   One provision of a $1-billion loan made to the parent company is
that PG&amp;E NEG maintain an investment-grade credit rating. Lenders,
which are still owed $420 million, granted the company a waiver of
that requirement until Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, NEG's line of credit with 16 lenders owed $431
million, is set to expire Oct. 21, and Moody's expressed "concerns
about the ability of NEG to extend" the credit line.</TE>
<TE>   "The downgrades are beginning to recognize the severity of the
problem, but that may be a bit late," said Paul Fremont, an electric
utilities analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is negotiating for its life, for its continued
existence, and that was the case in August," Fremont said.</TE>
<TE>   The energy group develops, builds and operates electric generating
facilities and natural gas pipelines and provides energy trading.</TE>
<TE>   It's part of a market sector facing a host of woes, including the
fallout from Enron's collapse, sagging wholesale prices and flagging
investor confidence, said Arleen Spangler, a director in the
utilities, energy and project finance group at Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, the PG&amp;E energy group used short-term
financing to fund the construction of power plants nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   She said S&amp;P has "not come to a conclusion" on whether to further
downgrade NEG's credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope that the company would have some restructuring plan
in place" before Oct. 18, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The parent company declined to elaborate on previously announced
plans to explore options for the energy group.</TE>
<TE>   Those options include "sales of assets and businesses, debt
restructuring and reorganization of existing operations."</TE>

<HD>Raytheon Cutting 100 Jobs in El Segundo</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raytheon Co. said Tuesday that it is cutting about 100 administrative
jobs at its sprawling El Segundo operations as part of a
reorganization to beef up its defense businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The defense contractor said the job cuts were part of plans to
streamline headquarters staff. In August, the company announced it
was combining the headquarters staff of its Electronic Systems unit
in El Segundo, where about 6,500 engineers work, with its Command,
Control and Communications business based in Marlborough, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   After combining the two units, the company then created seven
business divisions focused around specific products and services such
as space systems and information technology to help bolster sales to
the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   Raytheon, which has been struggling to beef up defense profit amid
a slump in its commercial aircraft business, said the move would
remove a layer of management and cut administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the company said it would cut about 300 engineering
jobs in Massachusetts as a result of losing a major satellite
contract. The company employs about 78,000 people worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   A Raytheon spokesman in El Segundo, where the company has been on
a hiring binge amid an upturn in defense spending, said many of the
100 employees affected by the reorganization probably will be placed
in other jobs or offered early retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon fell $2 to $27.15 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Sides Argue Over Safety vs. Speed</HD>
<DH>Labor: To dockworkers it's 'working safe,' while shipping
lines see it as a waterfront slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union leaders call it "working safe," making sure every safety rule
at the ports is followed to the letter.</LD>
<LD>   For their part, company officials say those are just code words
for dockworkers slowing down and gumming up their operations.</LD>
<LD>   As the International Longshore and Warehouse Union prepared to go
back to work as early as tonight after a lockout at 29 West Coast
ports, the distinction between working safely and working slowly
still loomed as a potential source of trouble.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, has vowed to seek sanctions against the union in
the event of slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But the ILWU has claimed there's good reason for "working safe":
five deaths among its members so far this year, compared with one or
two deaths a year normally.</TE>
<TE>   Union members contend that as cargo shipments have grown, so has
the danger.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, more than 142 million tons of goods, from frozen chicken
feet to tennis shoes, moved through the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, the nation's largest harbor complex.</TE>
<TE>   That's four times the tonnage reported in 1980, according to the
maritime group.</TE>
<TE>   America's appetite for cheap imported goods is driving demand for
bigger vessels, which require more-powerful tugboats, larger
terminals with longer wharves, bigger cranes, faster trains and more
big rigs than ever to handle the freight.</TE>
<TE>   "Anymore, when you get nudged by something in the port you get
crushed or maimed," said Tom Harrison, president of ILWU Local 63.
"So we try to stand in conspicuous places where there's room to run
or back away without running into a machine or a wall."</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders cited the deaths last month when they began to "work
safe" amid stalled contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Maritime Assn. officials claimed the union's action was an
orchestrated disruption to show its displeasure with negotiations,
and ultimately ordered a lockout Sept. 29--shutting down the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The five deaths among ILWU members include one in Oregon and four
in California. In addition, two non-ILWU workers have also died on
the job at California ports this year, according to the state
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, there has been an average of about one port worker
death a year in California for the last decade--although in 1997,
there were five deaths, said Cal-OSHA spokeswoman Susan Gard.</TE>
<TE>   Of the six California fatalities this year, five occurred at the
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. There were no worker fatalities
at the complex in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal safety officials who are investigating this
year's accidents say they don't appear to follow any pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of fatal accidents we've seen this year is raising
concerns," said Dean Fryer, a spokesman for Cal-OSHA. "But they
involved different employers, different kinds of machinery and
different circumstances at different times of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The maritime association said that it would be a mistake to try to
draw sweeping conclusions from the spike in deaths this year.</TE>
<TE>   "These are unfortunate situations--an anomaly--and they are being
investigated by the appropriate agencies," said Tom Edwards, the
Northern California regional manager for the maritime association and
a member of its contract negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, with the ports expected to reopen tonight, the union
has raised the prospect that slowdowns in the name of safety will
persist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to work safe," union President James
Spinosa told reporters Monday, when asked how the union would handle
the reopening. "Five people being killed on the waterfront in that
short a time has to be reckoned with," he said. "And if that's a
slowdown, then that's a slowdown, but that's the way we're going to
work. We're going to work safe."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, after a federal judge ordered the ports to reopen,
ILWU negotiator Joseph Wenzel declared: "Folks are going back to work
in a safe manner." He acknowledged that any resulting drop in
productivity could land the union back in court but said, "We'll
defend ourselves by any means necessary."</TE>
<TE>   When asked Tuesday about the maritime group's response to a
slowdown, spokesman Steve Sugerman said, "We'll cross that bridge
when we get there."</TE>
<TE>   But association President Joseph Miniace has made it clear that
the shipping lines have detailed productivity records they are ready
to show to a judge if the work pace slows.</TE>
<TE>   Luisa Gratz, president of the ILWU's Local 26, which has lost two
members since March, says that "management is more interested in the
bottom line and profit than in saving lives in many cases."</TE>
<TE>   "The harbor is an extremely busy, dangerous place to work," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got terminals servicing three vessels at once with huge
cranes, trains and hundreds of big rigs. All around them are vehicles
and forklifts searching for, picking up and dropping off multi-ton
containers."</TE>
<TE>   The management group, however, says technological changes being
resisted by the union could improve safety.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next decade, the volume of cargo moving through the ports
will explode," Edwards said. "The most effective and safe way to run
the terminals will be to get more workers off the yards and into
offices, where they can monitor activity from computers and
television screens."</TE>
<TE>   According to Cal-OSHA, the following deaths occurred in California
this year:</TE>
<TE>   * March 3: Quilcano Solari was fatally injured on Terminal Island
in the Port of Los Angeles when a lifeboat became detached and fell,
crushing him on a ship's gangway.</TE>
<TE>   * On March 14, foreman John Prohoroff, 68, was struck and killed
in the Port of Long Beach by a 3,000-pound metal ring that dropped 30
feet after a crane broke.</TE>
<TE>   * On March 15, Mario Gonzalez, 53, was trying to fix a jammed
automobile shredder in the Port of Los Angeles when the machine's
heavy hydraulic-powered door closed, crushing him.</TE>
<TE>   * On July 23, Richie Lopez Jr., 39, was run over and killed by a
large forklift at Port Hueneme in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   * On Sept. 3, security guard Rudy Acosta, 50, was directing
traffic in the Port of Long Beach when he was run over and killed by
a 90,000-pound forklift used to stack cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   * On Sept. 17, Filipino Sherwin Lumilian was killed when he fell
into an open hatch aboard a vessel berthed in the Port of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Solari's death came less than a week after the 5,400-member ILWU
Local 13 won a Southern California Area Safety Award from the Pacific
Maritime Assn. for achieving a seventh consecutive year of reduced
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-OSHA spokeswoman Gard said there were 14 waterfront deaths in
California over the last decade, but was unable to provide a
year-by-year account because the state agency depends on the
databases of the U.S. Department of Labor for such statistics. If
there are fewer than three deaths in a given year, the cases are kept
confidential by the Labor Department, Gard said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Nancy Cleeland and Joseph Menn contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Sony Plans to Invest in Palm's OS Unit</HD>
<DH>Computers: $20-million deal gives the consumer electronics
firm a 6% stake and boosts the hand-held maker's plan to spin off the
division.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENDA McCARTHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp. on Tuesday agreed to invest $20 million in the Palm Inc.
unit that makes the leading operating system for hand-held computers,
boosting Palm's plans to split into two independent companies.</LD>
<LD>   The deal gives Sony a 6% stake in PalmSource. The consumer
electronics powerhouse is the first outside investor in the unit.
Palm has been struggling amid lackluster demand for hand-helds, and
Sony has a vested interest in sustaining the platform, which powers
its line of Clie organizers.</LD>
<LD>   For Milpitas, Calif.-based Palm, the relationship could bolster
the audio and video capabilities of its operating system, which is
under attack by Microsoft Corp.'s rival Pocket PC. Once the leader in
hand-held organizers, Palm in the second quarter fell behind
Hewlett-Packard Co., which uses Pocket PC.</LD>
<TE>   "Sony has such a wonderful reputation for innovation, we could not
have asked for a better partner or investor," PalmSource Chief
Executive David Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Sony has licensed Palm's operating system since 1999 and its Clie
organizers have about 10% of the market. New Clie models record
video, play music and browse the Internet with a wireless connection
using Palm's latest software version, OS5.</TE>
<TE>   PalmSource started seeking investors several months ago for its
spinoff from Palm. Palm decided last year to split its hardware and
operating systems businesses into independent companies to boost
software sales to computer makers hesitant to license an operating
system from a rival.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's investment gives Palm more freedom to decide how it wants
to conduct the spinoff, which it expects to complete early next year,
Nagel said. Palm is leaning against an initial public offering
because of the weak market.</TE>
<TE>   The companies already have separated physically. PalmSource now
operates from offices in Sunnyvale, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   James Faucette, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Ore., said the Sony investment was not unexpected. Faucette
said the expanded collaboration would help Sony develop products that
interact with each other. Faucette has a neutral stance on Palm and
doesn't own any of its shares.</TE>
<TE>   Palm software also powers Handspring, Samsung and Kyocera "smart
phones," which combine features of mobile phones and personal digital
assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Palm last week said it plans a 1-for-20 reverse stock split as it
prepared for the spinoff. The company's stock will begin trading Oct.
15 on a reverse-split basis.</TE>
<TE>   Palm shares rose 6 cents to 67 cents on Nasdaq. The shares have
fallen 61% over the last year. Sony's American depositary receipts
rose $1.15 to $41.48 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Times to Unveil Revamp of Its Features Sections</HD>
<DH>Media: Sunday Calendar will return to a full-page format,
and Southern California Living will be discontinued, among other
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting Sunday, the Los Angeles Times will introduce redesigned
features sections that the paper said would "capture the worlds of
entertainment, culture and lifestyle in a voice that's expressly for
Southern California."</LD>
<LD>   The changes will include several new columns, features and
listings, as well as improved coverage of health and food. The
Calendar section will be expanded, and the Southern California Living
section will no longer be published.</LD>
<LD>   All aspects of The Times' features report have been reinvented,
said Times Publisher John Puerner.</LD>
<TE>   The sections will be more readable, better organized and more
visually dramatic, all part of a newsroom initiative to provide
readers with enhanced coverage of culture and entertainment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to position these sections in a way that will best
serve our readers and the paper for the long term," Puerner said. The
changes are expected to increase the paper's "appeal to women and
young readers, while at the same time positioning The Times to be the
nation's best single source of news and features on popular
entertainment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Carroll, the newspaper's editor, added, "The new features
report is not just about a change in format and content.... It's also
about the voice in which we communicate with our readers."</TE>
<TE>   The new features sections will be directly overseen by John
Montorio, deputy managing editor.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Calendar, a tabloid since 1960, will return to a full-page
format in two parts. The section will continue to be devoted to the
classical arts, movies, television, music and pop culture, with
expanded coverage of "the style and culture of Los Angeles, the
nation and the world," The Times said.</TE>
<TE>   Specific new features will include: Page Three, a compendium of
short arts and entertainment features; Back Story, a
behind-the-scenes story of the business of Hollywood; Connections, a
column by Times staff writer Reed Johnson that pulls together the
"big picture of popular culture and the arts"; Social Climes,
snapshots from L.A.'s social scene; the Guide, new arts and
entertainment listings with more analysis and critics' comments; and
Media Matters, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer David Shaw's comments on
the world of media and information.</TE>
<TE>   The new daily Calendar section, debuting Monday, will continue to
provide readers with arts and entertainment reporting as well as
literary and media coverage with a "fashion, living and design" style
report, The Times said.</TE>
<TE>   New columns by Times staff writers and features in the daily
Calendar section will include Calendar's Calendar, a selective
entertainment guide; New York, N.Y., a weekly column by Geraldine
Baum; and L.A.-centric, an essay column by Mary McNamara.</TE>
<TE>   A redesigned weekly entertainment information guide, Calendar
Weekend, will be unveiled Oct. 17. A new Health section will debut
Monday with expanded coverage of fitness and wellness. And on Oct.
16, a revamped Food section will be introduced.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, The Times plans to launch weekly feature sections on the
home, fashion and outdoors.</TE>

<HD>VeriSign Settles Another Lawsuit Over Direct Mail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VeriSign Inc., the world's largest provider of Web addresses, has
settled a second lawsuit filed against it over a controversial
direct-mail campaign targeting rivals' customers, the company said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Go Daddy Software of Scottsdale, Ariz., said it settled the
lawsuit it filed in June accusing VeriSign, based in Mountain View,
Calif., of false advertising. Neither company would discuss details
of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   In August, VeriSign and domain name provider BulkRegister.com Inc.
settled the lawsuit BulkRegister filed in May.</LD>
<TE>   VeriSign's mass mailings to customers of competitors prompted four
lawsuits and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The notices, which VeriSign said it stopped sending in May, urged
recipients to return the forms along with a payment or risk losing
their Web addresses, even if the domain name was not due to expire,
according to the lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Many people didn't realize that doing so would automatically have
their domain name registration transferred to VeriSign, the lawsuits
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   VeriSign, which also sells Internet security and telecom services,
has been looking to refresh its domain name business.</TE>
<TE>   Other domain name providers have been accused of doing similar
direct mailings, but VeriSign has received most of the attention
because it is the dominant player in the market.</TE>
<TE>   VeriSign shares fell 19 cents to close at $4.13 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Can Cancel Ad Deal, Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Media: Decision lets phone firm back out of
$81-million-a-year contract with AOL.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF ST.ONGE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. can cancel an $81-million-a-year advertising agreement
with AOL Time Warner Inc. as the second-biggest U.S. long-distance
phone company cuts costs to help it emerge from bankruptcy, a federal
judge ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The four-year contract required WorldCom, parent of MCI Group, to
buy more ads than it needs and allocated ads among AOL Time Warner
media properties "in a manner that is not favorable," WorldCom said
in court papers. The agreement, which would have run through 2004, is
"unnecessary and costly," Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom said.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom's abandonment of the deal comes after AOL, the world's
largest media company, has seen the value of its shares fall more
than 66% this year amid declining ad sales at its Internet unit and
slowing subscriber growth.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez approved WorldCom's
request to back out of the deal and left open the question of how
much WorldCom owes AOL under the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Companies reorganizing in bankruptcy can abandon certain types of
contracts, and any legal damage claims that arise as a result can be
combined with other creditors' claims.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, which also owns magazines and cable television
networks such as CNN, was named in July to WorldCom's 15-member
official committee of unsecured creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rosenberg, a lawyer for New York-based AOL Time Warner, and
Tricia Primrose, a company spokeswoman, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell 53 cents to $10.67 Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of WorldCom fell less than 1 cent to
9 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, WorldCom won court approval to pay its employees
and certain officers for some legal bills. The coverage includes
suits involving property damage, personal injury and employment
disputes, as well as company officers sued over negligence,
securities or pension law violations.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection in July, a month after
revealing it hid $3.9 billion in costs to inflate sales. The company
later uncovered a further $3.3 billion in hidden costs since 1999,
bringing the total misreported to more than $7 billion. WorldCom says
it owes creditors $41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's former accounting director, Buford Yates Jr., pleaded
guilty Monday to aiding in the company's alleged multibillion-dollar
fraud. He said he was following orders from supervisors, including
former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan, to falsify
financial records.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan was indicted Aug. 28 on charges that he orchestrated the
alleged fraud.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's America Online unit and WorldCom both are under federal
investigation of their accounting.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner is completing an internal investigation of America
Online advertising deals after disclosing in August that it may have
improperly booked $49 million in ad revenue. WorldCom was one of
three companies that accounted for the $49 million.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Cuts Back on Nasdaq, OTC Stocks</HD>
<DH>Securities: Brokerage will stop trading some of the least
active issues and will close N.J. office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Tuesday slashed the number of Nasdaq and
over-the-counter stocks it trades by about 75% and closed its Jersey
City, N.J., site, as it struggles to cope with a dimmed market
outlook after 30 months of falling share prices.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill, the largest securities firm by capital, said it would
stop trading some of the least active issues, known as OTC Bulletin
Board and Pink Sheet stocks. Overall, the firm reduced the number of
Nasdaq and OTC stocks it trades to 2,400 from 10,000.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill also said it would move all Nasdaq trading to its New York
headquarters, shutting a Jersey City office it had run after it
acquired trading firm Herzog Heine Geduld Inc. two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Brokerages have seen trading profits crimped by the general
decline in investor interest in stocks, falling per-trade values, and
also by the move last year to decimal stock pricing. The pricing
switch narrowed the gap between buy and sell prices of shares--the
so-called spread that had long been a source of Wall Street profit.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill said the Nasdaq stocks it would continue to track
accounted for about 92% of the total year-to-date volume in that
market.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that Merrill Lynch is continuing their commitment
to make markets in virtually all major Nasdaq stocks," a Nasdaq
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Merrill's decision removes a source of liquidity for
smaller Nasdaq shares, potentially increasing their volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt Denies Pressure</TE>
<TE>   on Board Chief Choice</TE>
<TE>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, embroiled
in a new controversy, denied succumbing to pressure from Republicans
and the accounting industry to abandon plans to choose a former
pension fund chief to lead a new accounting board, saying that no one
has yet been selected.</TE>
<TE>   "Untrue press stories have suggested that the commission, or
individual commissioners, have been besieged by pressures to reject
the purported choice of a chairman that never was," Pitt wrote in a
letter to House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and
fellow Democrats John J. LaFalce of New York and Barney Frank of
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Setbacks in selecting an accounting board chairman are putting new
pressure on Pitt, who faced criticism in his first year as SEC
chairman for being too close to the accounting industry, which he
represented as a private lawyer. Trying to meet a Congress-mandated
Oct. 28 deadline to choose the five-member accounting regulatory
board, Pitt canceled part of a trip to Europe this week to
concentrate on the selections.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are pushing him to select John Biggs, former chairman of
the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Assn. and College Retirement
Equities Fund, the largest teachers' pension fund, to run the board.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have objected. House Financial Services Committee
Chairman Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, said last week he
wanted a "moderate" to lead the accounting board.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democrats, Reps. John D. Dingell of Michigan and Edward J.
Markey of Massachusetts, wrote to Pitt on Tuesday to "express our
concern and displeasure regarding press reports indicating that, due
to pressure from the accounting industry and its Republican
supporters in Congress, you are backing away from the choice you and
other members of the SEC had favored to head the new oversight
board."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, in his letter to Gephardt, LaFalce and Frank, said: "The
commission has made no offers to anyone, received no acceptances from
anyone, and, indeed, has not yet finished interviewing potential
candidates for the board."</TE>

<HD>Gemstar CEO Resigns Amid Reorganization</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. said late Tuesday that Chief
Executive Henry Yuen resigned as part of a revamp of the Pasadena
company unveiled in August when Gemstar began reviewing its
accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Yuen has been replaced by company executive Jeff Shell, who was
brought aboard Gemstar this year by News Corp., which owns 42%, and
its chairman, Rupert Murdoch.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the management shake-up, Chief Financial Officer Elsie
Leung also resigned and will be replaced by News Corp. executive Paul
Haggerty, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Gemstar, a maker of software to run on-screen TV program guides
and the publisher of TV Guide magazine, in June lost a patent dispute
with Scientific-Atlanta Inc., a maker of TV set-top boxes. Gemstar
had recorded more than $100 million in revenue over the last three
years that it said it expected to collect in patent fees from
Scientific-Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Under their agreements, Yuen will be chairman of the board in a
non-executive capacity and will lead an international business
development unit. Leung will work alongside Yuen.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares fell 1 cent, to $2.59, in regular Nasdaq trading
before the resignations were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<LD>The presidential campaign of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in
Brazil received a major boost when he won the endorsement of the
fourth-place finisher in the first round of the election, center-left
candidate Ciro Gomes.</LD>
<LD>   Da Silva, the Workers' Party candidate known to Brazilians simply
as Lula, finished first in Sunday's voting, with 46% of the vote, but
failed to win the outright majority necessary to become president. On
Oct. 27, he will face conservative ruling-party candidate Jose Serra
in a runoff. Serra took 23% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Gomes received 12% of the vote but is widely popular in Brazil's
impoverished northeast.</LD>

<HD>Divisions Threaten Stability in Belfast</HD>
<DH>Northern Ireland: Unionists vow to leave the power-sharing
government if Sinn Fein doesn't. Britain says it will attempt to
mediate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM WALLACE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The attempt by sectarian communities to share power in Northern
Ireland teetered toward collapse Tuesday when the parties that are
largely Protestant declared they would no longer sit in a government
with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.</LD>
<LD>   The crisis has developed swiftly since Friday, when police began
arresting republican activists on charges of stealing sensitive
British government documents from offices in Northern Ireland's
parliament building. Three people have been charged in the provincial
capital, Belfast, with handing the stolen papers to Sinn Fein
strategists and the IRA, an act of political espionage that unionist
First Minister David Trimble described as "10 times worse than
Watergate."</LD>
<LD>   Already under pressure from hard-liners within his Ulster Unionist
Party who are anxious to expel Sinn Fein from government, Trimble
went to London's 10 Downing St. on Tuesday to deliver British Prime
Minister Tony Blair an ultimatum. Trimble said he and his ministers
would quit unless Sinn Fein's two representatives are thrown off the
power-sharing executive--the cornerstone of the 1998 Good Friday
peace agreement that was supposed to end the violence between Roman
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   Unionists will not return to governing with Sinn Fein until the
IRA declares its war against the British state over, disarms and
disbands, Trimble said.</TE>
<TE>   The British government said it would hold discussions with all
parties this week.</TE>
<TE>   Issuing ultimatums and deadlines is becoming habitual among
politicians in Northern Ireland, but Blair described the current
situation as "very serious," noting that the peace process "can only
be made to work on the basis that everyone accepts the full
principles of that agreement'' and "an end to any form of terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Blair's dilemma, however, is how to cut a political deal to keep
the process alive. He must placate a unionist community antsy because
the IRA's cease-fire and grudging first steps toward disarmament have
not fully ended its paramilitary operations. Yet he has no desire to
accede to demands to kill off a power-sharing arrangement that,
however flawed, has kept sectarian violence far below the horrific
levels of the 30-year "Troubles," during which more than 3,000 people
were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Blair has repeatedly said he is convinced that Sinn Fein leaders
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness are sincere about their party's
switch from physical force to constitutional force, as the Sinn Fein
politicians put it.</TE>
<TE>   Most observers expect Blair to suspend, rather than kill, the
Northern Ireland Assembly. That tactic would have the advantage of
postponing the reckoning of new elections. Polls indicate that an
election would strengthen hard-line parties on both sides of the
sectarian divide: Sinn Fein among Catholic voters and the Rev. Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionists--which opposes the Good Friday
agreement--among Protestants.</TE>
<TE>   But rebuilding trust between two communities so mutually
suspicious is now almost certain to be more difficult. Unionist
agitation about the peace process goes deeper than reaction to the
bizarre events Friday, when heavily armed police stormed into Sinn
Fein's parliamentary offices. Those arrested and charged include
Denis Donaldson, 52, Sinn Fein's chief of administration; William
Mackessy, a 44-year-old former messenger at the Assembly building;
and Fiona Farrelly, 46, a community worker.</TE>
<TE>   Among the papers allegedly photocopied were notes from discussions
on Northern Ireland between Blair and President Bush.</TE>

<HD>Marine Dies in Kuwait Attack</HD>
<DH>Persian Gulf: A second from Camp Pendleton is hurt. Two
assailants are killed in return fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>Gunmen opened fire Tuesday on Marines conducting an urban warfare
exercise on a Kuwaiti island, killing one American and wounding
another. The attack highlighted growing tensions in the Arab world as
the United States prepares for a possible attack on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Marines, based at Camp Pendleton, returned fire with their
M-16s and killed the two gunmen. Kuwait declared the attackers to be
terrorists but did not immediately tie them to a specific group.</LD>
<LD>   Pentagon officials said security would be increased at all U.S.
bases in the region but did not say whether they regarded the
shooting as a terrorist attack.</LD>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met
with other senior U.S. military officials and spoke by phone with
commanders in the region to discuss other possible responses, a
Pentagon spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was highly unusual in Kuwait, a close U.S. ally since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War. More than a decade later, most Kuwaitis
remain supportive of the relationship. However, analysts said that
even in Kuwait, moderate Muslims feel caught between their more
radical brethren and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuwaiti government identified the gunmen as Anas Kandari, born
in 1981, and Jassem Hajiri, born in 1976, and described them as
Kuwaiti residents and Islamic extremists.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry said it would "not allow anyone to undermine
the country's security." Friends and associates of the men were being
rounded up for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-one unarmed Kuwaiti civilians in the area of the exercise
on Faylakah island, 10 miles east of Kuwait City, were taken into
custody by the Marines as witnesses and turned over to local
authorities for questioning, said a Navy spokesman in Bahrain, the
U.S. military's regional hub for Gulf operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The two gunmen were in a vehicle that got close to the training,"
said the spokesman, Lt. Christopher Davis. "They got close, jumped
out and opened fire without any warning or provocation."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the Marines were using dummy rounds when they were
attacked and that they shifted to live rounds to defend themselves.
Three AK-47 assault rifles and a cache of ammunition were found in
the attackers' pickup truck, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Marines who were shot were taken by helicopter to a
military hospital used by U.S. personnel on the Kuwaiti mainland,
where one died during surgery. The Marine's name was withheld pending
notification of relatives. The other Marine suffered an arm wound
that was not considered life-threatening, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "We mourn the loss of one of our brothers today, and we wish our
injured Marine a speedy recovery," said 1st Lt. Carrie Batson,
spokeswoman for the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp
Pendleton. "However, we stand ready and able to continue our
mission."</TE>
<TE>   The 150 Marines in the training exercise were withdrawn from the
island after the shooting and sent to an encampment in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines were among 1,000 combat troops from the 11th Marine
Expeditionary Unit who are in Kuwait for a monthlong training
exercise called Eager Mace.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise, including live-fire training in the desert frontier
between Iraq and Kuwait, had been scheduled for months. But it has
taken on added significance and received more media attention in
light of President Bush's threat to use military force against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine exercise is the latest show of U.S. military muscle in
the region. As tensions with Iraq have mounted, the U.S. has shifted
weaponry and munitions from bases in Qatar and Saudi Arabia to bases
in Kuwait in anticipation of a possible land offensive in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Among the equipment being positioned are tanks and Bradley
fighting vehicles, the kind of gear used by Army combat troops.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, senior defense officials say elite special operations
troops last month began training alongside CIA units that could be
used in covert counter-terrorism operations within Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the last decade, the Pentagon has based more than
20,000 U.S. military personnel within close striking distance of
Iraq, along with heavy equipment for at least four armored brigades,
as well as Patriot antimissile batteries to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the Pentagon has moved or announced plans to
move an additional 10,000 troops to the region, officially to conduct
routine training exercises. But military officials acknowledge that
the added troops may remain in the area for longer than their
exercise schedules call for.</TE>
<TE>   A leading Kuwaiti intellectual said in an interview that the
gunmen might have been motivated by anger at the United States for
its policies on Afghanistan, Iraq or the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The incident cannot be cut off from its context: the escalation
between the United States and the Islamists around the world," said
Abdullah Sahar, a political scientist at Kuwait University. "That has
really weakened the moderate Islamists and empowered the radicals and
the ignorant."</TE>
<TE>   Radicals have been gaining adherents around the world "and Kuwait
is no exception," he said. However, Sahar said he believes that the
radical Islamic movement is weaker in Kuwait than in most Islamic
countries. "The majority of Kuwaitis, even within the Islamist
movement, do not consider America a hostile power in any way," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the shooters, he added: "Maybe they had relatives at
Guantanamo. Maybe they had relatives killed in Afghanistan, or maybe
they have some kind of philosophical agreement with Al Qaeda--we
really don't know at this time."</TE>
<TE>   He added that while most Kuwaitis admire the United States and
appreciate what it did during the Gulf War, there is also widespread
disagreement with U.S. foreign policy in the Mideast, and
particularly with its support of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting followed by less than two weeks an incident in which
two men in a jeep, carrying a machine gun and many rounds of
ammunition, tried to position their vehicle amid a convoy of American
military vehicles along a Kuwait freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The two were arrested by local authorities but released after
saying that they were on their way to a bird hunt in the desert. The
authorities described them as being drunk.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other recent incidents targeting Americans in
neighboring countries, including a violent demonstration outside the
U.S. Embassy in Bahrain. Gunmen also opened fire outside a U.S. air
base under construction in Qatar. No one was hurt in either of those
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   The site of Tuesday's shooting, Faylakah island, was abandoned by
its inhabitants when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and Iraqi forces
heavily mined it during their occupation.</TE>
<TE>   After a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait in the Gulf War, the
government compensated island residents for their property and
resettled them on the mainland. The island was kept closed for
several years while land mines were cleared. It has recently been
reopened to Kuwaitis and tourists and has become a popular fishing
spot.</TE>
<TE>   While nearly all of the damage done by Iraq in Kuwait City has
been repaired, Faylakah has been left largely untouched as a kind of
war memorial. It was chosen by the U.S. military for urban warfare
training because of the bullet-riddled ruins still left from the
Iraqi occupation.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Opposition Faces Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Campaign: On the eve of voting, parties accuse president of
trying to keep them out of the race, sometimes by pressure to switch
sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LARKANA, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Nisar Khuhro spent the first 23 days of his election campaign in
various courts, fighting an order barring him from seeking office
because his daughter had defaulted on a bank loan.</LD>
<LD>   As Khuhro, head of the Pakistan People's Party in Sindh province,
battled that ban, the opposition group's national leader and two-time
former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, faced a similar fight: She had
been ordered disqualified from running Thursday because she had
failed to appear in an anti-corruption court.</LD>
<LD>   And yet Azam Tariq, leader of an extremist group outlawed by
President Pervez Musharraf, has been allowed to stand for election to
the National Assembly from jail. A pro-Musharraf candidate even
pulled out of the race to support the extremist leader, who is
running as an independent and whose group, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan,
is blamed for killing hundreds of minority Shiite Muslims in
bombings, shootings and grenade attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "These are very sensitive matters, so they would not be left to
lower-level officials," said Afrasiab Khattak, who heads the
independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. "There has to be a
policy from above."</TE>
<TE>   As Pakistan prepares for Thursday's general election--the first
since Musharraf's October 1999 coup--opposition groups accuse his
government of trying to keep them from running, pressuring their
candidates to switch sides and otherwise manipulating the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf feels that he can get away with anything and
everything," said Mian Raza Rabbani, acting secretary-general of
Bhutto's party. "And I think he is pandering to the right-wing,
[Islamic] fundamentalist lobby as well."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders claim Musharraf is using the military's
Inter-Services Intelligence agency to intimidate candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League says
it couldn't field candidates in several districts because they were
coerced by ISI agents into joining the pro-Musharraf PML-Q, nicknamed
"the king's party" by its opponents. League chairman Raja Zafar
ul-Haq said many PML-Q converts were threatened with corruption
charges.</TE>
<TE>   In Punjab province, Rabbani said, the ISI persuaded at least 21 of
his party's candidates to defect to a pro-Musharraf party.</TE>
<TE>   Sadiq Umrani, a provincial assembly candidate in Baluchistan, is a
typical case of a politician pressured by an ISI agent, said Rabbani,
a former federal law minister.</TE>
<TE>   "He was initially told, 'It will be better for you if you stay
away from the People's Party,' " Rabbani said. "When he refused, he
got a notice from the [anti-corruption] National Accountability
Bureau, which ordered him to appear in front of an investigating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't specify any evidence, but when he went to the
investigating officer, he made the most common of charges: 'You are
living beyond your means,' " Rabbani said. Umrani fought and managed
to stay in the race as a People's Party candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, who will remain president after the vote, has
repeatedly rejected allegations that he is manipulating the election
in an effort to ensure the vote produces a compliant government. He
insists he is only reforming a corrupt system, so that a new
generation of politicians will serve the interests of the people--and
not themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident that, as a result of the forthcoming elections, a
new political culture of tolerance, accommodation and responsibility
will emerge, replacing the culture of complete political polarization
and conflict we witnessed in the past decade," Musharraf said
Saturday in the capital, Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, who is also the military's commanding general, promised
that the newly elected prime minister "will be fully in charge and
empowered to govern the country."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistanis have traditionally been passionate about their
politics, and in previous elections, rallies drew huge crowds. But
this campaign hasn't stirred much excitement. Musharraf's opponents
say that's exactly how he planned it, promoting minor parties and
trying to neutralize several major ones that have dominated Pakistan
for generations.</TE>
<TE>   The country's three biggest political names remain in exile.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto, who now lives in London, threatened to return to Pakistan
but backed down after failing to get her name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Sharif, who lives in Saudi Arabia, was allowed to run, despite a
conviction on corruption and treason charges, because Musharraf
pardoned him. But he withdrew from the race in September to protest
the ban on Bhutto.</TE>
<TE>   And Altaf Hussain, who leads the Muttahida Quami Movement, also
remains in London since fleeing Pakistan to avoid arrest in the early
1990s. His political base is refugees from the 1947 partition of
India and their descendants. His party wants more autonomy for Sindh
province.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Hussain's party in Karachi, their stronghold, said
Musharraf, who fled with his family from India at the end of British
rule, sent two generals to London to negotiate with Hussain. But
talks fell apart after politicians from his party were assassinated
and the party blamed elements of the ISI.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto supporters feel especially targeted by Musharraf. After he
issued a decree prohibiting anyone who has served two terms as prime
minister from running for reelection--a measure that could apply to
Bhutto as well as Sharif--Bhutto insisted on running. He then amended
the constitution to bar any candidate convicted of failing to appear
in front of an anti-corruption tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Since Bhutto is the only one in that category, her supporters call
the amendment a "Benazir-specific law" aimed solely at keeping her
out of office.</TE>
<TE>   Larkana, a city of about 450,000 people amid rich farmland along
the Indus River, is Bhutto's home district. It elected her to the
National Assembly four times, and she was named prime minister in
1988 and 1993. It had also sent her father to that body, and he
became prime minister in 1973. But he was overthrown four years later
and executed in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Despite numerous allegations of corruption against Bhutto over the
years, Larkana has remained a bastion of her party. Khuhro, who leads
the party in the province, says that is why the government went to
great lengths to try to disqualify him.</TE>
<TE>   One of Musharraf's election decrees bans any candidate who has
defaulted on a bank loan. The prohibition applies even if it's a
spouse or a dependent child who hasn't paid up, Khuhro says.</TE>
<TE>   He says he was barred from running because his daughter hadn't
paid a bank $13,000, her share of what remained of a $50,000 loan
taken out with three partners in 1990 to start a bus company.</TE>
<TE>   After Khuhro paid up for his daughter, an election official
refused to approve his candidacy until the company cleared the rest
of the debt, he says. When it did, Khuhro still couldn't get on the
ballot until the provincial High Court ruled that the election law
wasn't meant to punish the father of a debtor for life.</TE>
<TE>   Khuhro and other opposition leaders believe Musharraf has tried to
create "a leadership crisis" among major parties "so that people
don't get reminded of what's going on and become a problem for him,"
Khuhro said. "It's 'divide and rule.' He wants people to lose
interest in politics and voting."</TE>
<TE>   In Larkana, at least, some old political enemies are joining to
oppose Musharraf and his allies.</TE>
<TE>   The Khaksar Tehrik, which has defended farm laborers and other
poor people since 1931, has long been a rival of Bhutto's party. But
Sunday night, the movement's local patron, Sabiha Mughal, urged about
500 supporters to vote for Bhutto's candidate, saying it would be a
vote for national unity.</TE>
<TE>   "If the national parties are condemned, then the smaller parties
from the provinces will have the power," she said. "That will not be
good for the integrity of Pakistan."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Speech Gets a Mixed Review Abroad</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Some find comfort in the toned-down rhetoric. But
in the Arab world, there's a conspicuous lack of official response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>An anxious world reacted with both cautious hope and disappointment
Tuesday to President Bush's address about a possible war with Iraq,
finding comfort in indications he is committed to a U.N. process that
might head off an attack but worried about the absence of new
initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   In the Arab world, a region that many predict could descend into
turmoil if there is a war in Iraq, reaction was conspicuously muted.
Bush's speech late Monday drew a dearth of official reactions and
only passing attention of political observers.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a repeated kind of speech or rhetoric that we have been
hearing daily from the president himself or his administration," said
former Jordanian Prime Minister Taher Masri.</LD>
<TE>   However, in key European capitals and at the United Nations, there
was relief that Bush avoided the aggressive rhetoric heard last month
from some senior administration officials, who called for unilateral
military action against Iraq's Saddam Hussein and dismissed the
return of U.N. weapons inspectors as a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   Many believed that both in tone and content, Bush's speech seemed
to signal a willingness to work with the other four permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council--Britain, France, Russia and China--for
a strongly worded resolution demanding that Hussein give up any
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said they also were encouraged that Bush stressed the
goal of disarmament rather than regime change in Iraq and declared
that war was neither imminent nor inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like the State Department had done a lot of work,"
summed up a diplomat from a Security Council member country,
referring to differences within the administration on how best to
confront Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, those who wanted to watch the
speech live had to stay up until the predawn hours Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They were sitting, waiting until 4 o'clock, to see what the man
was going to say, but he did not say anything new," said Mohammed
Saleh Musfir, a political science professor at Qatar University. The
speech, Musfir said, "will not persuade anybody to support his
campaign against Iraq. I think this is a minus in his campaign, not a
plus."</TE>
<TE>   The White House had dampened speculation domestically that Bush's
speech would break new ground, but that message appeared not to have
lessened expectations overseas. Afterward, many said they saw the
speech as directed mainly at the American public and members of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the sharpest reaction from the region came from
Baghdad, where Reuters news agency quoted two senior members of the
Iraqi parliament attacking the speech. One of them, Abdul Azis
Kailani, denounced Bush's address as "full of lies and ...
unreasonable arguments." He described Bush as "just like a beast
which wants to eat small countries."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher issued one of the few
official statements in the Middle East, saying, "George Bush has a
desire to settle the Iraqi issue by peaceful ways."</TE>
<TE>   He expressed hope that U.N. inspectors would return to Iraq as
soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The statement reflected Egypt's delicate position. The country is
a major recipient of U.S. aid, but its people are strongly opposed to
American intervention in Iraq. Other Arab countries in the region
feel a similar squeeze, realizing they have little choice other than
to support the United States in the confrontation if they want to
share in postwar spoils, but knowing that the popular sentiments of
their people are with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Wahid Abdel Megid, a political analyst at Cairo's state-sponsored
Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said many
Egyptians interpreted the speech as closing the final door to peace.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, "I think there is still a chance to avoid the
war if the Iraqi regime can change its behavior and its attitude
toward the crisis, so ... the matter is dependent on the Iraqi regime
more than on the American administration."</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, leaders of some smaller nations were especially
encouraged that Bush said he would continue to press for U.N.
backing.</TE>
<TE>   "From the perspective of a small state, it is very important that
the U.N. keep its role--with all the imperfections that it has--and
that questions of war and peace be decided by the U.N.," said Predrag
Simic, foreign policy advisor to Yugoslav President Vojislav
Kostunica.</TE>
<TE>   Praise also came from officials of France. Leaders of the
center-right government welcomed Bush's emphasis on disarmament,
saying they saw encouraging signs in his speech that the U.S. and
France are converging on the need for U.N. inspections and
multilateral action.</TE>
<TE>   "If I read President Bush's statements correctly, he asserted that
a military intervention is neither imminent nor inevitable," said
Alain Juppe, leader of France's ruling coalition, the Union for a
Presidential Majority. "He talked about coalition, about action with
allies, and he recalled that the objective is the disarmament of
Iraq.... That's exactly what we advocate."</TE>
<TE>   France has proposed a two-step process in the Security Council,
requiring an initial resolution to toughen the inspection process
and, if Iraq is recalcitrant, a second one addressing the use of
force. Juppe called regime change a risky policy but agreed with Bush
that Hussein's regime poses a threat.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy and Poland, Bush's speech was interpreted as a step back
from the brink.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a mandate for an inevitable, an immediate war," said
Franco Pavoncello, a political scientist at John Cabot University in
Rome. "I think that this really gives the signal that he still wants
to play within the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jerzy Marek Nowakowski, foreign affairs commentator for the
Polish weekly Wprost: "Polish public opinion reacts very positively
to Bush's decisiveness. The American president knows that if one
speaks to a gangster, one needs a loaded gun in his pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Even in Germany, where Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has ruled out
participating in an attack on Iraq under any circumstances, there
were signs that Bush's words had a soothing effect.</TE>
<TE>   "For the German public, the speech raised a little bit of hope
that war is not coming as soon as expected," said Damir Fras of the
daily Berliner Zeitung.</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, there was no immediate official reaction to Bush's
speech, which came too late to be widely reported in the morning
papers. But senior U.S. government officials gave some indication
that intensive diplomatic consultations with Moscow were beginning to
bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Russia has nothing against an
additional U.N. resolution and would support any proposals "aimed at
increasing the effectiveness of the activity of the international
inspectors in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The comments seemed to open the door for Russian support for a
toughly worded resolution such as that sought by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Developments in Moscow came as reports at the U.N. indicated that
France was also narrowing its differences with the United States on
draft language for a formal Security Council resolution. Earlier
drafts circulated informally by the U.S. and France had indicated
that the two countries were far apart.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of predictable anger about Bush's speech from
Europe's socialist left, and there were doubts about the president's
claims of ties between the Iraqi regime and Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   French Socialist leader Jean-Marc Ayrault accused America of
veering from legitimate self-defense against terrorism "into a
crusade with airs of television evangelism against what it calls the
'axis of evil.' "</TE>
<TE>   "It's playing with matches in a barrel of gunpowder," he said.
"Preventive war imposes the rule of force rather than the rule of
law."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea's Designee Under House Arrest</HD>
<DH>China: Beijing says an entrepreneur tapped by its Communist
neighbor to run a capitalist enclave is being investigated for
illegal business activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A Chinese tycoon picked by North Korea to spearhead an experiment in
capitalist reform is under house arrest for possible economic
misdeeds in his native country, the government said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing the issue for the first time since reports of his
detention surfaced late last week, Chinese authorities confirmed that
Yang Bin's movements were being restricted by police. Yang, 39, has
not been heard from since Friday, when authorities descended on his
home in Shenyang in northern China and hustled him away.</LD>
<LD>   "The public security organs in China have, according to law, put
him under house supervision," said Zhang Qiyue, a spokeswoman for the
Chinese Foreign Ministry. "Yang Bin and his enterprises in China are
suspected of being involved in various illegal activities in China."
She did not elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Yang, head of Euro-Asia Agricultural Holdings Co., has
acknowledged owing $1.2 million in taxes but said before his
detention that he was about to settle the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, an orchid exporter who is one of China's richest men, has
been making headlines with his appointment by North Korea to head a
new specially designated economic zone in the city of Sinuiju, on the
border with China. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il shocked observers
last month by announcing that the enclave would enjoy total freedom
to pursue a free-market policy, which his hermetic, Stalinist state
has long resisted. Kim then tapped Yang, a foreigner, to lead the
reform experiment.</TE>
<TE>   No one appeared more surprised than the Chinese government, which
seemed unprepared for the announcement even though China and North
Korea are close allies. Since then, China's leaders have pursed their
lips and stated their support for reform in North Korea but have
maintained a stony silence about Yang's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's business dealings were already under investigation in China
when the government in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, swore him in
Sept. 24 as Sinuiju's leader. His sudden detention Friday might have
been in the works for some time, observers say, but its timing
amplified Beijing's displeasure with Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   The government denied any connection.</TE>
<TE>   "Yang Bin's case has nothing to do with the establishment of the
special area of Sinuiju," Zhang told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Yonhap News Agency of South Korea reported over the
weekend that China was sending a senior official to North Korea this
week to try to keep the rift between the Communist allies from
widening.</TE>
<TE>   Also, North Korea's vice president is scheduled to visit China
next week.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into Yang's dealings comes at a sensitive time
politically for China's leaders, who are gearing up for an important
Communist Party conclave next month that could bring in a new
generation of top officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing regime is acutely aware of simmering dissatisfaction
among ordinary people over corruption and the vastly uneven
distribution of wealth. Residents assume that the newly rich are the
beneficiaries of ill-gotten gains, and in many cases they are right.</TE>
<TE>   To be seen as combating the problem, the government has launched a
high-profile crackdown on tax cheats, a campaign that has so far
netted one of China's best-known celebrities, movie star Liu
Xiaoqing.</TE>

<HD>West Coast Ports Ordered to Reopen</HD>
<DH>Labor: Bush uses the Taft-Hartley Act to request emergency
court action to end the dispute. The shutdown could end as early as
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON, JOSEPH MENN and PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast ports are set to reopen tonight after a federal court
Tuesday granted a temporary injunction ending the lockout that has
bottled up ports from San Diego to Seattle, inflicting billions of
dollars in damage on an already shaky economy.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush requested the emergency order Tuesday after a White
House panel informed him that "seeds of distrust" had so poisoned
relations between shipping lines and dockworkers that the two sides
were unlikely to reach an agreement on their own.</LD>
<LD>   "The crisis in our Western ports is hurting the economy; it is
hurting the security of our country, and the federal government must
act," Bush said outside the West Wing of the White House. "This
nation simply cannot afford to have hundreds of billons of dollars
... in ... manufacturing and agricultural trade sitting idle."</LD>
<TE>   Analysts have estimated that the 10-day lockout has cost the
economy $1 billion to $2 billion a day in lost sales, wages and
production. Those figures are hard to quantify. But the Justice
Department on Tuesday marshaled new statistics to bolster its case,
predicting that a lengthy shutdown of the ports could cost 140,000
American jobs by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The government likewise played the defense card given the expected
conflict with Iraq and continuing concern over terrorism, contending
that an extended shutdown would have a "substantial negative impact
on military readiness during a time of national crisis."</TE>
<TE>   The government's complaint included testimony from Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who said a continued shutdown of the 29
West Coast ports would adversely affect the ability to move supplies
overseas in the event of war and jeopardize the global fight against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who issued
the order, said the government's arguments were "very compelling."</TE>
<TE>   "The docks are rotting with perishables," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alsup's granting of the temporary restraining order Tuesday marks
the beginning of an 80-day cooling-off period for management and the
10,500-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union to restart
their stalled negotiations, as required under the provisions of the
Taft-Hartley Act. Both sides are scheduled to appear in court Oct.
16, when Alsup will consider converting his temporary order into a
preliminary injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's politically sensitive move, coming only five weeks before
congressional midterm elections, makes him the first president in
nearly a quarter of a century to intervene in a labor dispute using
the Taft-Hartley Act. That 1947 legislation allows the president to
use the power of the courts to temporarily end work stoppages that
"imperil the national health and safety."</TE>
<TE>   "This is great news," said Robin Lanier, director of the West
Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents about 50 large retailers
and manufacturers dependent on waterborne trade. "But the question
now is, what are the logistics of getting the enormous backlog
unstuck?"</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, said it would call union members to report for
work at 6 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping group locked out union workers Sept. 29 after a
series of disruptions that slowed the movement of cargo. Union
members said delays were the result of a crush of cargo during the
peak shipping season, as well as an effort by workers to observe
proper safety procedures in the wake of five union worker deaths
along the West Coast waterfront this year.</TE>
<TE>   As the ports reopen, the prospect of continued disruptions remain.
Union spokesman Steve Stallone said after the court ruling that dock
employees would continue to "work safely" and follow the contract
terms closely.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone predicted that the Pacific Maritime Assn. probably would
accuse the union of a slowdown, using productivity comparisons from
months ago, that could result in court sanctions against the union.
Stallone said those comparisons are unfair because the current
gridlock will make it difficult to work at anything resembling a
normal pace.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to be trying to financially break this union with
fines and throw our leaders in jail," Stallone said. "It's going to
cost us a bundle to defend ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Under the court order, ILWU members must resume work at a "normal
and reasonable rate of speed."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn.'s Sugerman would not speculate on what
the management group would do in the event of a union slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll cross that bridge when we get there," Sugerman said. But
President Joseph Miniace previously said the shipping group was
prepared to present productivity records in court if the work pace
slows.</TE>
<TE>   The court order followed a last-ditch effort by Bush
administration officials to avoid using the Taft-Hartley Act by
asking both sides to agree to an unconditional 30-day extension of
the expired labor contract. The Pacific Maritime Assn. had said
throughout the lockout that it would open the ports if the union
signed such an extension, which would prevent it from staging further
slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The union agreed to the deal but the shipping group rejected it,
despite a personal appeal from Eugene Scalia, the Labor Department's
chief attorney.</TE>
<TE>   After five months of negotiations, sporadic slowdowns and a
weeklong lockout, Miniace said, the shipping group could not risk
more slowdowns after the 30-day extension expired, when docks would
be buried with backed-up cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take us six to nine weeks to dig out from under
this," Miniace said. "The backup is horrific."</TE>
<TE>   Miniace also said that a court order is better insurance against
work disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Under Taft-Hartley, a federal mediator is in charge and a federal
judge will be looking over operations at the terminals," he said.
"Hopefully we'll have this contract done by the end of that 80 days.
If we don't, at least the supply chain will be ironed out by then."</TE>
<TE>   But union officials said the shipping group's decision proved the
point they have been making since negotiations began in May: that the
employers have been counting on federal intervention to strengthen
their hand at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been saying all they needed was a day-to-day extension.
We give them a 30-day [extension] and suddenly it's not good enough
for them," Stallone said.</TE>
<TE>   He also faulted federal officials for failing to publicly note the
Pacific Maritime Assn.'s about-face. "That's the kind of treatment we
get with the Bush administration," Stallone said.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between the union and the management group collapsed
Sunday night, prompting Bush to establish a three-member board of
inquiry under the Taft-Hartley Act. That panel recommended an 80-day
cooling-off period, during which the ports would reopen and both
sides would return to the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the seeds of distrust have been widely sown,
poisoning the atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, which could
enable a resolution of seemingly intractable issues," the panel said.
"We have no confidence the parties will resolve the West Coast ports
dispute within a reasonable time."</TE>
<TE>   If no settlement is reached within 60 days, the three-member panel
headed by former Republican Sen. Bill Brock will issue a report
laying out where the two sides stand. Union members then would be
required to vote on management's latest offer. If members rejected
the offer and the 80 days lapsed, the two sides could resume their
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the president's decision to invoke Taft-Hartley, its
first use in 24 years, was divided along generally predictable lines.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups, which lobbied Bush heavily to intervene in the
dispute, applauded the decision. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the
National Assn. of Manufacturers, said the back-to-work order would
help avert "the potential for major damage to an already fragile
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Rep. George Radanovich of Mariposa praised Bush, saying
"no state stands to lose more [from a continued shutdown] than
California.'</TE>
<TE>   "As the country's headquarters for the agriculture and high-tech
industries, California businesses have millions of dollars worth of
goods that are rotting or collecting dust on the docks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Democratic leaders excoriated the president for
interfering in the collective bargaining process in ways that they
said favored management.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said, "When the
president decided to invoke Taft-Hartley, he turned his back on the
collective bargaining process and our nation's workers."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need drastic measures; we need the collective bargaining
process to be allowed to work," Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The fight between the ILWU and management has centered on the
introduction of labor-saving technology that could eliminate
longshore jobs and dilute the union's clout on the docks.</TE>
<TE>   During the lockout, tons of cargo has been stranded in more than
200 cargo ships at berths or anchored off the coast.</TE>

<HD>A Clouded View of U.S. Jews</HD>
<DH>Religion: One study finds numbers falling; another finds
growth. The results raise divisive questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than a decade, the American Jewish community has poured
millions of dollars and thousands of hours into programs driven by a
single fear--the prospect that the country's Jewish population is
dwindling away.</LD>
<LD>   Now, two conflicting population studies have set off a new debate
over whether those programs are failing--or even aimed in the wrong
direction.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary results released Tuesday from the most comprehensive
survey ever conducted of America's Jewish residents--the $6-million,
five-year National Jewish Population Survey--show that in the last
decade the population dipped slightly, to 5.2 million. The results
come just two weeks after another study found the population
increasing to 6.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   The difference involves not just issues of demographic technique,
but also emotionally divisive questions of who should be properly
considered Jewish and what the future holds for American Jewry.</TE>
<TE>   That future "doesn't look too good," said Viv Klaff, a University
of Delaware professor who was one of the directors of the latest
population survey. The study's numbers show an aging population that
has too few children to keep its numbers steady.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "Jews are a growing, thriving, sustained and even
powerful American subculture," insists Gary Tobin, president of the
San Francisco-based Institute for Jewish &amp; Community Research, which
conducted the survey showing that the population is growing.</TE>
<TE>   The study results involve emotional issues of identity and
powerful practical ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   On the practical level, the numbers are used to set the national
Jewish agenda for years to come and influence spending priorities for
the roughly $850 million raised in annual campaigns by Jewish
federations throughout North America.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional punch comes from the question of whom to count.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all American ethnic groups face similar issues of how to
maintain a distinctive identity while assimilating into the broader
American society. The debate over group survival is particularly
emotional, however, for a people that has suffered a history of
pogroms, peril and the horror of the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, Jewish religious tradition held that to be
considered Jewish, a person had to be the child of a Jewish mother or
had to have undergone a formal conversion. In more recent years,
Judaism's Reform movement decided to count the offspring of Jewish
fathers as Jews. But demographers employ a far wider definition.</TE>
<TE>   The national survey, for instance, counted as Jewish those
respondents who reported Judaism as their faith, along with those who
considered themselves ethnic or cultural Jews: those who may have
said they practiced no faith but were born of Jewish parents or who
were raised Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin, on the other hand, cast his net even wider. In addition to
the 6.7 million Americans who reported Judaism as their primary faith
or ethnic identification, he found another 6.6 million linked in some
way to the Jewish people. They include those who practice Judaism as
a secondary faith, those who have some Jewish ancestry but do not
practice Judaism, and those married to a Jew.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a huge potential for people to become Jews," Tobin said.
"Jews are caught in this obsession with birthright and bloodline. But
the experience of America is that religious identity is a matter of
choice. It's time for the American Jewish community to change its
psychology and think of who can come in instead of who's going out."</TE>
<TE>   Tobin also criticizes the national survey on technical grounds.
The study was an enormous undertaking involving 5 million calls made
to households using random digit dialing to find 177,000 households
that included 4,500 Jewish respondents.</TE>
<TE>   But Tobin asserts that the survey method undercounts recent
immigrants from Russia and Israel, along with younger Jews and those
who live in the West.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the national survey failed to include entire segments
of the population, such as adopted children and the offspring of
women more than 40 years old--thereby misstating the fertility rate.
His own survey, based on 250 Jewish respondents gleaned from 10,000
households screened, found 18% more Jews than reported in earlier
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the United Jewish Communities, the umbrella
organization that sponsored the population study, declined to respond
to Tobin's critique, saying the survey "stands on its merits."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is a renewal of a 10-year-old debate over how best to
ensure the long-term survival of the American Jewish population.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the last national Jewish population survey found Jewish
numbers to be stagnant, and 52% of Jews married in the preceding five
years had wed non-Jews. That figure, although widely criticized since
as inaccurate, caused the organized American Jewish community to
mount an intensive campaign to strengthen Jewish identity through day
schools, programs to Israel and other activities.</TE>
<TE>   The survey inspired similar programs across the religious
spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   They ranged from the Orthodox National Jewish Outreach initiative
to teach Hebrew and Sabbath rituals to a larger number of Jews, to
the multidenominational Synagogue 2000 effort aimed at transforming
synagogues from largely ethnic enterprises to centers of spirituality
that would attract and hold larger numbers of people.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the Jewish Federation of Greater Los
Angeles began pouring millions of new dollars into Jewish education:
support for Jewish day schools, summer camps, college programming and
visits to Israel for youths. Across the United States, the number of
non-Orthodox Jewish high schools has increased to 29 from five since
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Federation President John Fishel said the 1990 survey helped make
Jewish education the organization's No. 1 priority--a focus the
Orthodox community has always promoted.</TE>
<TE>   "The most committed community is the knowledgeable community,"
said Rabbi Elazar Muskin of Young Israel of Century City, an Orthodox
synagogue. "The survey proves that the community has to continue to
improve the effectiveness of Jewish education."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Hoffman, chairman of United Jewish Communities, said the
new results may prompt a review of whether Jews are being deterred
from having more children because of the high cost of Jewish
education and other services.</TE>
<TE>   Lowering the cost of such services might produce more involvement
in Jewish life, said Pini Herman, a Los Angeles-based demographer who
has studied the Jewish population.</TE>
<TE>   A "big basket" of services for a family of four--including such
items as Jewish day schools, synagogue and organizational
memberships, bar and bat mitzvah events--runs as much as $28,000
annually, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Making Jewish life more affordable should be a higher priority for
the community, he said. "A lot of Jews are being priced out of the
Jewish market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin and other critics of the organized community's efforts argue
that Jews should adopt a different strategy to increase their
numbers: abandoning their traditional reticence about proselytizing
and putting more resources into embracing potential Jews.</TE>
<TE>   A leading national proponent of that idea is Rabbi Harold
Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom in Van Nuys, who speaks often of
opening Judaism to what he calls "the unchurched and the seekers."</TE>
<TE>   Schulweis said he plans to make that a particular focus this year
by organizing more one-on-one encounters--invitations to Friday night
dinners, for instance--between Jews in his synagogue and those
interested in the faith.</TE>

<LD>The numerous reports of death and illness among users of dietary
supplements containing the herb ephedra show that the government must
ban the unrestricted sales of such products, a panel of experts
testified before Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Ephedra, the experts told a Senate subcommittee, has been linked
to heart attacks and strokes and has not been proven to have any
valid medical purpose.</LD>
<LD>   They urged the Food and Drug Administration to remove the products
from the market.</LD>
<TE>   "It is beyond dispute that ephedra has triggered heart attacks and
death," said Bill Jeffery of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest in Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   He said supplements with ephedra are banned in Canada, which
classifies the herb as a "class 1 health risk."</TE>

<HD>Bush Calls War His 'Last Choice'</HD>
<DH>Politics: President raises $1 million for Tennessee GOP.
Besides focusing on Iraq, he also notes stock market woes but says he
remains optimistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALCOA, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>With November's elections approaching, President Bush focused on
politics Tuesday as he addressed a political rally here, attended a
$1-million Republican fund-raiser in nearby Knoxville and then
returned to Washington to mingle with $100,000 party donors.</LD>
<LD>   But in both of his speeches to Tennessee audiences, Bush
reiterated the case for action against Iraq and--returning to
domestic issues--took note of the dropping stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Replaying the message he detailed Monday night in Cincinnati, the
president vowed to pressure Iraqi President Saddam Hussein--by force,
if necessary--to destroy his suspected weapons of mass destruction
programs.</LD>
<TE>   But as he did Monday, Bush left the door open for a peaceful
resolution to the showdown with Hussein. "It's his choice to make,"
Bush told hundreds of cheering supporters in a giant hangar at the
McGhee Tyson Airport here.</TE>
<TE>   "A military option is my last choice," Bush said. But should war
become unavoidable, he added, "we'll be prepared, we'll have a great
plan."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have said that a range of military
options has been presented to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Shedding the somber and deliberate demeanor that marked his
Cincinnati speech, Bush on Tuesday returned to his more colloquial
speaking style.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to those responsible for last year's terrorist attacks
on the United States, Bush vowed to "hunt the killers down, one
person at a time, and bring them to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the issue of Iraq: he said, "I've got a problem,
obviously, with Mr. Saddam Hussein, and so do you. And that is, he
poses a threat. He poses a threat to America, he poses a threat to
our friends, our Israeli friends, our friends in his own
neighborhood. He is a threat."</TE>
<TE>   The question facing the world is, "do we deal with this guy, or
not," Bush said. "We'll see whether or not the United Nations has the
desire, has the backbone necessary to uphold its own resolutions and
help keep the peace. But if they're unable to act, and if Saddam
Hussein can't do what he said he would do, which is disarm, this
country will lead a coalition and disarm him, for the sake of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Congress is expected within days to approve a resolution granting
Bush broad authority to act against Baghdad. Bush said, "I look
forward to watching the Congress debate this issue this week. I
believe we're going to get a strong resolution, backed by both
Republicans and Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of those Democrats expected to back the resolution have
questioned whether the administration's push for a confrontation with
Iraq has been partly motivated by a desire to distract attention from
economic problems as the November vote nears.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush, in his remarks Tuesday, made a rare, direct reference to
one of the economy's weakest sectors--the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously I'm concerned as well when the stock market is
declining," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the president expressed his optimism about the
economy's basic strength and took note of some positive signs,
including low interest rates and high productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "The foundation for growth is good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has regularly spoken about the economy and his support for
job-creation initiatives, but his remarks have taken on new
significance because of recent polls showing widespread public
anxiety over the economy.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer indicated that as
elections approach, Bush plans to devote time to campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to focus on those candidates who support
his agenda, so that he'll have better prospects for passage of
legislation to improve education, to protect people's pensions, to
create jobs," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In Knoxville, Bush raised $750,000 for Rep. Van Hilleary, the
Republican gubernatorial candidate, and $250,000 for the Tennessee
Republican Party.</TE>

<HD>Congress Debates War Plans</HD>
<DH>Resolution: Lawmakers take up Iraq issue but uncertainty
remains over whether the nation is really on the cusp of military
action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Tuesday joined the Senate in the sobering debate over
authorizing the use of military force against Iraq, but a marked
sense of uncertainty hangs over both chambers about whether the
nation is, in fact, on the brink of war.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has insisted he has not decided whether he would
use military force even if Congress authorizes it, and his top
national security aides swarmed Capitol Hill to tell lawmakers that
the administration will go to war only if diplomatic efforts aimed at
Iraq fail.</LD>
<LD>   "War is the last resort," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
as he headed into meetings with lawmakers at the Capitol. "I want to
reassure the American people that neither the president nor Congress
is leaping into something without thinking."</LD>
<TE>   In a letter made public Tuesday, the CIA said the probability of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein initiating an unprovoked attack in the
near future, while he is still building an arsenal, is low.</TE>
<TE>   But if attacked, he would likely respond with biological or
chemical weapons. The letter was signed on behalf of CIA Director
George J. Tenet and sent to the Senate Intelligence Committee as part
of a document declassification.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet on Tuesday denied the letter contradicted the imminent
nature of the Iraqi threat as described by President Bush in his
televised speech Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we think the chances of Saddam initiating a WMD [weapons
of mass destruction] attack at this moment are low--in part because
it would constitute an admission that he possesses WMD--there is no
question that the likelihood of Saddam using WMD against the United
States or our allies in the region for blackmail, deterrence or
otherwise grows as his arsenal continues to build."</TE>
<TE>   As debate opened in the House and continued in the Senate on the
authority Bush seeks, his allies argued that the best way to avoid
the need for a U.S.-led military strike is to deliver a strong
bipartisan vote in support of the administration's policy. They said
that would strengthen Powell's hand in building an international
coalition to stand up to Hussein and force disarmament of his
suspected weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is through a strong show of support for this joint resolution
that war can best be avoided," Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) said.
"Against such an implacable foe as Saddam Hussein, peace can only be
achieved through strength--the strength of conviction as much as the
strength of arms. It is only when the Iraqi dictator is certain of
our resolve and our ability that peace becomes possible."</TE>
<TE>   But many hawks in Congress and the administration say it is plain
that, based on Hussein's record of noncompliance with U.N. mandates,
the use of force against his regime is almost inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein's track record is he's never complied," said Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.). "Everyone understands that if Saddam Hussein
doesn't comply, this means that the president can and probably will
take military action."</TE>
<TE>   And some antiwar lawmakers argue that, despite the
administration's insistence that war is a last resort, the
saber-rattling of recent months puts the United States irretrievably
on the road to war.</TE>
<TE>   "Preparing for war ensures it will truly happen," said Rep. David
E. Bonior (D-Mich.), one of three antiwar Democrats who traveled
recently to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers on all sides predict Bush will win the power he seeks to
deal with Iraq when Congress takes its final vote on the issue. That
vote is expected Thursday in the House, and perhaps by week's end in
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, top administration officials have thrown themselves into
lobbying wavering members to pump up Bush's margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Powell lunched with Senate Republicans on Tuesday then met with
uncommitted House Democrats. National security advisor Condoleezza
Rice briefed senators of both parties. A delegation of House
fence-sitters was brought to the Pentagon for a breakfast briefing by
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jack Quinn (R-N.Y.), one of those invited to the Pentagon,
said the briefing--and Bush's speech on Iraq Monday night--helped
"move me further" toward supporting the president's position.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty about whether Bush will take military action
against Iraq underscores the unusual ambiguity of the resolution
before Congress. Bush is asking for authority to wage a war he has
not yet decided to mount, so Congress is voting simply to allow Bush
to decide later whether to attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the resolution's foes sought to focus on that point.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is asking Congress to delegate its constitutional
power to declare war before he has decided we need to go to war,"
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Tuesday. "But he has not
adequately explained what this war will look like."</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty also distinguishes the current debate from the one
in 1991 on authorizing an attack on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait. The
question then was not whether but when the United States would
attack, and the military action began within days of Congress' vote.</TE>
<TE>   The House debate began with a rare floor speech by Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who argued that inaction is not an option in
the face of the perceived threat posed by Iraq. "The only thing
necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,"
Hastert said, quoting Edmund Burke. "We must not let evil triumph."</TE>
<TE>   The House is expected to continue its debate today and vote
Thursday on three alternatives:</TE>
<TE>   * Bush's proposal, which would grant him broad authority to use
any means he determines necessary and appropriate--including military
force--to respond to any security threat posed by Iraq. It requires
Bush to certify to Congress, within 48 hours of launching any attack,
that diplomatic avenues had proved fruitless and that an attack was
"consistent" with ongoing efforts to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   * An alternative by Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.) that
authorizes military force only in conjunction with passage of a new
U.N. Security Council resolution. Bush would have to come back to
Congress if the U.N. fails to act. A comparable measure by Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) will be voted on in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * A measure by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) that would urge the
United States to work for Iraqi disarmament through peaceful means
using U.N. diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Bush's resolution claimed Tuesday that in the
432-member House, they expected 100 lawmakers to vote against it. But
it is a discouraging time for outnumbered dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a reluctant debate," said Rep. Louise McIntosh
Slaughter (D-N.Y.). "Everyone feels the pressure of: Why now?"</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he hoped
to bring the Iraq resolution to a final vote by week's end. But the
debate could stretch into next week because Sen. Robert C. Byrd
(D-W.Va.), who opposes Bush on Iraq, has blocked efforts to expedite
action.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-backed resolution was formally introduced in the Senate
on Tuesday by Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), joined by Sens. John W.
Warner (R-Va.), Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) and McCain.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000 and
a potential challenger to Bush in the 2004 campaign, has strongly
backed the administration on its push to confront Iraq. Explaining
his position, Lieberman said: "There is no one other nation that
brings as much poison and evil intent together, and in that sense so
threatens the United States of America, as Iraq."</TE>

<HD>At House, Open Mike on War and Peace</HD>
<DH>Congress: Lawmakers drop talk on other issues to
concentrate on Iraq resolution. The debate is scheduled for 20 hours,
but it could go longer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It's been nearly 12 years since both houses of Congress held a
simultaneous, all-consuming, full-throated debate on war and peace.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq, Part II, seized the stage on both sides of the Capitol on
Tuesday as the House added its voice to the Senate's in a marathon
talkfest on the possibility of another Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   Shoved aside were bankruptcy reform, election reform, pension
reform, energy policy, budget battles, tax cuts, prescription drug
benefits and anything else that lawmakers might have wanted to talk
about in the days before a pivotal midterm election.</LD>
<TE>   Well over half of the 432 House members may speak by the time the
Iraq debate ends, along with most of the 100 senators.</TE>
<TE>   For the Senate, which has been discussing Iraq since Thursday,
extended debate is routine. But in the House, it's is a rarity.
Leaders and backbenchers alike are being given free rein to speak
out--as long as they can keep their comments to six minutes or less.</TE>
<TE>   So, even though it is clear that both chambers will back a
resolution giving President Bush broad authority to use military
force, if necessary, against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
lawmakers are lining up to speak their piece.</TE>
<TE>   They seem aware that these speeches are not the usual throwaways
that fill up Washington air time. Some were reminded of the
outpouring of remarks last year, in the days after the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Those with long tenure compared the debate with the deliberations
on the original Gulf War resolution, which lasted three days. A
congressional aide recalled that the 1991 debate was extended nine
times to allow everyone a chance to speak out. Others, like Rep. John
M. McHugh (R-N.Y.), compared the current debate with the day in 1998
that the House impeached President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For historic importance, impeachment and Iraq "far exceed every
other issue in my 10 years here," McHugh said as he was walking to
his office to work on his speech in favor of the Bush-backed
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after excoriating that same resolution on the House floor,
in a seven-minute speech that was lengthy by the chamber's standards,
Rep. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.) said in an interview that the Iraq
debate was even more important than impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned that history will accuse us of lowering the
standard for a 'just war,' " Delahunt said. To make his point, he
reached back to a speech that Daniel Webster gave in 1837 laying out
limited scenarios in which preemptive attacks would be justified.</TE>
<TE>   Delahunt, knowing that his side would lose, said he was speaking
out "for the record, for history and for the American people."</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the House debate is scheduled to last 20 hours--17
hours for consideration of the resolution favored by Bush and House
leaders, one hour each for two alternatives pushed by Democratic
dissidents and an hour to wrap up. But the time allotted could
be--and lawmakers say probably will be--lengthened by agreement of
the GOP and Democratic leadership. House leaders were planning to
stay in session late into the night to accommodate speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio), a leader of the opposition
forces, said 76 Democrats have sought time to speak against the
Bush-backed resolution. An equal number may speak for it.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are about 120 Republicans who are nearly unanimous in
support of the president and want the opportunity to say so.</TE>
<TE>   The scene in the House chamber Tuesday afternoon showed anew how
Washington's great debates these days are aimed more at a television
audience than at lawmakers themselves. The galleries were mostly
empty, save for a sprinkling of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   In one typical hour, 11 members squeezed in speeches. Rep. David
E. Bonior (D-Mich.), who recently returned from Baghdad, gave one of
the final stemwinders of his 26-year House career, leaning back on
his heels and then windmilling his arms forward to drive home his
argument against the administration's position. "If we strike first,
what kind of message does that send to the tinderboxes of Pakistan
and India, China and Taiwan, North and South Korea?" asked Bonior,
who is leaving Congress at the end of the session.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), up next, gave a ringing defense of Bush.
"Appeasement does not work," he said, speaking without notes and
waving a finger of warning. "Nobody wants war. But we are at war,
right now," he added, taking note of the post-Sept. 11 war on
terrorism. "We have a chance right now to avoid more carnage in
America."</TE>
<TE>   Then followed Reps. Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks, a Democrat
backing Bush; Barbara Lee of Oakland, a Democrat passionately
opposed; and Ron Paul of Texas, one of the few Republicans opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Paul, speaking from a few handwritten notes, mocked the idea that
Hussein represents a serious threat. Observing the futility of Iraq's
attacks on allied warplanes patrolling "no-fly" zones, Paul said:
"The fact that he has missed every single airplane for 12 years--and
thousands of sorties have been flown--indicates the strength of our
enemy." Paul declared that the U.S. was in jeopardy of violating what
the Christian doctrine of a "just war" would be--in response to
aggression and after the exhaustion of diplomatic negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But only a few Republicans were expected to echo his view in the
days ahead.</TE>

<HD>Secret Deportation Hearings Are Upheld</HD>
<DH>Terror: The decision is at odds with earlier ruling on
similar case. Issue could go to high court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government may legally hold secret deportation hearings for
individuals targeted in the sweeping post-Sept. 11 terrorism
investigation, a divided federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision is the first by a federal appellate court upholding
controversial government secrecy policies enacted in the aftermath of
the terrorist attacks. It reversed the ruling of U.S. District Judge
John W. Bissell in Newark, N.J., who held in May that the government
policy violated the 1st Amendment right of the press and the public
to attend such hearings.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government
has the right to close the hearings on grounds of "national
security," saying it trumps the public's 1st Amendment right of
access.</LD>
<TE>   "Since the primary national policy must be self-preservation, it
seems elementary that, to the extent open deportation hearings might
impair national security," it is logical for the government to close
the hearings, Judge Edward R. Becker wrote for the majority.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 decision is at odds with an Aug. 26 decision by a federal
appeals court in Cincinnati, making it likely that the U.S. Supreme
Court will review the thorny issue. These are the only two cases that
have been filed on this issue, although there are other pending legal
challenges to government policies adopted after the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the 3rd Circuit ruling applies only in its
jurisdiction--New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Virgin
Islands, just as the 6th Circuit decision applies only in Michigan,
Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Anthony J. Scirica dissented, saying the government had not
justified a blanket policy of closure. Scirica said that while there
might be valid reasons to close some hearings, federal immigration
judges were capable of deciding--"with substantial deference to
national security"--which ones to close on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision "is not just a victory for the Justice
Department, but for every American relying on the government to take
every legal step possible to protect our nation from acts of terror
while preserving constitutional liberties," said Assistant Atty. Gen.
Robert D. McCallum Jr. Justice Department regulations dating from
1964, he added, have expressly allowed "select deportation hearings
to be closed to protect public interest, and this authority is an
important constitutional tool in this time of war."</TE>
<TE>   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who argued
the case on behalf of three New Jersey newspapers seeking access to
closed deportation hearings, said he was disappointed and might ask
for a rehearing from a larger panel of 3rd Circuit judges or a review
by the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision sanctions locking up people based on secret
hearings," Gelernt said. "That is profoundly at odds with basic
principles of fairness."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the Justice Department
launched a massive probe, taking more than 1,200 noncitizens into
custody. The vast majority were never charged with any act of
terrorism, but many had violated immigration laws, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 763 taken into custody on immigration charges, only 35 are
still being held for that reason, Jorge Martinez, a spokesman for the
Justice Department, said Tuesday. Martinez added that 446 had been
deported, 242 had been released and 40 had been transferred to other
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Bergen Record, the Herald News of West Paterson and the New
Jersey Law Journal sued in federal court in March after their
reporters were denied access to hearings as well as to notification
of the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration judges in New Jersey had launched a blanket closure
policy in response to a Sept. 21, 2001, directive by chief U.S.
Immigration Judge Michael Creppy.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Bissell issued a nationwide injunction prohibiting the
government from holding closed hearings, saying the plaintiffs would
be irreparably harmed if they could not attend the hearings. In June,
the Supreme Court stayed his ruling while the government's appeal was
pending.</TE>
<TE>   The 3rd Circuit majority--Becker, joined by Judge Morton I.
Greenberg--took a dramatically different approach from the 6th
Circuit panel, which ruled 3-0 that the government's blanket closure
of deportation hearings for people targeted after Sept. 11 was
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   In that ruling, Judge Damon Keith said, "Democracies die behind
closed doors."</TE>
<TE>   Becker, the 3rd Circuit's chief judge, responded by quoting a
skeptical commentary in the Washington Post by Michael Kelly:</TE>
<TE>   "Democracies die behind closed doors. So they do, sometimes. But
far more democracies have succumbed to open assaults of one sort or
another--invasions from without, military coups and totalitarian
revolutions from within--than from the usurpation-by-in-camera
incrementalism that Judge Keith fears."</TE>
<TE>   The executive branch has virtually total power over immigration
matters, and the Justice Department asserted that in both of these
cases this power should supersede any 1st Amendment right of access
to deportation hearings. The 3rd Circuit disagreed, but nonetheless
ruled for the government.</TE>
<TE>   The 3rd Circuit majority said that there was not an unbroken,
uncontradicted history of deportation hearings being open in the same
way that criminal trials are open. The court said there was only a
qualified right of access to such hearings, similar to rules
governing hearings on Social Security disability benefits and other
administrative proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the court said that it had to consider the potential
adverse consequences of open hearings in light of the events of Sept.
11 and the ensuing "war against terrorism that has pervaded the
sinews of our national life since that day."</TE>
<TE>   The majority accepted the argument of Justice Department lawyers
that holding open hearings might lead to the revelation of sensitive
information, including seemingly innocuous facts that, in reality,
could tip off terrorists to what government investigators know or do
not know about their activities. "In this case, the Government
presented substantial evidence that open deportation hearings would
threaten national security," Becker wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Scirica, the dissenting judge, said courts should accord the
executive branch substantial deference in matters of national
security. But he added, "Deference is not a basis for abdicating our
responsibilities under the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   He said that closure of some of these cases might be warranted but
that the government had not demonstrated why all should presumptively
be closed.</TE>
<TE>   "National security interests can be fully accommodated" by
case-by-case review, Scirica concluded. All three 3rd Circuit judges
were appointed by President Reagan, as was Bissell, the lower court
judge. All three judges in the 6th Circuit case were appointed by
Democratic presidents.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from the House debate on whether to grant President Bush
authority to use force on Iraq:</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo): "With this resolution, Congress
is making clear that our first priority is building an international
coalition through the United Nations.... While I am firmly committed
to using diplomacy first and our military only if we must, I cannot
ignore Saddam Hussein's track record of disdain for international
law. With everything we know about his aggressive pursuit of weapons
of mass destruction, it would be irresponsible not to at least make
plans for what we may need to do in order to counter the threat he
poses."</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Lynn C. Woolsey (D-Petaluma): "I will vote against the
president's resolution because I do not believe we are making anyone
safer if we alienate our allies, or set a precedent that it is
acceptable to preemptively attack another country because we don't
like their leader, or because we think they're dangerous. I will vote
against the president's resolution because we shouldn't risk the
lives of our sons and daughters and the lives of Iraqi civilians when
we have no evidence that our country is in imminent danger. I will
vote against the president's resolution because we must not spend our
scarce tax dollars on war.... "</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo): "Just as leaders and diplomats who
appeased Hitler at Munich in 1938 stand humiliated before history, so
will we if we appease Saddam Hussein today.... Imagine a future in
which Iraq continues to build its arsenal of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons. Wielding such weapons of mass destruction, Saddam
Hussein not only assures his own survival but rises to preeminence in
the Arab world.... "</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas): "There is no doubt that
Saddam Hussein's regime poses a threat to the Iraqi people, to his
neighbors in the Middle East, to the United States and to the world
at large with his biological and chemical weapons and his nuclear
program. In the face of this legitimate threat, I cannot
unequivocally count out future military action. However, I strongly
believe that the most effective way of combating this menace is by
solidifying the support of the international community and acting
within the auspices of the United Nations, not by acting
unilaterally."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas): "So far, the United Nations has
proved unwilling to back its words with actions.... With every U.N.
resolution Iraq ignores, it threatens international peace. Unless and
until Iraq complies fully with the inspections -- a standard it has
never met -- there remains ample justification for taking action to
defend the security of our nation."</TE>

<LD>Americans are even fatter than they think they are, with nearly a
third of all adults -- almost 59 million people -- rated obese in a
disturbing new government survey based on actual body measurements.</LD>
<LD>   One in five Americans, or 19.8%, had considered themselves obese
in a 2000 survey based on people's own assessments of their girth.</LD>
<LD>   The new 1999-2000 survey puts the real number at 31% -- a doubling
over the last two decades. The new number is considered more reliable
since people consistently underestimate their weight.</LD>
<TE>   "The problem keeps getting worse," said Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. "This has profound health implications."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a measurement-based survey of young people found that
15% of youngsters ages 6 to 19 were seriously overweight. That is
nearly 9 million youths and triple the number in a similar assessment
from 1980.</TE>
<TE>   The findings appear in today's Journal of the American Medical
Assn. The results come from nationally representative surveys of
4,115 adults and 4,722 children.</TE>
<TE>   Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher.
The index is a measure of weight relative to height.</TE>

<HD>Freeh Bristles at Critics of FBI Efforts to Fight Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Ex-director defends his own actions and says
bureau lacked money and staffing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Appearing before Congress on Tuesday for the first time since Sept.
11, former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh strongly defended the bureau's
actions before the terrorist attacks and his own record as a key
architect of U.S. anti-terrorism policy for much of the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   Freeh, who stepped down in June 2001 after eight years as FBI
chief, struck a measured but defiant tone in his testimony before the
joint congressional intelligence committee that is investigating the
2001 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   He read aloud a 25-page statement that largely ignored or brushed
aside criticism leveled against the FBI by both staff and witnesses
in previous hearings.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Freeh complained that both the Clinton and early Bush
administrations--as well as Congress--had failed to provide adequate
funding for the FBI's expanding counter-terrorism mission before the
World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks that killed more than 3,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   During questioning, Freeh refused to acknowledge criticism that
the FBI had missed crucial clues about the hijackers in America, that
it focused too much on prosecuting criminals and too little on
thwarting terrorist attacks, or that the tight-lipped FBI "culture"
had created communication problems that hampered analysis of incoming
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an absolute misperception that we have a culture in
which information is not shared," Freeh said. He insisted that
similar charges that the FBI does not cooperate with the CIA are also
incorrect. America's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies
"have been fully cooperating," he said, and their communications are
"exemplary."</TE>
<TE>   When Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.) twice demanded that Freeh "explain
the Arizona memo," a reference to the FBI's failure to respond to a
Phoenix agent's warnings in July 2001 that potential Middle Eastern
terrorists were training at U.S. flight schools, Freeh conceded the
system wasn't perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying there were not gaps," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the failure to act on the Arizona memo, or to fully
investigate suspected Al Qaeda member Zacarias Moussaoui after his
August 2001 arrest at a Minnesota flight school and the failure to
launch a manhunt for two hijackers who entered the United States
after attending a January 2000 Al Qaeda meeting in Malaysia, were
"isolated incidences" that ignored the broader FBI successes, Freeh
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "Analyzing intelligence information can be like trying to take a
sip of water coming out of a fire hydrant," Freeh said. "The reality
is that these unquestionably important bits have been plucked from a
sea of thousands and thousands of such bits at the time."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had seen no evidence that indicated the FBI and U.S.
intelligence agencies could have prevented the attacks. And he
bristled at allegations that the FBI had ignored the threat of
terrorism in America.</TE>
<TE>   "I take exception to the finding that we were not paying
sufficient attention to the threat at home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeh's reputation as an FBI chief who successfully reformed the
bureau has been tarnished during the committee hearings, but his
appearance sparked little of the fireworks or drama that has
characterized several previous public hearings. Panel members, who
had been expected to grill the former FBI chief about embarrassing
FBI lapses that the committee staff has uncovered, instead seemed
sympathetic. Most, indeed, had left the vast hearing room by the time
he finished reading his statement.</TE>
<TE>   A more contentious hearing is likely Thursday when the witnesses
will include the current FBI director, Robert S. Mueller III, as well
as CIA Director George J. Tenet and the director of the National
Security Agency, Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden. Both the CIA and NSA also
have been sharply criticized in previous hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Freeh's seemingly successful tenure as FBI chief came under
critical scrutiny immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, when
President Bush, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Mueller announced plans
to refocus bureau priorities. Henceforth, they said, the FBI would
seek to prevent terrorist acts, not just respond to them with
investigations and prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the FBI gained more than $1 billion in new funding during
Freeh's tenure from 1993 to 2001, he insisted Tuesday that the bureau
had too little money and too few agents.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal year 2000, he said, he requested 864 additional
agents--analysts, linguists and other counter-terrorism personnel--at
a cost of $380.8 million. He said he received only five people and
$7.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The allocations were insufficient to maintain the critical growth
and priority of the FBI's counter-terrorism program," he said. Even
today, he said, the FBI has 11,516 agents, or about 150 fewer than it
had in 1999. Freeh's defense of FBI counter-terrorism efforts in the
1990s was largely supported by Mary Jo White, former U.S. attorney
for the southern district of New York in Manhattan. Before resigning
this year, White had successfully prosecuted a series of major
terrorism cases, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and
the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's goal was to thwart plots before they occurred, and to
neutralize dangerous terrorists so that they could not attack in the
future," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the committee staff director, Eleanor Hill, said the FBI had
taken a "law enforcement approach to terrorism" before Sept. 11 that
focused chiefly on arrests and trials. She said the FBI was not
aggressive at home and had focused most of its counter-terrorism
efforts overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying before Freeh, Hill cited a senior U.S. policymaker,
whom she did not identify, as saying most FBI field offices were
"clueless" about counter-terrorism and Al Qaeda, and did not consider
them priorities.</TE>

<HD>5 of 6 N.Y. Terror Suspects Denied Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Calling them a threat to public safety, a federal judge Tuesday
refused to grant bail to five local men who attended an Al Qaeda
training camp several months before the attacks on the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<LD>   However, U.S. Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder granted bail
to Sahim Alwan, a sixth man who attended the camp, saying he had
cooperated with FBI agents in providing details about the trip and
seemed to be remorseful for what he had done.</LD>
<LD>   The six men, who are accused of giving aid and support to Osama
bin Laden's terrorist network, could face up to 15 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine if they are convicted in a trial that is expected
to begin next year. The case has focused national attention on what
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft called a "sleeper cell" awaiting orders to
commit acts of terror in America.</LD>
<TE>   "There are no [bail] conditions or combinations of conditions that
I could impose that would reasonably assure the safety of the
community and the appearances of the defendants when required,"
Schroeder said, explaining his denial of bail for Yahya Goba, Shafal
Mosed, Yasein Taher, Faysal Galab and Mukhtar al-Bakri.</TE>
<TE>   As the judge read his decision, the six men, wearing prison
jumpsuits and shackled at their hands and feet, listened impassively
as about 50 supporters sat quietly at the back of the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said that the six defendants attended the
Al-Farooq training camp in Afghanistan, where they were taught how to
use high-powered rifles and explosives, learned about the use of
suicide bombings and heard an anti-American speech delivered by Bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   All six live in Lackawanna, a small steel town just south of
Buffalo, and are American citizens of Yemeni descent. Members of
their community, who have raised thousands of dollars for their legal
defense, have insisted that the men made an innocent mistake in
attending the camp and that they are victims of anti-Muslim paranoia.
The supporters have said there is no evidence that the men were
preparing any acts of terror.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that just six individuals are on trial," said Dr.
Khalid Qazi, who heads the western New York chapter of the American
Muslim Council. "I think the entire American judicial system is on
trial, and the world will be watching very carefully to see how
fairly--how honestly--these men are going to be treated."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, who said he had scrupulously followed the spirit and
letter of the U.S. Constitution in his decision, noted that he had
not been influenced by the "maelstrom of human emotions" unleashed in
America after the Sept. 11 attacks, including "fear, anxiety, hatred
and a feeling of paranoia in many of the hearts and minds of the
inhabitants of this great nation."</TE>
<TE>   Normally the decision whether to grant bail is dealt with quickly
after a defendant is charged with a crime. But in this case, the
judge--citing the extraordinary complexities facing the legal system
in dealing with terrorist suspects--convened a bail hearing that
lasted four days. He gave the attorneys opportunities to show that
their clients were not a threat to public safety or a flight risk,
and to rebut government evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Schroeder said there had been virtually no exculpatory
evidence produced by defense attorneys after their clients' Sept. 13
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The judge indicated that the government might have a tough time
proving its case, but he also raised "troubling" questions about the
men's behavior: "Were they recruited by someone to make this trip,
and if so, by whom, and on what basis were they selected, and for
what purpose? How is it that six young men from Lackawanna, N.Y.,
were allowed to enter a secret training camp known as Al-Farooq in
Afghanistan and attend a speech given by Osama bin Laden?"</TE>
<TE>   As for Alwan, Schroeder said the defendant had informed FBI agents
of the men's mysterious trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the
spring and summer of 2001. The judge also noted that Alwan, unlike
the other men, left the camp early--instead of attending an entire
five-week training session--because he felt that the Al Qaeda leaders
were "crazy."</TE>
<TE>   However, the judge attached sweeping conditions to Alwan's bail,
beyond the posting of a $600,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Under the order, Alwan cannot leave his house except to go to
work; he must wear an electronic monitoring device on his ankle and
also must wear a global positioning system device that will track his
movements. He must submit to having his phone tapped by the
government and is not permitted to have a cell phone or access to a
computer. Alwan, who is unemployed, must also pay the costs of such
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   James Harrington, Alwan's attorney, said his client was gratified
that he received bail, but was also "somewhat stunned" by the
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "We said at the beginning of this that we would be willing to
comply with whatever requests the judge set for bail, and we meant
it," Harrington said. "But some of these are fairly extreme. I've
never heard of this being done before."</TE>

<HD>3 Awarded Nobel Prize in Physics</HD>
<DH>Science: Pioneer in X-ray astronomy and scientists who
trapped and studied elusive particles from the sun win this year's
honors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Japanese scientist and two Americans have won the 2002 Nobel Prize
in physics for snatching elusive cosmic particles and bits of
radiation that constantly pelt the Earth and using them to understand
the basic workings of the sun and stars and to unveil the previously
hidden but incredibly violent nature of our universe.</LD>
<LD>   University of Pennsylvania chemist Raymond Davis Jr., 87, and
retired University of Tokyo physicist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, shared
half of the $1.1-million prize for their pioneering work on detecting
solar neutrinos--ghostly particles that stream out of the heart of
the sun by the thousands of billions, change "flavors" as they
bombard Earth and pass easily through solid rock, making them almost
impossible to snare.</LD>
<LD>   The two men created fantastical underground chambers--one in a
South Dakota gold mine, the other in a Tokyo copper mine--to trap and
study the particles. The work resolved a centuries-old controversy by
proving that it was indeed nuclear fusion that made the sun shine.
The work also suggested that all those neutrinos each seemed to
contain a sliver of mass, meaning the universe was not as lopsided as
once believed.</LD>
<TE>   The other half of the prize went to Riccardo Giacconi, 71, an
astronomer who was the first to detect X-rays coming from outside our
solar system and the first to prove that the universe is bathed in a
background glow of X-rays. The work proved the existence of black
holes and established an entirely new field of astrophysics, X-ray
astronomy, that has gone on to illuminate many surprisingly violent
aspects of the night skies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just that the winners have written new sentences in the
history of science, they've written whole new chapters," said John
Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J., who worked closely with Davis on solar neutrinos and
called Giacconi "a giant."</TE>
<TE>   The Nobel committee said X-ray astronomy had provided "completely
new--and sharp--images of the universe" and described neutrino
detection as "considerably more difficult than finding a particular
grain of sand in the whole of the Sahara desert." They credited the
work with changing "the way we look upon the universe."</TE>
<TE>   The prizes did not come as a surprise to many in the physics
community, or even to one winner. When the phone rang in his Tokyo
home, "I said, 'Oh, that must be it,' " a smiling Koshiba told dozens
of reporters who clustered at his house shortly after the
announcement. "Having won the prize, I can finally return to my quiet
life."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who suffers from early-stage Alzheimer's disease and now
lives in semi-retirement on Long Island, did not make public comments
about his award. His reaction to colleagues was a modest one. "I
don't deserve this," he told his University of Pennsylvania
collaborator Ken Lande, saying the award should be shared among
hundreds who contributed to his manpower-intensive work.</TE>
<TE>   Giacconi said he was "dumbstruck" when Nobel officials phoned him
at his Washington, D.C.,-area home at 5:30 a.m. and had since been
fielding a steady stream of congratulatory calls. "It's been a long
day," he said in a telephone interview, "but I've had worse." He said
his first thought was to use the Nobel money to pay for the education
of his two grandchildren. "Given how the costs are rising, that might
require the whole prize," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues who knew the men were as quick to comment on their
generosity and humanity as on their science. "My mother would have
said of them: 'They're good people,' " Bahcall said. Added Lande of
Davis: "He is helpful. He is imaginative. He creates excitement about
everything around him." Giacconi can be "intimidating, outspoken and
demanding," said his close collaborator Harvey Tananbaum, "but he has
an incredible ability of enabling people to do the best work they're
capable of doing. I'm still thriving on it."</TE>
<TE>   The existence of neutrinos was first postulated in the 1930s. But
their existence tormented the man who theorized them, Wolfgang Pauli,
who at the time said: "I have done a terrible thing. I have
postulated a particle that cannot be detected."</TE>
<TE>   With no electrical charge and possibly no mass at all, it seemed
that neutrinos would forever remain elusive. Despite the poor odds,
Davis thought he could trap them. To do so, he needed to build a
detector deep underground so the experiment would not be contaminated
by cosmic rays. Solar neutrinos would have no problems getting
underground--interacting only weakly with matter, they pass through
rock, dirt and human beings with equal ease.</TE>
<TE>   To trap neutrinos, Davis and colleagues filled a portion of South
Dakota's Homestake gold mine with 100,000 gallons of dry-cleaning
solvent. Neutrinos, he reasoned, would react with the chlorine in the
cleaning fluid and produce radioactive argon atoms, which he could
measure by releasing helium gas through the fluid to grab the argon.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic worked, to the amazement of physicists everywhere. But
in 30 years of collecting, the instrument detected just 2,000 argon
atoms--far fewer than expected.</TE>
<TE>   This led to an even greater mystery, known as the "solar neutrino
problem." Where were all the rest of the particles? Scientists
theorized that neutrinos can flit between various forms--electron,
muon and tau--during their eight-minute journey from the sun to
Earth, and that Davis' detector was only picking up one form of
neutrino.</TE>
<TE>   Koshiba and his collaborators confirmed and extended Davis' work
at the Kamiokande and later at the bigger Super-Kamiokande neutrino
detectors, huge tanks of water buried beneath the Japanese Alps. When
neutrinos from the sun and from supernovas passed through the tank, a
tiny fraction of them interacted with atoms in the water and gave off
a characteristic streak of blue light called Cerenkov radiation. The
work showed that neutrinos did come in different flavors.</TE>
<TE>   By showing that muon neutrinos had a different mass than tau
neutrinos, they showed the particles were not massless wonders as
stan- dard theories of physics had predicted. With a speck of mass
each, the untold numbers of neutrinos that shoot through the universe
now are thought to add heft to the big equation of what makes up the
universe. They also add up to more problems for physicists trying to
sort out the rest of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we live for," Bahcall said. "New cans of worms."</TE>
<TE>   The Italian-born Giacconi was 28 when he started working out the
details of how to construct the X-ray telescope. Four decades later,
X-ray astronomy is a branch of study on equal footing with
traditional optical and radio astronomy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every day someone just starts a field from scratch,"
said Tananbaum, who was in graduate school when Giacconi made his
first discovery and now directs the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a
powerful telescope the two men proposed in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Before Giacconi's work, astronomers had viewed the universe as a
stately, relatively quiet place. That's largely because the violent
explosions of X-ray radiation emitted from violent black holes and
dying stars had been invisible.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us a different view of the universe, just as an X-ray
gives a different view of the body," said Giacconi, who still
conducts research with Chandra and runs Associated Universities Inc.,
a nonprofit corporation that operates astronomical observatories.</TE>
<TE>   X-ray astronomy allowed Giacconi to prove the existence of binary
star systems and black holes, monsters that previously existed only
in science fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "A new, fantastic zoo of important and strange celestial bodies
has been discovered and studied," the Nobel committee said. "Today
the universe seems much more remarkable than we believed 50 years
ago."</TE>

<HD>Private Hearing Sought for Noelle Bush</HD>
<DH>Crime: A judge is asked to close the drug court proceedings
for Florida governor's daughter. But an attorney for newspapers says
there's no 'celebrity exception.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>An attorney for Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter asked a judge Tuesday to
close her drug court proceedings, arguing that she has a right to
privacy while under that court's supervision.</LD>
<LD>   Drug courts help a person complete treatment and aren't subject to
the same openness as criminal courts, lawyer Peter Antonacci argued.</LD>
<LD>   However, an attorney for the Orlando Sentinel and the South
Florida Sun-Sentinel newspapers said drug courts are no different
than any other criminal court and should stay open.</LD>
<TE>   "This decides whether she goes to jail or not," said Jonathan
Kaney, an attorney who specializes in 1st Amendment issues. He said
there is no "celebrity exception to the rule of openness in court."</TE>
<TE>   The judge didn't say when he would make a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Noelle Bush, 25, was arrested in January for allegedly buying an
anti-anxiety drug with a fraudulent prescription. She sought
treatment through a drug court, but she could face criminal charges
if she fails to complete the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In July, she spent two days in jail for allegedly possessing a
prescription drug.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, police were called to her treatment center in Orlando
after another patient said Bush had crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters in Tallahassee, the governor said drug
courts should be protected from public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "At a point in time, people can be looked at as though they're
failing when in fact if you look at it over the long haul, they're on
the road to recovery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Cooper, associate director of the Drug Court Clearinghouse
at American University in Washington, said she had never heard of a
drug court hearing being closed to the public. Neither had Karen
Freeman-Wilson, chief executive of the National Assn. of Drug Court
Professionals in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge rules in favor of Noelle Bush, it would go against
the grain of the 1st Amendment, because court proceedings are closed
to the public only under rare circumstances, said Bruce J. Winick, a
law professor at the University of Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Our tradition is one of openness," he said. "What happens in a
courtroom is of strong public interest."</TE>

<HD>Panel Revives Pluto Mission's Hope for Liftoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mission to Pluto that has been canceled twice and was not funded in
this year's NASA budget appears to be set for liftoff again after a
House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA funding approved
spending $105 million to keep the mission alive.</LD>
<LD>   Although the funding still must be approved by the full
Appropriations Committee before going to the House floor, the
decision has leaders of the Pluto trip confident that their
spacecraft will fly.</LD>
<LD>   "We are delighted," said Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is leading the
team now developing the $500-million New Horizons Pluto-Kuiper Belt
spacecraft for a 2006 launch to the solar system's smallest and most
remote planet.</LD>
<TE>   Interest in Pluto and its neighborhood--the icy Kuiper
Belt--received an additional boost Monday with two Caltech
astronomers' discovery of Quaoar, a neighboring planet-like object
half the size of Pluto.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuiper Belt, which contains what Stern calls the solar
system's "ancient wilderness," contains the primitive remnants from
which our solar system formed and may contain objects even larger
than Pluto, which is 1,400 miles in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a leading panel of astronomers called two missions that
had been canceled by NASA--one to explore the Kuiper Belt and another
to explore the ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa--two of the the
agency's most important voyages.</TE>
<TE>   The House Appropriations subcommittee agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Appropriations panel already has approved similar
funding for the Pluto mission. The House subcommittee also joined the
Senate panel in adding $40 million to begin work on a mission to
Europa. In all, both panels approved a $300-million increase of the
NASA budget over President Bush's initial request, bringing the total
to $15.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The mission to Pluto, which Stern has taken to calling "the
undead," has developed a huge following among schoolchildren and
space buffs everywhere. News of its repeated cancellation has
prompted emotional outcries and massive letter-writing campaigns to
try to revive it.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have said several technical hurdles must be overcome before a trip is
launched, but they are exploring ways to complete the 3-billion-mile
trip by 2020.</TE>

<HD>Killer's Specter Haunts D.C. Suburbs</HD>
<DH>Sniper: School security is tightened. A taunting message
from attacker is reportedly recovered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN and JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>Life proceeded under the shadow of the gun in the Washington
metropolitan area Tuesday as investigators searched for an elusive
sniper and thousands of students returned to locked classrooms and
school campuses patrolled by police.</LD>
<LD>   The rifle-wielding assailant laid low after a six-day rampage that
left six dead and two wounded. But a day after critically wounding a
13-year-old boy Monday, the unseen sniper still managed to alter
lives throughout the region, spurring public officials to
dramatically tighten school security and urge residents to report any
suspicious activity.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they were examining whether the shooting of a
liquor store employee three weeks ago was connected to the recent
cases, but they otherwise reported no significant progress Tuesday.
"We will catch him, there's no question, and he'll be brought to
justice," Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening vowed. "We're not going to
allow one individual to disrupt our education, to disrupt our lives,
to disrupt our economy."</LD>
<TE>   But routines were repeatedly thrown into chaos and conducted in
fear. Parents flocked to schools with frightened children in tow.
Shopping centers reported thinning traffic. Worried that their
customers could be targets, coffee shops shut down outdoor seating
throughout the region. Tipsters called by the score, flooding police
dispatchers with more than 400 new leads deemed credible. Police
flagged down dozens of white trucks, the type of vehicle described by
a witness, and confronted drivers, school visitors,
pedestrians--anyone who seemed out of place.</TE>
<TE>   Already strained by the widening manhunt, police forces in the
Maryland suburbs--where most of the shootings have occurred--spent
much of the day responding to false alarms that sometimes required
hours to put to rest. Backfire from a dump truck on a Montgomery
County highway caused a flood of jittery calls during the morning
rush hour. A phantom sighting of a man with a gun sent dozens of
Prince George's County officers combing a wooded area for hours in
the afternoon, emerging finally without a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was some investigative movement. Prince George's
County Police Chief Gerald Wilson said that a shell casing recovered
Monday near Benjamin Tasker Middle School, where the 13-year-old was
shot, was being analyzed by firearms agents.</TE>
<TE>   And Tuesday night, police sources confirmed to local media outlets
that the sniper had left a taunting message for authorities outside
the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear policeman, I am God," the message said. Police said it was
found on a Tarot card, part of a deck used in fortune telling, and is
known as the Death card. It was spotted in a wooded area about 150
yards from the school entrance, where police found the shell casing
and a matted area of grass that suggested the gunman had laid in
wait.</TE>
<TE>   The message, first reported Tuesday night on Channel 9 in
Washington, was the first known communication from the sniper, police
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The police chief
was noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't confirm that," Wilson said. There's "nothing I can say in
regards to that."</TE>
<TE>   The student who was shot remained hospitalized in critical but
stable condition at Children's National Medical Center in Washington,
where doctors said his prognosis was promising.</TE>
<TE>   Federal ballistics experts also said they had conducted tests on
bullet fragments recovered from a shooting last month in a Montgomery
County shopping center--nearly three weeks before the start of last
week's killing spree. In the Sept. 14 incident near Silver Spring, a
liquor store employee was wounded by a single rifle shot as he walked
in a parking lot after closing.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bouchard, special agent in charge of the Baltimore office
of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said tests on
the fragments from the Silver Spring shooting proved
inconclusive--but, he was careful to add, "we are not ruling out that
shooting as being linked."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose and other officials
declined to discuss specifics of the case, but an investigator
familiar with the incident said, "We're looking at any case that has
similarities, I can tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   According to Arnie Zelkovitz, the owner of the liquor store, he
and an employee had locked up the store after 10 p.m. and were out in
the parking lot when they heard a gunshot. The employee fell and
Zelkovitz said he saw a small bullet hole in the man's back. Doctors
who treated the wounded employee repaired damage to the man's kidney,
liver and colon and removed several fragments that appeared to come
from a rifle round, Zelkovitz said. The wounded man is now recovering
at home, Zelkovitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were interviewed last week by detectives, Zelkovitz said,
adding that police told him that they were looking into the
possibility of a link.</TE>
<TE>   Suburban Maryland detectives were tight-lipped about other
developments. Even as Moose and other police officials simply
reiterated that they were searching for a white "box truck," a Prince
George's County official said that a similar vehicle was spotted
making an "erratic U-turn" on Route 197, near Tasker Middle School,
within minutes after Monday's shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "This truck cut off traffic," said Bowie Councilman William
Alshire, a retired Washington police officer. "We're not saying it's
the one, but it was clearly suspicious." Police would not comment on
the reports.</TE>
<TE>   Prince George's police also raided a residence in Bowie on Monday
night, retrieving several rifles, handguns and other materials. But
Wilson appeared to downplay the move Tuesday, acknowledging the
search but adding that it "has not led us to the perpetrator" of the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Moose said a burgeoning task force of more than 195 local, state
and federal police investigators was now searching for the killer.
Moose, who is heading the probe, said he was assured Tuesday morning
by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft that federal officials would offer any
manpower and resources that the area's beleaguered police need.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to bring in resources as our investigators and
people on the team tell me what they need," Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   His 1,000-officer Police Department patrols a sprawling, affluent
county of 875,000 residents--a largely peaceful community where more
than 20 killings a year are uncommon. But the flip side of the low
crime rate is a detective force "pretty lean for a county this size,"
acknowledged Phil Andrews, a county councilman who heads the
council's Public Safety Committee. Already, the strain on manpower
has cost the county more than $100,000 in overtime pay, Andrews
said--a necessity that will continue to spiral until the sniper is
caught.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Andrews and others said, is a department dependent on
the extra support it is now getting from the Maryland State Police,
the FBI and even such federal agencies as the Secret Service and the
U.S. Marshals Service. "They've done a great job in responding,"
Andrews said, "but we clearly need the help."</TE>
<TE>   Uniformed police and plainclothes officers also flooded school
grounds in Maryland counties and in the District of Columbia
throughout the day. At Tasker, nearly a third of the students stayed
home for the day, officials reported. A Prince George's police
helicopter hovered above the school building as children and parents
streamed in for the start of class Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "The only ones who seemed really concerned were the parents," said
teacher Dorothy Prater.</TE>
<TE>   At Parkland Middle School in Rockville, not far from the gas
station where the third victim was killed last week, Maryland state
police and county officers cruised through parking lots and checked a
grove of trees to ensure that no one lurked near the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The number of parents who showed up with their children in tow at
the start and end of the school day more than doubled, said Principal
Carlos Hamlin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad because it robs our students of a little bit of their
innocence," Hamlin said as the last buses pulled out. "Our kids miss
being able to go outside, and our adults are clearly worried about
things. But they've all been able to roll with it so far."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A 15th century marble statue of Adam regarded as priceless toppled
over at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and broke into dozens of
pieces, the museum's director said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "An accident like this is a deep emotional loss," Philippe de
Montebello said.</LD>
<LD>   The life-size nude by Venetian sculptor Tullio Lombardo fell after
its pedestal gave way, de Montebello said. The accident apparently
happened after closing time Sunday, when a security guard heard a
crash.</LD>
<TE>   "It could have been a problem with its construction, or maybe [the
pedestal] had just been moved too many times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists should be able to restore the statue, but the
work could take as long as two years, De Montebello said.</TE>
<TE>   The statue, dated 1490-95, came to the museum in 1936 and is part
of its permanent collection, according to the museum's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The statue of Adam holding an apple was noted for the purity of
its marble and its smooth, elegant carving.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Tennessee's system for distributing tax money to public schools was
declared unconstitutional Tuesday by the state Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   In its third such ruling in less than a decade, the court found
unanimously that the system shortchanges rural districts and denies
equal educational opportunities for students.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could potentially cost the state government, already
stretched financially, hundreds of millions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The court, in a decision written by Justice E. Riley Anderson,
said the plan adopted by the Legislature seven years ago doesn't
equalize the pay between teachers in rural and urban school
districts.</TE>
<TE>   It also "fails to comply with the state's constitutional
obligation to formulate and maintain a system that affords a
substantially equal education opportunity for all students," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Until that mandate is met, the inherent value of education will
not be fully realized by all students in the state, regardless of
where they live and attend school."</TE>

<HD>Open-Air Bioweapon Tests Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States held open-air biological and chemical weapons tests
in at least three states--Alaska, Hawaii and Utah--during the 1960s
in an effort to develop defenses against such weapons, according to
Pentagon documents.</LD>
<LD>   Tests in Alaska from 1965-67 used artillery shells and bombs
filled with the nerve agents sarin and VX, records show.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department planned to release summaries of 28 chemical
and biological weapons tests at a House Veterans Affairs Committee
hearing Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The documents did not say whether any civilians had been exposed
to the poisons. Military personnel exposed to weapons' agents would
have worn protective gear, the Pentagon says.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon previously acknowledged that it had conducted
biological and chemical tests, but this was the first time it
disclosed that some tests were conducted over land and not out at
sea.</TE>
<TE>   The tests were part of Project 112, a program in the 1960s and
'70s to test chemical and biological weapons and defenses against
them. Parts of the testing program done on Navy ships were called
Project SHAD, or Shipboard Hazard and Defense.</TE>
<TE>   The tests were directed from the Deseret Test Center, part of a
biological and chemical weapons complex in the Utah desert.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those involved in the tests say they now suffer health
problems linked to their exposure to dangerous chemicals and germs.
They are pressing the Veterans Affairs Department to compensate them
and the Defense Department to release more information about the
tests.</TE>
<TE>   In response to pressure from veterans and Congress, the Pentagon
began releasing details of the tests last year. Earlier this year,
the Defense Department acknowledged for the first time that some of
the 1960s tests used real chemical and biological weapons, not just
benign stand-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cold War era experiments of Project SHAD ... must be
aggressively investigated in as open and transparent a manner as
possible," said the House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman, Rep.
Chris Smith (R-N.J.).</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department has identified nearly 3,000 soldiers
involved in tests disclosed earlier, but the VA has sent letters to
fewer than half of them. Officials said finding the soldiers has been
difficult.</TE>

<HD>Serial Killer's Life Still Intrigues on the Eve of Her
Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Today, Aileen Wuornos may be only second woman
executed in Florida since 1976.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>She may be America's only death row inmate to have inspired an
opera--a six-time convicted murderer with a bleak childhood and rough
life who has puzzled and intrigued criminologists. And this morning,
she is due to die.</LD>
<LD>   At 9:30, executioners at Florida State Prison are scheduled to
empty two syringes of potassium chloride into the bloodstream of
Aileen Wuornos, stilling the heart of a rare female serial killer.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old former prostitute, who murdered seven mostly
middle-aged men along Florida highways more than a decade ago,
battled in court to bring her own end closer, firing her lawyers and
dropping her appeals.</LD>
<TE>   "If I have to spend life in prison, I will kill," Wuornos once
told a judge. "I will kill again."</TE>
<TE>   "She was a homicidal predator," John Tanner, the state attorney
for four Florida counties who was the prosecutor at her 1992 trial,
said at the time. "She was like a spider on the side of the road,
waiting for prey--men."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously rejected a
request by an Ohio group to challenge Wuornos' execution on grounds
she is mentally incompetent and a "borderline psychotic."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a panel of three psychiatrists reported to Gov. Jeb
Bush that Wuornos understood she was facing the death penalty and
what its application meant. "Therefore she is competent to be
executed" under state law, the psychiatrists said. Bush signed a
death warrant for her on Sept. 5, suspended it pending the findings
of the psychiatric evaluation, then reinstated it on Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   If Wuornos does die today at the state prison near Starke, she
will be only the second woman executed in Florida since the death
penalty was reinstated nationally in 1976. On March 30, 1998, Judi
Buenoano of Orlando went to the electric chair, the legal means of
capital punishment at the time, for fatally poisoning her husband
with arsenic, drowning her partially paralyzed son and trying to kill
her fiance with a car bomb.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first execution of a woman in Florida since a slave
named Celia was hanged in 1848 for killing her master.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, nine women have been executed since 1976. As of July,
there were 52 women on death rows in the United States, or 1.4% of
the total number of condemned killers, according to the Death Penalty
Information Center's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Murder is primarily a male activity," James Fox, professor of
criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston and the author
of five books about serial and mass murders, said in an interview.
"Ninety percent of murders are committed by men."</TE>
<TE>   There have been other female serial killers; currently, a
41-year-old nurse in the Netherlands is accused of administering
lethal drug cocktails to 13 of her patients. "But Wuornos is unique
in that she killed in the style of male serial killers," Fox said.
"She killed strangers selected at random. Women generally don't kill
people they don't know."</TE>
<TE>   What drove Wuornos, Fox said, is still conjecture. "I think the
motive was robbery," he said. "I supposed she wanted to have her way
with these men. She may have felt they were trying to get control,
and she decided to be the one to have the last laugh."</TE>
<TE>   The grisly trail left by the ninth-grade dropout, who became known
as the "Damsel of Death," began in December 1989, when the remains of
a Clearwater, Fla., electronics shop owner were found in a junkyard.
It was the first of six male bodies that would turn up in a 13-month
period near interstate highways in north-central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos was arrested in January 1991 at a Daytona Beach biker bar.
At her trial, she said she intended to rob one of her customers
because she was afraid she was about to lose her lesbian lover and
needed $200 for rent. She shot Richard Mallory, 51, the shop owner,
in self-defense after he tied her to a steering wheel and sodomized
her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the innocent victim, not him," Wuornos told the jury, which
convicted her anyway. She later pleaded no contest to the murders of
five other men, and received six death sentences. She said she killed
a seventh man whose body was never found.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos had been abandoned at birth by her parents and raped at
13. "I don't think she's a monster; she is someone who was seriously
damaged and who snapped," said Carla Lucero, 38, a San Francisco
composer and librettist who became fascinated with Wuornos' life.
"Now she just wants to die. She is tired of living a life without
love and support."</TE>
<TE>   "Wuornos," the opera Lucero took five years to write, premiered at
San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in June 2001. It ends
with the protagonist, both victim and villain, lamenting: "I am a
child in your arms, my God; you cannot reject me too."</TE>
<TE>   The saga of the Florida death row inmate has also engendered
true-crime books, a comic book and at least three movies, one of
which, "Damsel of Death, The Aileen Wuornos Story" by writer,
director and producer Jackelyn Giroux, was selected for this year's
New York International Independent Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Raag Singhal, a Fort Lauderdale attorney, spoke with Wuornos six
weeks ago and found her eager to die. "Her attitude was she wanted to
be executed as soon as possible," Singhal said. "She certainly did
not want to live in prison for the rest of her life."</TE>
<TE>   However, the lawyer said he has doubts about her mental stability
and tried to get the state Supreme Court to delay the execution. He
was sharply critical of how police and the state justice system had
dealt with Wuornos, and hypothesized gender had been a handicap.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted Bundy was offered life to resolve his cases," said Singhal,
referring to the notorious serial killer who confessed to killing 23
women and girls, and was put to death at Starke in 1989. "But Aileen
is someone they always sought the death penalty for."</TE>

<HD>Scientists Give the Lie to Polygraph Testing</HD>
<DH>Security: The tool has failed to ferret out spies and other
threats, an expert panel concludes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polygraph testing for national security screening is little more than
junk science, with results so inaccurate that they tend to be
counterproductive, according to a long-awaited report released
Tuesday by the National Academy of Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's premier scientific organization said such tests, a
key counterespionage tool for 50 years, promote false confidence that
spies and other national security threats have been ferreted out.</LD>
<LD>   Produced by experts in psychology, engineering, law and other
fields, the report confirms long-standing doubts about the validity
of polygraph testing that led to a 1988 federal law banning the use
of such tests for employment screening in most private businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Polygraph results are also inadmissible as evidence in nearly all
state courts, with federal courts leaving the decision up to the
judges.</TE>
<TE>   "If logic has anything to do with it, then the report will have a
major policy impact," said Steven Aftergood, an intelligence analyst
with the Federation of American Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think federal agencies stop and ask themselves how many
spies have we caught with this--because the answer is 'none'--or how
many people have been unfairly denied employment, because the answer
is 'many.' "</TE>
<TE>   Federal security agencies would not discuss the report's
conclusions Tuesday, saying they needed time to review the 333-page
report in detail.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government subjects thousands of job applicants or
employees in sensitive positions to "lie detector" tests each year.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA and the National Security Agency administer polygraph
tests to all job applicants and employees. The FBI and the Defense
Department also test extensively, particularly since last year's
terrorist attacks. Such screenings are also common at large police
departments nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "The polygraph has been, and continues to be, one of a number of
useful tools in the applicant screening process," said CIA spokesman
Paul Nowack.</TE>
<TE>   Linton Brooks, acting head of the National Nuclear Security
Administration--the agency responsible for the United States' nuclear
weapons stockpile--said the agency will reassess its use of
polygraphs in light of the new report.</TE>
<TE>   "It is used not on a stand-alone basis but as part of a larger
fabric of investigative and analytical reviews to help security
personnel determine who should have access to classified
information," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon spokesperson said the Defense Department has valued the
polygraph "as an investigative tool" for half a century, but agrees
that further research would be valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say the wide-ranging and authoritative report, which
was prepared by the academy's research council based on 19 months of
study, could trigger changes in security practice for agencies that
depend on polygraph testing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be a watershed" that shifts the burden of proof
from polygraph skeptics to its advocates, said Paul Giannelli, a law
professor at Case Western Reserve University and a consultant to the
national academy panel.</TE>
<TE>   "The report is so devastating that it will affect all uses of the
polygraph," he said, noting that the panel concluded that the
government has "wasted millions of dollars and ought to go in a
different direction."</TE>
<TE>   However, advocates of polygraph screening were unsurprised by the
study's conclusions. They disagree that profound changes in security
strategy are warranted during a war on terrorism that often comes
down to fuzzy questions of intent.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it is clearly not a perfect screening tool ... nothing
has come along that people have felt good enough about to replace the
polygraph," said Michael O'Neil, former general counsel of the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it is not an exclusive tool" but one of several
methods to determine security clearances, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other national security veterans concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the few tools you have that coerces more candor than
the person offers up voluntarily, that a civilized society finds
acceptable," said Stewart Baker, a former general counsel of the
National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the report should be considered carefully, but that
the real-world experience of intelligence agencies may trump an
academic analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The study was underwritten by the Department of Energy, which was
embarrassed by contradictory interpretations of polygraph tests on
accused nuclear spy Wen Ho Lee in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Taiwanese-born scientist pleaded guilty to one felony charge,
but he was ultimately exonerated of spying, and the furor over his
case indirectly prompted the polygraph study.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 national defense authorization bill now requires the
Department of Energy to revise its current polygraph policy--under
which about 2,000 employees are tested annually--based on a review of
this new study.</TE>
<TE>   Many people often assume that polygraph machines literally detect
lies. Actually, they measure changes in physiological signals--blood
pressure, heart and breathing rates, and perspiration--thought to
characterize deception.</TE>
<TE>   Only trained operators can interpret the results, and their
conclusions are often more art than science.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing a century of experience, the research panel found that
technicians can sometimes detect deceptive responses to questions
involving specific incidents, such as, "Were you at the bank robbery
on Oct. 9, 2002?" But the method shows scant reliability for general
use in employment or security screening, particularly with spies or
criminals trained to defeat the testing procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "Polygraph testing yields an unacceptable choice for DOE employee
security screening between too many loyal employees falsely judged
deceptive and too many major security threats left undetected," the
report noted.</TE>
<TE>   Naive faith in the power of the polygraph leads some subjects to
confess, or to avoid committing crimes for fear that they will be
found out, experience suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "However, overconfidence in the polygraph--a belief in its
accuracy that goes beyond what is justified by the evidence--also
presents a danger to national security," the panel concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the reliance of the national security apparatus on
polygraph testing, virtually no serious research about its efficacy
has been conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a decision made to continue polygraph testing, it
would have to be made on the untested belief that the benefits of
deterrence and confessions" offset the vast cost of testing and the
negative effect on thousands of falsely suspected subjects, said
Richard M. Shiffrin, an author of the report and a professor of
psychology at Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the debate over polygraph testing reflects a general
problem with forensic science--a field developed by law enforcement
practitioners outside mainstream science.</TE>
<TE>   "They look for something useful, quick and persuasive in court,
but they don't approach their task with the same self-scrutiny and
analytic rigor we find in other areas of science," said William C.
Thompson, a criminology professor at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   He called the validation of many forensic techniques, such as
ballistics, carpet-fiber, fingerprint and hair-matching,
"ridiculously bad." Those methods are facing increasing scrutiny in
legal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "The forensic sciences are really not sciences at all," Thompson
said. "They are a service industry for law enforcement ... more like
a trade guild that is selling a product."</TE>
<TE>   But he noted that forensic techniques--including polygraph
testing--can be improved with rigorous research.</TE>

<HD>Probing the DNA of Death</HD>
<DH>Experts examine 14,994 remains to try to identify the 9/11
dead. In the process, they are reinventing a science.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The human remains of the day shelter in the shade of a white tent
near the East River's edge.</LD>
<LD>   Here, set off by wilted bouquets, are the unanswered questions of
the World Trade Center dead, stored in the 16 refrigerated trailer
trucks parked on this shaded sliver of vacant pavement.</LD>
<LD>   Each question is an anonymous flake of human bone or fleck of
flesh picked from the rubble and preserved in a scientific limbo.
There are 14,994 of them.</LD>
<TE>   This is death divorced from identity--body parts without names to
claim them; names without remains that can be mourned.</TE>
<TE>   These human fragments are the dark heart of an unconventional
murder mystery that will take years to solve. There is no question
who committed the Sept. 11 attack or why terrorists may have acted as
they did; little question now of the 2,797 names of those who died.
The only answer authorities still seek--at a cost of $58 million
since last fall--is how to settle those names on these unidentified
remains.</TE>
<TE>   Only half the dead have been identified so far.</TE>
<TE>   The search has brought investigators to the edge of what science
can discern of death.</TE>
<TE>   By necessity, forensic specialists led by Dr. Robert Shaler, head
of forensic biology at the New York chief medical examiner's office,
are virtually reinventing the science of identification.</TE>
<TE>   Their pursuit of identity has turned the busiest morgue in the
U.S. into a laboratory at the forefront of human gene research. They
are forging the new tools of 21st century forensic medicine.</TE>
<TE>   They are creating better ways of handling DNA, perfecting new
genetic testing techniques and developing computer programs to
analyze genetic variations. The new techniques one day may help
diagnose inherited traits across the entire human population.</TE>
<TE>   "We are moving into new territory," Shaler said. "I feel as
nervous as I did the first day of the attack."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In its scale and scientific demands, the federally financed World
Trade Center investigation is unique in the annals of crime and
forensic medicine, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort that rivals the Human Genome Project, Shaler has
marshaled a national network that includes the New York State Police,
the FBI, six biotechnology companies, a score of DNA consultants,
computer software developers and an advisory committee of 30 forensic
experts that has met every eight weeks to thrash out technical
issues.</TE>
<TE>   So crushed, burned, waterlogged and corroded are these remains
that they defy conventional identification techniques, forensic
specialists quickly discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, almost half of the identifications made so far have
been solely on the basis of genetic testing--682 of the 1,411
named--and DNA analysis helped in the identification of 343.</TE>
<TE>   Of the rest, there is not enough undamaged DNA to build a normal
genetic profile.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, no one can even tell how many people these refrigerated
tissues encompass. No one knows how many people vaporized in the
fiery crashes and collapsing towers.</TE>
<TE>   The fires took three months to extinguish. Crews sifted 1.6
million tons of debris for nine months to exhume the remains.</TE>
<TE>   Death crushed some people so fiercely that only genetic analysis
has been able to tell their intermingled cells apart.</TE>
<TE>   Death made a jigsaw of others. More than 180 pieces of one victim
have been identified so far. The slayers and the slain mingle, flesh
and bone, in an autopsy test tube.</TE>
<TE>   The forensic experts so far have matched 4,930 body pieces to
1,411 of the victims and given over many of them for burial or
cremation.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had occurred in 1980, or even 1990, the forensic work
would have to stop now, with only half the people identified after
heroic, intensive work," said Clyde Snow, a forensic anthropologist
who helped pioneer modern identification techniques.</TE>
<TE>   By pushing the state of the forensic art, Shaler is hoping to
identify remains of at least 600 more victims.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the forensic experts have invented more refined
testing techniques to extract usable DNA. They are retesting every
one of the thousands of unclaimed pieces of bone, flesh, hair and
clotted blood samples.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional genetic testing--the mainstay of the effort so
far--is reaching its limits. Shaler is resorting to experimental
genetic techniques never before used on such a scale.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, DNA experts at Celera Genomics in Rockville, Md., have
processed 19,000 DNA specimens from victims and relatives, examining
the genetic material contained in the thousands of mitochondria in
every cell.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA in these cellular power plants is inherited directly from
each person's mother. It is much smaller than DNA found in the
nucleus of a cell but is much tougher and more likely to survive
intact in damaged tissue.</TE>
<TE>   This month, forensic experts at Orchid Cellmark Inc. in
Germantown, Md., expect to begin tests that look for single
variations in the 3 billion characters of the human genome. These
differences--called single nucleotide polymorphisms--are part of the
reason every individual is unique. So far, scientists have mapped 1.4
million of these molecular variations in humankind.</TE>
<TE>   Forensic experts are contemplating more exotic methods that might
allow them to rebuild shattered fragments of DNA the way a cosmetic
surgeon can rebuild a face.</TE>
<TE>   Even for those professionally hardened to death, the work is
emotionally exhausting.</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon to find forensic technicians weeping at their
computer terminals. Several have asked for transfers. One lab expert
quit under the strain earlier this year. A second broke down
emotionally and was hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   There is no room for error. Perfection is the acceptable legal
standard.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they must anticipate failure.</TE>
<TE>   Morgue technicians already are drying these tissues, like petals
of rare flowers, to preserve them for a day when more advanced
technology may allow the identification of the most damaged remains</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody wants to look at this 20 years from now, they will be
able to scrutinize it," Shaler said. "Somebody, someday will
challenge what we have done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the first hijacked airliner hit the World Trade Center,
Shaler was holding his regular Tuesday morning staff meeting to plan
the workload for the 90 forensic experts under his direction.</TE>
<TE>   Shaler, 59, has unblinking blue eyes shielded by frameless
glasses. A closely trimmed white beard softens his expression. He is
light on his feet as he sidesteps the cardboard boxes of unfinished
cases that crowd his office cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   In more ways than one, Shaler is married to his work. His wife,
whom he met at a medical examiners conference, is a forensic
scientist for the New Jersey State Police.</TE>
<TE>   After almost 14 years in the medical examiner's office, he is no
stranger to the confusion that fogs the circumstances of violent
death.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, led by Dr.
Charles Hirsch, is the country's busiest, handling 25,000 deaths a
year, including 3,300 homicides and sexual assaults. Hirsch recruited
Shaler to found the forensic biology laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   As conflicting reports filtered back to the medical examiner's
office on Sept. 11, a seven-member emergency morgue team mobilized
and headed downtown, in accordance with the city's long-standing
plans for any air disaster.</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise when they left without asking anyone from the
forensic DNA team to go with them. They were never included in
disaster drills.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, the sobering scale of the World Trade Center
disaster emerged. Early reports placed the dead at 6,700 or more.
Morgue experts were braced to handle as many as a million body parts.
The numbers of the missing and murdered continued to fluctuate for
months.</TE>
<TE>   In all, they would find 19,924 body parts.</TE>
<TE>   For nine months, human remains recovered from the Trade Center
site or culled from rubble trucked to the Fresh Kills landfill on
Staten Island were delivered to the open-air bay by the side entrance
of the medical examiner's office. Even now, tissue still turns up.
The most recent fragment was delivered from the World Trade Center
area Monday.</TE>
<TE>   There, under a canopy on a cul-de-sac blockaded by six metal
barricades and under police guard, Shaler and his staff took
possession of the dead.</TE>
<TE>   As the only full-time forensic anthropologist on the medical
examiner's staff, Amy Zelson Mundorff was the first to examine
remains when they came through the door, the last one to sign them
out when they finally were identified.</TE>
<TE>   Pathologists, dental experts and fingerprint analysts searched
each new set of remains for identifying marks or features that might
help distinguish it from the other dead--a distinctive tattoo, a
pattern of freckles, a healed bone fracture, a birthmark, a wedding
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Each piece was cataloged, tagged with a bar code and measured.</TE>
<TE>   "We would go through the bags and sort out the cases," Mundorff
said. "Anything that was not attached to something else got its own
case number. We would take the time, if we could, to put the pieces
back together, if we could make it into one case."</TE>
<TE>   She kept at it 12 hours a day, six days a week.</TE>
<TE>   For many emergency workers, the difference between the quick and
the dead at the World Trade Center was uncomfortably close.</TE>
<TE>   On that Tuesday morning, Mundorff had rushed to the World Trade
Center shortly after the first aircraft crashed into the building, as
part of the disaster team dispatched to assess the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing forward with other emergency workers, she was caught in
the tumbling outwash of debris from the fall of the south tower.
Slammed against a wall, she suffered a concussion and broken ribs.
Rubble and broken glass slashed her legs. One of her co-workers
fractured his skull.</TE>
<TE>   For the first month, she looked at sets of remains through two
blackened eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were too close," she said. "When I look at the cases on the
table, I feel lucky."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Mundorff and her colleagues sorted through bag after bag, it
became clear that the mainstays of forensic identification--detailed
skeletal analysis, dental X-rays and comparison with existing medical
records--were all but useless.</TE>
<TE>   There rarely was enough bone to make a recognizable skeleton; no
faces that could be reconstructed; few teeth to be matched to dental
records; even fewer whole fingers to print.</TE>
<TE>   "So many of our traditional anthropological techniques are
obsolete in a mass disaster like this," Mundorff said. "It is
frustrating. We have to take what we know and apply it in a different
way."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,797 dead, only 287 whole bodies were found. Only 185
people could be identified solely from their teeth; 70 from their
fingerprints alone.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, remains of the 44 people who died in the crash of
United Airlines Flight 93 near Shanksville, Pa., were all quickly
identified, aided by accurate passenger manifest information.</TE>
<TE>   All but five of the 189 people who died at the Pentagon have been
identified. Forensic experts were able to take advantage of military
identification tags and extensive government medical files.</TE>
<TE>   Remains of nine hijackers from those two crash sites also have
been identified.</TE>
<TE>   But the victims of the World Trade Center attack included office
workers and visitors from 60 countries, shredded now beyond all
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   To identify the fragments, the medical examiner's technicians
would have to look deep into the heart of the human cell.</TE>
<TE>   Properly treated, the nucleus of a cell can yield the long,
twisted thread of DNA that forms the unique molecular signature for
every individual. Stretched to its full length, that strand of DNA is
almost 6 feet long. It weighs barely a billionth of a gram.</TE>
<TE>   Only one-tenth of a single percent of DNA differs from one person
to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists can use these variable regions to generate a DNA
profile of an individual, using samples from blood, bone, hair and
other body tissues. In conventional genetic testing, a series of
chemical probes will bind to the DNA sample in a distinctive pattern
for an individual.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, can be compared to DNA from the victim's personal
effects or with that of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Robotic gene sequencers and supercomputer bioinformatics systems
would have to do what family and loved ones could not.</TE>
<TE>   "We take snippets of tissue--less than a cubic centimeter," Shaler
said. "It is not much, but there are tons of cells in there. You just
need to find 100 good cells."</TE>
<TE>   It is technology whose time had come.</TE>
<TE>   By last year, 120 DNA crime laboratories were involved in more
than 16,000 cases and were analyzing more than 265,000 samples from
convicted offenders. In New York alone, genetic testing is being used
to reevaluate evidence in 17,000 unsolved rapes.</TE>
<TE>   As a new tool of mass identification, genetic testing helped
investigators identify all 230 of the victims of TWA Flight 800,
which crashed in the ocean off Long Island in 1996. It helped
resurrect the identities of the murdered from the mass graves of
Bosnia and Guatemala. It reunited families with remains of
long-missing soldiers killed in Korea and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, genetic testing also altered public expectations
about the anonymity of death. With so much scientific knowledge to be
had from the code of life, a nameless death seemed an affront.</TE>
<TE>   Even America's Unknown Soldier was no longer unknown.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the remains of an unidentified American serviceman from
the Vietnam War, buried beneath the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington
National Cemetery, was removed from his public tomb, identified
through genetic testing and returned to his family.</TE>
<TE>   The crypt has since remained vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Just as genetic testing altered the forensic science of
identification, however, the demands of the World Trade Center dead
would in turn change the technology of genetic testing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a laboratory technique, modern genetics depends on highly
automated machinery that can perform the mindless, repetitive
chemical work of gene sequencing at high speed, running as many as
800,000 genotypes a day.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists around the world dump more than 100 million bases each
week into a public data repository. It takes arrays of supercomputers
to make sense of the raw genetic sequences, by identifying the
patterns of DNA code that indicate genes or the presence of
identifying markers.</TE>
<TE>   Although New York City has the largest forensic DNA lab in the
country, the demands of the World Trade Center investigation
instantly swamped its resources.</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner quickly drafted the New York State Police
forensic DNA laboratory in Albany and two of the world's largest
genetic sequencing companies: Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc. in
Salt Lake City and Celera Genomics, which was the first private
company to sequence the human genome. A third company, Applied
Biosystems Inc. in Foster City, Calif., provided equipment and
expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most experienced private forensic DNA identity
laboratories--Orchid Cellmark and the Bode Technology Group in
Springfield, Va.--also joined the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory Corp. of America, which has 900 DNA centers around the
country, and the New York State Police collected almost 7,000 razor
blades, combs, toothbrushes, lipsticks and other items that had
belonged to victims, which could be tested for DNA and compared to
remains. From relatives, they also collected more than 6,800 DNA swab
samples to be compared with victims' genetic profiles.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, couriers were crisscrossing the country carrying sealed
pouches full of bar-coded vials of DNA.</TE>
<TE>   But no one had ever tried to use these high-speed laboratory DNA
extractors and gene sequencers to handle so many tissue samples so
badly damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Nor were research laboratories accustomed to the unforgiving
demands of forensic identification or the legal niceties of handling
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, it was more than the robots and the prepackaged
biochemical kits could handle.</TE>
<TE>   Shaler's technicians processed the first 3,000 sets of remains by
hand, extracting the DNA themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical extraction solutions had to be customized by trial
and error, the timing adjusted and procedures revamped. As the weeks
went on, every one of the processing methods was customized to handle
these unusual human cells, said Brian Ward, president of operations
at Myriad.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists were retrained. Laboratories were rebuilt and secure
evidence rooms constructed to hold the DNA. The reliability of new
procedures was tested again and again, then certified by the New York
Department of Health.</TE>
<TE>   At Celera the new labs were ready by November, but it took until
June to develop computer programs that could analyze all the data the
high-speed sequencers spit out.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a laboratory using high-speed robotics to
process such a large number of mitochondrial samples--not the FBI,
not the Defense Department, not anywhere," said Rhonda Roby, forensic
manager for Applied Biosystems.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 20,000 DNA samples were sent to Myriad for analysis on its
12 high-speed sequencing robots.</TE>
<TE>   More than 13,000 bone samples were shipped out for testing and
analysis to the Bode laboratory. So were DNA extracts from 4,000
remains and 3,000 DNA samples gathered from family members or
personal effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The bones are the hardest to do," said Tom Bode, general manager
of Bode Technology Group. "Most of them have been subjected to 2,000
degrees Fahrenheit for weeks on end."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure of so many dead pushed the company's workers and
technology to new extremes.</TE>
<TE>   When Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed two years ago off the
Ventura County coast, it took the Bode laboratory three months to
process DNA from 860 bones recovered from the ocean, then considered
a record pace.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the lab processed 2,000 bone fragments from the
World Trade Center dead in one week last October. Working around the
clock, they continued to process 1,000 new samples a week for the
rest of the fall.</TE>
<TE>   As the weeks turned into months, however, only half the remains
yielded useful DNA. Almost one-fourth showed no DNA at all.</TE>
<TE>   Shaler soon realized that technicians would have to test all the
unclaimed remains again, in the hope that they had learned enough
from the year to coax a name from even these damaged cells.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the DNA identification room, Shaler squinted at the matrix of
the dead scrolling across the computer monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Each numbered cluster of items detailed a set of body pieces,
personal effects and DNA from families of victims that all have a
genetic sequence in common.</TE>
<TE>   Shaler clicked on a case number with the computer mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The microprocessors brooded briefly, then flagged one collection
of remains with a yellow tag.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like a potential mix-up," Shaler said.</TE>
<TE>   Retesting revealed that two people--a man and a woman--had died in
the same spot, their remains intermingled in the crush of tons of
falling Trade Center rubble. The tissues were recovered by rescue
workers and collected in a single 50-milliliter test tube. Muscle
clung to bone.</TE>
<TE>   "People died together," Shaler said. "We have a lot of that."</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall, three industrial freezers were stocked with vials
of World Trade Center DNA. Nearby, a walk-in chiller held a roomful
of bones gleaned from the rubble. Red plastic containers holding
personal effects of disaster victims were stacked six deep to the
ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   On Shaler's computer display, it was all reduced to symbols: life
code and computer code.</TE>
<TE>   In this molecular search-and- rescue effort, they are aided by a
sophisticated computer matching program developed during the course
of the investigation by an Ann Arbor, Mich., company called Gene
Codes Forensics.</TE>
<TE>   The program can cross-match thousands of gene sequences at a
keystroke.</TE>
<TE>   "DNA is the sexy part, but the real underpinning of all this is
computer software," Shaler said. "Without this, it would be
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Shaler moved the computer cursor down the ranks of the dead.</TE>
<TE>   He clicked on a case number.</TE>
<TE>   The screen blossomed into a matrix of genetic sequences from 63
body parts, matched against the DNA extracted from the bristles of a
toothbrush brought in by a victim's family.</TE>
<TE>   "They all match this one person," Shaler said. "And we have the
identification."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the computer's conclusion must be independently confirmed
by a second set of genetic tests, then laboriously cross-checked
against all the family records and personal effects on file, to make
sure that no one puts the right name to the wrong body.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you were 99% perfect, you would have still misidentified
28 people," said Mike Hennessey, project leader for the World Trade
Center identification system.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the system is the program developed by Gene Code
Forensics. With 96,000 lines of code, the software links every item
in the investigation, information once scattered through 22 different
databases and countless file cabinets at laboratories in five states.
With it, Shaler and his forensic team can simultaneously sort in
seconds information from three different types of DNA tests on almost
20,000 partial human remains and compare it to more than 3,000 DNA
samples gleaned from cheek swabs of victims' kin and genetic material
taken from almost 8,000 personal effects.</TE>
<TE>   Other computer programs allow morgue analysts to cross-check
family relationships and calculate the statistical probabilities of a
match between genetic samples and family groups.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Shaler and his team have been able to use the
computer programs to meld partial fragments of DNA from different but
related samples, to create virtual genetic profiles for comparison
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The company delivered the first version of the program, called the
Mass Fatality Identification System, in December.</TE>
<TE>   It made 55 conclusive identifications its first day. Now the team
revises it every week to handle the changing demands of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This requires a level of quality assurance beyond anything we
have ever done, because of the consequences of a mistake and the
emotional pressure," said Howard Cash, the president of Gene Code
Forensics. "Nothing can ever be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Every Friday morning, Cash flies from Michigan to New York,
hand-carrying the latest update of the software.</TE>
<TE>   When he walks through the lobby of the medical examiner's office,
he passes a child's note taped to the wall, written in red crayon on
white construction paper: "I hope you find the people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The dead transform the landscape they occupy, even as a temporary
measure.</TE>
<TE>   In this way, a cornfield becomes a battlefield monument. A stretch
of invasion beach becomes a place in the heart.</TE>
<TE>   So too this sloping asphalt slab where the homeless dead are
parked has--without planning or public ceremony--become a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   There is no plaque.</TE>
<TE>   There is the smell of the dead, the steady hum of cooling fans and
the roar of the rush-hour traffic on FDR Drive beyond the barbed-wire
fence.</TE>
<TE>   By the morgue tent, three unpainted plywood walls have been
erected to give visiting families an easel to write their thoughts of
love and remembrance. An architect is at work on drawings for a
temporary mausoleum.</TE>
<TE>   Along the walls, mourners taped up a photograph of the wife, the
husband, the father, the mother, the son, the daughter, the friend
whose remains have yet to be identified and released.</TE>
<TE>   Every Friday afternoon, Charles Flood, an Episcopal chaplain from
Philadelphia, lights a single candle by the morgue tent and holds a
prayer service. He reads aloud the 23rd Psalm, should any among the
living be there to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "This DNA process is all wrapped up in feelings of wanting to
conquer death," Flood said. "It is very American. It is a way of
saying we will prevail: This dust shall have a name again."</TE>
<TE>   Some families cannot bring themselves to come. A few cannot stay
away.</TE>
<TE>   There is a woman who comes every day and leaves one fresh flower.
A couple from New Jersey paid their first visit not so many evenings
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Their son is here. They know the trailer where his remains are
stored. More of him may yet be identified. They agonized over how
much longer to wait before holding his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   They left his picture by the trailer.</TE>

<HD>Right and Wrong Shouldn't Be Guesswork</HD>
<DH>We have to simplify the laws governing business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if ... what if, these corporate buccaneers are right, or
half-right, when they say they never meant wrong? What if prosecutors
cannot prove otherwise, beyond reasonable doubt?</LD>
<LD>   If you are attentive, there are words of caution buried
parenthetically in news accounts of the now-routine criminal roundup
of alleged corporate racketeers: Obtaining convictions isn't going to
be easy.</LD>
<LD>   "These are some of the most intricate, complex facts I've ever run
into," said Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.). He was speaking of the
fraud-plus case against silver-haired corporate wonder boy Andrew
Fastow, ex-CFO at Enron. But he could just as well have been speaking
of the whole mess left over from the boom of the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Therein hangs the meat of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   I'll pick a number out of the air and dare you to prove me wrong:
Our public securities laws and regulations are a hundred times too
complex. Unfathomably so. And in the vast terrain of this "gray
area," sewer rats feed.</TE>
<TE>   As business scandals continue to unfold, how many times have we
heard an expert say something like this: Well, it may have been
immoral, certainly it was improper, but it may not have been illegal.</TE>
<TE>   I've taken a dozen stabs myself at trying to plow through the
layers of laws and regulations that are supposed to ensure investors
a fair shake in the free-market investment system. The result? Pity
the poor souls who are going to be yanked out of their jobs or called
back from vacations to sit on juries in these free-market malfeasance
cases. Is someone like Martha Stewart an inside trader of stocks?
Well, it depends. Some of those in the know say that if her brokerage
tipped her to the fact that some ImClone insiders were dumping their
holdings or trying to, she may be nothing but a conscientious
investor. But if she was also tipped as to why other insiders were
selling off, that may be different.</TE>
<TE>   I think what the experts mean is that you can try to turn a profit
on gossip so long as the gossip isn't too good. Then it becomes
insider dope.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? In the hullabaloo to restore confidence in the system,
regulators, Congress and the president have overlooked the one thing
that might actually succeed. How about a wholesale and very public
simplification of business law?</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the country has now been dragged into the
investment markets through changes in pension systems. When the
futures of that many of us are involved, we shouldn't have to wonder
why something can be wrong and legal at the same time, and why a
system that is supposed to be wide open for everyone almost never is.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it is beyond the capacity of Congress or the White
House to undertake such a daunting reform. Lobbyists exert too much
control in Washington, and politicians are too beholden for campaign
contributions. But from time to time in our history, we have
entrusted important matters to study by appointed blue-ribbon
commissions. You know the kind I mean, a panel of experts with
unimpeachable reputations and a willingness to serve the larger
interests of their country, a diminishing breed of American, perhaps,
but not yet extinct.</TE>
<TE>   Let them go back and affirm the original purpose of laws that
govern business in the public interest. Investors are supposed to be
able to understand the basic finances, the bottom line, of companies
that offer stock for sale, period. Those people who advise and
conclude these sales should be straightforward in their loyalties and
motives. Entrepreneurial creativity should not include accounting or
offshore post office boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Why are there off-the-books business activities anyway? Or why
must companies account for stock options on taxes but not in their
annual reports? Why do we permit brokers to hand out IPO shares the
same way auto mechanics pass out calendars to customers?</TE>
<TE>   Give this appointed commission time to devise new codes to govern
corporations and Wall Street and then have Congress vote the package
up or down without tinkering by lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   The result would be good for business and good for the country.
Vast thickets of regulation would be mowed down. Perhaps even Wall
Street could gain some lost respect under a more logical and
comprehensible framework of rules. The rest of us would wind up with
what we presumed we had all along: laws to ensure us a fair shake
when we invest our labors and our earnings in American enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   No, you cannot stop wrongdoing. But we shouldn't have to guess
what it is, either.</TE>

<LD>As I have witnessed the tides that ebb and flow on the world stage
over these 50 years, all the more have I come to believe that the
Constitution is the principal mast to which we should rope ourselves
in order to put wax in our ears to the siren calls that will lead us
astray from what the Constitution says.</LD>
<LD>   The Constitution very clearly says, in a nonambiguous sentence,
the Congress shall have power to declare war. I am very pained to see
a Congress, most of the leaders of which say we should pass this
resolution--pass it now, pass it here, get it behind us before the
election. Get it behind us.</LD>
<LD>   Where are we looking? We are looking at Iraq. Yet there is nothing
new in the evidence. I have asked the director of the CIA on two
different occasions: What is different? Do not tell me anything about
policy; we will make the policy. But tell me what there is by way of
intelligence where you are the expert. What is there that is new
today, that you know today that you did not know three months ago or
six months ago? What is it that is so new, so compelling that all of
a sudden, after we heard all this business to the effect there is no
plan on the president's desk?</LD>
<TE>   I asked that question of the secretary of State: What is it that
is new? I have asked that question of the secretary of Defense. What
does he say? The thing that is new is Sept. 11. That is not so new;
that is over 365 days old. So what is there that is new that requires
us to make this fateful, far-reaching decision before the election?</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new. They have known it for three months, six
months. A lot of it they have known for years. This is a fateful
decision, and the decision ought to be made here, and this Congress
ought not turn this fateful determination, this decision, over to any
president, any one man, because, as James Madison said, the trust and
the temptation are too great for any one man.</TE>
<TE>   Here we are today; we have rubber spines, rubber legs, and we do
not have backbones. This branch of government, under the
Constitution, is the branch consisting of the immediately elected
representatives of the people, and under the Constitution it is to
declare war.</TE>
<TE>   The framers were very wise when they determined that these two
matters--the decision to go to war and the making of war--should be
in two different places. The decision, the determination to declare
war, should flow from this branch, the people's branch, and the
matter of making war should be in the hands of a unified commander,
the commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   What are we doing? In my view, if we accept this resolution as it
is written, we are saying both of these vital functions would be
placed in the hands of one man.</TE>
<TE>   I respect the president of the United States. We should work with
him, and we should support him when we can. But remember what Madison
said: The trust and the temptation are too great for any one man.</TE>
<TE>   We elected representatives of the people are not supposed to
follow any president, whether he is a Democrat or Republican, meekly
and without question. I do not believe there is a Republican in this
body who knows me well who would believe for a moment, if we had a
Democratic president today, I would not be saying exactly what I am
saying right now.</TE>
<TE>   There is no king in the American scheme of things. There is no
place for kings in our constitutional system. But there is a place
for men. When I say "men," of course, I am speaking of men and women.</TE>
<TE>   We are voting on this new Bush doctrine of preventive
strikes--preemptive strikes. There is nothing in this Constitution
about preemptive strikes. Yet in this rag here, this resolution, we
are about to vote to put the imprimatur of the Congress on that
doctrine. That is what the Bush administration wants us to do. They
want Congress to put its stamp of approval on that Bush doctrine of
preemptive strikes.</TE>
<TE>   That is a mistake. Are we going to present the face of America as
the face of a bully that is ready to go out at high noon with both
guns blazing or are we going to maintain the face of America as a
country which believes in justice, the rule of law, freedom and
liberty and the rights of all people to work out their ultimate
destiny?</TE>
<TE>   What are the ramifications around the globe? What is the image of
the United States then going to be? A nation that is a rogue nation,
that is determined to wipe out other nations with a preemptive
strike? And what will happen if we deliver a preemptive strike? Will
other nations be encouraged to do the same?</TE>
<TE>   I think the president is in a much better position, ultimately, if
we let the United Nations speak first and not go to the United
Nations and say: Now, we would love to hear what you have to say, but
regardless of what you have to say, we have made up our minds, and if
you don't do it, we are going to do it.</TE>
<TE>   We are committing the blood and the treasure of the American
people to do what the United Nations won't do. I say, do what the
president has done thus far. Put it in the lap of the United Nations
and expect them to give us an answer. Then come back to the people's
representatives and let them make a determination as to whether or
not at that point we should strike.</TE>
<TE>   [However], if we are going to make it a blank check, let's make it
a blank check right upfront, without all of these flowery fig leaves
of "whereas" clauses, and simply say that the president has this
power. Give it to him and we will put up a sign on the top of this
Capitol: "Out of business." "Gone home." "Gone fishing."</TE>
<TE>   We are giving to the president of the United States a blank check,
and Congress cannot do that. Congress should not do that. Where is
the termination? Where is the deadline? Where is the sunset language
that says after this happens this resolution shall no longer exist?
There is nothing. This goes on to the next president of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't the leadership of this Congress say that the
concerns are so great, the potential is so weighty, that we, the
people's representatives, ought to go back and talk to the American
people about this? Let's hear from them before we make this final
decision. Why should we be forced to make this decision now?</TE>

<BD>Peggy Orenstein is the author of "Flux: Women on Sex,
Work, Kids, Love, and Life in a Half-Changed World" (Anchor, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time pink ribbons made me see red was a couple of years
back, when I was stopped short by a sign at a gas station. Cunningly
placed next to a pump, it sported the ubiquitous pink bow and read:
"Be a driving force against breast cancer."</LD>
<LD>   For me, who had finished treatment for the disease three years
earlier at the age of 35, that tore it. Corporations know that those
pink ribbons translate into green cash: According to a 2000 Opinion
Research International poll, more than two-thirds of women said they
would purchase a product linked to the fight against breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   But how many of them will ask how their money is actually spent or
how corporate donors may themselves "drive" the breast cancer agenda?</LD>
<TE>   Consider Breast Cancer Awareness month, which is every October.
Its founder, the drug maker AstraZeneca, manufactures the breast
cancer drug tamoxifen and other chemotherapies, but until recently it
made agrochemicals as well.</TE>
<TE>   It's a perfect profit circle.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont, another sponsor of awareness programs, continues to
manufacture pesticides that contain known carcinogens. So this month,
we are likely to hear a great deal about "prevention" in the form of
behavior modification and diet but will not hear that as many as half
of all cancers are not associated with known risk factors. The "e
word"--environment--if it comes up at all, will be quickly dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   We will also hear that early detection is the best protection. We
will not hear that mammograms miss 25% of cancers in women under 50.
Nor will we hear that, in many cases, early detection makes no
difference in outcome, either because the woman's disease is too
aggressive or because it is sufficiently nonaggressive that she'd be
just as likely to survive or die if she waited until she or her
doctor discovered a lump.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a 10-year study published this month in the Journal of
the National Cancer Institute, covering more than 250,000 women,
showed virtually no difference in death rates from breast cancer
between those who did monthly breast self-examinations and those who
did not. We also will not hear that too little has changed in the
treatment of breast cancer since President Nixon raised the battle
cry in 1971. Our choices are still slash, burn and poison.</TE>
<TE>   Women without health insurance don't even have those options.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what we need to be thinking about: Mammography, while the
best screening currently available, is simply not good enough. We
need to focus, urgently, on developing more effective, safer
screening technologies that will better predict which tumors need
aggressive treatment.</TE>
<TE>   And more attention needs to be paid to possible environmental
links to the disease. Establishing those relationships is notoriously
complex, as a recent 10-year study of breast cancer in Long Island,
N.Y., showed. But that's no reason to abandon the effort. There are
thousands of pesticides, solvents and fuels lingering in our
environment and in our bodies that may be affecting our breast
tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, research that could result in pulling products off the
shelves may not be a popular idea with corporate sponsors. They'd
rather have women passively shopping for a cure than angrily
demanding a search for a cause.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we need better treatment options for the 40,000 women who
die each year of this disease, whose cancers were too aggressive to
be helped by mammography detection or current therapies. Their deaths
were not a failure of will but a failure of medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The pink ribbon once represented the effort to transform breast
cancer from a source of silent shame into a public health crisis. To
make good on its promise, we need to do more than patronize companies
that support complacency in the name of "awareness." Before we put
our money down--whether for a gallon of gasoline, a handbag (in
partnership with an automobile company!) or to sponsor a friend on a
fun run--we need to ensure that the pink-ribbon profits will make a
real difference in prevention, detection and treatment of breast
cancer.</TE>

<AU>JOHN W. WARNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The purpose of this resolution is to show the resolve of the Congress
of the United States. People say: Where is the smoking gun? Let's
hope we do not have a smoking gun.</LD>
<LD>   We are faced with the situation of an individual who has
extensively utilized in years past--not in the 1990-1991 conflict but
in the war with Iran--chemical weapons. He also used those weapons
against elements of his own people whom he was trying to repress and
subject to his tyrannical regime. So there is a clear history of the
use of these weapons. There is now a clear, documented case of open
intelligence that he possesses larger stocks, more versatile stocks
and the ability to use them.</LD>
<LD>   We must pay due respect to our colleagues who have different
views. But the important thing is that the Congress speaks with one
voice with our president as he proceeds to address these issues in
the United Nations and as he proceeds to engage other nations'
leaders to encourage them to accept the same responsibility the
United States is prepared to accept in addressing the potential
dangers of these weapons of mass destruction which are clearly
possessed by Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   This is, quite literally, a decision to put our nation's sons and
daughters in harm's way. It is a decision that must never be taken
lightly. It is also a decision we must be willing to make when the
security of our nation or our vital national security interests are
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Our republic has sent forth the men and women of our nation in
uniform close to 100 times. Some calculations use 80.</TE>
<TE>   [The Constitution] enumerates with specificity the duties and the
powers of Congress. One is to declare war. But as I look over those
80-plus times that the men and women of the armed forces have gone
forward, only four times in the 200-plus-year history has this
Congress ever declared war. We are not declaring war. What we are
about to do has the same depth of seriousness and the same depth of
consequences to the men and women in the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   None of us wants to see our men and women in uniform committed to
foreign battlefields. None of us seeks a war with Saddam Hussein.
War, conflict is the last resort; that the strength and the resolve
that we take now is the best way to avoid that conflict.</TE>
<TE>   There are times, again, we must be prepared and willing to resort
to the use of force to protect our national security and the people
of our great nation and those of our allies. This is one of those
times.</TE>
<TE>   The principal purpose of this resolution is to authorize our
president to use military force if--if--he deems it necessary to
remove the threat to our nation and the world possessed by Saddam
Hussein and his growing inventory of weapons of mass destruction, the
chemical and biological weapons this evil man already possesses and
the nuclear weapons he is racing to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there are risks associated with confronting Iraq. I have
enumerated those in some detail. But the risks associated with
inaction, to me and to our president, are far greater if we fail to
confront this danger now--not tomorrow; now.</TE>
<TE>   Confronting Saddam Hussein now is a logical step, a necessary
step, and a mandatory step to rid the world of his potential.</TE>
<TE>   How will we explain to the American people--in the wake of a
possible future attack on the United States or U.S. interests,
directly by Saddam Hussein or indirectly through surrogate terrorists
equipped and directed by him, that we, the Congress, knew Saddam
Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that we knew from history
that he did use them against others, and that he intended to
manufacture and acquire even more and to use these weapons possibly
against us and others, and yet the world failed to act timely?</TE>
<TE>   Now the Congress, as a coequal branch of government, must join our
president and support the course that he has set. We have to
demonstrate a resolve within our nation and internationally that
communicates to Saddam Hussein a clear message that enough is enough.
You are to be held accountable to the world law and order as
enunciated in 16 resolutions--and possibly a 17th--of the United
Nations. He has to be convinced that America and international
resolve is real, unshakable and enforceable if there is to be a
peaceful resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But, if diplomacy fails, we must be prepared to act.</TE>
<TE>   The president is not king. But what is in the Constitution is the
president should be commander in chief of the Army and Navy and,
indeed, the Air Force and the Marines. At this very moment, while we
are in this chamber, Saddam Hussein is firing on our airplanes over
Iraq, which have been operating for over a decade, trying to enforce
at least one of the resolutions, 688, which precluded him from using
force, such as poison gas and biological weapons, against his own
people.</TE>
<TE>   What is new? I am urging the administration to try and share more
information with the Congress, but I can only speak for myself as to
what is new, and that is the biological weaponry. It is an open fact
now.</TE>
<TE>   Policies of containment have worked in the past, but with the
spread of modern technology, and the clear documentation that this
particular evil dictator, Saddam Hussein, has used these weapons
against his own people and his adversaries, it is clear and
convincing proof to this senator that there is a threat that must be
dealt with now--not tomorrow, now.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, the United Nations will devise a resolution and live up
to its responsibilities. But if it does not, let there be no doubt in
the minds of anyone that our nation will act in its own interest to
protect its own people and, hopefully, will act with a coalition of
allies.</TE>

<HD>Vote Yes on Proposition 50</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians prize their environment, and they have been generous in
providing bond funds to improve water quality, fix up long-neglected
state parks, clean up beaches and develop urban park and recreation
facilities. Voters are now being called on to pass Proposition 50, an
initiative measure for the sale of $3.44 billion in general
obligation bonds to continue badly needed water projects, protect
watershed areas, purchase and restore wetlands such as Bolsa Chica in
northern Orange County and finance local and regional projects. It's
a lot in one basket, but the projects are worthwhile individually and
almost all are long-term. Proposition 50 deserves a yes vote.</LD>
<LD>   By restoring the environment, especially in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, Proposition 50 would help stabilize Southern
California's water supply and improve its quality. But the measure is
important to all of California.</LD>
<TE>   The plan was written primarily by Joe Caves, a Sacramento lobbyist
representing the Nature Conservancy. Normally such measures should
travel the regular legislative process. Caves proceeded with his
petition drive only after lawmakers failed to assemble their own
water bond issue, primarily because farm-area legislators insisted on
construction money for new water storage reservoirs. But actual work
on the reservoirs can't begin until surveys and engineering studies
are done. Indeed, Proposition 50 allocates $50 million for those
feasibility studies, along with $70 million for critically needed
restoration of delta levees.</TE>
<TE>   The measure allocates the money in broad categories and through
existing financing mechanisms. Most of the money would be
appropriated by the Legislature. The exception is $750 million that
the state Wildlife Conservation Board would allocate over a period of
years, largely to buy and restore coastal wetlands, and for which it
would set priorities. Past bond issues have helped acquire some
wetlands but not restore them.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single amount, $950 million, is earmarked for wetlands
and watershed protection. An additional $825 million would go to
Cal-Fed, the massive state-federal program to restore the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and related waterways. The Metropolitan
Water District, which wholesales water throughout Southern California
and is backing Proposition 50, gets much of its supply from the
delta-fed State Water Project via the 400-mile-long California
Aqueduct. Cal-Fed needs the money in part because the federal
government is failing to pay its share of the joint project.</TE>
<TE>   About $640 million more would be used to assist regional water
supply and water quality programs and improve fish and wildlife
habitat. Bond funds also would help consummate a needed water trade
between the farmlands of the Imperial Irrigation District and San
Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 50 is a multiyear investment to give California an
adequate water supply and save wild lands and wetlands for future
generations. Vote yes on Proposition 50.</TE>

<LD>President Bush promised Monday night that the United States and its
allies would help rebuild Iraq in the event of war. Last weekend's
election in Bosnia-Herzegovina showed the extraordinary difficulty of
such nation-building. The U.S. and other nations would be well
advised to watch what's happening there as they decide how to deal
with Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   From 1992 to 1995, the war in the Balkans, fueled by ethnic
rivalries, killed 200,000 people; ethnic cleansing drove 1 million
from their homes. In 1995, the warring factions met in Dayton, Ohio,
and achieved peace accords that provided Bosnia-Herzegovina with a
three-person collective presidency to reflect that troubled region's
three main factions--Serb, Croat and Muslim.</LD>
<LD>   Now Bosnian voters have rankled the countries that pump aid into
the region by voting heavily for the same nationalist types who
plunged the territory into devastating war a decade back. Western
donor nations were rooting for a multiethnic party known as the
Social Democrats, hoping this important part of the ruling coalition
would gain power and increase the chances of economic reforms.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the Social Democrats finished fourth, with nationalists
winning the Serb and Croat seats and an all-Muslim party appearing
ready to win the Muslim seat. The Social Democrats could have done
better had they lifted more people out of poverty; their failure to
do so and continued ethnic tensions wounded them.</TE>
<TE>   Donor nations have provided Bosnia with more than $5 billion in
aid. They had hoped that a moderate government seeking economic
reforms would make enough progress toward peaceful democracy that
outsiders could start to pull back. The nationalists' rise--which
reversed the move toward reform that came with state elections two
years ago--makes that goal unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia demonstrates the difficulty of building democracies on the
rubble of war. Nation-building takes many billions of dollars, spent
over many years. It requires economic coalitions, not just military
ones.</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia, NATO intervened to stop the killing. The United States,
Germany, Britain and their allies will have to keep sinking in money
if the foundering government is to survive. In Afghanistan, a
coalition force drove out a government that had been harboring Al
Qaeda terrorists. The United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia and other
nations will spend an estimated $10 billion on reconstruction over
the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Setbacks aside, the alternative to pitching in to help
Bosnia-Herzegovina or Afghanistan would have been bloody chaos--a far
more costly outcome for the world in the long run. Still, economies
across the globe are in sad shape. The United States and its allies
would be wise to figure out who will pay the billions of dollars to
rebuild Iraq before deciding whether to topple Saddam Hussein.</TE>

<HD>Terror's Renewed Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Terror" is a word Americans have heard and used a lot in the last 13
months. It means intense fear. And that, even on this opposite coast,
is what the Washington-area sniper has unleashed this last week.
Eight people--six dead, two wounded, one of them a boy going to
school--were methodically picked off by an unseen villain using
bullets designed to splinter and maim.</LD>
<LD>   Snipers are useful in war, sneaking into enemy areas to cause
casualties and consternation among actual combatants. We've had
snipers in American civilian life before, deranged, angry loners with
guns who typically set up in some high place--a university tower or a
hotel roof--to kill strangers randomly and senselessly. They're
usually caught or killed quickly and we return to the mental comfort
of knowing they were aberrations.</LD>
<LD>   In the context of Sept. 11, 2001, however, we are more easily
frightened by such violence. Any deaths and injuries are truly
terrible. But it's the apparent randomness of such events that spawns
terror. The perpetrators use our prized openness and routine
innocence to stalk us. Out of a clear blue sky, airplanes crash into
buildings, single bullets crash through one pedestrian running
errands and not another, one child gets abducted and murdered while a
playmate doesn't.</LD>
<TE>   As humans, we need patterns to make sense of our
surroundings--even lethal patterns. A fired employee, a racist, a
pervert or a spurned lover, we need to find some reason for these
incomprehensible events.</TE>
<TE>   We have none of that yet in this newest spree. To have no patterns
makes no sense. And that is terrifying, even far from the immediate
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   What usually comes from fear and frustration, strangely, is anger.
The rage we feel boiling is understandable, even predictable.
Arousing such reactions is, in fact, part of the sick goal of those
who use terror, be they legions of suicidal zealots or cunning cults
of one. One of the most important delayed lessons of 9/11 may be the
recurring need to control that anger in this evolving era of terror.
We need to channel that fury again and again into a kind of
thoughtful but relentless response to protect the enduring civility
and democracy that created and sustained the openness and innocence
in the first place.</TE>

<HD>Justice System: When a Plea Is No Bargain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Deals Shift Justice Into High Gear," Oct. 5: Using a recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision, people accused of crimes can be forced to
enter into plea bargains without full knowledge of the cases both for
and against them--much like being forced to traverse a camouflaged
minefield without a map.</LD>
<LD>   An example from my experience as a juror: A longtime public
drunkard accused (in what smelled ever so strongly of frame-up) of
illegal heroin possession was offered a deal of 30 days of county
jail time in exchange for a guilty plea. Had he accepted this
wonderful bait, he could well have faced substantial prison time the
eminently predictable next time around as a two-time "offender." As
things worked out, I had the temerity to "hang" the racially biased
jury, after which the heroin charge was dropped and our defendant was
allowed to plead guilty to the proper charge of public drunkenness.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since that experience, I have felt great skepticism about a
system that offers differing versions of "justice" to people of
differing bank balances.</LD>

<LD>While I may agree with your "no" recommendation on Proposition 51
(editorial, Oct. 4), please do not use the golf cart path for Leisure
World residents as part of your ammunition.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California has not been very friendly over the years to
nonpolluting travelers such as Red Car riders, pedestrians,
bicyclists and Leisure World seniors. That is one reason why our air
is so polluted and our streets are so congested.</LD>
<LD>   If seniors collectively choose to maintain their mobility with
zero-emission golf carts or neighborhood electric vehicles, should we
not encourage that?</LD>
<TE>   In this instance Proposition 51 addresses a need that conventional
thinking may overlook. With any luck, you and I will reach an age
where that dedicated path is important to our mobility, safety and
well-being.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I just watched the (only?) debate between Gov. Gray Davis and Bill
Simon (Oct. 8). I am struck by how adept both candidates seemed at
dancing around any direct response to a question and falling back on
canned campaign rhetoric. I think they are sending us a message, and
I propose we send one back--vote for anyone else!</LD>

<TE>   I enjoyed listening to the gubernatorial debate Monday. Both
candidates bragged and whined quite a bit and didn't say all that
much about where they stood on many issues. My question to The Times
is, where were the other four candidates for governor who are listed
in my sample ballot? It would have been just as interesting to hear
their takes on what is going on as it was to hear both Davis and
Simon.</TE>

<TE>   Perhaps if The Times took more pride in its position of informing
the public, Green Party candidate Peter Camejo could have achieved
the 15% poll rating you required in order to have him participate in
Monday's debate (Oct. 7). The fault is not his but yours.</TE>

vote for Simon!</TE>

<TE>   In the wake of the Enron collapse, electricity suppliers'
manipulation of California's energy grid and catastrophic stock
market losses, Davis' motto during the debate, "Trust me, I'm from
the government," resonates with voters a whole lot better than
challenger Simon's mantra, "Trust me, I'm a businessman."</TE>

<TE>   Re "Latino Caucus Won't Support Davis Reelection," Oct. 5:</TE>
<TE>   Because Davis had the guts to veto SB 804 and AB 60, the bills
that would have permitted illegal immigrants the privilege of
obtaining driver's licenses, I am going to support and vote for him.
Previously, I was not. I still had a problem with the handling of the
power plant crisis and blowing the budget surplus. My one lingering
question is his seeming to want illegal immigrants to first have a
job before getting a license. The jobs are for people here legally.</TE>
<TE>   I believe the Latino Caucus is racist. It should be concerned with
getting illegal immigrants, of any stripe, back home and not given
the privileges that are due legal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Nelson</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The arrogance of the Democratic Latino legislative caucus is
reaching new limits. Its members have chosen not to support Davis
because he won't support allowing illegal immigrants to obtain state
driver's licenses. Illegal immigrants are not U.S. citizens and have
broken the laws of our country. Why should they be allowed the same
rights and privileges of citizens who elected these representatives,
pay their salaries and who are supposed to be represented by them?
These Latino members of the Senate and Assembly need to rethink their
priorities.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Davis Can Expect to Be Haunted by Latino Issues," by Frank del
Olmo, Commentary, Oct. 6: Gov. Davis did the right thing in vetoing
the measure that would have allowed illegal aliens to get driver's
licenses. At least now we won't "be haunted" by the specter of
another million drivers on our roads. Del Olmo and Assemblyman Gil
Cedillo should look up the definition of "illegal" before being
allowed to write another column or introduce any more legislation,
because they don't seem to understand its meaning. Anyone who is here
illegally should be deported, not rewarded.</TE>

<LD>President Bush is quoted as saying in his speech Monday night: "We

people to do?</LD>
<LD>   The economy keeps dipping lower and lower, and the threats of
terrorist attacks and the so-called necessity for a war on Iraq get

up? Hopefully soon.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Cowboy Style Won't Lasso Support," by Tyler Marshall and
William Wallace, news analysis, Oct. 7: It is understandable that
European diplomats, in their customary dither to avoid decisive
action, would seize on Bush's colloquial style as justification for
avoiding his compelling substance. It is not understandable that
objective journalists would resurrect 2-year-old faux pas to justify
their sympathy with perceived European sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the president's Monday night address was free of
the Western mannerisms so jarring to the ears of the refined. But I
do not expect this to produce increased receptivity in Europe or even
among certain American journalists.</TE>

<TE>   I listened to his every word. All of it is conjecture and

Good luck to Bush and his cronies. Congratulations to those who

suspended as long as this man is our president.</TE>

<TE>   All the war crimes that "Iraq War Crimes Dossiers in Works" (Oct.
6) lists occurred from 1988 to 1991. You characterize the first Bush
administration not pushing for prosecution as ironic, when it was
more likely craven political expediency.</TE>
<TE>   There has never been a serious explanation as to why we supported
Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and failed to topple his
regime or offer real help to opposition groups after the Gulf War.
Why was he an acceptable dictator in 1988 yet is an evildoer now?</TE>
<TE>   Paul Zelevansky</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finally our government is talking seriously about indicting
Hussein and his cronies for their crimes against their countrymen and
their neighbors. You can hardly find an Iraqi American among us who
has not called for such an action before. It is the best way to
change the regime and to get the international community behind us.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Bush deserves the chutzpah-of-the year award. He has
spent much time trying to kill the new International Criminal Court
but now has decided Hussein should face a modified international
tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Where was he when most of the atrocities were being committed? The
Kurds were gassed in 1988, and religious persecution and ethnic
cleansing go back to 1991. Somehow the president doesn't seem like he
is ready to lead Amnesty International.</TE>

<TE>   Will someone please remind our president that, as a Texan, he
should know that no sheriff worthy of his star goes riding off into
the sage after the bad guys without a posse to back him up. If he
can't convince the U.N. (posse) that he is right, he just may be
wrong.</TE>

<TE>   I have no doubt that the thousands of people who took part in the
peace demonstration at the Federal Building in Westwood on Sunday are
sincere. Just as the people who urged this country not to get
involved in "Europe's war" between 1939 and 1941 were sincere, until
Pearl Harbor changed everything. A dictator is a dictator, whether he
is Adolf Hitler or Hussein. They cannot be dealt with diplomatically
in the same way that democracies negotiate with each other. To the
people who marched across the country, I would ask: Should we wait
for another Sept. 11? Should we wait until thousands of Americans are
killed in a chemical, biological or nuclear attack? Will it take
another Pearl Harbor for you to realize that force is the only thing
that dictators like Hussein understand?</TE>

<HD>High School Diploma Must Have Meaning</HD>

<LD>Starting with the words "penalty" and "blame" ("Diploma Penalty
Misplaces Blame," by Jeannie Oakes and John Rogers, Opinion, Oct. 6),
the authors beg the question of whether the high school exit exam is
designed to be a punishment. The requirement that students master key
skills before exiting high school is a reform, as much as the push to
fully credential teachers. Thus Los Angeles Unified School District
Supt. Roy Romer has proposed accommodating seniors who have failed
the exit exam with an additional year of adult school.</LD>
<LD>   Reforms that are difficult are, nevertheless, reforms. After all,
what good is a diploma, to the student or to society, if it does not
accurately reflect achievement?</LD>

<TE>   In other times, students could be expelled for misbehavior,
flunked for inattention or retained in one grade level until they
learned the required syllabus. Having deprived the schools of these
useful sanctions, we demand that they replace the "stick" not with a
carrot but with a lobster dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Creating an environment where nothing can be blamed on the student
will assure that a sizable fraction of students remain belligerent,
inattentive and irresponsible.</TE>

<LD>Don't let the banners, champagne and giddy behavior fool you. Anaheim
may seem as if it's reveling in the success of the upstart Angels,
but behind the scenes, there's some serious strategizing about how to
raise the city's profile.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the Anaheim Angels' making the playoffs--and
their first-round victory over the New York Yankees--is a gift from
the PR gods, landing theem on the front pages of the country's
largest newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   Converting it into cash, however, could prove difficult.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to avoid the perception that this is our 15 minutes of
fame," said John Nicoletti, a city spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city that is in the national spotlight for a positive
reason ... and we need to capitalize on the name recognition of being
a major league city and convert it into the long term."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who is also a huge Angel fan,
has been granting every media request. He even went on Minnesota
radio live Monday afternoon with the mayor of Minneapolis to cement
their friendly playoff wager.</TE>
<TE>   His mantra doesn't waver: Anaheim is the smallest city with a
major league baseball team carrying its name, and this is the first
year the team sports "Anaheim" on road uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Nicoletti is firing out news releases--datelined Anaheim--with a
collection of facts about the city.</TE>
<TE>   If only people knew where it is. Daly winces when he reads quotes
from New Yorkers asking: "Where is Anaheim? Who is Anaheim?" and,
well, maybe, isn't it "about 50 miles south of San Diego?"</TE>
<TE>   But those who study sports business and marketing said sporting
events rarely translate into financial gain for cities because
residents simply choose to attend a game rather than pick some other
leisure activity--they won't do both.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim is simply a suburb of Los Angeles that happens to have a
good baseball team," said Smith College economics professor Andy
Zimbalist, who is also an expert in sports business.</TE>
<TE>   "If they think somebody is going to watch the Angels beat the
Yankees on TV in Georgia and say, 'Anaheim, where is that? I've got
to take my family there,' they're mistaken. I don't think that
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Anaheim is in a unique spot, said David Carter of the
Redondo Beach-based Sports Business Group. While many teams use state
names--Colorado instead of Denver Rockies and Arizona instead of
Phoenix Diamondbacks--the Angels have done the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Because Anaheim already is strongly linked to Disneyland and
Southern California, the rewards may not be as great as they would be
for a smaller, lesser-known city that lacks a tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "Either people don't have any feeling for Anaheim or they
generally think positively about the region and the city," Carter
said. "This is a significant opportunity for Anaheim to protect the
great reputation it already has in sports and entertainment."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Pins PR Hopes on Angels' Fame</HD>
<DH>Baseball: City using publicity to boost name recognition.
Experts are divided on effectiveness.</DH>

<LD>Don't let the banners, champagne and giddy behavior fool you. Anaheim
may seem as if it's reveling in the success of the upstart Angels,
but behind the scenes, there's some serious strategizing about how to
raise the city's profile.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the Anaheim Angels' making the playoffs--and
their first-round victory over the New York Yankees--is a gift from
the PR gods, landing them on the front pages of the country's largest
newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   Converting it into cash, however, could prove difficult.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to avoid the perception that this is our 15 minutes of
fame," said John Nicoletti, a city spokesman, who has been fielding
out-of-town media calls since the Angels made it to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city that is in the national spotlight for a positive
reason ... and we need to capitalize on the name recognition of being
a major league city and convert it into the long term."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who is also a huge Angel fan,
has been granting every media request. He even went on Minnesota
radio live Monday afternoon with the mayor of Minneapolis to cement
their friendly playoff wager.</TE>
<TE>   His mantra doesn't waver: Anaheim is the smallest city with a
major league baseball team carrying its name, and this is the first
year the team sports "Anaheim" on road uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Nicoletti is firing out news releases--datelined Anaheim--with a
collection of facts about the city: that it's California's 10th most
populous city, covers 50 square miles, and claims either headquarters
or major branches of industries such as Carl Karcher Enterprises, the
Walt Disney Co., and the Boeing Co., not to mention that it's a
"great place to live, work and play."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Angels are a bona fide Cinderella story--not just a
jinxed team that hadn't won a playoff series in 42 years--Nicoletti
said the city will start including baseball caps and jerseys in
informational packets to lure prospective businesses into Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   If only people knew where it is. Daly winces when he reads quotes
from New Yorkers asking: "Where is Anaheim? Who is Anaheim?" and,
well, maybe, isn't it "about 50 miles south of San Diego?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's about identity," Daly said. "It's a subject that requires
constant attention. I wish there was a way to say Anaheim is a
convenient drive between Los Angeles and San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   But those who study sports business and marketing said sporting
events rarely translate into financial gain for cities because
residents simply choose to attend a game rather than pick some other
leisure activity--they won't do both.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim is simply a suburb of Los Angeles that happens to have a
good baseball team," said Smith College economics professor Andy
Zimbalist, who is also an expert in sports business. "If they think
somebody is going to watch the Angels beat the Yankees on TV in
Georgia and say, 'Anaheim, where is that? I've got to take my family
there,' they're mistaken. I don't think that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Angels Adopt Stronger Identity With City</TE>
<TE>   Still, Anaheim is in a unique spot, said David Carter of the
Redondo Beach-based Sports Business Group. While many teams use state
names--Colorado instead of Denver Rockies and Arizona instead of
Phoenix Diamondbacks--the Angels have done the opposite. Once known
as the California Angels, they were renamed the Anaheim Angels in
1996, after Disney bought the team.</TE>
<TE>   "For most cities, that would be the equivalent of being on
national TV with a sandwich board walking around the stadium saying,
'Here we are, come visit us,' " Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   And they don't even have to pay for it. "You can't buy the front
page," Nicoletti said about the free publicity the team is generating
for the city. A 30-second commercial on Fox during the American
League Championship Series costs about $100,000 depending on the day
of week. It jumps to about $300,000 for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Rewards May Not Be That Great, Some Warn</TE>
<TE>   But because Anaheim already is strongly linked to Disneyland and
Southern California, the rewards may not be as great as they would be
for a smaller, lesser-known city that lacks a tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "Either people don't have any feeling for Anaheim or they
generally think positively about the region and the city," Carter
said. "This is a significant opportunity for Anaheim to protect the
great reputation it already has in sports and entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Angels' success may not translate into economic
riches and a tourism bonanza for Anaheim, one marketing consultant
said city leaders are doing all the right things. "I really do think
there's an opportunity that shouldn't be wasted here," said
consultant Rolfe Shellenberger.</TE>
<TE>   "That opportunity needs to be hyped. I would tell them to continue
to get their name on everything. ... Send releases. This is an
address you may have dimly remembered from your past and yes, it is
in the middle of Orange County. Home of the Anaheim Angels, home of
Disneyland."</TE>

<HD>Armenian American Group Comes Out Against Secession</HD>
<DH>Politics: Organization says breaking up L.A. could further
split the ethnic community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The western board of the Armenian National Committee of America
announced Tuesday that it opposes San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession, an issue that some say has divided the large numbers of
Armenian Americans in the two areas.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the Armenian committee said they joined the
anti-secession campaign because they believe a breakup of Los Angeles
would be financially risky and could further split the Armenian
American community.</LD>
<LD>   There are about 100,000 Armenian Americans in the city of Los
Angeles, with heavy concentrations in Hollywood and the East Valley,
according to Steven J. Dadaian, board chairman for the committee. Two
Armenian Americans are running for Valley and Hollywood city council
seats in the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<TE>   "Hollywood has traditionally represented the gateway through which
many Armenian Americans immigrated to Los Angeles," Dadaian said. "We
think of ourselves as one community in Los Angeles. We did not want
to divide up our community."</TE>
<TE>   The committee has significant influence among Armenian American
voters, according to Vache Mangassarian, owner and anchor of the
Armenian National Network, a television station based in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   But Pete Abajian, director of the Armenian Assembly, said most of
the calls he gets from Armenian Americans are in support of
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "The Armenian community has been drastically underserved by the
city of Los Angeles," said Abajian, who supports secession. The
assembly, a Los Angeles-based political advocacy group, focuses on
national issues and does not plan to take a position on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Garry K. Sinanian, a Hollywood council candidate, said the
secession debate has been especially contentious among the 50,000
Armenian Americans living in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee does not speak for all of the Armenian community,"
Sinanian said.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate added that secession would give Armenian Americans
access to local political power. He said he could never run
successfully for the Los Angeles City Council, which is made up of
districts that contain about 250,000 people each and are drawn in a
way that divides the Armenian population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too big, and you would have to spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars," said Sinanian, who played an instrumental role
in convincing the city to install a Little Armenia sign in east
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for the five Hollywood council seats are running at
large in the proposed city of 180,000. If secession loses, the
Hollywood and Valley councils will not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Armineh Chelebian of Winnetka, who is running for the 3rd district
seat on the Valley council, said she also views secession as an
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "It opened doors for me," she said. "It allowed me to start my
political career."</TE>

<LD>Bail was set at $250,000 Tuesday for a man who police said fled after
an auto accident last week, leaving his critically injured infant son
in the front seat.</LD>
<LD>   John Steidinger, 23, made his initial court appearance on charges
of felony hit-and-run, child endangering and abandoning a child. But
the entry of his plea was postponed until Oct. 25, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Cher DeCant, so a public defender could be assigned to the
case.</LD>
<LD>   The boy suffered multiple skull fractures and a bruised lung,
authorities said, and remains hospitalized.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>Charles Savoca was looking forward to ridding his house of termites,
but he didn't realize the whole house would be gone as well.</LD>
<LD>   Exterminators accidentally blew up Savoca's house Monday while
using "thermagation"--an alternative to fumigation--to get rid of
termites and ants.</LD>
<LD>   For whole-house thermagation, a tarp is draped around the home.
Propane heaters set up outside the house generate heat on the
exterior walls and on the inside through portable duct systems. The
temperature inside the house reaches 140 degrees to 150 degrees and
the bugs are cooked to death.</LD>
<TE>   It's typically an effective way to rid a house of bugs. But in
Savoca's case, something went wrong. First one and then four or five
other propane tanks blew up from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   A raging fire took five air tankers, three helicopters and dozens
of firefighters two hours to control. It devastated Savoca's home,
leaving a blackened concrete slab.</TE>
<TE>   "I hired them thinking they had the expertise to do this without
burning my house down," Savoca said. "They sure exterminated my
house."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Recruits Face High Expectations, Bratton Says</HD>
<DH>Police: The designate for chief tells future officers to
carry selves with pride and respect for the job--as well as for
city's residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police chief-in-waiting William J. Bratton addressed a group of 51
bright-eyed police recruits at the Los Angeles Police Department's
Westchester training facility Tuesday, laying out his vision for
community policing and his high expectations for future officers.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton sounded many now-familiar themes in brief remarks to the
43 men and eight women in the class, one of six LAPD recruitment
classes expected to be trained to join the department over the next
year.</LD>
<LD>   But as he looked out at the rows of recruits, their hair closely
cropped and eyes fixed forward, he began waxing sentimental about his
beginnings in the Boston Police Department, and the three decades
that have passed with the snap of a finger.</LD>
<TE>   There would be large expectations, Bratton, who was selected by
Mayor James K. Hahn last week as the city's next police chief, told
the recruits. And as they move through their careers, they need to
remember that they are public servants and to carry themselves based
on pride, commitment and respect for the job, as well as for the
city's inhabitants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As you police these streets, think of what you would want for
your mother, your father, your sister, your brother," Bratton said,
recalling the words of a late compatriot. "Think of your family in
terms of what it would be like for them to walk in some of the
neighborhoods you will be asked to police and some of the
neighborhoods you are going to be asked to bring back."</TE>
<TE>   To do that, Bratton said, the department must not be afraid to
reach out to the community, business people and political leaders to
identify and prioritize problems "that are creating crime, fear and
disorder."</TE>
<TE>   It also means adhering to the highest ethical principles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Bratton acknowledged that he will have to
accomplish more with fewer resources than in the past, noting that
"the thin blue line was being stretched pretty thin."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton wrapped up his tour by watching other police recruits
engage in hand-to-hand combat training exercises, paying cash for two
LAPD T-shirts and pausing at a memorial for fallen officers. Looking
back at the modern training facility, he added that the department
also needs a new headquarters to replace Parker Center downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, meanwhile, a group of Latino community members,
including several former LAPD officers, denounced Hahn's selection of
Bratton, calling the process unfair and tainted.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Frias, a member of the coalition known as the Los Angeles
Coalition for the Chief of Police, which endorsed Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez, said Hahn chose Bratton prior to the official selection
process.</TE>
<TE>   Frias and others called upon the Los Angeles City Council, which
must confirm Bratton's appointment, to formally investigate the
mayor's action. They cited as an example the fact that Bratton was
house hunting in Los Angeles weeks before his selection.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Bratton was warmly received at a Latino heritage picnic
thrown by the Latin American Law Enforcement Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody is happy, but the disappointment is over," said
association President Art Placentia. "We will support him [Bratton]
as vigorously as we would have Art Lopez."</TE>

<HD>Acquitted Pair Seek to Clear Names</HD>
<DH>Law: Eileen and Jennifer Childs of Simi Valley, found not
guilty of trying to kill Eileen's husband, want to erase records of
their arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley woman and her teenage daughter are asking a judge to
declare them "factually innocent" six weeks after they were acquitted
on attempted murder and arson charges.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Eileen Childs, 38, of plotting with her
daughter, Jennifer, 19, to kill her husband by setting him on fire as
he slept. When Larry Childs awoke in March to find his mattress on
fire, the women allegedly beat him on the head with baseball bats.</LD>
<LD>   The pair were accused of trying to collect on a $1.4-million life
insurance policy. But jurors found there was no solid proof of the
alleged crimes and acquitted the mother and daughter on all charges.</LD>
<TE>   Eileen and Jennifer Childs, who maintained they were defending
themselves from Eileen's 57-year-old husband, now want a finding of
factual innocence to clear their names.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is only fair to put them back to the place they were
in before the fingers of suspicion were pointed at them," said Chief
Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley, who filed the petition.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee, who is opposing the request, said
"There is a huge difference between a jury finding a defendant or
defendants not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and a finding of
factual innocence."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said such a finding requires police agencies to destroy all
records related to a defendant's arrest and allows the suspect to
claim he or she was never prosecuted for the crime. Such petitions
are rare, Lee said, and typically pursued in cases in which a victim
recants or other evidence clears the accused of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a far cry from that," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor has urged Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III,
who presided over the Childs' trial, to deny the petition. Curtis
took the matter under submission Tuesday and is expected to issue a
written ruling within 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's hearing, Eileen Childs said her request is driven
in large part by a desire to shield her teenage daughter from having
to list her arrest for attempted murder on future job applications.</TE>
<TE>   "I want this more for Jennifer," she said. "To be accused of
attempted murder when all she did was protect her mother is just
disgusting."</TE>

<HD>Making Social Justice Part of the Curriculum</HD>
<DH>A new charter middle school aims to prepare 'the next Cesar
Chavez or the next Martin Luther King,' says its executive director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an attorney, Roger Lowenstein defended some notorious characters,
including a mobster, a group of political radicals accused of
inciting riots, a Russian spy and, most notably, a widely despised
New Jersey cop-killer.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, however, Lowenstein took on a new, rambunctious batch
of clients: nearly 120 Los Angeles middle-school students.</LD>
<LD>   Under his charge, a charter school with a focus on social justice
opened in Koreatown. Lowenstein and a crew of activist-minded
teachers have pledged to turn students at the Los Angeles Leadership
Academy into critical thinkers and potential political leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to be the next Cesar Chavez or the next Martin Luther
King, there is no place to go," said Lowenstein, 59, who is executive
director of the school. "One of the real motivations for me to start
this school was to change that."</TE>
<TE>   Already, the campus has set itself apart.</TE>
<TE>   While many schools commemorated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by
listening to patriotic songs or making memorial banners, students at
the Leadership Academy instead learned about the oppression of Afghan
women under the Taliban and about Muslim Americans whose civil
liberties have been violated in the United States over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   As Columbus Day approaches, plans are underway to teach about
historical injustices against Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   And when a student got in trouble for stealing a visitor's purse
recently, a reformed ex-gang member was brought in to counsel the
student and to coax out a confession. Instead of expelling the
youngster, Lowenstein and the boy's family worked out a plan to
improve his behavior. The staff used the incident to discuss right
and wrong with students.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey-born attorney and father of two graduated from
Harvard Law School. He was on the defense team of the Chicago Seven,
political radicals accused of conspiring to incite the riots during
the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   He is best known for working more than 20 years without pay on one
case--handling the parole appeals of Thomas Trantino, who was
convicted of first-degree murder four decades ago for killing two
Lodi, N.J., police officers. The jury convicted Trantino and
sentenced him to the electric chair, but he later received a life
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Lowenstein left other law cases in 1990 and became a screenwriter
for television shows, including "L.A. Law," "Equal Justice" and "Silk
Stalkings." He remained on the Trantino case, becoming detested in
police circles. Lowenstein argued that Trantino had been made insane
by pills and alcohol and that an accomplice, who was later killed by
police, had fired the fatal shots. In January 2001, the state Supreme
Court ruled that there was no legal basis to hold Trantino any
longer.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Trantino was set free. Lowenstein, who calls Trantino
a "close friend," said the ex-convict is involved with a program that
helps re-integrate released criminals into society.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to work with kids who, without intervention, might become
the next Thomas Trantino," Lowenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The school spends most of its time focusing on reading and writing
and aligns its curriculum with state standards. Teachers also search
for ways to bring in alternate perspectives about the world. Some of
those perspectives might make conservatives shudder, but Lowenstein
insists he is not pushing any particular political agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools, although funded with public money, are freed from
most state and local regulations. Charters have a range of
philosophies, and Lowenstein's school may be one of the first to
focus on social justice, said Lance Izumi, director for the Center
for School Reform at the Pacific Research Institute, a San
Francisco-based organization that supports charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some people may disagree with Lowenstein's political views, but
parents are legally entitled to have their children attend a school
that teaches such ideas along with the basics.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long term, it will be important to see if the kids can
actually read, write and do math," Izumi said. The question about the
Leadership Academy is "whether this will be a school that educates,
or a propaganda camp."</TE>
<TE>   The Leadership Academy's charter was approved by the Los Angeles
Unified School District. School Board President Caprice Young said
Lowenstein has "a real vision and a passion for education."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea behind the Leadership Academy is that, if kids
take power in their lives and communities, it makes them much more
attached to their education."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, the new school is needed in a Koreatown
area that buses out 4,000 students each day. Leasing space in a
Wilshire Boulevard building owned by Emmanuel Presbyterian Church,
the school started with a sixth grade this fall and plans to add
seventh and eighth grades over the next two years. High school
classes may follow.</TE>
<TE>   To attract students, staff members passed out information to
parents at local bus stops. There was no problem in filling the
classes with an ethnically diverse student body.</TE>
<TE>   "The two middle schools in the area are just bursting," Lowenstein
said. "Most parents were just happy to have a safe environment, where
their kids won't get shot or stabbed."</TE>
<TE>   The eight teachers include college graduates with degrees from
Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, Berkeley and UCLA. One worked as a
grass-roots organizer for the Quaker nonviolent peace movement. One
has organized unions in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   Susanne Cole, the program director in charge of curriculum, who
received a master's degree in public policy from UC Berkeley,
previously spent time in Chiapas, Mexico, studying a school run by
the Zapatistas, an Indian-rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Cole said she wants the school's graduates to "become people who
feel inspired to make change in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast and lunch are cooked by mothers of children who attend
the school. A few work there full time and the rest volunteer. Meals
are required to be nutritious: fresh fruits, whole grains, low-fat
milk, salad bar offerings during every lunch, no refined sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Perla Melgar, a parent, works in the Leadership Academy as a cook.
It is important that her 11-year-old daughter, also named Perla,
thrives in school, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's better for her to be in a small group," she said.
"All the other schools are so overcrowded. She wants to learn more,
and I think this is the place she can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Every Friday, a staff member or a visitor talks about social
issues to a school assembly. A gang member named Chico Brown, a
friend of Lowenstein, recently told students about being shot and
going to prison.</TE>
<TE>   He has since turned his life around, but he stressed that the
students should not wait until it is too late. He encouraged them to
make the best experience out of the Leadership Academy.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger has big dreams for you guys," he said. "He's got big plans.
And I know it's going to work."</TE>

<HD>Pining for Bristlecone Clone Success</HD>
<DH>Forestry: Researchers want to preserve genetic material
from the world's oldest tree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nonprofit group that says it promotes forests by cloning America's
biggest and oldest trees arrived in eastern California Tuesday to
claim a crown jewel.</LD>
<LD>   In a stealth operation with the cooperation of the U.S. Forest
Service, the tree advocates ventured into California's White
Mountains to the home of Methuselah, a 4,768-year-old bristlecone
pine recognized as the oldest known living tree.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Michigan-based Champion Tree Project International
came to the secret location where the tree has grown since well
before recorded history. With a Forest Service manager looking on,
they plucked new growth, needles and cones off the gnarled tree. They
hope the samplings will provide enough genetic material to make it
possible to produce copies of Methuselah.</LD>
<TE>   David and Jared Milarch, the father and son team that operates the
Champion Tree Project, claim many benefits to cloning the nation's
biggest and often oldest trees--some can be planted in weakened
forests or used to replace sickly urban trees or saved for scientists
to help understand the longevity of some of Earth's oldest living
things.</TE>
<TE>   'Champion' Trees</TE>
<TE>   The group has arranged for the cloning and propagation of more
than 70 of the country's largest trees, known as "national champion
trees," which are granted the designation based on girth, height and
crown spread.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Jared Milarch and the group's executive director also
took samples from "the Patriarch," the largest bristlecone (although
much younger than Methuselah).</TE>
<TE>   Then, as though racing to deliver an organ to a transplant
patient, the pair loaded their take onto ice and high-tailed it to
Bishop to deliver the package to UC Davis for the cloning attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "The value is in preserving the genetics of those trees and
figuring out ... why they survived so long," said Jared Milarch, 24.</TE>
<TE>   Milarch and his father, 53, founded the Champion Tree Project in
1996. Fifth-generation shade-tree farmers, they knew that not all was
right with America's trees. The average lifespan of urban street
trees is about 7 years, and nearly all old-growth forests have been
logged.</TE>
<TE>   We should capture the genetic material from the hardiest
sentinels, they reasoned, before those trees are lost.</TE>
<TE>   "The trees we are using today aren't working," said David Milarch,
who was in Michigan during Tuesday's excursion. "A good place to
start looking are the oldest, largest trees we have."</TE>
<TE>   By saving samples of old and hardy trees, "we're trying to close
the barn door before the horses get out," Milarch said.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked on arid, inhospitable slopes, the oldest known bristlecone
pines are clustered in a corner of the Inyo National Forest. Growth
conditions there are so unique that the clones are not likely to be
used for planting new forests elsewhere. And the bristlecone's
twisted branches and stunted trunks make them commercially
undesirable.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, a successful cloning could open the door to research on
the role of genetics in the trees' longevity, said Larry Payne,
director of cooperative forestry for the U.S. Forest Service in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Preservation</TE>
<TE>   Even if the scientific gains from the cloning are limited, the
publicity from cloning the world's oldest tree--and, say, displaying
a cloned sapling at the National Arboretum--could be a powerful boost
to efforts to promote forests, Payne said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to draw people's attention to the trees and the
importance of the environment, it's good to have a tree of that
notoriety," said Payne, who helped organize the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Champion Tree Project hopes to clone champions of more than
800 U.S. tree species.</TE>
<TE>   The group has drawn attention with both ceremony and gimmick: A
sapling cloned from a 450-year-old champion red ash was among those
planted at a Sept. 11 Pentagon memorial. Last year, the "Today" show
broadcast the group as it picked pieces off poplars planted by George
Washington at Mount Vernon. The Milarchs pledged to return to plant
the clones.</TE>
<TE>   The group long had its eye on Methuselah. Featured in a 1958
National Geographic article, for years a plaque identified it for
visitors. But too many people picked at it and trampled its roots to
pose for photographs, so officials now take pains to keep its
location secret to prevent further damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Champion Tree Project hopes to produce an exact replica of
both the oldest and largest trees through cloning. As a backup, the
group will also germinate seeds from cones, which contain genetic
material of another parent. While Methuselah seeds have been
germinated, Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest manager John Louth said
he knows of no previous attempt at tissue cloning.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us think that this is really a long shot," because of the
age of the trees, said Louth, who led Tuesday's excursion.</TE>
<TE>   But the scientific challenge makes it worthwhile, said plant
pathologist Chris Friel, a UC Davis doctoral student who will attempt
the cloning.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to receive the package of cuttings today and will place
any bud tissue from the samples in a starchy medium with plant growth
hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Those bud cells--similar to human stem cells--theoretically could
differentiate into a range of parts, such as roots and branches,
making it possible to grow an entire plant.</TE>
<TE>   If Friel succeeds, the clones could be used for later research
that might not even be contemplated today.</TE>
<TE>   Just being able to clone such an old tree is "a really big step,"
Friel said. "It's almost like Walt Disney having himself frozen. I'm
not really sure what they have in mind."</TE>
<TE>   A Monterey tree propagator, Bill Werner, will attempt to clone the
trees from needle bundles, a method he has used on Monterey pines.</TE>
<TE>   Debate Over Longevity</TE>
<TE>   The value of cloning the large and old national champion trees is
a matter of debate. The Milarchs say the trees have endured
environmental hardships for generations. If genetics are the reason,
then replicas could prove just as hardy. But others say there could
be other explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning a national champion does not always mean that you're
going to grow a national champion," said Deborah Gangloff, executive
director of the nonprofit American Forests, which was formed in 1875
and began in 1940 to track national champion trees.</TE>
<TE>   The trees' stature could be due to "conditions in the environment:
how much sun, nutrients, water, the drainage, or being lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gangloff's group recognizes the appeal of old trees.
Consumers can purchase direct offspring, and in some cases clones, of
trees planted or enjoyed by Elvis Presley, Johnny Appleseed, Martin
Luther King Jr. and others from American Forests' "Historic Tree
Nursery." Most of these trees are propagated through traditional
grafting techniques, another way to produce exact genetic replicas.
The oldest bristlecone pines produce so little new growth each year
that the Champion Tree Project was not likely to have obtained enough
material to produce grafts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in the business longer than anybody and we're for
anybody who wants to do right by trees, get people interested in
trees and knowledgeable about trees," Gangloff said. "There are no
more important trees in the U.S. than the bristlecones."</TE>

<HD>Simon Retreats on Allegations of Illegal Fund-Raising by
Davis</HD>
<DH>Politics: Challenger says it's not his job to verify
whether photo was taken in state office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After accusing Gov. Gray Davis of illegal fund-raising, Republican
challenger Bill Simon Jr. was forced to back away from the allegation
Tuesday after release of a photograph that contradicted the charge.</LD>
<LD>   At a raucous news conference in North Hollywood, Simon initially
described the photo as proof that Davis had accepted a campaign
contribution in his state office when he was lieutenant governor.</LD>
<LD>   "Unlike people's recollections, photographs don't change, they
don't lie," Simon said, adding that wrongdoing by Davis has "been
proven now with the release of today's photograph."</LD>
<TE>   But the office pictured was not the one the GOP nominee said it
was.</TE>
<TE>   After questioning by reporters, Simon retreated from his
allegations of criminal wrongdoing. "Whether or not it's the
lieutenant governor's office, it may or may not be," Simon said.
"That can be determined. That's not my job to determine that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon raised the issue in Monday's debate with Davis, asking the
Democratic incumbent if he had ever accepted campaign donations in
his state office. Immediately afterward, Simon aides accused the
incumbent of violating state law by taking a check in 1998 in his
then state office. While the Davis campaign immediately denied the
accusation, Simon said there was evidence, and his campaign aides
promised to provide it Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   However, the photograph produced by the political group--the
California Organization of Police and Sheriffs--shows Davis posing
with a check inside an office considerably different from the one he
used as lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   The man shown handing Davis a $10,000 check--former organization
President Al Angele--also denied presenting the money to Davis in his
state office. He said he had never been in Davis' state office.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, Simon conceded his campaign had made no attempt
to verify where the photo was taken and suggested that the state Fair
Political Practices Commission could sort the matter out. "That's why
complaints get filed," Simon said. "In order to resolve the truth."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the organization's attorney sent a letter to the state
watchdog agency accusing Davis of wrongdoing. But he, too, appeared
to back away from that stance Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Sacramento attorney Tom Hiltachk said he has not
"accused the governor of anything" and "never said there was a
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Doubts about the veracity of the photo threatened to upend Simon's
troubled campaign less than four weeks before the election, at a time
the GOP hopeful is struggling to raise money and boost credibility
within his own skeptical party.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who made no public appearances Tuesday, had no comment on
the strange sequence of events.</TE>
<TE>   But his chief strategist, Garry South, delivered a blistering
denunciation of Simon, his campaign team and the California
Organization of Police and Sheriffs.</TE>
<TE>   He called the GOP nominee "a desperate candidate" and denounced
the police group as "a scummy organization that will perform any act
for the right amount of money"--referring to the money Simon's
campaign gave to the police group to secure a spot on its list of
endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   South said that Simon "owes the governor an apology. This man has
accused the governor of California of committing a crime without
evidence at all."</TE>
<TE>   Had the allegation been true, Davis technically would have
committed a misdemeanor by accepting the campaign check on state
property.</TE>
<TE>   The four-year time limit for prosecuting such a crime expired in
January, however.</TE>
<TE>   The accusation began unraveling within minutes of the photograph's
release at a Los Angeles news conference called by the police
organization's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the scene depicted in the photograph, the
lieutenant governor's office has dark wood paneling running from
floor to ceiling, a dark wooden door and a large, single-pane window.</TE>
<TE>   The room in the photograph has white painted walls and a large,
paned window.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Pacyna, a spokeswoman for Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, said
the office has not been remodeled in many years--at least not since
Davis left the office four years ago to become governor.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly identical police organization photos are stamped Jan.
31, 1998, when Davis was running for his first term as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis strategist South said the governor was not even in
Sacramento when the photos were taken, but was at an event with
then-Vice President Al Gore in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   But an attorney for the police organization said the group
"continues to believe that the photo depicts" Davis' office as
lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not the lieutenant governor's office, or some other state
office, where is it?" asked Hiltachk.</TE>
<TE>   None of the parties involved could answer that question Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   While the Tuesday brouhaha was damaging to the Simon campaign, it
also raised questions about the actions of an organization that has
long been courted by California politicians--chiefly because of its
acronym, COPS.</TE>
<TE>   The group, an affiliation of union organizations, has a membership
of roughly 5,000 police officers.</TE>
<TE>   However, rather than any law enforcement activities, it is best
known among political insiders for the aggressive fund-raising
practices surrounding its slate mailer program.</TE>
<TE>   Such mailers, which purport to be independent voter guides, are a
highly lucrative staple of California politics, familiar to voters
who have found one of the cardboard strips hanging from their
doorknob.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Davis has welcomed the organization's support.
Indeed, the organization endorsed Simon and Davis in their respective
March primaries.</TE>
<TE>   But relations between Davis and the group's leaders soured after
the organization tilted toward Simon in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   South said the group was upset that the Davis campaign did not buy
a slot on the group's mailer in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   He said that after being turned down, the organization's political
consultant, Kelley Moran, tried to sell the Davis campaign a spot on
a separate environmental slate that his firm produces.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the level of consistency and principle involved in these
things," South said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has contributed at least $225,000 to the organization,
according to records filed with the secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP nominee is set to appear on the group's slate mailers for
the Nov. 5 election, and members of the group are now providing
security for the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the money he gave to the organization, Simon also
donated $143,000 to Moran's consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Tuesday about his contributions to the group, Simon said he
did not believe his campaign had paid to appear on its slate mailer.
"Not to my knowledge," the GOP candidate said, referring questions to
his campaign consultant, Sal Russo.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, a spokesman for the Simon campaign, Mark Miner,
responded by saying he was not aware if Simon knew about the payments
to the organiza- tion.</TE>

<HD>2 School Bonds Get Donations</HD>
<DH>Election: Statewide and L.A. Unified measures raise $9
million, mostly from teachers, builders. Opposition is muted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two campaigns for school construction bonds--a $13-billion statewide
measure and a separate $3.3-billion proposal in Los Angeles--are
gathering strong financial support from teachers unions, developers,
nonprofit university foundations and even a Wal-Mart scion.</LD>
<LD>   Financial disclosure reports released this week show the two
measures together raised about $9 million as of Sept. 30 to spend on
advertising and mailings before the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents have not reported any funds to defeat the measures,
which would fund hundreds of new schools and modernization projects
to ease overcrowding. But bond backers still worry that a sluggish
economy, an uninspiring gubernatorial race and bids for San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood secession could jeopardize their passage.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles supporters also need to overcome voters' suspicions
that the local school district can not be trusted to handle big
construction projects such as the much-delayed Belmont Learning
Complex near downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the state bond, Proposition 47, contributed more
than $7.8 million as of last month, and the campaign for Measure K,
the bond for the Los Angeles Unified School District, reported
raising more than $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single donor so far has been the California Teachers
Assn., which gave $3.3 million to the state bond campaign. The
California Building Industry Assn., a group of housing developers,
contributed $1 million. Nonprofit foundations for Cal State and
University of California campuses gave more than $600,000 to help
pass Proposition 47, which would provide $1.6 billion for public
higher education and the rest for kindergarten through 12th-grade
facilities. Education activist John T. Walton, son of Wal-Mart
founder Sam Walton, contributed $100,000, the most of any individual.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest financial supporters of the Los Angeles bond effort
are billionaire magnate Eli Broad and Univision chief Jerry
Perenchio, who chipped in $200,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   In radio spots, mailings and print ads, the Los Angeles bond
campaign will stress the need for new campuses in a district in which
nearly half the students are on staggered, year-round calendars. In
addition, consultants are spreading a tightly scripted message that
the school district has reformed its building program under Supt. Roy
Romer and a new board majority.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide Field Poll and a survey by the Public Policy
Institute of California last month showed support for both measures
hovering several points above the minimums needed for
approval--Proposition 47 requires a simple majority and Measure K
must get 55% of the vote. If the Los Angeles school bond passes,
property owners within the district would pay about $60 per $100,000
of assessed property value annually over 30 years. The state bond
would be covered by the general fund over the same period, with
interest bringing its true cost to $26 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic and deep-pocketed contributors show support for
increased spending on California's educational facilities, and a
community of self-interest that is nearly as broad.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pass a $13-billion school construction program, obviously
the builders are going to be interested because it means business for
them," said Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn.
"The chambers of commerce see this as a stimulus for the economy and
more jobs. Teachers want to relieve school overcrowding and that sort
of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Home builders have a stake in the bonds because school districts
may levy higher fees on new housing construction if the bonds fail.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of school districts around California are awaiting $6
billion for backlogged construction projects, state officials said,
and many more proposals are eligible for consideration in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 47 would be the first of two parts--the state
Legislature already has placed a related $12-billion bond on the
April 2004 ballot. Los Angeles Unified would couple its share of the
state bond, which could exceed $1 billion, with the Measure K funds
to complete 120 new schools and 80 expansions. Those extra facilities
could end mandatory busing in some areas and return many students to
regular 180-day calendars, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If either the local or state measure fails, Los Angeles Unified
would have to seek other sources of money, such as developer fees or
loans. At worst, construction plans would be abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Organized opposition to the ballot measures has been muted.
Representatives of smaller school districts have opposed the state
measure because new State Allocation Board rules allow the most
overcrowded school districts--usually in urban areas--to jump to the
head of the funding line. "This whole thing is directed toward Los
Angeles," said state Sen. William J. "Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale), the
sole elected official to sign the ballot's opposition argument
against Proposition 47.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. argues that the
state's money woes are too dire and government agencies are too inept
to manage so much new debt.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents say they will not wage a formal anti-Proposition 47
campaign. "The special interests in favor of this are vastly more
powerful than the diffuse interests of taxpayers, no doubt about it,"
Coupal said. "I don't see any money being spent against it."</TE>
<TE>   Bond backers, besides worrying about the impact of the economy and
secession on voters, said demography also will be important in the
election. The most likely voters are the most unlikely to have
children in public schools. So the Los Angeles campaign will try to
mobilize families who rely on public schools, especially Latinos who
traditionally have low voter turnout rates.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the recent settlement on teacher salary raises and
benefits cleared the way for the 40,000-strong United Teachers-Los
Angeles to participate fully in the local bond campaign. Union
President John Perez said the group sent a $50,000 check to the
Measure K campaign on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The state and local campaigns have given key supporters booklets
with sample speeches in one-, five- and 10-minute versions. The
Proposition 47 campaign's speakers manual, for example, includes such
instructions as "Remember you are never invisible! Avoid shaking your
head, scowling or fidgeting in reaction to what your opponent is
saying."</TE>
<TE>   School district officials, teachers union activists and parent
leaders are using those to speak to the media, churches and civic
groups. In the next few weeks, phone banks will be manned by teachers
calling voters at home.</TE>
<TE>   Measure K's booklets stress that focus groups frequently
associated Los Angeles Unified with Belmont Learning Complex, a
$154-million high school that was abandoned in mid-construction in
1999 after toxic gases were discovered under the site. The school
district is studying whether the school could be safely completed for
an additional $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many Los Angeles residents were angered last year when school
district officials acknowledged $600 million worth of excessive
management costs and inefficiencies in a school repair plan funded by
Proposition BB, a $2.4-billion local bond passed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "California voters are very sophisticated and very cynical about
these things," said Dave Fogarty, deputy campaign manager for the
"Yes on 47" campaign. "They want to know what the measure is about,
why it's important to me and my family, and how can we be sure that
the money be spent where you say it will be spent."</TE>

<HD>Council Orders Audit of L.A. Film Agency</HD>
<DH>Government: Controller will hire an outside firm to see if
location-shoot overseer is fulfilling its city contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid concerns over possibly delinquent payments to the city by the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., the Los Angeles City
Council directed the city controller Tuesday to launch an audit of
the beleaguered agency's performance in expediting city film permits.</LD>
<LD>   Controller Laura Chick said Tuesday that she had already begun
preparing plans to hire an outside firm to conduct a performance
audit that will look at whether the agency is fulfilling its contract
with the city and whether the city has exercised proper oversight.
She decided to seek an independent review because she formerly served
on the EIDC board.</LD>
<LD>   "It is crystal clear that we need some very important questions
answered about the city's contractual relationship with the EIDC,"
Chick said. "We must know if the dollars are meeting the target and
if the city is the beneficiary of those dollars."</LD>
<TE>   In particular, Chick said, she has discovered from preliminary
reviews that the EIDC may be delinquent in paying "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" for city services such as providing
firefighters on film location shoots.</TE>
<TE>   EIDC officials blame the city for delays. The agency collects
money for the city for firefighting and other services used by crews
shooting movies, TV shows, commercials and the like. The services
range from the posting of "No Parking" signs to the use of streets
and parks as filming locations. But EIDC officials say city delays in
reconciling differences between what services were paid for and what
were actually used prevent them from making prompt payments to the
city and refunds to filmmakers who have overpaid.</TE>
<TE>   The council grilled City Administrative Officer William Fujioka on
Tuesday about the alleged delinquencies, but he asked for more time
to find out how much is owed to the city and whether the city is at
fault for delayed payments.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of a contract, the city allows the EIDC to retain
all film permit application fees to pay for staff and other expenses,
Chick said. The agency is also required to collect fees charged by
city departments for services to crews shooting on location and to
pass the money on to the departments, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fujioka said he had conducted two previous performance reviews of
the EIDC contract but that this audit will be much broader.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, a former film industry executive,
proposed that the council authorize funding of the audit to
supplement a financial review being done by county investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that is critically important about keeping
production in Los Angeles, restoring the confidence in this
organization and ensuring the way it's structured and the way we are
getting reimbursed is appropriate," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss said the goal of the audit should be a
reform plan that will allow the city to hold the EIDC accountable. He
said he is still not convinced that council members are legally
mandated to serve on the EIDC board. Many council members said they
were surprised to learn they are automatically board members and that
they have never attended board meetings.</TE>
<TE>   One of the issues the district attorney's office is examining is
whether funds collected by the EIDC are public money and thus should
not have been used to make political contributions to council members
and county supervisors on its board. County prosecutors are also
looking at large travel and dining bills charged to the account of
EIDC head Cody Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it is a public or private entity, which is still being
debated, none of that matters if the agency isn't operating
effectively and the funds are spent appropriately," Greuel said.</TE>

<LD>Los Padres National Forest, home to one of the nation's largest
collections of prehistoric artifacts, has ignored and damaged its
cultural treasures while retaliating against employees who have
complained, according to a report released Tuesday by a national
watchdog group representing whistle-blowers.</LD>
<LD>   In its 18-page report, Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility blames the alleged neglect on Los Padres supervisor
Jeanine Derby. It recommends a thorough investigation of Derby's
"hostility" to historic preservation and her "retaliation against
outspoken cultural resources personnel."</LD>
<LD>   Derby vigorously denied the accusations. However, she said they
would be investigated.</LD>
<TE>   "These things disappoint me because there are other avenues for
employees to take their complaints," she said, admitting the process
is slow and frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   Los Padres National Forest, encompassing 1.7 million acres from
Ventura County north through Big Sur, is the ancient home of the
Chumash, Salinan and Esselen Indian tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service volunteers and staff members are charged with
recording ancient sites so that firefighters, heavy equipment
operators and others using the forest can avoid the sites. They also
try to keep out looters looking to steal Indian artifacts and vandals
who deface rock paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Key historical areas are sometimes signed and fenced to keep the
public out. During construction projects, monitors are supposed to be
used to make sure no archeological materials are destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Derby professed a lifelong interest in ancient Native American
cultures and said she has always tried to quickly deal with mistakes
in Forest Service programs wherever they are discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We could use more money for the program," she said. "But we are
basically doing the best we can and hiring the most competent people
for the job."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Mathes, spokesman for the Pacific Southwest Region of the
U.S. Forest Service, which oversees Los Padres, said the report is
being reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "At the regional office we are confident that Los Padres National
Forest will work through these controversies," he said. "Jeanine is a
fine forest supervisor and she has a challenging job. These forests
are often over 1 million acres and people care passionately about
what happens there."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Padres is also dealing with sexual harassment
complaints lodged last month against members of an elite forest
firefighting crew.</TE>
<TE>   Top managers were accused of ignoring the allegations and
retaliating against those who complained.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's complaints were leveled by former staff members and
volunteers, some of whom remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The report, titled "Ruined Relics," was written by Stephen Horn, a
former Forest Service archeologist who resigned last year.</TE>

<LD>Los Padres National Forest, home to one of the nation's largest

cultural treasures while retaliating against employees who have
complained, according to a report released Tuesday by a national

<LD>   In its 18-page report, Public Employees for Environmental

"hostility" to historic preservation and her "retaliation against

<TE>   "These things disappoint me because there are other avenues for

<TE>   Los Padres National Forest, encompassing 1.7 million acres from

<TE>   Forest Service volunteers and staff members are charged with

<TE>   Key historical areas are sometimes signed and fenced to keep the

<TE>   Derby professed a lifelong interest in ancient Native American

<TE>   "We could use more money for the program," she said. "But we are
basically doing the best we can and hiring the most competent people
for the job."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Mathes, spokesman for the Pacific Southwest Region of the
U.S. Forest Service, which oversees Los Padres, said the report is
being reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "At the regional office we are confident that Los Padres National
Forest will work through these controversies," he said. "Jeanine is a
fine forest supervisor and she has a challenging job. These forests
are often over 1 million acres and people care passionately about
what happens there."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Padres is also dealing with sexual harassment
complaints lodged last month against members of an elite forest
firefighting crew.</TE>
<TE>   Top managers were accused of ignoring the allegations and
retaliating against those who complained.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's complaints were levied by former staff members and
volunteers, some of whom remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The report, titled "Ruined Relics," was written by Stephen Horn, a
former Forest Service archeologist who resigned last year. It warns
that unless something changes "these sites may well be lost to the
world forever, along with the information they hold."</TE>
<TE>   According to Horn, Los Padres contains one of the world's richest
collections of abstract, prehistoric paintings along with artifacts
dating back 6,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   But the report contends these resources are being damaged and
destroyed by bureaucratic mismanagement. Rock art has been defaced,
fossils and artifacts bulldozed and qualified archeologists replaced
with less experienced ones.</TE>
<TE>   Forest managers, the report states, are far more interested in
accommodating recreational users and farmers' grazing livestock than
in protecting history.</TE>
<TE>   Livestock can damage surface archeological sites as well as wall
paintings by rubbing up against them, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   During last June's Wolf fire, which burned 23,000 acres north of
Ojai, bulldozers and fire lines badly damaged known prehistoric
sites, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   "In each case fire control personnel and the lead archeologist
assigned to the fire failed to take even the most basic measures to
avoid permanent harm," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   An ancient rock painting of condors, bears and stars could have
been saved from smoke damage if it had been covered before fire
reached it, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the report said a network of off-road vehicle trails in
San Luis Obispo County is affecting 30 prehistoric and historic
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Horn, 57, said when he worked in Los Padres there were clear
tensions between cultural programs and forest managers.</TE>
<TE>   "Cultural resources are a barrier to getting projects done," he
said. "They cost too much; the laws are too powerful. The smooth
delivery of goods and services is inhibited."</TE>
<TE>   When it was easy to protect an ancient site the Forest Service was
amenable but when it entailed fencing off existing areas or altering
a trail or road, it became difficult, Horn said. "Archeological sites
are nonrenewable resources," he said. "When they are gone, they are
gone."</TE>
<TE>   Horn, who worked in the Santa Barbara headquarters, said he
complained five times to top Forest Service officials but all he got
was a reputation as a troublemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Horn said he soon found himself in a job heavily monitored by his
bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Horn eventually quit for another government position that he
declined to disclose.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Schambach, director of the California chapter of Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, headquartered in
Washington, D.C., said she was approached by former Forest Service
employees months ago to compile the report. "After questioning them
we decided to review their charges," she said. "They provided us with
information and it all had to be corroborated."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service said in the interest of fairness and "good land
management" it will ask the state office of historic preservation to
review an allegation in the report that said artifacts were exposed
and damaged while building a Forest Service road.</TE>
<TE>   "The project was stopped immediately after discovering the
prehistoric site and the road was moved," Los Padres spokeswoman
Kathy Good said.</TE>
<TE>   The report concludes with a series of recommendations, which
include investigating the supervisor and the cultural heritage
program. It also advocates a non-retaliation policy against employees
who identify wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very astute to watch for negative reaction against employees
[who lodge complaints]," Derby said. "But on the other hand, people
do reap what they sow."</TE>

whipping in the 10400 block of Slater Avenue, said Fountain Valley
Police Sgt. Kim Brown. The victim was taken to Fountain Valley

said. Anthony Rios, 31, of Yorba Linda, was arrested two days later
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and burglary, Brown
said.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's raid was carried out by several law enforcement agencies
from Orange and Los Angeles counties. The three arrests were for

<HD>Laws Aimed at Homeless Approved</HD>
<DH>Poverty: Santa Monica council OKs ordinances to restrict
free outdoor meals and prohibit staying in doorways overnight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica, a city known for its compassion toward homeless people
but long troubled by the problems they bring, passed two
controversial laws Tuesday night aimed at limiting their presence.</LD>
<LD>   "The public is scared and tired and just generally want it
stopped," Councilman Herb Katz said.</LD>
<LD>   The first ordinance, passed by a 5-2 vote after emotional debate
among council members, seeks to limit free outdoor meals by requiring
groups serving 150 or more people to adhere to community event laws
and county health standards. The second ordinance, passed
unanimously, makes it illegal to sit or lie in doorways downtown or
along Main Street between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. if the business owner
posts a sign to that effect.</LD>
<TE>   The area affected by the second ordinance will be defined by the
city staff.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica has long embraced liberal policies to help the needy.
As many as 30 charity groups have migrated to the seaside community
to serve free meals, primarily at three downtown-area parks,
Palisades, Memorial and Reed, attracting as many as 300 homeless at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   But pressure has been building to rethink the policy, as business
owners, residents and tourists increasingly have complained about
homeless people panhandling, congregating in parks and urinating in
public.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the City Council postponed its vote on the proposed
ordinances after hearing nearly four hours of testimony from more
than 130 people, many of them homeless. The testimony ran until
nearly 1 a.m., when the council decided to return in two weeks to
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless activists said Tuesday afternoon that they suspected the
voting would not go their way on the free-food measure. Nor were they
optimistic about the other proposal, known as the doorway ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates held a prayer vigil in front of Santa Monica City Hall
before the council meeting began, lamenting the prospect that the
council would soon "criminalize charity." One homeless activist
carried a sign reading "Welcome to Skid Row Monica."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael Feinstein spoke vehemently against the proposal to
limit free meals. He invoked the notion of karma, saying: "While we
take more of the burden [of caring for homeless people], we should
remember that this city made the conscious decision in the 1980s to
become more cosmopolitan.... We make a lot of money here.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't support using the wrong tools to achieve what we need,"
Feinstein added.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Kevin McKeown joined Feinstein in opposing that
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Although the ordinances were introduced to the council by city
staff, they sprang from a committee organized by Bayside District
Corp., a city-funded group that manages the downtown area.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot forget the fact that residents have listed this as
their No. 1 concern for the last three years," said Kathleen Rawson,
Bayside's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The organization says it is not trying to rid the city of homeless
people but to encourage them to hook up with city-funded social
services, from showers and lockers to job training or treatment for
mental disorders and substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of seeking services, Rawson said, people come to Santa
Monica simply for the free food, which a variety of groups serve in
Palisades and other parks. Many of the food providers are church
groups from outside Santa Monica, including Manhattan Beach,
Westchester and West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation is that many of the groups will not go to the
trouble of securing the required permits to serve their brown bag
meals to large groups. But Feinstein said he expects groups to get
around the new rules by offering food to smaller numbers. He said he
also anticipates a court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein and other council members noted that the city's social
service agencies do not have the space or funding to accommodate all
of the homeless people who gravitate to Santa Monica. The city, with
a population of 88,000, estimates that on any given day 1,000
transients take to its streets and shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Not all merchants will object to letting the homeless roost
overnight, one council member predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who probably don't mind," said Ken Genser, who
has served on the council for 14 years. Still, he said, "I recognize
there are indeed problems, such as people acting in inappropriate
ways or defecating."Whether Santa Monica will have enough police
officers to enforce the ordinances, and to what extent the city will
prosecute offenders, remain issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is enforcement," said John Maceri, executive
director of the Ocean Park Community Center, which provides
transitional housing for homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Moira LaMountain, an activist for the homeless, said she's
confident that something good will come of the city's grappling with
the problem. .</TE>
<TE>   "When it's all said and done, the laws will be overturned for
unconstitutionality," she said. "The city will be forced to come to
grips with the issues." Perhaps, she said, Santa Monica will invest
in a soup kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The vote to limit free meals in the parks does not signal that the
city is becoming less compassionate, said Councilman Richard Bloom,
who was one of the first to back the measures.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do hope this leads to a better day where we are working
together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the measures passed, council members began contemplating
whether the city might open more all-night bathrooms. Previously, the
city has been forced to close many facilities because it could not
afford to maintain them around the clock.</TE>

<HD>Inmates to Be Paid for Extra Time in Jail</HD>
<DH>Rights: Ventura County officials agree to settle for nearly
$256,000 in a lawsuit brought by 81 people rearrested by Sheriff's
Department while in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County will pay $255,600 to settle a federal class-action
lawsuit filed by dozens of jail inmates who contend that authorities
violated their legal rights by keeping them in custody for days
without filing criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers and administrators for the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department confirmed the settlement Tuesday after emerging from a
closed meeting in which the county Board of Supervisors authorized
the payment.</LD>
<LD>   "I think from the county's perspective that the settlement was
very good," Oxnard attorney Philip Erickson said. "We limited the
damages, and we especially limited the attorney fees."</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, which still must be approved in federal
court, 81 former inmates will be paid between $100 and $1,250 for
each extra day spent in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates who were never charged with a crime will receive more
money than those who were charged, convicted and given credit for
time served. The most any one inmate will be paid is $7,500, Erickson
said.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that suspects be arraigned on criminal charges
or released within 48 hours of arrest. But for years, Ventura County
law enforcement officers have rearrested suspects while they were
still in custody, giving prosecutors more time to gather evidence to
support charges.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many suspects who were never convicted of the crimes
for which they were arrested were held for extra days.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Ken Kipp, who oversees detention services for the
Sheriff's Department, said that the practice of rearresting inmates
was abandoned after concerns were raised nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't try to fight it," Kipp said. "We sat down and said,
'We've got to fix this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorney John Burton of Pasadena said he was pleased
with the "constructive and positive attitude" county officials took
in solving the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We sometimes don't see that from government entities and police
departments, and we certainly saw it here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kipp called the settlement fair and reasonable. Both he and
Erickson said the county could have faced a much steeper legal bill
if settlement negotiations had dragged on or the case had gone to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed to
pay $27 million to settle five class-action lawsuits brought by
inmates held in jail after courts ordered them released. The lawsuit
involved about 400,000 detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Although in-custody arrests in Ventura County affected far more
inmates than the 81 involved in the federal lawsuit, many were
excluded by statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Those named in the lawsuit were affected in the year before
February 2001, when Burton filed a legal claim.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement marks the second time the county has resolved a
federal lawsuit involving improper in-custody arrests.</TE>

<HD>Inmates to Be Paid for Extra Jail Time</HD>
<DH>Rights: Ventura County officials agree to settle for nearly
$256,000 in a lawsuit brought by 81 people rearrested by Sheriff's
Department while in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County will pay $255,600 to settle a federal class-action
lawsuit filed by dozens of jail inmates who contend that authorities
violated their legal rights by keeping them in custody for days
without filing criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers and administrators for the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department confirmed the settlement Tuesday after emerging from a
closed meeting in which the county Board of Supervisors authorized
the payment.</LD>
<LD>   "I think from the county's perspective that the settlement was
very good," Oxnard attorney Philip Erickson said. "We limited the
damages and we especially limited the attorney fees."</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a federal
judge, 81 former inmates will be paid between $100 and $1,250 for
each extra day spent in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates who were never charged with a crime will receive more
money than those who were charged, convicted and given credit for
time served. The most any one inmate will be paid is $7,500, Erickson
said.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires that suspects be arraigned on criminal charges
or released within 48 hours of arrest.</TE>
<TE>   But for years, Ventura County law enforcement officers have
rearrested suspects while they were still in custody, giving
prosecutors more time to gather evidence to support charges.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many suspects who were never convicted of the crimes
for which they were arrested were held for extra days.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Ken Kipp, who oversees detention services for the
Sheriff's Department, said that the practice of rearresting inmates
was abandoned after concerns were raised nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't try to fight it," Kipp said. "We sat down and said,
'We've got to fix this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorney John Burton of Pasadena said he was pleased
with the "constructive and positive attitude" county officials took
in solving the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We sometimes don't see that from government entities and police
departments, and we certainly saw it here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kipp called the settlement fair and reasonable. Both he and
Erickson said the county could have faced a much steeper legal bill
if settlement negotiations had dragged on or the case had gone to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed to
pay $27 million to settle five class-action lawsuits brought by
inmates held in jail after courts ordered them released. The lawsuit
involved about 400,000 detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Although in-custody arrests in Ventura County affected far more
inmates than the 81 involved in the federal lawsuit, many were
excluded by statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Those named in the lawsuit were affected in the year before
February 2001, when Burton filed a legal claim.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement marks the second time the county has resolved a
federal lawsuit involving improper in-custody arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Sheriff's Department paid $125,000 to
Westlake Village businessman Lee Mannheimer, who was jailed for
several days in September 1999 on suspicion of trying to kill his
ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   He was never charged with the crime and sued the county for false
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department stopped rearresting uncharged inmates in
December 2000, after Public Defender Kenneth Clayman filed a legal
challenge on behalf of Jorge Robert Juarez.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested on suspicion of burglary and rearrested 47 hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit, spent 105 hours
in jail without going before a judge. He later was convicted of
burglary.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Clayman declined to comment on the federal lawsuit.
But he applauded the Sheriff's Department for ending its rearrest
practice after civil rights issues were raised.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we were concerned, we had a problem that we discovered
and they did the appropriate action to correct it," Clayman said.</TE>

<HD>Zvi Kolitz, 89; Produced Israel's First Film, Wrote
Fictional Holocaust Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zvi Kolitz, eclectic Jewish writer and producer who penned a
fictional personal account of the Holocaust so moving that it was
accepted as fact for many years, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Kolitz died Sept. 29 of causes associated with aging in Manhattan,
where he wrote a column for the Yiddish newspaper Algemeiner Journal
for the last 32 years.</LD>
<LD>   He was the co-writer and co-producer of Israel's first film, "Hill
24 Doesn't Answer," in 1955, which won an award at the Cannes Film
Festival. He also was co-producer of the Broadway play "The Deputy"
in 1964 and the Broadway shows "The Megilla of Itzik Manger" and "I'm
Solomon" in 1968.</LD>
<TE>   Kolitz was best known for a short story he wrote in 1946 for a
Jewish newspaper in Buenos Aires titled "Yosl Rakover Talks to God."
Based in Warsaw, the story's doomed title character challenges God in
a final conversation about the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   For some two decades, the little story was considered an authentic
first-person account by a Holocaust victim dated April 28, 1943,
presumably found in a bottle in the charred ruins of the Warsaw
ghetto. It was reprinted anonymously in numerous anthologies of
Holocaust literature and even as a meditation in Jewish prayer books.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Alytus, Lithuania, Kolitz was never in Warsaw. After
studying at Yeshiva of Slobodka, the scion of a rabbinical family
fled to Italy in 1936 where he attended the University of Florence
and the Naval Academy at Civitavecchia. In 1940, he moved on to
Palestine where he spent adventurous years as a prisoner of the
British, a soldier in the British Army, an official emissary for the
World Zionist Congress and an unofficial recruiter and participant in
the Irgun, the radical Jewish underground.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, he found himself in Argentina making speeches
and was asked to write an article for the newspaper's special Yom
Kippur edition. Although translated into many languages and
republished over the years, "Yosl" wasn't printed again with Kolitz's
name attached to it until 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Holli G. Levitsky, Loyola Marymount University professor and
expert on Holocaust literature, wrote for The Times' religion section
in 1999 that accepting Kolitz's fictional account as fact was
understandable. "As truth," she wrote, "the story starkly presents
the quarrel at the heart of post-Holocaust spirituality: Did the God
of Israel abandon his people?"</TE>
<TE>   Kolitz is survived by his wife of 50 years, Mathilde; three
children; a brother and a sister; eight grandchildren; and five
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Cleanup in Irvine, by Order of the Court</HD>
<DH>Environment: Over the owner's protests, the D.A.'s office
brings in a crew to protect water from gas station leaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under police guard, a construction crew on Tuesday began a project
aimed at removing pollutants from under an Irvine gas station despite
protests from the business owner.</LD>
<LD>   County prosecutors took the unusual step of getting a court order
to perform the work, saying leaking underground gas tanks were
threatening the local water supply. It's the latest step in a
crackdown on environmental pollution by a special unit of the
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The owner of Alfie's Place, a busy service station, car wash and
lube shop, has been fighting for several years with the former owner,
Unocal, over the placement of equipment needed to clean up
underground pollutants. Unocal agreed in 1995 to clean up pollutants
that leaked from its underground tanks before it sold the station.</LD>
<TE>   The owner, Joel Burnstine, said he was shocked Tuesday morning
when a police officer, district attorney investigator and
construction crews entered his property to begin the cleanup.
Burnstine went to court Tuesday to stop the work, but a judge
declined to issue a restraining order.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in with heavy equipment, bulldozers and jackhammers and
tore up the property," Burnstine said. "John Q. Customer doesn't go
to properties that are contaminated. People will think we did it. And
the truth is we didn't have anything to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   All sides agree that the contamination needs to be removed, but
Burnstine fears Unocal's plans to install equipment at the front of
the property will hurt his business. He favors a location at the
south side of his station, near Culver and Michelson drives.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a location on the property where the equipment could be
placed, and it would impact no one," Burnstine said. "But it would be
more expensive for Unocal."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County district attorney officials entered the dispute in
May, obtaining a court order that allowed Unocal officials to begin
cleanup efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Nicholas Thompson said he sought the court
order after Burnstine removed some equipment Unocal had previously
installed and then fought Unocal's efforts to renew cleanup efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was evident to me over a five-year period that nothing was
going to change," Thompson said. "The property owner was unable to
resolve this. He was putting his own interests over the protection of
the public."</TE>
<TE>   Burnstine said he was disturbed that Orange County prosecutors
entered what he deems a private dispute and obtained the order
without allowing him to present his side to the judge.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is, why did they do this in secret?" Burnstine
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine gas station is one of hundreds of sites in California
that were contaminated by gasoline that leaked from underground
storage tanks. The gasoline additive MTBE has contaminated many of
those sites, including the Irvine property, and threatened to
contaminate underground water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said tests have shown that MTBE slowly seeping under the
Alfie's Place property poses a potential threat to a "major
drinking-water aquifer" a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   He argued in court Tuesday that the cleanup efforts should
continue.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Derek W. Hunt declined Tuesday to issue a
temporary restraining order, but scheduled a Friday hearing to
reconsider the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's environmental crimes unit has been
expanded by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. Its targets include
multinational corporations that threaten local drinking water
supplies and the city of Huntington Beach, which pleaded guilty to
pollution charges.</TE>

<HD>Ballot Measures Give Voters a Say Over Development, Taxes,
Schools</HD>
<DH>Election: The hottest of 31 issues, a Home Depot and
upscale housing, are in San Juan Capistrano. An Irvine tax could be
repealed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Buena Park, voters are being asked to kick in for a new police
station. In Fullerton, residents are deciding whether they want their
city clerk to be elected or appointed. In Irvine, voters are
considering whether to repeal a business utility tax.</LD>
<LD>   But those measures, and the assortment of others to be decided in
the Nov. 5 election--31 city, county and school measures will appear
on various ballots--seem mundane compared with the heat generated in
San Juan Capistrano over two long-running development issues.</LD>
<LD>   The first measure lets voters decide whether they want an upscale
housing development and an accompanying high school built in the
foothills on the east side of town. In the second, voters would
advise the city whether to sell 13 acres of undeveloped land to the
Home Depot Corp., a deal that would net the city $9 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Both measures are really asking people what kind of city do they
want San Juan to be," Assistant City Manager Julia Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time San Juan Capistrano residents were asked to
determine what the town should look like was in 1990, when voters
trooped to the polls in huge numbers and surprised political experts:
They agreed by a 71% majority to tax themselves to buy farmland to
help preserve the city's rural flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Adler, a Long Beach-based political consultant working for
a group that supported selling some of the town's raw land to Home
Depot, said he believes San Juan's voters could show up in large
numbers again.</TE>
<TE>   "Our polls show there is a large awareness of the issue, but I
don't know if that's enough to drive turnout in a year where voters
are turned off by the governor's race and the assembly and senate
races."</TE>
<TE>   Both San Juan Capistrano measures ask similar questions: Do we
protect our small-town charm and our unique way of life, or do we
want more development and a bigger tax base?</TE>
<TE>   To some, like Councilman David M. Swerdlin, the measures don't
necessarily pit developers against preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlin supports Whispering Hills, a 175-home upscale housing
tract, and San Juan Hills, which would be the city's first public
high school in more than 40 years. But he is opposed to Home Depot,
which the council placed on the ballot as an advisory vote.</TE>
<TE>   "With Home Depot, I made the decision that a small-town lifestyle
is a higher priority than a high tax base. That's what distinguishes
this town from other communities," Swerdlin said. "I think Whispering
Hills strengthens our community and prepares us for the future. The
district's high schools are vastly overcrowded now. And our history
favors a good education."</TE>
<TE>   In Buena Park, the police station debate is attracting far less
attention. Voters are being asked to help pay for construction of a
50,000-square-foot police headquarters through a tax that would cost
roughly $19 a year for a single-family parcel through 2033. The
measure must be approved by two-thirds of the voters. The city's
existing police station was built in 1962, and city officials say it
is cramped and outdated.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, City Council candidate Linda Lee Grau gathered enough
signatures to force a vote that would repeal a 15-year-old business
utility tax that generates $3.7 million for a variety of city
services. "It's a big bite for us if it doesn't pass," Irvine City
Clerk Jeri Stately said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to end the tax, which is capped at $5,000 a year
for each business, say it hits small companies too hard and that the
city is obsessed with retaining its image as a well-groomed city.</TE>
<TE>   In Fullerton, voters will be deciding whether voters or the City
Council should select the city clerk. The clerk is now elected.</TE>
<TE>   The election was prompted by the retirement of longtime City Clerk
Audrey Culver. Council members said that when they tried to find
someone to complete Culver's unfinished term, they were unable to
find a qualified candidate who lived in the city and was registered
to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Palmer, a city spokeswoman, said the council decided it
would rather conduct a detailed search for someone with professional
experience, a hunt that might take them outside the city limits. The
idea of taking that decision out of the voters' hands, however, is
meeting resistance.</TE>
<TE>   In Garden Grove, voters are considering whether to raise the
city's hotel bed tax to 13% from 10%. Community leaders who favor the
measure say the additional revenue would provide badly needed funds
for police, fire and other city services. Opponents argue that the
bed tax for nonresidents has already been raised twice and that the
10% tax is already higher than in most neighboring cities.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities are considering a host of housecleaning initiatives,
including restricting RV parking in residential neighborhoods in
Fountain Valley, updating city charters in Cypress, Placentia and
Seal Beach, and reauthorizing utility taxes in Los Alamitos.</TE>

<HD>Visit by Tibetan Monks Provides Om Schooling to Students in
Ojai</HD>
<DH>Education: The Buddhists, who are on a peace tour, perform
dances and answer questions at the private Oak Grove campus.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rumor started to spread among students at Oak Grove School on
Monday: Monks from Tibet were coming to the Ojai campus.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in math class Tuesday morning, 10th-grader Caitlin
Praetorius saw them, with their familiar shaved heads and
gold-and-burgundy robes, getting out of the van they use to travel
around the country.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, 'Wow, cool,' " said the 15-year-old.</LD>
<TE>   That was the general reaction among students at the private
school, who spent the morning watching eight Tibetan monks perform
folkloric dances, engage in spiritual debates and create a colorful
sand mandala meant to further compassion, peace and harmony in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot about monks, so it was pretty cool to see them,"
said fifth-grader Ezra Kopf, 10. "They seem like normal people. They
just have different interests."</TE>
<TE>   On their fifth annual tour for world peace and universal
compassion, the monks from the Gaden Jangtse Tsawa Khangsten
monastery in south-central India have visited dozens of schools,
universities, churches, prisons and private homes across North
America spreading a message of peace. The tour will end in New
Hampshire in February.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to share our experiences and what we learn from
Buddhist compassion," said Penpa Gyaltsen, the group's translator.
"We also share the method by which we receive inner happiness, which
the Tibetan culture is in danger of losing."</TE>
<TE>   China's invasion of Tibet in 1959--which was followed by the
destruction of most of Tibet's Buddhist temples and the confiscation
of many of the culture's most treasured artifacts-- prompted a mass
exodus of Tibetans fleeing persecution and seeking sanctuary in
India.</TE>
<TE>   The monks' tour is an effort to garner understanding of their
plight and raise funds to help rebuild the Gaden monastery in India.
The original Gaden structure, now destroyed, was once the
second-largest monastery in Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   "For them, this is one small step on the road to a more
compassionate world," said Gary Garcia, a volunteer who helps the
monks travel across the country. "With the young people, they believe
they are planting a seed for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said that when he heard the monks were visiting Southern
California, he knew they should come to Oak Grove, one of nine
campuses established throughout the world by the late spiritual
leader Jiddu Krishnamurti.</TE>
<TE>   The 150-acre Lomita Avenue campus, with its rolling hills, oak
groves and post-and-beam architecture, provided the perfect venue for
the monks' rituals, Garcia said. The monks said that the school's
octagonal pavilion seemed as though it were built for creation of the
mandala.</TE>
<TE>   "There is energy that we feel here," Gyaltsen said.</TE>
<TE>   The school's approach--emphasizing the importance of human
relationships as much as academics--lends itself to visits by people
from all walks of life, who come to interact with the children, said
program director Peter Thielke.</TE>
<TE>   That is why, after the morning ceremony of chanting and dancing,
the monks spent an hour answering questions from the students. They
didn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have electricity?" one asked. "Do you have TV?" another
wanted to know. "Do you have skateboards?" (Yes, no and no.)</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Lorenzo, 10, had more serious inquiries: "How does this
meditation thing work?" and "Does everyone get reincarnated or just
the Dalai Lama?" Meditation clears the mind and frees the body,
Anthony was told, and everyone can be reincarnated.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Laura Whitney, who has a daughter and a son at the school,
called the monks' visit a gift to the students.</TE>
<TE>   "Here they can experience what it means to be peaceful--that it
starts with the individual," she said. "The monks are a living
example of that."</TE>

<HD>MWD Cancels Desert Storage Project</HD>
<DH>Board: The complex plan to keep Colorado River water
underground is seen as risky, opposed by environmentalists. The vote
is a blow for Davis backer and his Cadiz Inc.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Water District Tuesday canceled the controversial
Cadiz program, a multimillion-dollar project to store water under the
desert that was once seen as a key to Southern California's water
supply future but had become an environmental and political lightning
rod.</LD>
<LD>   The narrow vote by the district's Board of Directors provoked a
brief round of applause from a boardroom audience that was heavily
populated by environmentalists and public-interest activists who had
made the proposal a statewide issue.</LD>
<LD>   "It's great when a public agency actually does the right thing and
turns down a project like this that would have been very unsound,"
said Simeon Herskovits, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law
Center. The Taos, N.M., organization represents a coalition of
environmental groups opposed to the project.</LD>
<TE>   Also in the audience was the project's main sponsor, Keith
Brackpool, a leading financial backer of Gov. Gray Davis and an
advisor to the governor on statewide water issues.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool's company, Santa Monica-based Cadiz Inc., stood to earn
$500 million to $1 billion in revenue over the 50-year term of the
project, but now faces a doubtful future.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote represents a personal embarrassment for Brackpool,
a British-born investment professional who made his public reputation
in California by proselytizing about the need for new approaches to
the state's water supply crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who received more than $235,000 in campaign contributions
from Brackpool and the money-losing Cadiz, placed Brackpool and other
Cadiz officials on statewide advisory panels on natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   In one last personal appeal Tuesday, Brackpool strove to assure
the board that the numerous lingering environmental and economic
questions about the project could be successfully addressed.</TE>
<TE>   He reminded the board that the federal government had given its
final environmental approval to the project Aug. 29, after five years
of costly environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we really want to throw the baby out with the bathwater less
than 60 days after we received all those federal approvals?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   But responses from several board members suggested that they had
become weary of debating a project about which too many environmental
questions remained unresolved, along with new questions about the
practicality of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cadiz program doesn't represent reliability at this point,"
said Timothy Brick, a board member representing the city of Pasadena.
"It represents risk."</TE>
<TE>   The innovative and complex project envisioned storing up to
1.5-million acre-feet of surplus Colorado River water in an aquifer
under a Mojave Desert tract owned by Cadiz for extraction in dry
years.</TE>
<TE>   The company also stood to earn a profit by selling the MWD as much
as 1.5 million acre-feet of indigenous ground water already flowing
through the aquifer. The MWD and Cadiz were to share the $150-million
capital cost, most of it devoted to construction of a 35-mile
pipeline between the MWD's Colorado River aqueduct and the Mojave
site.</TE>
<TE>   Critics had argued that ground water extraction on the anticipated
scale threatened permanent damage to the fragile desert ecosystem.
Although the Interior Department ruled in August that a proposed
network of testing wells around the site would deliver adequate
warning of impending damage, few environmentalists agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the strongest critics was Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
who said she feared that the project would threaten the nearby Mojave
National Preserve and who asked the MWD to reject the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the district's enthusiasm for the project had ebbed
markedly since it was first presented to the district in 1997. At
that time, the MWD was just beginning to grapple with the
implications of a looming cutback in the water it received from the
Colorado River. Any program to husband the Colorado resources seemed
promising.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, however, a severe drought on the Colorado
has sharply reduced the district's expectations of the surplus it
will receive over the next 12 to 15 years, making it uncertain
whether there will be enough water to store at Cadiz to justify the
project's expense. Continuing environmental opposition could also
have slashed the volume of ground water that could have been
extracted from the site.</TE>
<TE>   The deteriorating financial condition of Cadiz, meanwhile,
undermined its suitability as a business partner with the district.</TE>
<TE>   "At a minimum, it is simply not timely for us to be making a
decision to proceed with this project," MWD Chief Executive Ronald R.
Gastelum told the board before its vote.</TE>
<TE>   The motion to cancel the program passed with 50.25% of the board's
weighted votes in favor, a razor-thin margin over the 50% needed,
with the largest bloc coming from Los Angeles County board members.
Cast in opposition were 44.22% of the votes, including votes from San
Diego and Orange County members. The balance of the votes were held
by board members not in attendance. Under the MWD system, the 37
board members are entitled to weighted votes based on the size and
valuation of the 26 local and municipal water districts they
represent.</TE>
<TE>   The motion prevailed over a single alternative: a plan, favored by
Gastelum and the district's professional staff, to defer approval of
the project indefinitely. That vote failed 47.11% to 47.36%.</TE>

<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District board of trustees voted 5 to 0
Tuesday to reject a contaminated parcel of land at the former Tustin
Marine base and take a $22-million cash payment instead.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-acre parcel at the intersection of Red Hill and Warner
avenues, originally intended for a combined elementary and middle
school, was offered by Tustin as part of a settlement reached in May
to conclude years of legal battles over the closed helicopter base
and its reuse.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, environmental consultants hired by the school district
found unacceptably high levels of carcinogens and other dangerous
chemicals in soil samples collected at the site.</LD>
<TE>   The money, which could potentially rise to $44 million if the
state matches the funds, will be used to buy land elsewhere in the
district.</TE>

<HD>Man, 70, Is First O.C. Victim of West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH>Health: He had traveled to Nebraska. His doctor says media
focus has created 'undue hysteria.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 70-year-old man who had traveled to Nebraska was identified Tuesday
as Orange County's first probable victim of the West Nile virus,
while health officials in Los Angeles County remain baffled about how
a 31-year-old woman there acquired what appears to be California's
only home-grown case of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Both have recovered.</LD>
<LD>   "People can't be scared of this thing," said James McGuy, a
Newport Beach financial planner who believes that he contracted the
virus from a mosquito bite at an outdoor family reunion in Central
City, Neb. "When you get it, there's nothing you can do but lie down,
let them take your blood and drink lots of water."</LD>
<TE>   The doctor who treated him agreed there's no reason to worry. "The
media focus on this has created undue hysteria," said Dr. Philip
Robinson, also of Newport Beach. "Most people who get infected ...
don't become ill; many don't even know they had it, or may think that
they had the flu."</TE>
<TE>   That was certainly true of McGuy, who began experiencing flu-like
nausea, headaches and body aches late last month about nine days
after returning from the visit with his wife to Nebraska. "I just
didn't feel good," he recalled. "I played golf that day and quit at
nine holes, which I never do."</TE>
<TE>   He went to the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian emergency room
and was admitted with a 104-degree temperature. "We basically just
controlled his pain, nausea and fever with pain medicines, Tylenol
and intravenous fluids," Robinson said. "We just treated the
symptoms."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of days later, McGuy was back home. It was only later
that his blood test results came back from Nebraska pointing to
probable West Nile. "I was shocked," he said. "We had talked about it
before going back there and both were concerned because a horse had
died in Central City and a woman is in the hospital."</TE>
<TE>   McGuy has no recollection of being bitten by a mosquito although,
he said, "they were all around and my wife got bit in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   The case of the Los Angeles woman, meanwhile, has baffled public
health experts since they announced her infection in early September.
She hadn't traveled outside the region and didn't remember being
bitten by a mosquito, the route of transmission in nearly all cases.</TE>
<TE>   No other locally acquired cases have been reported here or in any
adjacent state. And health authorities haven't found any signs of
infection in local mosquitoes, birds or chickens, typical indicators.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always the theory that a mosquito got off a plane at LAX
and infected this woman," said Dr. Frederick Murphy, a professor at
UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. As time goes by and no other
evidence is found, the theory becomes "more logical."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of acute communicable disease control
for Los Angeles County, described the case as a "big question mark."
But she said her office has given up trying to figure out its origin,
saying such knowledge wouldn't help protect residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know it's going to come," Mascola said. The delay "will
give us another year to be even more prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Cases of West Nile acquired in other parts of the country continue
to pop up in California. Los Angeles County, Contra Costa County and
San Francisco have reported infections among people who had traveled
outside the state.</TE>
<TE>   In about one in five cases, people experience mild symptoms,
including fever, headache and nausea. One in 150 require
hospitalization. West Nile infections can cause meningitis, an
irritation of the brain's membranes, or encephalitis, an inflammation
of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile first appeared in the United States in 1999, killing
seven people in the New York area.</TE>
<TE>   As for McGuy, he said he plans to fly to Ohio this weekend. "I
just wouldn't worry about it," he advised those worried about the
disease. "If it hits, it's going to feel like the worst case of flu
you ever had, but you're going to live. Just get to the hospital,
take lots of fluids, take lots of Tylenol, tell yourself you're going
to beat it."</TE>

<LD>Arms buildups seem to be in the news these days. For instance, the
police log of USC's Daily Trojan newspaper carried a report of
"students at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house firing potatoes
from a tube-launcher into an adjacent parking lot."</LD>
<LD>   Security officers said "the matter would be referred to Student
Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and cleared the location." A
cease-fire was arranged.</LD>
<LD>   Another reason to lose sleep at USC: Then there was the complaint
from residents of one dorm about an alarm clock sounding for several
minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Officers knocked on the door, found no one home and turned off the
buzzer so everyone could get back to sleep. After all, it was 9:23 in
the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like ... : Over the years, this column has collected
numerous items that were turned into people in classified ads:
Chester Drawers, Hugh Yard Sale, Chip and Dale Furniture, Rod Iron,
etc.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Spinoza of Valley Village came up with an addition, a
personalized variation of "wainscoting" (see accompanying). OK, I
admit I had to look it up (it's wall paneling), but I sort of knew
what it was, honest.</TE>
<TE>   Taking customers to the cleaners? Wendy Mollett of Studio City
found what she considers some pretty steep cleaning rates, especially
when you consider that the company apparently covers much, much less
than a foot of space per visit (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   No pun intended: Ron Johnson of Fullerton noticed that a real
estate office had misspelled the name of Anaheim's celebrated
baseball team and inserted a superfluous apostrophe for bad measure
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Introducing Orange County: For those in other parts of the nation
who plan to visit Anaheim during the baseball playoffs, we assure you
that it has changed since actress and one-time resident Helena
Modjeska questioned the honesty of the populace. Modjeska wrote: "We
had a vineyard which yielded beautiful muscat grapes but there was
nobody to buy them. And often people would come fill their wagons
with them without much ado; they said that such was the custom of the
country. We were too courteous to contradict them and smilingly
consented to be robbed."</TE>
<TE>   She also recalled that Anaheim streets became too dusty unless
sprinkled with water or covered with straw, and that the straw
attracted swarms of fleas. As I said, Anaheim has changed since that
account of 1876.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A bus driver reported that a pedestrian tossed a

<HD>Cities to Share Windfall for Parks</HD>
<DH>Funds: The $2.1 million will pay for soccer center, trail
improvements and other projects in 13 L.A. County communities.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Clarita, Lancaster, Burbank and 10 other cities in Los Angeles
County will share $2.1 million to develop and improve parks,
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The money comes from interest earned on the sale of bonds under
the Safe Neighborhood Parks Proposition, a countywide measure
approved by voters in 1992 and expanded in 1996 that designated a
total of $859 million for park projects.</LD>
<LD>   "The proposition envisioned that these additional funds might
become available, but there was no way of knowing how much that would
be," said Curt Robertson, a county parks department administrator.
"We're very pleased that these funds are stimulating park
improvements in cities throughout the county."</LD>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved
allocating $160,220 of the excess funds to each of the 13 cities
except La Verne and Covina, which requested lesser amounts. All the
cities are in Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 5th District.</TE>
<TE>   The cities plan to match the allocations with their own funds,
said Conal McNamara, deputy for Antonovich. City projects to receive
funds include:</TE>
<TE>   * An activity center at the National Soccer Center on Fern Avenue
in Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   * Parking and irrigation at Lost Canyon Park trailhead in Santa
Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   * Grading and fencing at Tejon Equestrian Park in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   * Acquisition of open space for a mini-park in southwest Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   * Improvements to Flint Canyon Trail in La Canada-Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   * Development of a new park on South San Fernando Road in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Cities in other supervisorial districts also have received excess
funds in the past to pay for park projects, officials said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick Machetanz, 94, Alaska's best-known artist who grandly
captured the state's vast landscapes and wildlife, died Sunday in
Palmer, Alaska, of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Kenton, Ohio, Machetanz got his start illustrating
covers for his beloved football team while attending Ohio State
University. He made a post-graduate vacation visit to an uncle in
Unalakleet, Alaska, near the Arctic Circle and made the state his
home.</LD>
<LD>   He served as a lieutenant commander in Navy intelligence in and
around Alaska during World War II, and used the G.I. Bill to study
lithography at the Arts Students League in New York City.</LD>
<TE>   First an illustrator, Machetanz and his wife, the late Sara Dunn,
produced several children's books including "Barney Hits the Trail,"
and travel documentaries for the state of Alaska and the Walt Disney
Co. But by 1962, Machetanz had become a full-time artist and art
professor at the University of Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Machetanz used a distinctive technique of painting his entire
canvas blue and letting it dry before varnishing that and beginning
to paint his subjects in layers. Considered one of the last of
Alaska's "old masters," he painted the natives, prospectors,
landscapes, polar bears and sled-dog teams.</TE>

<LD>Shony Alex Braun, 70, Holocaust survivor, violinist and composer who
wrote a "Symphony of the Holocaust," died Friday in Los Angeles of
pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Transylvania, Braun was interned as a teenager by the
Nazis at Auschwitz and Dachau and survived a bullet wound.</LD>
<LD>   A historical account of Braun's experiences, and those of his
wife, Shari, have been included in the archives of the Wexner
Learning Center of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington.</LD>

by age 10.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he studied at the University of Salzburg Mozarteum
and, after moving to the U.S. in the early 1950s, at Case Western
Reserve University in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He became a popular concert violinist, adept at gypsy music as
well as classical and Romantic pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Braun composed more than 200 works, but took greatest pride in his
five-movement, 17-minute "Symphony of the Holocaust." The music
evoked various scenes of concentration camp life and liberation.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony received its debut performance April 16, 1988, by the
Garden Grove Symphony with Braun performing the violin solos.</TE>

<HD>Gay Pride Group's Leader Seeks to Mend Rifts</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ideological gap emerged this summer in the organization that
stages San Francisco's annual gay pride parade. Some activists
thought the organization had sold out its left-wing political roots
for the sake of a few corporate backers. Others disagreed, saying the
gay community must define itself more broadly and welcome all comers.</LD>
<LD>   Now San Francisco Pride, the organization behind the 32-year-old
celebration, has named a new president who has pledged to bridge the
ideological gap in the city's large and politically powerful gay
community.</LD>
<LD>   Joey Cain, 47, a self-declared "radical fairy" who works as an
administrative assistant at the city's Haight Ashbury Free Clinic, is
the new president of San Francisco Pride.</LD>
<TE>   Cain now becomes a key figure in a parade that has become one of
the nation's largest displays of gay political and economic clout.
The new president said in an interview Tuesday that he may be a
radical and an anarchist and even agree with some criticism of
changes in the parade. But he said he's pragmatic enough to realize
that corporate sponsorship is crucial for a parade and other events
that draw hundreds of thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   "To just say, 'We don't want any corporate sponsorship,' I don't
think that is going to be very effective," Cain said. "The event
essentially won't exist. A more useful way to look at it is, 'What
sort of demands can we make on the corporations that are coming in?'
"</TE>
<TE>   A new policy requiring all corporate sponsors to offer domestic
partner benefits to their employees is a good start, Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Pride may begin investigating corporate partners'
human rights records as well, Cain said. The new president said he
will search for more ways to help the event connect with its roots as
a civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   The comments come months after the gay community was divided over
how the parade was being run.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of old-school, left-leaning gay activists
complained that corporate participants and other developments had
tarnished the celebration's radical roots. Others said the gay
community has been strengthened by broader participation from
political conservatives and corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The gay community in San Francisco, Cain said in a prepared
statement, "is recognized throughout the world for its leadership on
issues of diversity, freedom and social justice."</TE>
<TE>   "The Pride celebration should be, and is, a reflection of those
values," Cain's statement continued. "We've changed the world. Now
let's close those parade gaps and make it an even more fabulous
event."</TE>
<TE>   Teddy Witherington, the paid executive director of San Francisco
Pride, said the debate is merely a reflection of the gay community's
diversity. "Pride is so many different things to so many different
people."</TE>

<DH>Corrections: Lawyers say plan to house mentally ill inmates
in 'Supermax' unit is inhumane.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state Department of Corrections on Tuesday abruptly suspended a
plan to house mentally ill inmates in special segregation units after
lawyers for the prisoners said the cells are inhumane and would make
the convicts sicker.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, mentally ill inmates at Corcoran State Prison were
to be isolated, beginning today, in a special "Supermax" unit
designed for prisoners deemed dangerous to themselves or others.
Eventually, officials planned to expand the housing approach to nine
other prisons.</LD>
<LD>   But after learning that lawyers for the inmates intended to ask a
federal judge in Sacramento to block the move, the Department of
Corrections put the program on hold.</LD>
<TE>   A department spokeswoman, Margot Bach, said prison officials would
work with the attorneys to try to resolve their concerns. The
lawyers, however, went ahead with their request for a court order
halting the plan, saying they had no firm commitment from the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials have been working for more than a year to design
a housing approach to better serve mentally ill inmates, Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   The new Supermax facility, she said, was selected because it
creates "a quieter, smaller environment where they can't see and
imitate other inmates who may be behaving badly.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would be easier for them to function in this
environment, with fewer distractions," Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for mentally ill prisoners painted a different view of the
unit. Steve Fama, one of the attorneys, called the housing a place of
"endless sterility, monotony and sensory deprivation" that would
aggravate their condition.</TE>
<TE>   The court documents requesting a judicial order blocking the
program elaborate: "The cells are laid out so that ... inmates stare
at a blank wall and cannot even see guards or inmates in other cells.
The cells have heavy solid doors through which there is only a small
window to see into the corridor."</TE>
<TE>   There is no stimulation such as radio, and exercise is limited and
takes place in individual cages, the documents say.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no video monitoring of the cells, guards cannot
quickly spot suicidal, bizarre or predatory behavior, the documents
say. And inmates would attend therapy in specially constructed cages
barely large enough for a 6-foot-2 man to fit in comfortably, the
lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally ill people need human contact and socialization," said
another attorney on the case, Michael Bien of San Francisco. "These
units are actually dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers also charge that prison officials, uncertain what
effect the Supermax might have on mentally ill inmates, planned an
"experimental" six-month evaluation project to determine the impact
on an initial group.</TE>
<TE>   They say department officials planned to house about 50 mentally
ill inmates in the Supermax cells while leaving another 50 in the
traditional segregation unit as a control group.</TE>
<TE>   "The [department] 'scientists' will measure whether those mentally
ill inmates unlucky enough to be housed in the [Supermax] have a
higher rate of suicide attempts, crisis bed admissions, emergency
referrals and changes in levels of mental health care than the
control group," the court documents say.</TE>
<TE>   A Department of Corrections memo outlining the evaluation project
acknowledges the department's uncertainty over whether the Supermax
would create "extreme sensory deprivation that may be detrimental to
the mental health of the inmates."</TE>
<TE>   But Bach, the department spokeswoman, said it was unfair to
characterize the evaluation as an "experiment."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no data that says this would be harmful to mentally ill
inmates, and we believe it would be appropriate," Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's request for a court order is part of ongoing litigation
over the prison system's treatment of mentally ill inmates.</TE>

<HD>Unarmed Man's Killing Called Mistake</HD>
<DH>Probe: Redondo Beach officer was handed a shotgun rather
than a beanbag stun gun to subdue the suspected car thief,
authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Redondo Beach police officer under orders to subdue a suspected car
thief mistakenly fired a shotgun instead of a beanbag stun gun,
killing the unarmed man after he got out of the car, law enforcement
sources said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The officer, identified as Michael Strosnider, 30, was described
as distraught immediately after the Sunday night shooting, sources
said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting, which was recorded on a police videotape, is being
investigated by the district attorney's office and the Los Angeles
Police Department. The tape has not been released by authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have withheld the name of the 40-year-old suspect,
pending notification of his family. The coroner's office said the man
was a parolee.</TE>
<TE>   The shotgun used to fire the fatal blast did not have the yellow
tape the Redondo Beach Police Department uses to distinguish the
less-lethal weapon, according to sources close to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary investigation found that a senior officer at the
scene ordered use of the beanbag gun when the suspect at first
refused to follow orders to get out of the vehicle, according to
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Another officer handed Strosnider the shotgun and he fired,
hitting the man in the chest and killing him instantly, law
enforcement sources said. The LAPD took jurisdiction of the
investigation because the man was killed in Los Angeles, at Imperial
Highway and Sepulveda Boulevard. The area was described by sources
who were at the scene as poorly lighted.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies typically distinguish the less-lethal
stun gun by spray-painting the stock with fluorescent paint or
wrapping the barrel with bright tape. The beanbag guns used in
Redondo Beach are wrapped with thin yellow tape on both the barrel
and stock, a law enforcement source said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD paints the stocks of its beanbag shotguns a fluorescent
green to distinguish them from lethal shotguns.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach police refused Tuesday to provide further
information about the officer or the shooting. A department sergeant
referred all questions to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach Police Sgt. Phil Keenan said Monday that the officer
is undergoing counseling and is not on patrol. Strosnider joined the
department in August 2001, according to city officials.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when Redondo Beach police received a call at
6:50 p.m. about a reckless motorist driving north on Pacific Coast
Highway in a 1992 Ford Bronco. The vehicle had been reported stolen
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Officers spotted the vehicle headed north on Sepulveda Boulevard
in Manhattan Beach. When they tried to persuade the driver to pull
over, he stopped momentarily and then sped away, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver led police on a high-speed chase north through El
Segundo. He then turned west onto Imperial Highway and crashed into
the curb, leaving the Bronco disabled.</TE>
<TE>   A similar shooting occurred in Northern California seven years
ago, when a Contra Costa County deputy fired a shotgun instead of a
beanbag round, killing a 42-year-old man.</TE>

<LD>A judge this week approved a hearing that could add years to the
sentence of Sara Jane Olson, the radical-turned-suburban mother who
is in prison for plotting to blow up Los Angeles police cars in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Olson, a former Symbionese Liberation Army member, was sentenced
to 20 years in January and is eligible for parole in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   But California law lets the state Board of Prison Terms reconsider
sentences for crimes committed before 1977, when different sentencing
guidelines prevailed.</LD>
<TE>   Over Olson's objections, Superior Court Judge Thomas Cecil agreed
to permit a hearing Oct. 16.</TE>

<LD>City officials are dissuading people from attending an annual
Halloween party in downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The city has launched a multimedia advertising campaign asking
people not to invite out-of-towners to the party and to avoid
downtown. The campaign includes television spots, door hangers and
print ads.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say violence and vandalism have plagued the Halloween
party in recent years. Last year, police arrested 65 adults and seven
juveniles. Forty-four of those arrested did not live in the Chico
area.</LD>

<HD>Dispute Taints Sidewalk Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Downtown: Officials say loft developer must stop washing
garbage and human waste from in front of his buildings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If one downtown Los Angeles neighborhood is going to have clean
sidewalks, somebody is going to have to clean up their act.</LD>
<LD>   That much is certain in the dispute over sidewalk-washing between
city officials and developer Tom Gilmore, who is converting abandoned
office buildings near skid row into trendy loft housing.</LD>
<LD>   Gilmore sends workers each morning to scrub sidewalks in front of
his refurbished buildings. But the city has countered by dispatching
inspectors there to enforce municipal laws against water runoff.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, an inspector caught a worker wet-handed in front of the
refurbished Farmers and Merchant Bank Building on 4th Street between
Spring and Main streets. Drop that hose, he commanded the startled
sidewalk cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   An angry Gilmore has refused to quit cleaning, however, all but
daring street inspectors to cite him.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Mayor James K. Hahn's economic development office,
he offered to put away his hose only if "every morning before 8 a.m.,
the city will agree to clean my sidewalks of urine, human waste,
vomit, alcohol, cardboard, clothing, hypodermic needles, crack pipes
and bullet casings." Then, he said, "I will cease and desist from
maintaining my properties as any human being would have a right to
expect."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he'll keep washing the walkways used by 500 residents
of the newly converted buildings, Gilmore pledged Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   City officials wish they could wash their hands of the problem.
But they stressed that federal law requires them to prevent
pollutants from being carried by street gutters and storm drains into
San Pedro and Santa Monica bays.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely support Mr. Gilmore's efforts to bring more
vibrancy to downtown with mixed-use development. He's in a Catch-22
situation we're hoping to resolve," said Jonathan Kevles, deputy
mayor for economic development.</TE>
<TE>   Cora Jackson-Fossett, a spokeswoman for the city Department of
Public Works, said street and sanitation officials will meet with
representatives of Hahn and downtown-area City Councilwoman Jan Perry
in hopes of reaching a compromise with Gilmore.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Cornish, a high school English teacher who has lived for two
years on the eighth floor of one of Gilmore's buildings, described
the standoff as "crazy."</TE>
<TE>   "I know the radical difference between clean sidewalks and dirty
sidewalks. Here we have someone trying to make the place better. Why
shouldn't he be able to improve the quality of life downtown?"</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Fleischli of Santa Monica BayKeeper, who has
jurisdiction over Santa Monica and San Pedro bays, said that though
Gilmore's "intentions are good ... runoff from the urban environment
is the No. 1 cause of pollution of our waters."</TE>

<HD>Mia Slavenska, 86; Ballerina, Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mia Slavenska, one of the leading ballerinas of the Ballet Russe de
Monte Carlo, co-founder of the Slavenska-Franklin Ballet and a
respected former teacher at UCLA and California Institute of the
Arts, died Saturday. She was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Slavenska died of natural causes in an assisted-living residence
in Westwood, surrounded by family and friends, said her daughter,
Maria Ramas.</LD>
<LD>   Born Mia Corak Slavenska in Croatia in 1916, Slavenska began her
studies at the Zagreb Opera Ballet School, where she became prima
ballerina at age 17. She continued her studies in Paris, working with
Egorova, Kshessinska and Preobrajenska.</LD>
<TE>   She began creating dances for herself when she was 12 and went on
to be one of three dancer-choreographer winners--the other two were
Harald Kreutzberg and Mary Wigman--at the Berlin Dance Olympics, held
concurrently with the 1936 Olympic Games. It was after that event
that she dropped her family name and began appearing as Mia
Slavenska.</TE>
<TE>   She went on to dance in London and Paris. Her role in the 1938
prize-winning French film "La Mort du Cygne" (released in the United
States as "Ballerina") brought her further fame.</TE>
<TE>   Slavenska frequently danced "Carnaval" with Igor Youskevitch when
both were members of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo during the late
1930s and early '40s. She joined the Ruth Page Chicago Opera ballet
for a season, and also danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in
New York, the Ballet Theater and London Festival Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   From 1944 to 1945, she directed her own touring companies.
Slavenska and Frederic Franklin formed a series of touring companies,
beginning in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   One of her most celebrated roles was as Blanche in Valerie Bettis'
"A Streetcar Named Desire," created in 1952 for the
Slavenska-Franklin Ballet, which at its peak had about 18 dancers and
its own small orchestra. The company was dissolved in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very beautiful ballerina, and she was fearless, on
stage and in life," Franklin said from Cincinnati, where the
Cincinnati Ballet is presenting a tribute to Franklin and the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   "She was exceptional in the fact that she was something more than
just a ballerina. She managed her own company. She went on tour. She
choreographed. She designed costumes. She was quite unique. No other
ballerina at that time did all that."</TE>
<TE>   Their company folded, he said, "because of finances. Very simple.
There was literally no scrubbings, no fights, nothing like that. We
were sent on a tour, which was really just badly managed. One moment,
there wasn't any more money left. It was very sad."</TE>
<TE>   Slavenska taught at her own studio and at UCLA from 1969 to 1983
and at Cal Arts from 1970 to 1983.</TE>
<TE>   She married Kurt Neumann in 1946. He died in 1983. She is survived
by her daughter, who lives in Culver City. A memorial service will be
held early next year, Ramas said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police lieutenant has filed a whistle-blower lawsuit
against the department, alleging that she was demoted in retaliation
for reporting misconduct by former Police Chief Willie L. Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Kathleen Ann Sheehan, a lieutenant in the North Hollywood
Division, claims that police officials allied with Williams
retaliated against her for reporting alleged misconduct to the Police
Commission in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged misconduct includes mismanagement of funds, extortive
conduct and abuse of power. Williams was not available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Sheehan, who was Williams' former executive officer, said that
when she confronted her former boss with the allegations, he told her
to mind her own business.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which also names former Chief Bernard C. Parks as a
plaintiff, does not specify monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   Sheehan, 43, is a 22-year veteran of the department. According to
the lawsuit, she served as executive officer to two police chiefs and
was a designated expert on the Christopher Commission.</TE>

<HD>County to Survey Cities About Traffic Panel</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The proposed regional body would address
problems along Ventura Freeway from the Valley to Santa Barbara
County line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors agreed Tuesday to explore whether cities
along heavily traveled stretches of the Ventura Freeway in Los
Angeles and Ventura counties are willing to form a regional authority
to deal with traffic problems.</LD>
<LD>   On a 4-1 vote, board members authorized Supervisor Frank Schillo
to meet with representatives of eight cities to gauge their interest.
Los Angeles County officials would also be asked to participate,
along with several regional transportation boards.</LD>
<LD>   Under a plan unveiled by Schillo last week, the proposed authority
would rank traffic-reduction projects and help pay for them through a
fee levied for every house built near the Ventura Freeway between the
San Diego Freeway interchange in the San Fernando Valley and the
Ventura/Santa Barbara county line.</LD>
<TE>   "This could provide a pot of funds to reduce traffic on the
freeway, to widen the freeway or to help pay for other mitigations,"
Schillo told the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   A regional board--especially one that has its own funding--could
also wield more political clout in influencing what steps the
California Department of Transportation takes to alleviate growing
freeway congestion, Schillo said. The Thousand Oaks-based supervisor
said there are several studies underway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Westlake Village, Agoura Hills and Calabasas have
already indicated interest, said Schillo, adding that he will send
formal invitations to all the targeted agencies this week.</TE>
<TE>   The other cities are Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, Oxnard
and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials, however, are already voicing skepticism. Matt
Middlebrook, a spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn,
dismissed the proposal as a tactic to take the spotlight off calls
for a new traffic study for the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch housing
development.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has condemned environmental studies done on the proposed
subdivision near Calabasas as incomplete and called on the Ventura
County Board of Supervisors to authorize a new study.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems like an effort to detract from the need to do a new
and complete traffic study on Ahmanson," Middlebrook said. "We hope
the supervisor will act responsibly, listening to our concerns and
join us in demanding a new traffic study."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch agreed that nothing
short of a new traffic study will satisfy opponents of the housing
project.</TE>
<TE>   "Schillo's been getting pressure from his constituents to vote for
a new study, and this is an attempt to deflect attention from that
issue," Tsilah Burman, the spokeswoman, said. "It's a way for him to
seem as if he's doing something."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett was the only board member to vote against
Schillo's participation in the talks. Bennett, an Ahmanson critic,
said he supports the concept of addressing traffic problems on a
regional basis. But voting with the majority would have sent the
wrong message, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very different philosophies and positions on Ahmanson
Ranch, and I didn't feel comfortable implying that he was speaking
for me in these early negotiations," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the joint-powers authority is formed, Ahmanson Ranch's
developer, Washington Mutual, would not be required to pay any extra
traffic mitigation fees because its development agreement has already
been approved.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Washington Mutual officials have suggested they
would voluntarily pay additional fees--but only if other developers
are required to do the same. A per-house amount has not been decided,
but Schillo suggested it could be as much as $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Bennett, Schillo's colleagues were generally
supportive of his idea. Supervisor Judy Mikels acknowledged the money
raised by a regional authority probably would not be enough to cover
the cost of major improvements.</TE>
<TE>   But it could make a dent, she said. "You're not going to come up
with enough money locally to widen the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "That would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. But certainly we
can come up with the local matching funds."</TE>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors will seek a court order reversing the
Civil Service Commission's decision to hear an appeal by two
prosecutors who contend they were demoted for backing the wrong
candidate for district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors unanimously voted in favor of legal action, agreeing
with county lawyers' contention that the county commission
overstepped its authority in ordering a hearing on the employees'
grievance.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Pachowicz and Adam Pearlman are fighting to return to the
district attorney's office after being transferred to the child
support enforcement division three weeks after the March 5 election.
Both attorneys publicly backed Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh,
who lost to Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten.</LD>
<TE>   A third prosecutor, Vivian Rackauckas, is also challenging her
transfer.</TE>

<HD>Despite Gate, Home Builders Speculate</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Hills: Canyon residents fear that large new
houses along road ending in cul-de-sac will become multi-tenant
units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the locked gate across one of its public streets can't keep
anger and confrontation from creeping into Curson Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The gate blocks Wattles Drive, a short and twisty stretch of
asphalt that for decades ended in a Hollywood Hills cul-de-sac framed
by a stunning 180-degree view of the Los Angeles Basin stretching
from Los Feliz to Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   The handful of residents who live along Wattles Drive have the
access code. So do neighbors outside the gate--which the city
authorized nine years ago after locals complained that the cul-de-sac
had turned into a lovers' lane that was attracting troublemakers from
the flatlands below.</LD>
<TE>   The gate chased the outsiders away. But it also lured intruders of
a different type into the secluded canyon north of Hollywood
Boulevard and east of Nichols Canyon Road: developers building houses
on speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon residents watched in alarm as one huge spec house after
another was built. Most clung precariously to the steep mountainside
below Wattles Drive. Then one house actually seemed to spill onto the
roadway itself.</TE>
<TE>   That project has provoked howls from neighbors, who contend that
Los Angeles leaders gave away a chunk of Wattles Drive's spectacular
cul-de-sac for use as part of the frontyard of the house, which now
completely blocks the scenic view and is for sale for $4.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   And they say officials are looking the other way as other large,
unsold dwellings around Wattles Drive are converted into unauthorized
apartment houses.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal officials acknowledge the controversy over ownership of
the 75-foot cul-de-sac strip. But they say they are convinced that
giving up part of the street was proper. And they deny knowledge of
any illegal apartment houses in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Furious residents say the cul-de-sac was an important staging spot
for firetrucks. Without unfettered fire engine access, residents
complain, their neighborhood is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The cul-de-sac land was sold for development by "Jeopardy!" game
show host Alex Trebek.</TE>
<TE>   The cul-de-sac lot is part of a rugged mountainside that Trebek
purchased for $1.5 million in 1990. At the time, he planned to sell
21 lots near Wattles Drive and keep land at the top for a house for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   His own house plans fell through, however, because of access
problems with the site. Four years ago, Trebek donated the
mountaintop parcel to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy as open
space and sold off the remaining smaller lots around Wattles Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Four homes, including the one on the cul-de-sac, have been built
on Wattles and a fifth is underway. Beneath the drive, seven others
are in various phases of construction.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors assert that many of the dwellings are being built so
they can be turned into multi-tenant rentals.</TE>
<TE>   "I could tell by the way they were stringing the electric wiring
that they were building a rooming house," nearby resident Lan Ritz
said of one house. "I was right. A bunch of musicians live and
practice there. The quality of my life has diminished 95%."</TE>
<TE>   Ritz, a writer and artist who has lived in Curson Canyon for 38
years, said construction trucks have nearly flattened the masonry
wall next to her circa-1929 house. And after she complained to the
city about the alleged apartment building, a lawyer for one developer
threatened in May to sue her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have been slow to respond to residents' concerns,
others in the canyon agree.</TE>
<TE>   "The city goes after people doing little things wrong, but looks
the other way at things like that street," said Federico Fichtl, a
retired maitre d' who has lived beneath Wattles Drive for nearly
three decades.</TE>
<TE>   David Ronne, president of the Curson Hills Homeowners Assn., said
some of the neighborhood's spec houses have been under construction
off and on for as long as eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "We point out clear violations, and nothing happens. But the
neighbors get chastised for harassing the builders," said Ronne, a
movie recording engineer who has lived in the neighborhood 27 years.
He said the cul-de-sac house seems destined to become subdivided into
apartments too.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Lazar, the home's developer, said the reconfigured
cul-de-sac in front of his house meets city specifications. As for
its boomerang-shaped, view-blocking design: "It's a beautiful
hacienda house, not an apartment house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, who control use of new residential structures by
monitoring the number of kitchen facilities built into them, say
there is no indication the cul-de-sac house is apartment-bound. They
say there is no evidence other large homes under construction in the
area are, either.</TE>
<TE>   "I've sent the inspectors out there a million times, and they
don't see anything," said Renee Weitzer, an aide to City Councilman
Tom LaBonge, who represents the Hollywood Hills area.</TE>
<TE>   Weitzer said the Wattles Drive cul-de-sac still has plenty of room
for firetrucks to turn around. She said the city did not ask the
developers to pay for the frontyard land taken from the street
because the city didn't actually own the property beneath the
pavement.</TE>
<TE>   The city only had an "easement interest" dating from 1927,
according to Richard W. Brown, chief real estate officer for the
city's Bureau of Engineering.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent any information to the contrary, I believe that the owners
who abut Wattles Drive" own the street, Brown concluded in a report
issued in late April. "To confirm this," he recommended that the
house builders research the issue through a title search.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lazar says a title search was done, city Public Works
officials said they believe that was never completed, although they
could not locate the project's case file on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ronne said he feels a proper title search should have been
demanded by the city before the cul-de-sac land was used for the
house. But now that the structure is already built and the frontyard
landscaping and a wall are in place where the street once was, the
issue is only a matter of principle, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of Curson Canyon are reevaluating one of the things
that has helped give Wattles Drive its cachet with developers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been thinking about the gate," Ronne said. It forces police
investigating noise and other nuisances at residences and
construction sites on Wattles Drive to "announce themselves to get
in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides that, the barricade has far exceeded the three-year use
permit approved nearly a decade ago by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, say the Hollywood Hills residents, it's time for the gate
to go.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Infection Baffles Officials</HD>
<DH>Health: The only patient to acquire the disease in
California had not traveled outside the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the mosquito season winds down, Los Angeles County health
officials said they still don't know how a local 31-year-old woman
developed what appears to be the only West Nile case acquired in
California.</LD>
<LD>   The woman's case has baffled public health experts since they
announced her infection in early September. She hadn't traveled
outside the region and didn't remember being bitten by a mosquito,
the route of transmission in nearly all cases. She has recovered.</LD>
<LD>   No other locally acquired cases have been reported in California
or in any adjacent state. And health authorities haven't found any
signs of infection in local mosquitoes, birds or chickens, which are
typical indicators that the virus has arrived in a region.</LD>
<TE>   "There's always the theory that a mosquito got off a plane at LAX
and infected this woman," said Dr. Frederick Murphy, a professor at
the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. As time goes by and no
other evidence is found, that theory "becomes more and more logical."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of acute communicable disease control
for Los Angeles County, described the lone local case as a "big
question mark." But she said her office has given up trying to figure
out its origin, saying such knowledge wouldn't help protect
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know it's going to come," Mascola said of the virus. The
delay "will give us another year to be even more prepared" for when
the virus is firmly entrenched in the region.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said officials there know of no other instance domestically in which
West Nile has shown up in a human but could not be found in
mosquitoes or birds nearby. They did, however, point to a human
infection that could not be linked to a local source last year in the
Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Cases of West Nile acquired elsewhere in the U.S. continue to pop
up among visitors to California. Orange County health officials
reported a probable case Tuesday in a 70-year-old resident who had
traveled to Nebraska and later became ill. He was hospitalized and
released.</TE>
<TE>   This year, authorities in 34 states and the District of Columbia
have reported 146 deaths and 2,768 infections attributable to West
Nile. Federal health officials suspect that tens of thousands of
people are infected, but the vast majority of patients display no
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   In about one in five cases, people experience mild symptoms,
including fever, headache and nausea. One in 150 require
hospitalization. West Nile infections, which can lead to death, can
cause meningitis, an irritation of the brain's membranes, or
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile first appeared in the United States in 1999, killing
seven people in the New York area. This year, faced with so many new
cases, researchers learned that the virus can be spread through organ
transplantation, blood transfusions and breast milk.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials have said they are trying to quickly find
a test that can detect the virus in blood donations, as well as
create a vaccine for it.</TE>
<TE>   Californians who see birds that have been dead for less than 24
hours are asked to report them to health authorities at (877)
968-2473. Authorities will test for the presence of the virus. Los
Angeles County has also set up a general information hotline: (800)
975-4448.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Chosen for Tiger's Golf Center</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The $25- million learning facility is seen as a
boost for park-poor northern O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tiger Woods Foundation has chosen Anaheim as the site for a
$25-million educational center for underprivileged youths, a victory
for local officials working to boost recreation facilities in
park-starved northern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The Tiger Woods Learning Center would provide academic tutoring in
reading, writing and computer skills for children ages 8 to 17, as
well as classes in golf on a practice course. The foundation hopes to
eventually build several centers around the country. Anaheim was
selected over several Southern California cities, including Long
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said the facility
will fill a critical need for youth recreation programs in North
County, which has far fewer regional parks than South County.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a major step for the revitalization of north Orange
County," said Coad, who pushed for the center to be built on property
owned by the county flood control district next to the H.G. Dad
Miller Golf Course in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an area with a lot of underserved kids. It's a positive
part of the picture that's been missing. The kids in the area don't
have enough activities."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, acknowledged as one of the world's greatest athletes,
played the Dad Miller course as a standout student at Anaheim's
Western High School in the mid-1990s. He now lives in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   His foundation, based in Los Alamitos, has pledged to spend up to
$25 million in private funds to build a two-story, 30,000-square-foot
building next to the practice course.</TE>
<TE>   The first floor would house a pro shop, administrative offices and
classrooms. The second floor would have computer classes with up to
200 terminals, a library and space for tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   Golf architect Tom Fazio is designing the playing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation was wooed by several cities around the
country--most with more land to offer--but Woods has said he wanted
to open his first permanent center close to his childhood home. He
also said he wanted children from less privileged backgrounds to be
introduced to a game often associated with wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors unanimously approved an option for the
foundation to lease the property for $2 a year for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim still must formally approve parts of the deal, which
involves moving an existing driving range. The final proposal also
must be signed by Woods and his father, Earl Woods.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they anticipated resolving remaining details
within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything will turn out fine," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly
said. "This partnership has great potential."</TE>
<TE>   The county conditionally agreed to spend $1 million from state
park money for improvements to an adjacent area planned for a future
flood-control catch basin. The county had leased the land to Anaheim,
along with a portion of the Dad Miller Golf Course, which also is on
flood-control property. The county's lease with the city expired last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials touted the new center as part of a renaissance
for western Anaheim, including new parks, median landscaping and a
community center.</TE>
<TE>   "The schools are thrilled they're going to have a place with a
computer lab and so many opportunities," Coad said. "It's really a
happy day for the kids and the schools and the families."</TE>
<TE>   In other action Tuesday, county supervisors approved the first
recreation projects for north Orange County to be funded by $16
million from a state park bond. Orange County cities will receive $39
million from the same bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   About $3 million of the county's share will be spent on a cultural
center in Westminster, soccer fields in Santa Ana and an indoor
sports complex in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Some Westminster residents complained that the cultural center,
which will be providing art classes, doesn't fit the definition of a
park.</TE>

<HD>Tilting Toward Davis on Parole</HD>
<DH>Prisons: Justices are wary of second-guessing governor over
freeing a killer described as a model prisoner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court appeared to be inclined Tuesday to give
Gov. Gray Davis latitude to keep inmates convicted of murder behind
bars in cases in which the state parole board and lower courts have
found that the prisoners deserve parole.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court, meeting for arguments on pending cases, will
decide within 90 days what kind of evidence, if any, Davis must
present to keep model inmates with unblemished prison records
incarcerated despite the recommendations of the parole board that he
appoints.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't a great deal of deference accorded to the executive?" Chief
Justice Ronald M. George asked at the hourlong hearing. George
expressed concern that allowing the state's "1,600 judges to
second-guess gubernatorial decisions" might violate the separation of
powers doctrine.</LD>
<TE>   The court is considering the future of inmate Robert Rosenkrantz,
35, who killed a Calabasas schoolmate when he was 18 for exposing his
homosexuality. The decision in Rosenkrantz's 1985 case will affect
hundreds of inmates who were convicted of murder but are eligible for
parole.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has said publicly that he does not believe convicted
murderers should be paroled but has denied that he has an official
no-parole stance, a policy that lower courts have said would be
unlawful.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has overturned parole recommendations for 128 convicted
killers and approved the release of two, both battered women who
killed their abusers.</TE>
<TE>   "He has granted two," George said. "Do we look at his actions, do
we look at his decisions or do we look at the political rhetoric?"</TE>
<TE>   Justice Marvin Baxter asked whether the Board of Prison Terms made
a "free and voluntary" decision to parole Rosenkrantz. A parole board
in 1996 found Rosenkrantz suitable for release, but board
administrators overturned the decision. The parole board did not
again recommend Rosenkrantz's release until ordered to do so by a
Superior Court judge in Los Angeles acting on a habeas corpus
petition by Rosenkrantz.</TE>
<TE>   "The board's decision to grant parole was not of its own free
will," Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert D. Wilson told the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles judge ruled in the Rosenkrantz case that Davis had
an illegal, no-parole policy for convicted murderers. A state Court
of Appeal in Los Angeles sided with Rosenkrantz too, stating that
Davis had failed to present any evidence to show why Rosenkrantz
should remain in prison.</TE>
<TE>   George, however, indicated Tuesday that he believes Davis' 12-page
decision rejecting parole for Rosenkrantz contained evidence to
support continued incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't this indicate an exercise of discretion, a weighing of
the evidence?" George asked after reading aloud parts of Davis'
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Joyce L. Kennard, on the other hand, expressed concern
that it might be unconstitutional to deny Rosenkrantz parole because
the rules have changed since he committed his crime.</TE>
<TE>   Until voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1988,
governors could not override a parole board's recommendation for
release. Laws generally are supposed to be applied in the future, not
retroactively.</TE>
<TE>   George objected that if the court agreed there was a
constitutional problem, governors would not be able to overturn
grants of parole unless the inmates had committed their crimes after
the change in the law.</TE>
<TE>   "That delay," replied Donald Specter, director of the Prison Law
Office, "is part of the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Carlos Moreno suggested that the change in law might be
merely a modification of procedures, not an unconstitutional
retroactive increase in punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz's parents, who live in Calabasas, and his two younger
brothers attended Tuesday's court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Rosenkrantz, 56, an art therapist, said she grieves every
day for the family of her son's victim, Steven Redman, and the
incarceration of her son.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Herbert Rosenkrantz, 70, a retired lawyer, recalled
tearfully how he angrily rejected his son after Redman exposed him as
a homosexual.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rosenkrantz then went out and purchased an Uzi and a week
later shot Redman repeatedly in the head. Rosenkrantz said he had
asked Redman to recant and tell his father he was not gay, but Redman
refused.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Rosenkrantz said his rejection of his eldest son
"absolutely shattered Robert's self-esteem and set into a motion a
chain of events that resulted in the tragic murder of Steve Redman by
Robert."</TE>
<TE>   "I have regretted my failure to support Robert every day and night
of my life," the elder Rosenkrantz said, "because I believe that if I
had put my arm around him and been his friend rather than his angry
father, Steve might be alive today."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz, who was sentenced to 17 years to life for the
second-degree murder, has attracted wide support in his bid for
release. Among those who have advocated his parole are the judge who
presided over his trial and a detective who investigated the murder.</TE>
<TE>   Also siding with Rosenkrantz are the California Council of
Churches, the Board of Rabbis of Northern California, Catholic
chaplains who serve state prisoners and the California Coalition for
Battered Women in Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz has earned a college degree in prison and has tutored
other prisoners. Job offers await him if he wins a release.</TE>
<TE>   In denying parole, Davis cited the viciousness of the murder and
evidence that Rosenkrantz planned the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Five Superior Court judges in California have ruled that Davis
acted illegally by overturning various parole decisions. One Court of
Appeal has ruled for Davis, another against him.</TE>

<HD>Ad Blitz Against Secession Launched</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Hahn's campaign plans to hammer the spots on
broadcast and cable stations until Nov. 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign began a
multimillion-dollar television ad blitz Tuesday with a casino-themed
spot that labels the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood breakup
measures "a gamble that's not worth taking."</LD>
<LD>   The spots say secession could lead to higher taxes, fewer police
officers on the street, increased utility rates and the end of rent
controls. Leaders of the breakup campaigns immediately blasted the
commercials as lies.</LD>
<LD>   "They are absolutely false," said Carlos Ferreyra, co-chairman of
the Valley Independence Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Ferreyra said the state commission that approved the secession
measures for the Nov. 5 ballot determined that Valley and Hollywood
cities could provide the same level of municipal services as Los
Angeles now does, without higher taxes or utility rates.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of the candidates seeking offices in the proposed cities
also have signed pledges to enact Los Angeles-style rent controls if
the breakup measures win, the secessionists said.</TE>
<TE>   In defending the ads' message, the Hahn campaign cited a mix of
anti-secession reports by the unions that represent Los Angeles
police officers and firefighters, the city's consultants on the
breakup proposals, and the League of Women Voters.</TE>
<TE>   The 30- and 15-second spots debuted a day after the Valley
Independence Committee began running its first commercial on Valley
cable TV systems. That ad contends City Hall ignores the Valley. The
Hollywood secessionists are also running cable spots.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Protective League has launched its own
anti-secession TV campaign, part of the union's $366,000 effort to
defeat the measures.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's commercials, however, will dominate the airwaves. Flush
with more than $4.78 million, the mayor's campaign intends to run the
commercials on every broadcast station in Los Angeles and on many
cable stations--several times a day--until the election, said Kam
Kuwata, a political advisor to Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you that every voter in Los Angeles is going to see
this numerous times," Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   In the 30-second ad, a narrator says, "Secession is a gamble
that's not worth taking." The spot cuts to a spinning roulette wheel
as the narrator says, "Round and round it goes. Where it stops,
nobody knows.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are secession could mean higher taxes and cuts in vital
services ... fewer cops and more crime," the narrator continues.</TE>
<TE>   The ad also contends that secession "could mean disaster relief
won't be there when you need it," and "could mean higher DWP rates
and no rent control." There are also two 15-second versions of the
ad.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra said even with the qualifying "could," the ad misleads
because the state's Local Agency Formation Commission concluded after
an exhaustive study that Valley and Hollywood cities would be
financially viable, at current levels of service, and would have a
reasonable reserve fund to cover emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be fewer cops," Ferreyra said. "The budget that was
prepared shows we can keep the same tax base and improve services."</TE>
<TE>   As for the higher taxes claim, Ferreyra said many secession
candidates support cutting the business tax. He also said LAFCO has
required the Department of Water and Power to serve Valley and
Hollywood cities at rates no higher than those charged in the rest of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Valley campaign on Tuesday released its list of
financial donors, which showed that most of the $546,000 it has
raised came in big checks from Valley industry leaders and business
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Among the largest contributions were $100,000 from Studio City
attorney David Fleming, $40,000 from Galpin Motors President Bert
Boeckmann, $25,000 from the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors, and
$20,000 each from the California Assn. of Realtors and Cal State Auto
Parts.</TE>
<TE>   Boeckmann's car company contributed another $2,500 and his
relatives pitched in $11,000. Some had expected the multimillionaire
auto dealer and longtime secession supporter to give more. Boeckmann,
who is also an L.A. police commissioner, did not return a phone call
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra contributed more to the
Valley campaign--$50,000--than Boeckmann. La Pietra and his company
have donated $508,000 of the $585,326 collected by the Hollywood
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign finance reports released Tuesday also showed the
Valley effort is $102,000 in debt, including $38,487 owed to the
political consulting firm Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli, which
resigned recently, in part because its bills were not being paid.</TE>

<LD>There were two important moments. Corey Koskie's double in the fifth
inning gave the Twins a 2-1 lead. However, in the second inning,
Kevin Appier threw a wild pitch, allowing Torii Hunter to advance to
third. Hunter then scored on a sacrifice fly. If not for the wild
pitch, it's a 1-1 game.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   After scoring 31 runs in four games against the Yankees, the
Angels could manage only one run against the Twins, and they wouldn't
have scored that if not for Cristian Guzman's error. Maybe they spent
too much time celebrating their division series win, and not enough
time preparing for Minnesota.</LD>

<TE>   After Guzman's error allowed a run to score, Twin pitcher Joe Mays
made a point of going over to Guzman between innings to reassure the

<TE>   A big warning sign should be flashing for the Angels right now.
Throughout his career, a sure way to tell when Troy Glaus is in a
hitting slump is if he takes a lot of called third strikes. He took
two called third strikes Tuesday, one with the tying run on base in
the ninth inning.</TE>

<HD>Erstad Gives Team Some Local Presence</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>In North Dakota, a state colonized for baseball long ago by the
Minnesota Twins, the Angels have made inroads into developing a fan
base of their own.</LD>
<LD>   "They've been Twins fans their whole lives," Angel center fielder
Darin Erstad said. "Now they have someone else to cheer for."</LD>
<LD>   That someone is Erstad, a native son of North Dakota. In
Jamestown, population 15,000, a billboard proclaims the place as
Erstad's hometown. KSJB, a Jamestown radio station with a booming
signal that extends into six states and two Canadian provinces, airs
broadcasts of Angel games.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels send along shirts, caps and other promotional items for
the radio station to use in marketing the team, according to Angel
broadcasting director Jay Lucas. The Angels also provide tickets so
KSJB can invite listeners to win a contest to see Erstad and his team
play--in the Metrodome, of course, about a six-hour drive from
Jamestown.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas would love to sign up a radio station to air the Angels in
the Phoenix area, their spring training home, or in Las Vegas. No
such luck, but thanks to Erstad the Angels can be heard thousands of
miles from home, on KSJB.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be the most offbeat affiliate in baseball," Lucas said,
"and it's basically because of Darin."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia set himself up for criticism by setting up a
championship series rotation that could have Ramon Ortiz starting
twice in the Metrodome. The decibel level is loud and louder beneath
the dome, not the most beneficial environment for Ortiz, a
notoriously excitable sort.</TE>
<TE>   But Scioscia is well aware that Ortiz is a far better pitcher on
regular rest than on extra rest.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round of the playoffs, working on eight days' rest,
Ortiz gave up six runs in 2 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Ortiz went 5-6 with a 4.81 ERA on extra
rest and 10-3 with a 3.08 ERA on the regular four days' rest. He
pitches tonight with four days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Scott Schoeneweis was amused to pick up USA Today
and see his picture, above a caption that identified him as Erstad.
"We don't look anything at all alike whatsoever," Schoeneweis said,
"but it's not like anyone knows me to say, 'Oops, that's
Schoeneweis.' " ... The Angels assigned rookie infielder Chone
Figgins to the Arizona Fall League, but he made the playoff roster as
a pinch-runner and is spending October playing before crowds of
55,000 in the Metrodome instead of, well, 55 in Arizona. "I'll take
this any day," Figgins said. "But I still want to go there after the
season's over. I have some things to work on." ... Third-string
catcher Sal Fasano, who had been insurance against an injury to
Bengie and Jose Molina, is out for the season after suffering a torn
ligament in his elbow. Fasano was not on the playoff roster, and
General Manager Bill Stoneman said he did not plan to call up a minor
league catcher to replace Fasano on the taxi squad.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--David Eckstein grounded to the pitcher.
Darin Erstad singled to left. Tim Salmon grounded into a 6-4-3 double
play. No runs, one hit, none left.</LD>
<LD>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Bud Selig is in the Metrodome. He has
decided that if the score is deadlocked after this inning, they will
stop the game and declare it a tie. Jacque Jones popped to short.
Cristian Guzman grounded to first. Corey Koskie singled to right.
David Ortiz, professional hitter, swung at a 3-and-0 pitch and flied
to left. No runs, one hit, one left.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Garret Anderson grounded to short. Troy
Glaus struck out. It appears that plate umpire Ed Montague has a
different strike zone than the one the rest of the world uses. Brad
Fullmer flied to center. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 1, Angels 0--Torii Hunter hit a ball off the Hefty
bag in right for a double. Doug Mientkiewicz batting. Hunter took
third on a wild pitch. Mientkiewicz popped to third. Michael Cuddyer
walked on four pitches. A.J. Pierzynski flied to center, Hunter
scoring. It's too bad Fox analyst Steve "Psycho" Lyons' nickname
isn't "The Quiet Man." He makes Rex Hudler seem introverted. Luis
Rivas struck out. One run, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Scott Spiezio popped to the catcher.
Bengie Molina flied to right. Adam Kennedy singled to left. David
Eckstein singled to right, Kennedy to second. Eckstein is standing on
the bag at first and he is still dwarfed by Mientkiewicz. Next
season, Eckstein is going to wear Eddie Gaedel's old number. Erstad
grounded to short, but the ball went off Guzman's glove, between his
legs and into left, Kennedy scoring, Eckstein to third. Looks like
Game 4 against the Yankees. Wonder if Alfonso Soriano gave Guzman
some fielding tips before the game. Salmon flied to right. One run,
two hits, one error, two left.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Jones flied to right. Guzman grounded to
short. Koskie flied to right. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Anderson flied to left. Glaus bounced
to third. Fox reminds us to vote for the most memorable moment in
baseball history. My most memorable moment will be when they stop
interrupting the game by asking us to vote. Fullmer singled to
second. Spiezio grounded to first. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Ortiz singled to right. Hunter
sacrificed. Mientkiewicz walked. In Scrabble, Mientkiewicz could be
worth 122 points if you play your tiles right. Cuddyer flied to
right. Pierzynski popped to third. No runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Twins 1--Molina grounded to third. Kennedy flied
to left. Eckstein grounded to short. Joe Mays looks like Walter
Johnson out there. How was he only 4-8? No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Rivas, who walks about as often as
Professor X, drew a base on balls. Jones flied to left. Guzman lined
a single just over Eckstein's glove, Rivas to second. Koskie doubled
down the right-field line, Rivas scoring, Guzman stopping at third.
Ortiz popped to first. Hunter struck out. One run, two hits, two
left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Erstad popped to first. Salmon struck
out. Anderson hit a grounder between first and second and was thrown
out on a nice play by Rivas. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Brendan Donnelly pitching. Mientkiewicz
flied to left. Cuddyer flied to center. Pierzynski struck out
swinging. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Glaus flied to left. The game has been
so boring that even the normally raucous Metrodome crowd is quiet.
Fullmer grounded to second. Spiezio grounded to third. Time for a
nap. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Rivas grounded to third. Jones struck
out swinging. Guzman was hit by a pitch. Scott Schoeneweis pitching.
Koskie flied to right. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Orlando Palmeiro, batting for Molina,
struck out swinging. Kennedy grounded to short. The game was delayed
while someone from the stands ran on the field. It's Enrico Palazzo!
Eckstein grounded to short. Who are these guys, and what have they
done with the Angels? No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Jose Molina catching. Bobby Kielty,
batting for Ortiz, flied to right. Ben Weber pitching. Hunter struck
out swinging. Mientkiewicz struck out swinging. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Twins 2, Angels 1--Eddie "Latino Heat" Guardado pitching.
Erstad struck out swinging. Salmon walked. Why do Twins' fans wave
the Homer Hankie when the Angels are up? Do they want the Angels to
hit a homer? Chone Figgins ran for Salmon. Anderson flied to right.
Wouldn't that make the Angels hit a homer? Glaus took a called strike
three on a curveball right down the middle. Swing the bat! No runs,
no hits, one left.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * GAME 1/ MINNESOTA 2,
ANGELS 1</KH>
<HD>Angels Lost in a Mays</HD>
<DH>Right-hander is dominating for eight innings as Twins get
the advantage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Somewhere in New York this morning, a phone rings. Brian Cashman, the
general manager of the Yankees, answers. The caller is George
Steinbrenner, and the conversation is not pleasant. Explain,
Steinbrenner bellows, why I paid $33 million for starting pitchers
that could not do to the Angels what somebody named Joe Mays did to
them Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   After the Angels treated Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Mike
Mussina and David Wells like so many batting practice pitchers in the
first round of the playoffs, Mays put the Angel bats to sleep
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In what he called the "game of my career," Mays handcuffed the
Angels on four hits over eight innings, lifting the Minnesota Twins
to a 2-1 victory in the first game of the best-of-seven American
League championship series.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels hit .129 Tuesday. They hit .376 against the Yankees and
their decorated--and highly compensated--starters.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what the names are," Angel first baseman Scott
Spiezio said. "It matters where they throw the ball. Those guys were
giving us pitches to hit."</TE>
<TE>   The next pitch Mays gives the Angels to hit will be the first. If
he never wins another game, he can tell the grandkids about this one.</TE>
<TE>   He did not walk anyone. He did not give up an extra-base hit. The
Angels managed four singles, three hit to the opposite field and one
off the glove of the second baseman.</TE>
<TE>   He got 13 of his 21 outs on ground balls. The only hit after the
third inning was a ground ball, that infield single. The Angels
scored their only run on a ground ball, an unearned run on a ball
that rolled through the legs of Minnesota shortstop Cristian Guzman.</TE>
<TE>   Who is this Mays guy? He got shellacked by the Oakland Athletics
in the division series, and he sat out much of this season because of
an elbow injury. But the Angels remember him well from last season,
when he pitched a five-hit shutout in Anaheim and made the All-Star
team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like he's an anonymous guy," Angel designated hitter
Brad Fullmer said. "He was their best pitcher for a lot of last
season."</TE>
<TE>   He was the best pitcher on the field Tuesday, despite a valiant
effort from Angel starter Kevin Appier. He dodged a flurry of bullets
in his five innings, giving up five hits and three walks but only two
runs.</TE>
<TE>   But for one unfortunate pitch by Appier, the teams might still be
playing, and Mays might have been a footnote to the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins scored one run in the second inning, on a sacrifice fly,
but only because Appier threw a wild pitch that allowed Torii Hunter
to advance from second base to third. From second base, he would not
have scored on the fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels tied the score in the fourth inning, when Adam Kennedy
scored on that ground ball through the legs of Guzman.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins scored the winning run in the fifth inning, on a double
by Corey Koskie. Without that wild pitch, it's a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia could push no buttons Tuesday. The
Angels, so successful with their stolen bases and hit-and-run plays
and sacrifice bunts all season, could not use their favorite plays
because they never got the leadoff runner on base.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tough time pressuring them the way we wanted to,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   And even when the Angels thought they caught a break, that blew up
in their faces too.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the eighth inning, when Mays had retired 13
consecutive batters and thrown 98 pitches, Minnesota Manager Ron
Gardenhire asked Mays whether he could pitch the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eddie Guardado was warming up. "I can try to finish it, or
Eddie can," Mays said.</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire said he would have let Mays finish had he said, "Yeah,
I want it." But Mays, mindful of a little tightness in his arm in the
eighth, decided honesty was the best policy.</TE>
<TE>   So the Angels had been spared another inning of Mays. Guardado
struck out Darin Erstad, then walked Tim Salmon. Scioscia finally got
to push a button, bringing in Chone Figgins to run for Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   If the right-handed Mays had still been pitching, Figgins would
certainly have tried to steal second base, which would have put the
tying run into scoring position. But the left-handed Guardado baffled
the rookie runner, who could not decipher Guardado's move and kept
breaking back to first base when the pitcher threw home.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't get enough of a read to feel good about him
going," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson flied out and Troy Glaus struck out looking,
ending the game and leaving the Angels to explain their mysteriously
vanishing offense.</TE>
<TE>   There was no emotional letdown after the Yankee series, the Angels
insisted. The noise in the Metrodome was no problem. "I've heard it
louder. I've been here for Vikings-Packers," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Just a great night for Mays, the Angels said, and what can you do?
He dominated not by sheer speed but by his ability to put any of his
three pitches on the corners of the plate, every time.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, guys don't control their off-speed stuff like that,"
Salmon said. "He just didn't make any mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins improved to 13-2 in postseason play beneath their home
dome. In order to avoid a 2-0 deficit in the series, the Angels must
beat the Twins here and beat Rick Reed, another right-hander who
succeeds not by velocity but by location.</TE>
<TE>   "When you locate three pitches, it's tough to hit no matter how
hot you are," Fullmer said. "We'll come back tomorrow and hope we get
some mistakes."</TE>

<HD>Peralta Says He's Trying to Buy Angels</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Mexican billionaire Carlos Peralta confirmed Tuesday that he is
negotiating with the Walt Disney Co. to buy the Angels and said he
believes he is one of three bidders in a process he figures could
take "three or four months."</LD>
<LD>   Two other suitors--former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth
and the Nederlander family--have expressed interest in the Angels.
The Nederlander family, one of the first names in American theater,
includes two brothers who are limited partners in the New York
Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has applied for permission to share confidential financial
data with the Nederlanders but has not yet done so for Peralta, a
highly placed baseball source said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Peralta, who owns one Mexican League team and holds a minority
share in another team, attended the Angels' regular-season finale
last month and said he noted many Latinos in the sellout crowd. Under
Disney management, and under the previous Autry family management,
the Angels have failed to develop a significant fan base in the
Latino neighborhoods of Anaheim and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that the team is in an area with a dense Latino
population," Peralta told Reuters.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>All's Quiet in Heart of Lineup</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angels get zero production from Salmon, Anderson
and Glaus, who are hitless against the Twins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Even the Angels figured their offense would slow down a little in the
American League championship series, considering they couldn't take
the New York Yankee pitching staff to the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   What they didn't expect, though, was zero production from
heart-of-the-order batters Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus
in Game 1, helping the Minnesota Twins hang on for a 2-1 victory
Tuesday night before 55,562.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon, Anderson and Glaus--the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 batters--went
hitless in 11 at-bats combined against Minnesota starter Joe Mays and
closer Eddie Guardado, with only Salmon reaching base on a one-out
walk in the ninth. Anderson flied out and Glaus struck out looking
with Chone Figgins, running for Salmon, at first, providing a
familiar sight in ending a frustrating game for the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Mays and Guardado breezed through the rest of the club as well,
but the Angels' big run producers usually don't go so quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "You get used to those guys producing so much," second baseman
Adam Kennedy said. "You kind of come to expect it, so, yeah, you're
surprised a little. It's not like it's never happened before, but I
wouldn't count on that being the case too long."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they were tired from celebrating so much against the
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angels' AL division series victory over the Yankees,
Salmon, Anderson and Glaus batted .321 with six home runs and 14 runs
batted in. It looked so easy then and so difficult Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The problem?</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much, to sum up it, Mays was throwing strikes and not
throwing anything over the plate," said Anderson, who grounded out
twice and flied out twice. "If you hit your spots, and don't make any
mistakes over the plate, you're going to have some success, and
that's what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts said the Angels (Salmon, Anderson and Glaus, in particular)
pounded mistakes and good pitches in beating the Yankees, 3-1, in the
best-of-five series, but Mays' pitches were a little too good.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time since I've seen our guys that
off-balanced," hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "They just weren't
getting good swings at all off Mays. They weren't getting good reads
off of him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was making good pitches, all on the black all night, and it
was tough. The whole game was like that. When you get good pitching,
the offense wants to do good, so I think our guys were frustrated by
that."</TE>
<TE>   Watching Mays throw changeups on the corners for strikes certainly
wasn't fun for Salmon, Anderson and Glaus, but what could they do?</TE>
<TE>   "Really, I don't get frustrated, I just kept waiting for him to
leave something out over the plate," Anderson said. "It just didn't
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Patience is usually the correct move in such situations, but
patience only helps so much if a pitcher stays in a groove. Although
their results weren't good, Salmon, Anderson and Glaus had a good
approach at the plate, the Angels said.</TE>
<TE>   "He just did a great job shutting us down," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "Our guys went up there ... we just couldn't put any pressure
on those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they could have used help.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein and Darin Erstad provided only a tiny spark at the
top of the order, the Nos. 1 and 2 batters going two for eight
without a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely not all on those guys," Eckstein said. "We've
played as a team all year, we don't just rely on one guy, and that's
not going to change now. I definitely could have done some things
better with my at-bats, and that's what I'm going to try to do the
rest of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "But our guys [Salmon, Anderson and Glaus] will definitely make
their adjustments. They're going to figure out what they need to do
and do it. That's what they've done all year. We know that they're
going to have better results because we know what they're capable of
doing."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Mets exercised their $8-million contract option on
second baseman Roberto Alomar on Tuesday and waived pitcher Satoru
Komiyama.</LD>
<LD>   Alomar, acquired from Cleveland in a seven-player trade in
December, batted .266, his lowest batting average since his rookie
year of 1988. He had 11 home runs and 53 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   The Mets declined a $1-million option on Komiyama, signed as a
free agent in December. He was 0-3 with a 5.61 earned-run average in
25 games with New York.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona bought out the contracts of right-handed pitchers Rick
Helling, Armando Reynoso and Mike Morgan. The buyout for Helling was
$1.5 million, for Reynoso $375,000 and for Morgan $175,000....Utility
infielder Tomas Perez signed a two-year, $1.3-million contract with
Philadelphia....Toronto gave General Manager J.P. Ricciardi a
five-year contract, a week after denying Boston permission to

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gamboa, attacked by two fans during a September game at
Chicago's Comiskey Park, has been moved from first base coach to
bullpen coach by Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Gamboa, 54, said General Manager Allard Baird didn't give him a
reason for the switch.</TE>
<TE>   Baird said Tuesday the move wasn't related to the incident in
Chicago, in which William Ligue Jr. and his 15-year-old son came out
of the stands and pummeled Gamboa until Royal players stormed out of
the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the teenager was in juvenile court as prosecutors
refiled charges of aggravated battery and mob action against a state
police officer, who was working as a security guard at the game. The
charges had been dropped shortly after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, who remains in custody, faces the same charges for the
Gamboa beating. Ligue has been charged with aggravated battery.</TE>

<HD>Fans Must Turn Fox's Double Play</HD>
<DH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The confusion surrounding the television schedule for the first round
of baseball's playoffs is over, but now comes another problem.</LD>
<LD>   Both league championship series games today begin at the same
time.</LD>
<LD>   Game 2 of the American League series between the Angels and
Minnesota Twins begins at 5:15 p.m., as does Game 1 of the National
League series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis
Cardinals.</LD>
<TE>   "It was our decision," Fox Sports spokesman Dan Bell said Tuesday.
"We want to make these games available to the largest possible
audience, and if we aired a game in the afternoon, that would not be
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Our research indicates that viewership is 50% higher for an 8
p.m. [EDT] start than for a 4 p.m. [EDT] start. That's a pretty
significant increase."</TE>
<TE>   Because Fox can't televise two games at once, it is putting
today's NL game on Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, that game will be carried by Fox Sports Net 2.
That's because Fox Sports Net has the Kings' season opener against
the Phoenix Coyotes at Staples Center, plus the pregame ceremony in
which Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 jersey will be retired.</TE>
<TE>   After the baseball game, Fox Sports Net 2 will televise the
Galaxy's playoff game at Colorado, delayed. The soccer game begins at
6:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, the Kings can be seen on ESPN2, which is televising
the game nationally.</TE>
<TE>   As for head-to-head baseball telecasts, there is precedence. Last
year, when baseball's season was put on hold for a week because of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a cramped playoff schedule prompted
two league championship series games to be played simultaneously on
an NFL Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a combined 12.3 rating for the two baseball games,
the highest rating ever for Fox during a league championship series.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time Fox could be faced with have two games on a
weekday is a week from today, when Game 6 of the NL series and Game 7
of the AL series are scheduled. If both games are necessary, the NL
game will be played at 1:15 p.m. and the AL game at 5:15 p.m., both
televised by Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Fox figures people will be more likely to watch an afternoon game
if it is a decisive one.</TE>
<TE>   Today's head-to-head games will keep viewers wanting to see both
games busy clicking their remotes. But things could be worse. In
1995, the first year of the ill-fated Baseball Network, playoff games
were split nationally, , meaning only half the country got each game.</TE>
<TE>   Fox announced Tuesday that Monday night's decisive game in the San
Francisco-Atlanta division series averaged a 6.9 rating with a 12
share, bringing the average for Fox's six first-round telecasts to a
6.3/11, with an average audience size of 9.1 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The 6.3/11 was a 19% increase over last season's 5.3/10 and a 29%
increase over the 4.9/9 for Fox and NBC combined in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Minnesota is 0-4 in the NFL this season, but Viking Coach Mike Tice
is 5-4. That's because he also coaches his son's eighth-grade team.</LD>
<LD>   "We're 5-0, so that's good," Tice told the Associated Press.
"Maybe that's the only level I can win at."</LD>
<LD>   Aw, don't be so hard on yourself.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL single-season record for touchdowns
by a rookie?</TE>
<TE>   Ban 'em: David Letterman on his "Top Ten New York Met Promises for
Next Season." A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * "2-for-1 tickets for shirtless father and son lunatics."</TE>
<TE>   * "We're opening a second men's room."</TE>
<TE>   Mean and crude: Preparing for the Green Bay Packer-Chicago Bear
game on "Monday Night Football," radio station WMVP in Chicago staged
a satirical "Miss Wisconsin" contest for its listeners.</TE>
<TE>   The station called on Packer fans to bring women to the studios.</TE>
<TE>   Not pretty women, but large-boned women the station could make fun
of. Host Dan McNeil called it "Dog Day Friday" and station staffers
took pictures of the less-attractive hopefuls to post for Internet
voting on the WMVP Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Go for it: Thomas Boswell in the Washington Post:</TE>
<TE>   "If the Twins can somehow reach the Series, despite ranking 27th
among 30 teams in payroll, it's going to be one of the game's
legends.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, Minnesota has no one who hit over .300 or had 30
homers or 100 RBIs. No pitcher won more than 15 games or struck out
even 140 batters."</TE>
<TE>   Outside shot: Mark O'Meara would seem to be a logical choice as a
future Ryder Cup captain for the United States, but the PGA of
America might not forgive him for being among the first to raise the
compensation issue for Americans who compete in the event.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA made about $23 million from the 1999 Ryder Cup. To avoid a
player revolt, the PGA agreed to let players give $200,000 to the
charity of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the one that really started it," Curtis Strange, the captain
of this year's squad, told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "To be quite frank with you, I would be shocked if he ever got to
be the captain."</TE>
<TE>   Meddling man: Peter Vecsey of the New York Post says it's
inconceivable that Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban "didn't question
the officiating at his wedding."</TE>
<TE>   Don't listen: From comedy writer Earl Hochman: "It turns out that
those two sports psychologists Jacksonville Jaguar Coach Tom Coughlin
hired to counsel his players aren't licensed, and about as qualified
to offer players psychological advice as Randy Moss."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1988, the Dodgers defeated the Mets,
5-4, in 12 innings to even their National League championship series
at two games each.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Scioscia hit a game-tying two-run homer in the ninth and Kirk
Gibson won it with a solo shot in the 12th, knotting the series at
two games each.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gale Sayers of the Chicago Bears, 22, in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "Now that hockey
fans can go online to buy game-worn NHL jerseys, just one question:
Does that $12,500 for a Mark Messier sweater include tax, handling
fee and bloodstains?"</TE>

<HD>Washington's Neuheisel Cited as Colorado Put on Probation</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado was put on two years' probation by the NCAA on Tuesday for
recruiting violations, most of them occurring under former coach Rick
Neuheisel.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA cut the school's scholarships and accepted Colorado's
self-imposed recruiting limits, including reducing the number of
visits by recruits.</LD>
<LD>   Neuheisel, now coaching at Washington, was barred from off-campus
recruiting for the Huskies until May 31, 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado was not banned from TV or bowl appearances but must
reduce the number of new scholarships it offers from 25 to 20 in
either the 2003-04 or 2004-05 academic year.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to stress that at no time did I intend to break NCAA
regulations, and I never suggested to my staff we operate outside
those rules," Neuheisel said in a statement. "I never deceived
anyone, nor was I dishonest."</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC safety Troy Polamalu, who suffered a high right ankle sprain
against Washington State, did not practice Tuesday but said he plans
to play against California.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels a little bit better," Polamalu said. "It's coming along
slowly but surely. Whether I start and play every snap or just play a
few plays, I'm preparing mentally like I do every week."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said Polamalu probably will not practice
during the week and his availability could be a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do with him right now--we just have to
kind of chill him until the end of the week and see what the response
is," Carroll said. "It's not a serious ankle [problem] that's going
to keep him out for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Davis struggled in his first competitive kicking situation
since injuring his left leg during practice last Thursday. Davis
missed three of four field-goal attempts during drills. Ryan Killeen
made all four of his attempts.</TE>

24, will begin a light throwing program today.</TE>

<TE>   Dave Ragone led Louisville to three touchdowns in the third
quarter and the Cardinals (4-2, 2-0) hung on for a 38-32 victory over
Memphis in a Conference USA game at Memphis, Tenn. The Tigers are 2-4
and 1-3.... Ohio State freshman running back Maurice Clarett won't be
disciplined for his sideline outbursts at Northwestern, Coach Jim
Tressel said. Cameras caught Clarett and running backs coach Tim
Spencer yelling at each other and Clarett also was spotted exchanging
words with a teammate. Clarett did not comment because he was
displeased with questions from the media about his strained
relationship with teammates, an Ohio State spokesman said.... Utah
quarterback Lance Rice has been benched in favor of sophomore Brett
Elliott for Saturday's game at San Diego State .... Tennessee
quarterback Casey Clausen's sore left shoulder should not keep him
out of the Volunteers' game against Georgia, but tailback Cedric
Houston is doubtful because of a torn ligament in his left thumb.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Giguere's Presence Means Less Worry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are so many things the Mighty Ducks hope to learn over the next
few weeks, beginning in the season opener at St. Louis on Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   * Will the offense be better?</LD>
<LD>   * Will the defense be weaker?</LD>
<TE>   * Will they be good enough this season to finish ahead of every
expansion team that followed them into the NHL?</TE>
<TE>   What the Ducks already know, though, is plenty. They will get
solid goaltending every night. That was clear midway through last
season, when Jean-Sebastien Giguere took over the job and grew into
the potential that had made him a first-round draft pick in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "After the outstanding season he had, we're expecting the same
from him," defenseman Keith Carney said. "It's nice to have a
top-rated goalie behind us. It allows us to play with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere does instill that. His 20-25-1 record last season masked
his being one of the top goalies in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   His 2.13 goals-against average broke Guy Hebert's team record of
2.42. He ranked fifth in the NHL, ahead of Dominik Hasek and Martin
Brodeur. He was tied for fifth with a .920 save mark. .</TE>
<TE>   That the Ducks scored only 175 goals, the second fewest in the
NHL, kept Giguere from receiving more recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at his numbers last year, top five in the NHL playing on
this team, to me that's an unbelievable stat," Coach Mike Babcock
said.</TE>
<TE>   Said center Matt Cullen: "We know that he can keep us in every
game and that is huge for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski, who has been bothered by a sore
right knee, is expected to play Thursday.... The Ducks sent
defenseman Chris O'Sullivan to minor league Cincinnati, trimming
their roster to 23.... Defenseman Pavel Trnka will be put on injured
reserve until he recovers from a strained groin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are still negotiating a buyout on the contracts of
veterans Denny Lambert and German Titov.</TE>
<TE>   "We have informed their agents," General Manager Bryan Murray
said. "Now we have to follow up on that and make a proposal to them."</TE>
<TE>   Titov is owed $1.5 million this season. Lambert is owed $550,000
this season and $600,000 next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks announced their games will be carried on KPLS (830),
which will broadcast a minimum of 54 games this season.... The Ducks
will open the season with a $39,748,000 payroll, not including money
owed to Jason York, Lambert and Titov.</TE>

<HD>Jones Is Galaxy Leader</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Team captain, who has nine points in MLS playoffs,
is credited as being the team's driving force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Galaxy players' hearts dropped more quickly than Cobi Jones did
when he fell to the Rose Bowl grass in a heap on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't just the speed with which Jones, the Galaxy team
captain and unquestioned heart and soul of the franchise since its
1996 inception, went down that worried onlookers.</LD>
<LD>   It was in how much agony he appeared to be in after a full-speed
collision with Colorado defender Robin Fraser in the fourth minute of
the Major League Soccer semifinal series opener.</LD>
<TE>   Tossing, turning and clutching his side, Jones began vomiting as
trainers appeared with a stretcher. He was convulsing as was carried
off the field, and the Galaxy's hopes for finally winning the MLS Cup
seemed to shudder with him.</TE>
<TE>   This season more than any, the Galaxy's fortunes seem to rise and
fall with the dreadlocked Jones. So it was no real surprise that
after the attacking midfielder gathered himself, his return helped
spark the Galaxy to a dominating 4-0 victory over the Rapids and gave
it added confidence for Game 2 tonight at Invesco Field in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Win, and the Galaxy is in the MLS Cup for the fourth time--the
third in four years. Tie or lose, and Game 3 is Saturday at Cal State
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been the inspiration and really the driving force behind our
run this year," Galaxy defender Danny Califf said. "We didn't really
know what his reaction was going to be after the World Cup, coming
off such a high and coming back to the club team. But he's really
been ... the guy that's propelled the team to where it's at right
now.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, he continues to be that guy and it gives L.A. its
first championship."</TE>
<TE>   Consider: Jones missed nine MLS matches while he was with the U.S.
national team and the Galaxy went 4-5, getting outscored 15-12. With
Jones in the lineup, the Galaxy is 15-5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, 32, has also experienced a rebirth as a scorer in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After gaining a Barry Bonds-esque reputation of shrinking in the
playoffs by scoring only three goals in his first six postseasons,
Jones already has three this year.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in his three assists and, with nine points, he is the
second-leading scorer in the playoffs behind Carlos Ruiz, who has a
postseason record 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice, but I'm just continuing to play, doing my thing,"
Jones said. "It's about winning the games, that's the most important
thing."</TE>
<TE>   And that suits Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I think few people know is when [Jones] played
for me at UCLA, he was pound-for-pound one of the strongest athletes
on campus," Schmid said. "He's extremely strong and sometimes I don't
think Cobi gets credit for the toughness that he has."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Colorado Rapids</TE>
<TE>   6:30 PDT</TE>
<TE>   Invesco Field, Denver</TE>
<TE>   TV--Fox Sports Net 2 (delayed 8 p.m.)</TE>
<TE>   Radio--XTRA (1150), KTNQ (1020, Spanish).</TE>
<TE>   Records--With Saturday's 4-0 drubbing at the Rose Bowl, the No.
1-seeded Galaxy leads the No. 5-seeded Rapids in the
first-team-to-five points semifinal series, three points to none.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Rapids--3-2-0, including playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Galaxy has outscored the Rapids, 11-1, in the teams'
last three meetings.</TE>

<HD>Bauer Has a Rewarding First Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In many ways, it's no surprise that Beth Bauer was this year's rookie
of the year on the LPGA Tour. She was the American Junior Golf Assn.
player of the year in 1998, the NCAA freshman of the year while at
Duke in '99 and an NCAA All-American in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   It's just that success as a professional took a little longer than
she had anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   After she left Duke after her sophomore season in anticipation of
joining the tour, she was greeted by a harsh dose of reality. She
failed to make it through LPGA Tour qualifying school in 2000,
shooting 70-74-76-76, and was relegated to a year on the Futures
Tour--the minor league of women's professional golf.</LD>
<TE>   "I was devastated," Bauer said Tuesday at Monarch Beach Golf Links
in Dana Point, where she will be paired with Grace Park in the
Hyundai Team Matches, Nov. 16-17. "I was like, 'This is not where I
want to play.' "</TE>
<TE>   Turns out it might have been a blessing. Bauer learned her game
was not ready for the upper echelon of golf. So she worked out some
kinks--most specifically in her putting--and reestablished her
potential by winning four times on the 2001 Futures Tour and setting
a season earnings record of $84,529.</TE>
<TE>   That earned her an exemption for the 2002 LPGA Tour, and she made
the most of the opportunity. She has earned $429,353, 17th-best on
the tour, having made 20 of 23 cuts with six top-10
finishes--including five in her last six tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tampa, Fla., Bauer is only the fourth U.S.-born rookie
of the year since 1988 on a tour starving for an American star to
compete with Swede Annika Sorenstam, South Korean Se Ri Pak and
Australian Karrie Webb.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while I realized that maybe it was good to be on the
Futures Tour," Bauer said. "Maybe if I went to the LPGA Tour right
away, I would have fallen on my face and lost all my confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Bauer had dealt with adversity before.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 14, her father, John, died suddenly of Guillain-Barre
Syndrome, a rare nerve disorder. John, a club professional, taught
Beth golf.</TE>
<TE>   He also taught her patience, which came in handy during her stay
on the Futures Tour and now, as she awaits her first LPGA Tour
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played 23 events this year without a win, so I'm just trying
to find out what I need to do better," Bauer said. "I've had a few
chances this year, but this game is all about timing. It just wasn't
my time yet."</TE>

<HD>Roosevelt Not Surprised by Its Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The football stands were packed Friday night at Roosevelt High. The
overflow crowd spilled onto the dirt track that circles the field.</LD>
<LD>   The defending City Section champion Dorsey Dons were making a
visit to the Boyle Heights campus, so while hope may have been in the
air, there weren't many true believers in the Rough Riders.</LD>
<LD>   Not even Tony Sanchez's little brother.</LD>
<TE>   "Before the game, he said to me, 'Man, you guys are going to
lose,' " said Sanchez, a Roosevelt linebacker. "He wasn't going to go
to the game at first because he didn't think we'd win."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt has a few more believers this week. The Rough Riders
sent their fans into a frenzy and sent shockwaves through the rest of
the section with a 29-21 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were shooting skyrockets outside the school," Roosevelt's
standout running back Jody Adewale said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jose Casagran said he was driving around the neighborhood
Saturday night and saw people wearing Roosevelt football jerseys. On
their return to class Monday, the players were treated as if they
were celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stopped by about 50 people before I got to class," said
Sanchez, the team's defensive leader.</TE>
<TE>   Defeating Dorsey may have surprised everyone else, but not the
players. The last two meetings were decided by a total of 11 points
and the Dons needed a late touchdown each time to avoid an upset.</TE>
<TE>   Casagran helped bring his team down to earth when he pointed out
mistakes during the film session Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Rough Riders play an intersectional game at Santa
Fe Springs St. Paul. The Swordsmen are only 1-2-1 but are coming off
a 21-7 victory over Wilmington Banning.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been this close to beating one of the top teams,"
said Adewale, who rushed for 116 yards and two touchdowns against
Dorsey. "[The victory over Dorsey is] a little bonus. It puts us on
the map, but we haven't proved anything yet."</TE>
<TE>   Said Sanchez: "We know every time out, every team is going to come
at us with their 'A' game."</TE>
<TE>   This is the attitude Casagran has cultivated in five years as
Roosevelt's coach after coming from archrival Garfield, where he was
an assistant to current Carson Coach John Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Casagran always believed Roosevelt could be more than only the
best team in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went to the [Invitational] final two years ago, we made
the kids realize that there is life beyond the Classic," said
Casagran, referring to the annual Garfield-Roosevelt game. "Obviously
that's a big game and we want to win, but that isn't the only game.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, we had won our final game and everyone thought we
were going to the [Championship] playoffs. The players were crushed
to be put back in [the Invitational]. That was when I knew we had
turned the corner."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt, Fremont and Taft are the only teams in the section with
4-0 records.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westchester won its Western League opener Friday in dramatic--and
controversial--fashion when Wallace Hightower ran in a two-point
conversion in double overtime to defeat Fairfax, 22-20.</TE>
<TE>   Hightower was attempting an extra-point kick after the Comets
scored a touchdown to tie the score, 20-20. The kick was low and
bounced off an offensive lineman. The senior grabbed the ball out of
the air and went around the left side to score.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax Coach Shane Cox said the play should have been blown dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The field goal and try rules are two different things," Cox said.
"A field goal is a numbered and defined play. As soon as Hightower
kicked the ball into the lineman, it should have been blown dead
right there."</TE>
<TE>   He's right. According to the National Federation of State High
School Assns.' football rulebook, a point-after try ends when "it is
apparent a drop kick or place kick will not score."</TE>
<TE>   Cox filed an appeal on Tuesday with the City Section, but section
administrator Jeff Halpern said his organization does not have the
authority to overturn a referee's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The national high school football rules specifically say that you
cannot protest the ruling of a judgment call on the field," Halpern
said. "[Otherwise,] we would be very busy with this type of stuff
every week."</TE>
<TE>   Halpern said it would be up to the schools involved if they wanted
to resume the game from the point of the kick.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester Athletic Director Brian Henderson said it is unlikely
the contest will be resumed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a human factor involved and the officials made an error,"
Henderson said. "I just don't think it's worth it to go over there
for a [kick] attempt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When has Sylmar lost three games in a season on its own field?</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Engilman can't remember and he has been the Spartans' coach
for the last 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Sylmar is 2-2, having picked up a victory because of Dorsey's
forfeit. But the Spartans have lost to visiting L.A. Jordan and North
Hollywood on consecutive Fridays, and the problem is clear, at least
to Engilman.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively, we're having problems," he said. "Big plays are just
killing us."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Sylmar plays a nonleague game at Chatsworth (2-2),
which is coming off a 48-26 loss to Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see us pick up some momentum," Engilman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chatsworth poses a lot of problems for us because they can throw
the ball so well. Jason Moss is rusty [after sitting out the first
two games of the season because of grades] but he'll probably go off
against us."</TE>
<TE>   Engilman had threatened to file a protest to the section regarding
the officiating in his team's loss to Jordan. He decided against it,
but he didn't give the referees very high marks.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't want those same officials at our future games," he
said. "It's a shame when you have guys work their behinds off all
week and then a guy who's a part-time official comes in and ruins it
for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (4-0); 2. Fremont (4-0); 3. Birmingham (2-2);
4. Carson (3-1); 5. Roosevelt (4-0); 6. Gardena (3-1); 7. Crenshaw
(2-2); 8. Banning (2-2); 9. Jordan (3-1); 10. Venice (3-1).</TE>

<LD>The S &amp; R Sport Cup boys' water polo tournament, formerly known as
the Southern California Invitational, is changing sites.</LD>
<LD>   Because of a renovation at the Heritage Park Aquatic Complex in
Irvine, the tournament's longtime site, the 16-team field will begin
play Friday at Newport Harbor High and Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament pits top teams from Northern California against top
teams from Southern California. Long Beach Wilson, ranked No. 1 by
The Times, is seeded first, followed by North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake, Anaheim Servite and Corona del Mar. Northern
California teams include Carmichael Jesuit and San Jose Bellarmine.</LD>
<TE>   The championship game is scheduled for 8:40 p.m. Saturday at
Belmont Plaza.</TE>

<TE>   The Calabasas boys' water polo team went 10 years without a
victory against Malibu in games in the Frontier League. While that
streak will live on, at least the Coyotes can now claim a victory
against their former league rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas, which moved to the Marmonte League this season,
defeated Malibu, 8-7, in the semifinals of the Zack Hahn tournament
last month at Calabasas High. Senior David Dryjanski keyed the
victory with five goals and four steals.</TE>
<TE>   David Hershman, who has coached at Calabasas for 26 years, said
the victory was uplifting, though the Coyotes didn't play nearly as
well later that day in a 13-11 loss to Encino Crespi in the
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an emotional roller coaster," Hershman said. "We had a
real highlight beating Malibu, but then we were a little disappointed
the way we played against Crespi."</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Malibu got its revenge, defeating Calabasas,
14-7.</TE>

<LD>After winning six races in the first five days of the Oak Tree meet
to take the lead in the jockey standings, Corey Nakatani won't have
many opportunities to build on his advantage today.</LD>
<LD>   Nakatani, who earned his six wins with 30 mounts, is named to ride
only three horses. He is on 7-5 morning-line choice Himalayan in the
first and contenders Come Back Ronnie in the sixth and That Cool Cat
in the seventh.</LD>
<LD>   Himalayan, a 2-year-old Mountain Cat filly, is trying claimers for
the first time after finishing off the board in consecutive graded
stakes at Hollywood Park and Del Mar.</LD>
<TE>   Come Back Ronnie is the 5-1 second choice in the sixth, a $62,500
claimer at one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   That Cool Cat is 8-1, but the late runner could get an ideal
set-up in a race filled with need-the-lead types.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Sightseek, a Distant View filly trained by Bobby
Frankel, will try for her third win in four starts and her first in a
stakes in the $150,000 Raven Run at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Edgar Prado. The jockey won eight races over the
weekend at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Garrett Gomez and Jose Valdivia Jr. The riders combined
to begin Oak Tree two for 33.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Window B, Holy Mackerel,
Valiant Vision and No Curfew in the fifth, singling Turkish Prize in
the sixth, using That Cool Cat, Full Strike and Big Team Spirit in
the seventh and Chi Chi Nette, Tahitian Rain and Life Estate in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/13. Money: Previous day/meet

<HD>Kings Open New Season in the Black</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Expectations high for L.A. as key components of
95-point team from 2001-02 remain intact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the knowledge that a smoother break from the gate last fall
probably would have kept them out of Denver in April, the Kings will
open their 36th NHL season tonight with a game against the Phoenix
Coyotes at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings' 8-14-4-2 start last season was one of the worst in
franchise history and doomed them, despite the league's best record
over the season's last 4 1/2 months, to a first-round playoff matchup
against the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   The Avalanche, defending its 2001 Stanley Cup title, won the
series with a 4-0 Game 7 victory at Denver, eliminating the Kings for
the second consecutive season.</LD>
<TE>   Many times since, King Coach Andy Murray has said the only
difference in the series was that the Avalanche, seeded second in the
Western Conference, carried home-ice advantage over the
seventh-seeded Kings.</TE>
<TE>   And so, if the sole purpose of a six-month, 82-game regular season
is "positioning for the playoffs," as King defenseman Mattias
Norstrom said this week, the maneuvering starts tonight for the
optimistic Kings, whose 95 points last season left them only four
points behind the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   After a pregame ceremony in which Wayne Gretzky's jersey No. 99
will be retired, the Kings will break out their old black and silver
uniforms and kick off the 10th season since their Gretzky-led run to
the 1993 Stanley Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   With the goal of marking the anniversary with an encore appearance
next spring, they'll challenge the Coyotes with the same nucleus of
players that compiled a league-best record of 32-13-7-2 after Dec. 8
last season, posted a franchise-record 2.29 goals-against average and
excelled on special teams, leading the league on the power play and
ranking third in penalty killing.</TE>
<TE>   Other than defenseman Philippe Boucher, who signed with the Dallas
Stars in July as an unrestricted free agent, all of their key
components remain.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, they have the same core group that stumbled last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Murray has said the Kings overall played as well during the first
two months last season, when they lost 10 of 12 one-goal decisions,
as they did during the last four, when they won 14 of 20.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, he hinted for the first time Tuesday, was that
goaltender Felix Potvin wasn't as sharp in the early going.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that with the shortened training camp, our goaltending
wasn't at the level it would normally be because our goalies hadn't
seen enough shots," he said, referring to a truncated camp
necessitated by a regular-season schedule that included a two-week
Olympic break. "We had a better training camp schedule this year, but
we also brought our goalies in 10 days before camp."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin and backup Jamie Storr will look out from the net at a
familiar core of veteran players. Among them: a dangerous top line of
Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh, plus a strong defense
led by Norstrom, Mathieu Schneider and Aaron Miller. Miller, however,
will start the season on injured reserve and probably will sit out
until mid-November after off-season abdominal surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But the 23-man roster, which was set Tuesday with the signing of
free-agent defenseman Brad Norton to a one-year, $450,000 contract
and the demotion of Jason Holland to the minors, also is sprinkled
with newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most promising among them is Russian rookie Alexander
Frolov. The 20-year-old right wing will start the season on the
second line with Eric Belanger, an erstwhile checker who moves into
an expanded role as the No. 2 center, and holdover Bryan Smolinski,
who moves from center to wing.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski slumped to a career-low 13 goals last season, Belanger
scored eight in a season limited to 53 games because of a wrist
injury and Frolov scored 18 in 41 games in the Russian elite league,
where he was the rookie of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Murray has set a lofty goal for the trio: 75 goals.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't I always say you get from people what you expect of them?"
the coach said. "If I expect Eric Belanger to get 10 goals and
Alexander Frolov to get 10 and Bryan Smolinski to get what he got
last year, that's what we could be getting, so we've set the standard
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "That's three 25-goal seasons, and all three guys are capable."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Allison, Palffy and Deadmarsh combined for 80 goals,
nearly 40% of the Kings' total, and Palffy and Deadmarsh were the
only Kings who scored more than 19, so three 25-goal seasons from the
second line is a stretch, to say the least.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it doesn't hurt to dream.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, anything is possible, including a fast start to the
season leading to home-ice advantage in the playoffs next spring.</TE>

<HD>Even Sidelined, Shaq Can't Be Contained</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal traveled here with the Lakers, more than two hours
by bus Tuesday, for their exhibition opener. He said once again that
he has no idea when he will play after undergoing toe surgery on
Sept. 11. He said he hopes to begin light jogging next week.</LD>
<LD>   Then (surprise!) he grew playful before the Lakers' 101-99 loss to
the Clippers before a sellout crowd of 10,097 at Centennial Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to kick your ... Yao Ming," O'Neal whispered into a
reporter's tape recorder, referring to the Houston Rockets' top draft
pick. "Shaq-zilla is coming."</LD>
<TE>   Asked about the Sacramento Kings, he said, "I'm not worried about
the Sacramento Queens. Write it down. Take a picture. I'm not going
to talk about this all year. When I get back, there's going to be
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about reinforcement of the "Shaq rule," which prohibits
free-throw shooters from stepping over the line before the ball hits
the rim, he said, "I cross the line to mess with you. The officials
came to me before every game in the playoffs and warned me. I said,
'Call it.' It's not going to bother me. They've already made up one
'Shaq rule' with that ... defense [the zone].</TE>
<TE>   "Complaining won't stop me. It will only make me angry. You don't
want me angry."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Michael Olowokandi, his Clipper counterpart who
suggested O'Neal grow up after the two nearly came to blows in a game
last season, "Donald Sterling showed me he's not in my league."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers and Olowokandi failed to agree during the off-season
on a long-term "max-out" deal worth about $100 million over the next
seven seasons. Instead, Olowokandi took a one-season qualifying offer
worth $6.1 million. He will be an unrestricted free agent next July
1.</TE>
<TE>   "No," O'Neal said when asked if he was still upset with Olowokandi
after their confrontation last season, "I'm not mad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson took the NBA's threat to crack down on
O'Neal's penchant for stepping over the free-throw line a bit more
seriously than his oft-criticized center. Jackson said he has been
told there are at least two other players, including Clipper point
guard Andre Miller, who are every bit as guilty as O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson dismissed the NBA coaches who have concerned themselves
with keeping O'Neal behind the line as "whiners and complainers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As promised, Jackson played almost everyone in uniform. O'Neal and
Rick Fox, suffering from back spasms, did not dress. Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry played everyone in uniform too, but he had little choice
since eight players on the training camp roster are injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers led by as many as 13 points, but the Clippers rallied
behind free-agent forward Mike Batiste's 13 second-half points.
Batiste's jump shot from the left baseline with 6.6 seconds left gave
the Clippers the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette led the Clippers with 23 points in 33 minutes.
Andre Miller added 17 points in his Clipper debut. Kobe Bryant,
Kareem Rush and Jannero Pargo had 13 apiece for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clipper forward Melvin Ely aggravated the tendinitis in his right
big toe after landing awkwardly after getting hacked by Laker forward
Devean George midway through the first quarter. Ely had to be carried
to the locker room.</TE>

<HD>Sticking It Out</HD>
<DH>Enduring the infamy of his on-ice assault, McSorley gets
second chance, returning to hockey as a coach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He had weathered the shame of a criminal conviction that earned him
everlasting infamy far beyond the NHL, horrific images of him
chopping down an opponent with his stick flickering across the
nightly news and forever branding him a thug.</LD>
<LD>   He had quietly sat out a yearlong suspension, by far the longest
in league history for an on-ice infraction, biting his tongue while
pundits besmirched his reputation from Malibu to Moose Jaw, Hawthorne
to Halifax.</LD>
<LD>   Happily engaged to a professional beach volleyball player, he was
contentedly ensconced in Manhattan Beach, one of the world's
loveliest addresses, and building a palatial beachfront home in
neighboring Hermosa Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Financially, he was set for life.</TE>
<TE>   So why would Marty McSorley want to return to professional hockey,
to revisit the ignominy of his painful exit from the sport?</TE>
<TE>   And why, in turn, would professional hockey want him back?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to the first question, McSorley says over coffee during
an interview not far from the ocean in Manhattan Beach, is simple
enough: He loves it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a spark there that I really can't extinguish," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, instead of relaxing on the beach with his wife, Leanne
Schuster, this winter or traveling the world, as he did during his
hiatus from the game, the newlywed McSorley will slog through 16-hour
days coaching the Springfield (Mass.) Falcons, American Hockey League
affiliate of the Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   You read right: McSorley, a former King perhaps best known in the
Southland as the saboteur who derailed the club's championship hopes
when he was caught using an improper stick in the 1993 Stanley Cup
finals, is a coach.</TE>
<TE>   As to why the Coyotes would entrust him with their top prospects,
one step removed from the NHL, they say that answer is simple too.</TE>
<TE>   They know him.</TE>
<TE>   McSorley served long and hard as an on-ice bodyguard for Wayne
Gretzky, co-owner of the Coyotes, keeping bullies like himself off
the Great One's back. His agent was Mike Barnett, now general manager
of the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   They say there is more to McSorley, 39, than those unforgettable
images of him striking Donald Brashear of the Vancouver Canucks in
the head with his stick during a game at Vancouver, Canada, two years
ago--an incident so brutal that McSorley was prosecuted in provincial
court in British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   They consider McSorley an ideal choice to work with young,
impressionable prospects, the very picture of perseverance and
dedication when he played.</TE>
<TE>   Though not drafted and only marginally talented, McSorley battled
his way through 17 seasons with six NHL teams, winning two
championships with Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers in the 1980s and
racking up 3,381 penalty minutes, more than all but two other players
in NHL history.</TE>
<TE>   "Marty McSorley may be the best example today of a player who
enjoyed a stellar career yet willed himself into the league," Barnett
says. "He was never drafted, yet the commitment he made to himself to
try and improve every day, every month, was something he could never
waver from if he wanted to play in the National Hockey League. Once
he got into the league, he was bound and determined no one was going
to take that away from him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the understanding he's going to impact on our players. At
the minor league level, that's first and foremost, that you need to
make a commitment to yourself and pay a price to maximize your
physical potential as a National Hockey Leaguer."</TE>
<TE>   McSorley scored a career-best 15 goals and 41 points for the Kings
in the 1992-93 season, one of three seasons he ranked among the
league's top 10 defensemen in goal scoring. First and foremost,
though, he was an enforcer.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out on the ice to fight sometimes," he says, offering no
apologies for a career that, before the Brashear incident, included
seven other suspensions for acts ranging from cross-checking an
opponent in the forehead to eye-gouging during a fight. "Everybody in
the building knew I was out there to fight."</TE>
<TE>   The night of Feb. 21, 2000, was one of those.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the Boston Bruins against the Vancouver Canucks, less
than a minute remaining and the Bruins trailing, 5-2, McSorley was
sent into the game to fight Brashear, McSorley later testified.
Earlier, Brashear had inadvertently injured Bruin goaltender Byron
Dafoe, then taunted the Bruin bench.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next was caught on videotape and replayed ad nauseam
for months:</TE>
<TE>   From behind, the 6 foot 1, 235-pound McSorley approaches the 6-2,
235-pound Brashear, who is skating without the puck, and clubs him on
the side of the face with a quick, hard swing of his stick.</TE>
<TE>   Brashear crumbles to the ice. The back of his skull hits the
frozen surface as his helmet pops loose and, after lying motionless
for a moment, he begins to convulse. He is carried off on a stretcher
and taken to a hospital to spend the night, having suffered a
concussion that will sideline him for 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks were justifiably outraged, the general public
horrified.</TE>
<TE>   Even McSorley's wife-to-be, watching on television, was incensed.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the replay," Schuster says, "I was angry with Marty."</TE>
<TE>   Her anger quickly turned to sympathy, however, after she'd heard
his explanation, that he hadn't intended to hit Brashear in the head
but instead was aiming for a shoulder in an attempt to goad Brashear
into a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Others didn't buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "If McSorley plays another game in this league," Canuck defenseman
Mattias Ohlund told the Vancouver Sun, "then this league is a ...
joke."</TE>
<TE>   He never did.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly eight months after the incident, on Oct. 6, 2000, Judge
William Kitchen concluded a nonjury trial in Vancouver by finding
McSorley guilty of "assaulting Donald Brasher with a weapon, a hockey
stick."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL, which already had suspended McSorley for the last 23
games of the 1999-2000 season, extended the ban to a full calendar
year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McSorley didn't believe he was finished. Anticipating a
return to the ice when his suspension was lifted Feb. 21, 2001, he
joined a minor league team in Grand Rapids, Mich. But he cut short
the conditioning stint after realizing that no NHL team was going to
sign him. "For whatever reason," he says, arching his eyebrows as if
to imply that his suspension, in reality, was a lifetime ban.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he was 37 at the time and had played for five teams in
five seasons. His playing days seemed numbered, even without his
excess baggage.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the suspension and the criminal conviction had little
impact on McSorley's life. He served no jail time. Kitchen, in
sentencing McSorley, had issued a "conditional discharge,"
stipulating that for 18 months McSorley must not "engage in any
sporting event where Donald Brashear is on the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   McSorley didn't, and last spring his criminal record was expunged.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McSorley says that Kitchen's assertion that "Brashear was
stuck as intended ... an NHL player would never, ever miss" is "a
joke." He says also that his peers understand what happened in
Vancouver, that hockey players had clubbed each other before this
incident and that they continue to club each other.</TE>
<TE>   "They know that there are players put on the ice in certain
situations to do less-than-attractive jobs ... and if they don't do
it, somebody else will," he says. "Some of them gave me a hug and
said, 'We're proud of you.' Proud of me not for what happened, but
proud of me just for having the courage to say, 'I believe it never
should have happened; it was a mistake.'</TE>
<TE>   "Is it the only time [something like this] has ever happened? No.
Nobody likes to see it. I didn't like to see it. Did I feel bad for
Donald? Absolutely. I would rather have had Donald turn around and
drop the gloves, as intended. And they understand that. You know,
Gordie Howe made the comment, 'I've done worse.' "</TE>
<TE>   Though disappointed that his career ended on such a sour note,
McSorley says the fallout from the incident has not been all that
bad.</TE>
<TE>   An engaging, personable man, he says he is never scorned.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a tough time buying a beer in Canada because I get people
coming up who say what they really feel about what happened," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Of his forced retirement, he says, "I think, in a good way, it
affected my life. I got myself prepared to make the next step and
part of that next step was to continue to buy real estate, develop
properties [in the South Bay]....</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down with Leanne and said, 'Let's build a house, let's try
to plant some roots.' It forced me to reset my goals."</TE>
<TE>   Free to roam, he traveled to Australia, where he surfed,
participated in hockey clinics and attended the Australian Open
tennis tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In Switzerland, where his brother Chris coaches, he rode the bus
and joined the team for practices. In London, he played in two
charity games. In Canada, he played in a Christmas tournament on a
team with his six brothers.</TE>
<TE>   He watched Schuster, an Olympic hopeful from Mesa, Ariz., play
volleyball. And on Aug. 17, they were married north of Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the first year out was the toughest because your whole
daily routine has changed dramatically," Schuster says. "But to be
honest, I think he really enjoyed kind of taking a step back and
being free to do what he wanted to do and being able to just be a fan
of the game instead of in the middle of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, though, he found himself drawn back into hockey.</TE>
<TE>   As a spectator, he attended junior games as well as NHL games. A
few players, he says, asked if he'd like to be their agent. He
considered buying a junior team.</TE>
<TE>   And more than one team, he says, asked him about coaching.</TE>
<TE>   He met with Gretzky during a Mighty Duck game last season in
Anaheim and eventually worked out a deal with the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   McSorley, whose team opens its season Friday against the Hartford
Wolf Pack, won't reveal his salary but says it's not much.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say a vast majority of the [players], if not all, will
be making more money," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To McSorley, it matters not at all.</TE>
<TE>   He's grateful for the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of an awakening for me to see how much time and money
is invested in developing young players," he says, "and for me to
have this responsibility is very important to me. It's very
flattering to me."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky and Barnett, he believes, have gone out on a limb for him,
though Barnett says that NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman welcomed
McSorley back.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes somebody who's got some courage to do it because they're
going to be faced with people pestering them," McSorley says of his
return to professional hockey. "A lot of people have already said,
'What justifies him getting a head-coaching job? What qualifies him?'</TE>
<TE>   "And Wayne and Mike Barnett, I've heard them both chuckle and say,
'Seventeen years in the National Hockey League as a client and
teammate.' "</TE>
<TE>   He pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the ball's in my court."</TE>

<HD>Olajuwon Reportedly Retiring</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toronto Raptor center Hakeem Olajuwon will retire from the NBA on
Nov. 2, according to a published report.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Post's Peter Vecsey reported Tuesday that Olajuwon
will end his career on a night when the Raptors visit his original
team, the Houston Rockets, for their third game of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Olajuwon, 39, remained in Houston because of an injured back while
the Raptors began training camp last month. Plagued by a
deteriorating injury and a variety of creaky joints, his retirement
will end a failed experiment by the Raptors.</LD>
<TE>   Acquired last season from the Rockets, Olajuwon was supposed to
provide the presence and leadership that comes from being a 12-time
NBA All-Star and a two-time NBA champion. However, he averaged 7.1
points and 6.0 rebounds and missed 21 games because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon is under contract for $12 million over the next two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latrell Sprewell met with players' union director Billy Hunter in
New York to discuss appealing the $250,000 fine levied against him by
the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   The union received official notification of the fine, believed to
be the largest levied by an NBA team against a player. Sprewell and
Hunter met for about an hour in preliminary talks on the appeal,
expected to be filed later this week.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the fine for failing to notify the team of a hand
injury, the Knicks have ordered Sprewell to stay away from the team
indefinitely. He will be sidelined by the injury until mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   Because Sprewell was not officially suspended, he will continue to
be paid his full salary of $12.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Cavalier center Zydrunas Ilgauskas pleaded no contest to
drunken driving and was sentenced to one year of probation in Rocky
River, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The judge suspended a 30-day jail sentence, fined Ilgauskas $1,000
and suspended his driver's license for one year, although he is
allowed to drive to work, counseling sessions and the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   The Lithuanian-born Ilgauskas was stopped Sept. 15 for erratic
driving in suburban Cleveland and failed field sobriety tests. His
blood-alcohol level was 0.167, above Ohio's legal limit of 0.10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle SuperSonic forward Rashard Lewis had an MRI exam on his
injured left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Results were not available, a team spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10 Lewis, playing under a new $60-million, seven-year
contract he signed last month, injured his shoulder Sunday night in
an exhibition loss to the Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   The team is reportedly concerned that Lewis, who dislocated the
same shoulder in last season's playoffs, will require surgery and
miss most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller said he would consider selling the
team's nickname to the New Orleans Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm willing to sit down and talk about it," Miller said in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Wooldridge, co-owner of the New Orleans Hornets, said he'd
"love" to bring the Jazz nickname back to the city where it began.
The original team, the New Orleans Jazz, moved to Salt Lake City in
1979 and took the nickname with it.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that he and Miller hadn't talked yet, Wooldridge
said he had no idea what it would take to acquire the nickname.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Oliver Miller, a first-round pick in 1992 who has been kept
out of the NBA by constant weight problems, is trying to win a roster
spot in training camp with the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 32, who is 6-9 and 325 pounds, hasn't played in the NBA
since the 1999-00 season in which he ballooned to about 375 pounds
while playing for the Phoenix Suns, his original team.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The NBA moved a step closer Tuesday to putting a team back in
Charlotte, N.C., appointing an expansion committee to look at
ownership groups willing to pay the expected price of at least $300
million.</LD>
<LD>   The league's Board of Governors ended a two-day meeting at which
they were briefed on the prospects of adding a new franchise. One
prospective ownership group includes former Boston Celtics Larry Bird
and M.L. Carr, but the league said there is no front-runner for the
new team, which could begin play in the 2004-05 season.</LD>
<LD>   Charlotte lost its NBA franchise when the Hornets moved to New
Orleans in the off-season. Since then, at least three groups have
said they would like to bring a team back to Charlotte, and Deputy
Commissioner Russ Granik said the league is near agreement with city
officials on a deal to build a new arena with an NBA team as the
primary tenant.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very positive step, but I don't think we can say yet that
it's a done deal," Granik said.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Governors, comprised of a representative from each of
the 29 teams, also approved a change in the bylaws for the WNBA,
allowing for non-NBA ownership groups to pursue WNBA franchises in
non-NBA cities. Currently, the league owns all the teams, and with
the exception of the Charlotte Sting, all WNBA teams are operated by
the NBA teams in their cities.</TE>

<KH>ON BASEBALL/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS.
MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>Selig to Twins: It Was Nothing Personal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The man who provided the Minnesota Twins with a rallying cry, who
helped light their crusade, was ushered up a private stairway behind
the press box and into the glass enclosed box of Twins' owner Carl
Pohlad.</LD>
<LD>   A Metrodome crowd of 55,562 was too busy waving their Homer
Hankies, too caught up in Game 1 of the American League championship
series, to notice that the commissioner of baseball had joined
them--a good thing, of course, for Bud Selig, the reviled purveyor of
the contraction plan that called for the Twins' extinction.</LD>
<LD>   Had Selig chosen to sit with Jackie Autry and other baseball
luminaries in a newly constructed box near the Angel dugout, he might
have been greeted by a rude and roof-raising reception surpassing
even the normal, ear-shattering decibel level.</LD>
<TE>   The fact is, however, Selig should be cheered here, greeted by a
red carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Amid their surprising and stirring season, as they continue to
shed the Selig label of an aberration, and now take on the Angels in
a series refuting the competitive imbalance doctrine, the Twins have
used contraction as motivational fodder, driven by the vision of
Selig presenting them with the World Series trophy in their
champagne-soaked clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Even Selig smiled at that vision Tuesday night and said: "If I was
their Knute Rockne, then they owe me something."</TE>
<TE>   Something?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said infielder Denny Hocking, "I don't think we're going
to vote him a full share."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have time still to think of another reward, although
they took another step toward turning improbability into reality and
Selig into Rockne by defeating the Angels, 2-1, in the ALCS opener as
Joe Mays and Eddie Guardado erased the memory of those 56 hits and 31
runs Anaheim had collected against the New York Yankees in the
division series.</TE>
<TE>   With no Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Mike Mussina and David Wells
to beat up on, the Angels were restricted to four hits, and this much
is clear:</TE>
<TE>   The Twins live and contraction is dead, buried through 2006 by the
new labor agreement, and Selig, talking with reporters during the
early innings of Game 1, said contraction was never about the
Minnesota players and it was time to put the focus on the field.</TE>
<TE>   He delivered that same message to Hocking, the Twins' union
representative, before the game. Hocking said he didn't plan to
interrupt the playoffs simply to relay to teammates in a clubhouse
meeting what Selig told him, but "I was impressed that he was man
enough to signal me out. He was basically saying that [contraction]
is off the table for four years, let's put it behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Hocking and Manager Ron Gardenhire, who also talked
with Selig before the game, the Twins had no knowledge he was
present, secluded in the owner's box, and Hocking said that despite
all of the comments he and teammates have directed at the
commissioner, neither he nor contraction are the "rallying cry" they
have been portrayed to be.</TE>
<TE>   "The extra motivation was fine in April and May," he said, "but
this team began sniffing this position at about the All-Star break."</TE>
<TE>   That may be true, but when hasn't Selig been a convenient
lightning rod?</TE>
<TE>   What other theme is there to this ALCS than that of a team rising
from the ashes of virtual extinction and baseball's 27th-lowest
payroll to now close within three victories of the World Series?</TE>
<TE>   Selig himself called it a remarkable story, saluted the job
General Manager Terry Ryun has done, said the community should be
proud and that there is no reason to continue replaying contraction,
that if people had grown sick of hearing him talk about it, he was
equally sick of continuing to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Selig wasn't so sick that he couldn't make another
effort to set the record straight. He wouldn't confirm what is
accepted as fact, that it was banker Pohlad who volunteered his team
for contraction, but he reiterated that the concept wasn't his baby
alone, that all 30 owners approved it, including some who wanted four
teams eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   He also insisted that he isn't referring to the talent level of
the Minnesota players or any other players in describing it as an
aberration when a small-revenue team reaches the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Selig has received industry heat for using that term, but he said
it's only a reflection of that seven-year study by his blue-ribbon
committee that showed 98.2% of 224 playoff games had been won by
teams in the top two payroll quartiles.</TE>
<TE>   He also pointed out that the Twins had gone through "a decade of
frustration to get where they are" and that Oakland has been the only
small-revenue team "to win consistently" and "we have seen how hard
it is for the A's and other small-market teams to retain their
players."</TE>
<TE>   The new labor agreement, Selig said, will provide immeasurable
help for those teams. The Twins, for example, are expected to receive
about $25 million in revenue sharing in the first year of the new
agreement, and even the Angels, despite playing in a booming
population belt, are expected to receive about $13 million on the
basis of comparatively low revenue.</TE>
<TE>   If the revived Twins could benefit from a new ballpark, a process
still tied up in legislation, their immediate future is secure, and
Selig said he was "grateful to be here, grateful that [Minnesota]
still has a team."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, referring to the uncertain reception, he acknowledged
that neither his wife, who went to school in the Twin Cities, nor
many relatives and friends, chose to accompany him ("they decided to
let me try it the first time," he said) and only Laurel Prieb, his
son-in-law, came with him from Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he felt that he could serve as a bodyguard," Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Selig didn't require a bodyguard. Most fans
didn't know he was at the game, nor did most of the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Hocking, of course, had resisted calling a clubhouse meeting to
inform them. The commissioner's name comes up often enough in their
clubhouse anyway.</TE>

<LD>Little League Baseball will require all its managers, coaches and
volunteers to be checked against their state's list of convicted sex
offenders.</LD>
<LD>   Little League officials said their group is the first national
youth sports organization to have such a requirement.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to let anyone who would prey upon kids in the Little
League program know that they're not welcome and we're going to do
what we can to keep them out," Stephen D. Keener, president of Little
League Baseball Inc., said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Little League has recommended that local leagues do background
checks on volunteers since 1996, when USA Baseball suggested that all
youth baseball organizations adopt such voluntary policies.</TE>

<TE>   Lido Palace could have been nominated to the Breeders' Cup as a

<LD>Cleveland Brown backup quarterback Kelly Holcomb broke his left leg
and sprained his knee during a fourth-quarter rally Sunday night
against the Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   Holcomb, who threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter as
the Browns rallied before losing, suffered a hairline fracture of his
left shinbone, the team said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Browns did not say how long Holcomb would be sidelined.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Butch Davis offered little information on Holcomb during his
Monday news conference. Asked about Holcomb's injuries, Davis said
Holcomb "gutted it out and he finished the game."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Holcomb was undergoing tests at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Holcomb's agent, Frank Bauer, told the Akron Beacon Journal that
Holcomb was injured when a Raven lineman rolled onto his leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Kelly told me [Monday] his leg was hurting like a dog, but he
said, 'I couldn't come out of that game,' " Bauer told the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Holcomb led Cleveland's comeback from a 23-0 deficit after
starting quarterback Tim Couch was sidelined because of a concussion.
He threw two touchdown passes and finished 13 of 23 for 180 yards in
the Browns' 26-21 loss.</TE>
<TE>   He started the Browns' first two games as Couch recovered from an
elbow injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver J.J. Stokes is questionable for San Francisco's game at
Seattle on Monday night after an MRI revealed a sprained knee
ligament. Stokes was hurt in the 49ers' 37-13 victory over St.
Louis.... Green Bay end Joe Johnson will sit out the rest of the
season after tearing his left triceps in the Packers' 34-21 victory
over Chicago on Monday night. Johnson will need surgery.... End
Marcus Jones, a first-round draft pick who became one of Tampa Bay's
most productive pass rushers, was released by the Buccaneers off
injured reserve. Jones tore knee cartilage during an exhibition game
in August.</TE>

<HD>Injuries Pile Up for Bears</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAKE FOREST, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The Chicago Bears, already struck by injuries to key players, have
two more--left guard Rex Tucker is out for the season because of a
broken leg and receiver David Terrell has a broken right foot that
might require surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Terrell, the Bears' top draft pick in 2001, hurt his foot late in
the fourth quarter of Chicago's 34-21 loss to the Green Bay Packers
on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   He had a stress fracture in the same foot his last season at
Michigan, but never sat out a game or a practice.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Dick Jauron isn't ruling out surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what will happen there right now," Jauron said
Tuesday. "Our trainer and the doctors have to talk about that some
more to see what needs to be done and what that will mean to us and
to David this year."</TE>
<TE>   Terrell has only nine catches this season, but three were for
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker dislocated his left ankle and broke a bone in his leg in
the third quarter Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   He had surgery Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker, starting linebacker Warrick Holdman and backup defensive
back Bobby Gray are out for the year, and defensive tackle Ted
Washington probably will sit out the rest of the regular season
because of a ruptured ligament in his left foot and a broken bone in
his left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   End Phillip Daniels and cornerback R.W. McQuarters were in the
starting lineup Monday night for the first time since the season
opener. And end Bryan Robinson is still recovering after breaking his
wrists in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, who have lost three in a row after starting 2-0, were
among the healthiest teams in the league last season. Only one
defensive starter sat out a game.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Factor Is Sign of Times</HD>
<DH>National League: One way or another, Giant slugger will be
key, but La Russa says to not forget his teammates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Sitting in the locker room at New York's Madison Square Garden more
than half a century ago, Minneapolis Laker center George Mikan, the
league's first dominating player, couldn't figure out why none of his
teammates were getting dressed for the game.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you see the marquee outside?" he was asked.</LD>
<LD>   It read, "Geo Mikan vs. Knicks."</LD>
<TE>   Barry Bonds knows just how the chagrined Mikan felt.</TE>
<TE>   When the best-of-seven National League championship series begins
tonight at Busch Stadium, Bonds wouldn't be surprised to see a sign
reading, "Barry Bonds vs. Cards."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' teammate, Reggie Sanders, refers to the San Francisco
Giants as "Barry Bonds and his seven little dwarfs."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. Bonds
followed his record 73-homer season of 2001 by winning the league
batting title with a .370 mark and posting a .582 on-base mark.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants didn't win 95 regular-season games, hold off the
Dodgers for the wild-card spot and defeat the Atlanta Braves in their
division series after trailing 2-1 in games with a roster that
included Sleepy, Dopey and Grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' .267 team batting average tied them for third in the
league with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Jeff Kent, with 37 home runs
and 108 runs batted in; Sanders, with 23 homers and 85 RBIs, and
David Bell, with 20 homers and 73 RBIs, ably backed up Bonds, who had
46 home runs and 110 RBIs, in the power department.</TE>
<TE>   With a team earned-run average of 3.83, San Francisco was fourth
in the league. And its bullpen ERA of 2.91 was second best in the NL.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, one subject dominated Tuesday's media session with St.
Louis Manager Tony La Russa. Would he pitch to Bonds?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, there were variations on that theme. Would he pitch to Bonds
with the game on the line? Would he pitch to Bonds with the bases
empty? Would he pitch to Bonds, under any circumstances, with the
bases loaded?</TE>
<TE>   La Russa patiently answered each question.</TE>
<TE>   "What Barry has done the last two years is incredible," he said.
"We are not going to pretend he doesn't exist. We will go after him,
just as we go after all dangerous hitters. We'll keep the ball away
from the middle of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants beat the Braves. Barry Bonds didn't beat the Braves.
The Giants have a hell of a team and we are going to give them
respect."</TE>
<TE>   When the barrage of Bonds' questions began anew, La Russa smiled
at a reporter and said, "I know you'll do a very good job of
recognizing the rest of the talent on that team and not fall into the
trap."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa, of course, was sending a message. He knows Bonds is
Bonds, the most effective player in the game right now, performing at
a level only an elite few have ever reached. He expects Bonds to do
some damage if he gets pitches he can hit. La Russa's intent was to
make sure he didn't provide bulletin-board material for the others in
the San Francisco lineup. He doesn't want those "seven dwarfs" to
feel so slighted that they turn into giants at the plate. Not only
San Francisco Giants, but slugging giants.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa knows all about these mind games. A few years ago, he was
on the other side when Mark McGwire was in his lineup and other teams
were pitching around the St. Louis first baseman.</TE>
<TE>   That this discussion was even taking place shows how far Bonds has
come. Until a week ago, despite all his regular-season heroics, the
big question was: Why does Bonds always choke in big games? Never
mind the World Series. He's never been in one. But until Monday
night, he never even had been on a team that won a postseason series
of any sort, going 0-5 with the Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates. Before
this year's division series, Bonds had a .196 postseason average with
one homer and six RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Braves, he hit .294 with three home runs and four RBIs
in the five games.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Morris, tonight's starter for the Cardinals, was also
subjected to a media grilling on the subject of Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to go after him every time, every at-bat if the
situation called for it," Morris said. "But obviously, I'm not going
to do something to jeopardize the win.... I'm going to be careful.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a competitor, you don't want to get booed in your home park
by walking him all the time. But being a winner, you want to do the
right thing to win the ballgame, also, and not let your ego get in
the way of what you are trying to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa isn't concerned about the fans' reaction to his strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal manager said, "I've got a feeling that a whole lot
more of our fans will boo Matt if he throws a hanging curveball down
the middle, or a nothing fastball down the middle, and Bonds hits a
couple of home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "If Matt misses with that curveball or fastball and walks [Bonds]
a time or two, and a few people boo because they can't see Barry hit
a home run, then they are misunderstanding the competition. We are
here to compete against the Giants."</TE>
<TE>   So change that sign to read, "Giants, including Bonds when
unavoidable, vs. Cards."</TE>

<TE>   It's hard to figure Barry Bonds' chances against the St. Louis
pitching staff based on the regular season. Because of injuries,
Bonds made only token appearances against the Cardinals. A look at

<HD>La Russa Leaves Open Chance for Rolen Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>It was assumed that St. Louis Cardinal third baseman Scott Rolen,
suffering from a sprained left shoulder, was out of the National
League championship series, which matches the Cardinals against the
San Francisco Giants beginning tonight.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa thought so. But Tuesday, he wasn't
so sure.</LD>
<LD>   La Russa, while definitely ruling Rolen out of the first two games
of the best-of-seven series, said he is considering adding Rolen to
his roster, thinking that the third baseman could return later in the
series.</LD>
<TE>   Rolen was injured in the division series against the Arizona
Diamondbacks when pinch-runner Alex Cintron collided with him while
Rolen was trying to field a grounder.</TE>
<TE>   "[Monday] I thought he had no chance," La Russa said. "Now, I
would say it's not impossible that he could be back. He's got more
flexibility and mobility in his shoulder than he did [Monday], which
is a lot more than two days before that."</TE>
<TE>   After being obtained from the Philadelphia Phillies in a late July
trade, Rolen hit .278 for the Cardinals in 55 games with 14 home runs
and 44 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa would love to have Rolen, but if he puts him on the
roster and Rolen doesn't come back, La Russa will have left his team
a player short.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a tough call," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not so tough is the call on right-hander Woody Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who was left off the St. Louis roster for the division
series because of a pulled abdominal muscle, has recovered enough to
not only make the roster for this series but will start Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   His 2.53 earned-run average was the best among Cardinal starters
this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was no question that the Giants defeated the Atlanta Braves
in the fifth and deciding game of their division series.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a question of how much they won by.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 3-1 in the bottom of the ninth at Atlanta's Turner
Field, the Braves had Rafael Furcal at third and Julio Franco at
first. When Chipper Jones hit a grounder to the right side, first
baseman J.T. Snow stepped on the bag, removing the force play, then,
with Franco on his way to second, fired the ball to Giant shortstop
Rich Aurilia.</TE>
<TE>   As Franco stopped between first and second, Furcal started for
home.</TE>
<TE>   When Aurilia tagged Franco, the game was over. As the Giants
celebrated, the scoreboard showed the final score as 3-2. After a
conference in the press box, it was changed back to 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   If Furcal had scored before the tag was applied, his run would
have counted.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, Furcal, seeing the game was over, never touched
home plate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOXES)</TE>
<TE>   GIANT ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: It starts, of course, with Barry Bonds, who has gone
from a postseason bust in the past to the focal point of every
opposing team this season. A second big gun is second baseman Jeff
Kent (.313, 37 HR, 108 RBIs). Closer Robb Nen has had more than 40
saves in four of the last five seasons and showed he can be just as
effective in the postseason by shutting down the Braves twice.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: The lack of a balanced lineup. Other than Bonds and
Kent, nobody hit .300. And the lack of an overpowering rotation. No
starter won 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: INF Ramon Martinez (.271, 4 HR, 25 RBI), OF Tom
Goodwin (.260, 1 HR, 17 RBI), C Yorvit Torrealba (.279, 2 HR, 14
RBI).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM BATTING IN FIRST ROUND: .247</TE>
<TE>   TEAM EARNED-RUN AVERAGE IN FIRST ROUND: 4.70</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CARDINAL ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: How strong is the Cardinal offense? St. Louis hit .268
in the regular season, second in the league to the Colorado Rockies.
But perhaps even more impressive was St. Louis' performance in the
first round of the playoffs. The Cardinals beat Randy Johnson and
survived Curt Schilling of the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: There are question marks hanging over two key players.
Third baseman Scott Rolen, a late-season sparkplug, has a sprained
left shoulder and may not be activated. Pitcher Woody Williams will
start Game 2, but he is coming off a pulled abdominal muscle.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: IF/OF Miguel Cairo (.250, 2 HR, 23 RBI), OF Eduardo
Perez (.201, 10 HR, 26 RBI).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM BATTING IN FIRST ROUND: .314</TE>
<TE>   TEAM EARNED-RUN AVERAGE IN FIRST ROUND: 1.33</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   If the Cardinals can take Bonds out of the series by taking the
bat out of his hands, then they figure to win. But that won't happen
if the rest of the Giant lineup can assume its share of the offensive
load, forcing St. Louis to deal with Bonds. An effective return of
the two injured Cardinals--Rolen and Williams--could make the
difference for St. Louis on offense and defense. If Rolen doesn't
come back, Miguel Cairo's play at third will be a key. There are also
intangibles working on both sides. The Cardinals have dedicated the
season to pitcher Darryl Kile and broadcaster Jack Buck, both of whom
died during the season. The Giants have vowed to get Bonds the one
thing in the game he doesn't have: A World Series ring. The
Cardinals, deeper and more talented, have the edge.</TE>
<TE>   Records: Cardinals swept the Diamondbacks in the first round,
Giants beat the Braves in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Head to head: Cardinals, 4-2.</TE>

<LD>Nothing Against the Angels, He's Just Picking the Twins</LD>
<LD>   Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, a longtime friend, was on the
phone asking me to help him get some World Series tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Steinbrenner, of course, was kidding.</LD>
<TE>   Naturally, the Yankee owner is not pleased his team lost to
Anaheim in the division series. But Steinbrenner always was a big fan
of the late Gene Autry, who owned the Angels before the franchise was
purchased by the Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner was impressed by the Angels, who eliminated the
Yankees in four games. "They're good. Fundamentally they do all the
things that we did not do," he said. "That's the best way to explain
it. They believed they could win.... Now they have to come up there
and play on that ping-pong table. It's going to be a good series, but
there won't be that much interest in the country in it. That's the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Steinbrenner does not believe the Angels are as good as
the Yankees. "They aren't a super team," he said. "They are a bunch
of good athletes. They have a great manager [in Mike Scioscia], but
so do the Twins."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner picks the Twins to win the American League
championship series because they have the advantage in pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "The Twins have got a shot, definitely," he said. "I'm not taking
anything away from Anaheim but pitching usually wins. It didn't in
our case. This was an unusual year when pitching didn't come through.
But it didn't work for Oakland either."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner is not happy with the new collective bargaining
agreement, which will penalize the Yankees' high salaries more than
any other team. He said the success of the Twins and Angels in the
postseason proves the luxury tax is not needed.</TE>
<TE>   "What does this say to [Commissioner Bud] Selig' argument, that
it's all one-sided?" Steinbrenner asked about the agreement for which
Selig pushed. "It doesn't sound very good for Bud, does it? It proves
that payrolls don't win pennants."</TE>
<TE>   Sid Hartman</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis Star Tribune</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Take It to the Bank That Selig Did Not Act Alone</TE>
<TE>   It should have sounded different. The place should have sounded
like a jumbo jet with anger-management issues.</TE>
<TE>   What came out of mouths Tuesday night should have been ugly and
bitter and oh so satisfying. The people deserved at least that.</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of the 55,562 fans who showed up at the
Metrodome for Game 1 of the American League championship series had
no idea that the enemy was, if not within, then at least lurking near
the edges.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Selig spent part of Tuesday night in the private box of
Minnesota Twin owner Carl Pohlad, the man who was willing to make his
franchise go away in exchange for a satchel full of money.</TE>
<TE>   Must have been some party up there, wingtips a-tapping, money
being minted.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the commissioner is going to have to show up and
face the heavy metal. Sooner or later, he is going to have to settle
up with the people whom he marginalized.</TE>
<TE>   If there were any justice in this world, Pohlad would have been
forced to sit shoulder to shoulder with Selig in the stands, been
forced to absorb the abuse, maybe even been forced to throw out the
ceremonial first pitch into the thick of the anger. Selig might have
been the facilitator, but Pohlad was the one willing to sell his soul
and the soul of a city. Pohlad was willing to contract his team into
thin air.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all Bud," Twin center fielder Torii Hunter said. "It's
not all Bud at all. I think we have some people from within too."</TE>
<TE>   That would be banker Pohlad, whose fingers still are wrapped
around the first dollar from his first foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Morrissey</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Tribune</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What They Lack in Talent, They Make Up for With Heart</TE>
<TE>   The subject was heart. The speaker was Twin Manager Ron
Gardenhire, who in his way might know as much about heart as a
cardiologist.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're young and probably overmatched in experience," he
said. "That's where heart comes in."</TE>
<TE>   Basically, he was saying what Richard Adler and Jerry Ross put
into lyrics half a century ago: "You've gotta have heart. All you
really need is heart. When the odds are sayin' you'll never win,
that's when the grin should start. You've gotta have hope. Mustn't
sit around and mope."</TE>
<TE>   That song is from the Broadway musical "Damn Yankees," which,
incidentally, was about a man who sold his soul to the devil to play
for the Washington Senators, who later became the Twins. All these
years later a couple of modern-day devils--Bud Selig and Carl
Pohlad--conspired to eliminate the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the Twins showed the size of their heart. They won the
American League Central Division. Then it was on to the AL divisional
series against Oakland. The Twins were underdogs going in, and the
odds against them increased when they trailed, 2-1, in the
best-of-five series. You know how that turned out. Then they won Game
1 Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We go game-by-game. If one day doesn't work, we try to go the
next day," Gardenhire said.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>So this, the Angels have learned, is what is known as "Minnesota
Nice."</LD>
<LD>   Nice easy sinkers on the corners.</LD>
<LD>   Nice slow changeups at the knees.</LD>
<TE>   Nice grounders beat into the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Nice way to start an American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly moments after walking away from a Bronx street rumble,
the Angels stepped into a pillow fight.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't seriously hurt, but they weren't seriously upright,
either, their balance lost and their heads spinning while the
Minnesota Twins scampered out the door giggling with a 2-1 victory
Tuesday in Game 1 at the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   You know those inspirational bromides that floated around their
clubhouse after the first-round victory over the New York Yankees,
all that talk about inspiration and teamwork and destiny?</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, the bitter fruits of that victory brought to
mind a different sort of old saying.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful what you wish for.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of days that probably felt like moments, the Angels
went from Hall of Fame heat ... to Joe Mays' junk.</TE>
<TE>   They went from baseball's most dangerous neighborhood ... to a
fluffy white dome filled with soft white waving towels.</TE>
<TE>   They went from Frank Sinatra crooning "New York, New York" ... to
Lee Greenwood and 55,000 fans bellowing "God Bless the USA."</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that they would also go from swaggering to
stunned? From 10 hits in one inning to four hits in an entire game?
From a .320 middle-lineup batting average to three struggling guys
who combined to go hitless?</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, you just had to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "No way," Adam Kennedy said firmly. "You do not have a letdown in
a league championship series."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon didn't take that long.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, looking quickly away, next question.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, that state slogan for Minnesota's kindly way of
life became the theme for the Angels' demise. It is a theme that will
be repeated throughout the series if the Angels don't adjust.</TE>
<TE>   No, these aren't the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, these Twins are nice enough to throw first-pitch strikes.</TE>
<TE>   To 20 of the 31 batters Tuesday, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, used to taking ball one and working the count and
forcing the pitcher to surrender down the middle, were so flummoxed
by this trend that the first five batters of the game looked at a
first-pitch strike one.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Angels swung and made contact on only five of those
first pitches, resulting in three foul balls, a groundout, and one
lone single by Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get our kind of at-bats tonight," Scott Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   And they obviously better get used to it.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have studied the videos from the Yankee games, and will
continue to work this way.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get strike one with these guys, everything changes," said
Rick Anderson, Twin pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   No, these aren't the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, these Twins are also nice enough not to try to overpower you
with their best pitches in important situations.</TE>
<TE>   Facing Troy Glaus with a full count and a runner on first in the
ninth inning, closer Eddie Guardado threw not a fastball, but a
dipping, knee-high slider that caught Glaus staring.</TE>
<TE>   "Froze him," Anderson said with a shrug. "That's how Eddie tries
to do things."</TE>
<TE>   The first night away from the Yankees froze all of the Angels, it
seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out more aggressive," Kennedy said. "We need to be more
aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps less honest, as Kennedy readily acknowledged that he
did not see the idiot trespasser who ran on to the field and was at
least 10 feet inside the foul line when Kennedy grounded out to
shortstop in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Did not affect me at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The umpires didn't see him in time, so they didn't say anything,
but play should have been stopped, and Kennedy should have had
another chance.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it really mattered, though.</TE>
<TE>   Not when Salmon was shaking his head and saying, "I don't think I
ever got a swing that I wanted to take."</TE>
<TE>   Not when Spiezio was stroking his goatee and saying, "After your
second or third time up there, you knew, this guy was really going to
be tough."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels aren't the first team to struggle upon arrival in
Minnesota. This season, the Twins are 23-3 in the first games of
series here.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are also not the first team to wilt under the Twins'
change-of-pace pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "What a lot of people failed to realize was that the Twins won
their division easily without having their best two pitchers most of
the year," said Brad Fullmer, referring to Mays and Brad Radke. "This
is going to be a battle."</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels didn't realize it while dancing away from New York,
they realize it now. They will likely adjust their approach. They
will certainly alter their expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the video, you realize that the Yankees really
didn't pitch that well, that they left a lot of stuff across the
plate," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't happen Tuesday. It might not happen much the rest of
the week.</TE>
<TE>   Standing between the Angels and the World Series is a team that
bears no resemblance to the Yankees. Usually that is a good thing.
Suddenly, it is not.</TE>

<KH>Diane Pucin/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS.
MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>No Sign of Distress on Mays' Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The slider was sliding, the curve was curving, his changeup was
changing, every pitch was tickling the corner of the plate, leaving
the Angel hitters tied up in knots and wishing for the New York
Yankees to come back.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Mays was doing what Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Mike Mussina
and David Wells couldn't. He was making the Angels overanxious,
unbalanced, frustrated and mostly useless at the plate and making his
manager, Ron Gardenhire, look like the smartest guy in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Mays, a 26-year-old right-hander who missed a big chunk of this
season with an inflamed muscle in his pitching elbow, who floundered
helplessly against Oakland last week in his first postseason start,
lasting only 3 2/3 innings in Game 2, giving up six of Oakland's nine
runs by pitching timidly, by not trusting his arm and the way it can
make a ball sink and swerve and do somersaults to the plate, beat the
Angels on Tuesday night in the Metrodome by pitching eight innings,
by giving Anaheim no earned runs, by believing in himself, by
leaving, as he said, "my brain on top of my locker and just throwing
the ball."</LD>
<TE>   This is advice Ramon Ortiz, the Angels' Game 2 starter, should
follow. Ortiz was as ineffective, over-thinking, nervous and jumpy in
his own first postseason start last week. If Angel fans want to take
anything positive from Tuesday's game it is that maybe Ortiz will do
what Mays did.</TE>
<TE>   "I set my head up in my locker and I went down there and pitched a
game that I feel is the game of my career," Mays said. "I went out
and trusted what I have."</TE>
<TE>   While Mays sat in the dugout during the ninth inning, his head was
buried in his hands. He didn't want to watch Twin closer Eddie
Guardado save his 2-1 win. He didn't want to peek when Tim Salmon
walked with one out, didn't want to uncover his eyes while Garret
Anderson flied out and Troy Glaus struck out, frozen and looking at
strike three.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to let the crowd tell me the game was over," Mays
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Gardenhire announced his pitching rotation for this American
League championship series Monday, he said, "Let the second-guessing
begin."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to start Mays caused some consternation. In his
horrible outing against Oakland, Mays had seemed overwhelmed by the
situation, unnerved by the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the noodle starts rolling, you start over-thinking,
you're trying to think two or three pitches ahead when you should
just go out and throw the ball over the plate," Mays said. "My
coaches talked to me, told me to go out there and trust the stuff I
have and believe in what I'm trying to do and execute the pitches
instead of over-thinking and trying to analyze every mistake I make."</TE>
<TE>   For a man who was supposed to be emotionally disabled after the
Oakland disaster, for a man who was passed up as the starter in Game
5 Sunday in Oakland, when Brad Radke took his place, Mays was a man
supremely calm and totally confident in himself and his stuff
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He threw first-pitch strikes to the first six Angels he faced. No
leadoff hitter got on base against Mays. He walked nobody.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota pitching coach Rick Anderson said he could tell when
Mays was warming up that it was going to be a good night.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the good flow," Anderson said. "He was moving the ball in
and out, up and down and when the game started, he was using all his
pitches. The thing about Joe was that after the Oakland game, he
didn't lose his confidence. He wasn't happy. He came to me and said,
'Rick, I know what I did wrong. I didn't let the ball work for me.'
Tonight, he let the ball work for him. This game's great for
second-guessing, but I knew it was the right decision to let Joe
start."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Mays made the All-Star team and finished with a 17-13
record and a 3.16 earned-run average. But this season had barely
begun when Mays' right elbow began hurting. He was out from April 15
to July 20 and spent the rest of the season trying to find his touch,
locate his feel for the strike zone and rediscover his faith in his
talent.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard watching this team do so well and feel like I wasn't
contributing," Mays said. "I even heard people wonder if I should be
on the postseason roster. I heard the talk that I shouldn't have
started this game. But that talk didn't come from anybody on this
team or from my coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire laughed when he was asked what worked for Mays against
the Angels. "It would take less time if I tell you what wasn't
working."</TE>
<TE>   That's what happens to the winning teams, the playoff teams, the
teams that keep advancing through the postseason. Somebody
unexpectedly finds a new and special gear, makes an unexpected
impact.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we envision with Joe Mays," Gardenhire said. "A guy
going at the hitters, making them swing the bats, going right at
them, attacking."</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, Mays talked about trusting himself. It was all
about trust, about belief, about confidence. Those are the things
that have carried the Angels so far too, the things that all
underdogs need to have, the things that will serve Ortiz well
tonight. If he has them.</TE>

<TE>   A-Mays-ing at Home</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mays seemed to be a curious selection as Minnesota's Game 1
starter in the American League championship series, considering his
4-8 record and 5.38 earned-run average in the regular season and the
pounding he took (nine hits and six runs allowed in 3 2/3 innings) in
Game 2 of the division series at Oakland. But Mays had pitched well
at the Metrodome late in the season. A look at his last five starts
at the Metrodome and on the road:</TE>

<HD>Joke of a Kicking Game Needs Funny Man's Help</HD>

<LD>In the glorious history of USC football, 402 players have gone on to
be drafted by the NFL. One of them was a kicker.</LD>
<LD>   USC once went 14 years without making a field goal--Frank Gifford
breaking the dry spell with a 22-yarder against Cal.</LD>
<LD>   In their last 27 games, USC has failed to successfully kick the
"automatic" extra point 17 times. They've botched four PATs this
season in five games.</LD>
<TE>   Student body right now takes on a whole different meaning at USC.</TE>
<TE>   I asked the sports information department at USC who is the
school's best-known kicker of all time and was told, "Tommy Walker,
who would kick and then put on a cape to lead the band."</TE>
<TE>   Just how good was he? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the guy who composed the trumpet 'Charge,' you know, da, da
da da ta da ... charge!" he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COACH PETE Carroll said he didn't want to discuss the Trojan
kickers because it might affect their confidence. I guess that means
he would have nothing nice to say about them.</TE>
<TE>   I ran into former Trojan coach Craig Fertig, who told me he once
ran a want ad in the Daily Trojan for a kicker because John McKay
told him to find someone, and he didn't care how. That gave me an
idea.</TE>
<TE>   I decided to conduct auditions for a new USC kicker Tuesday and
brought along the official NFL football the Raiders gave me several
years ago to stay away from them with my name misspelled on the side
of the ball. I began approaching students on the USC campus, and I
would like to commend campus security guards at this time for not
drawing their weapons. (Thank heaven they weren't in walkie-talkie
contact with Mike Garrett).</TE>
<TE>   My first stop, of course, was Tommy Trojan, but I noticed he's as
big a stiff as the two guys kicking for the team right now, so I
moved to the Drama Center with the hope of finding someone who might
act like a kicker.</TE>
<TE>   Jaimey Wiener, a freshman theater major, said, "If someone asked
me to act like a USC kicker, I'd probably start by running around the
block to work up a sweat."</TE>
<TE>   I told her kickers don't usually sweat much, but she shot back,
"If you're kicking the way these guys are, you would." For the
record, that's the first person with any affiliation to USC to ever
demonstrate a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EDUARDO VIDAL, an economics major who was wearing a Dodger cap
because he said it matched his blue shoes, showed promise given the
quirky nature of kickers. "I also have a Steelers cap," he said, and
when I get the list of everything else he owns, I'll pass it on.</TE>
<TE>   Now you would think anyone wearing a Dodger cap would be pretty
adept at booting the ball, but Vidal asked to be holder for theater
major Sean Bury. Bury put on a good show but showed more promise as a
producer than actor, spotting George Costanza and immediately casting
him as kicker.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Alexander," said George Costanza as we shook hands, and if
he didn't want to attract any attention I would have suggested
calling himself, "Bob Patterson."</TE>
<TE>   Now as you know, George met Jerry Seinfeld at JFK High School when
he fell off a rope in gym class and landed on Jerry's head. So I knew
already he had the athletic qualifications to be a kicker.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have my kicking shoes on," Costanza said, and after what
I heard from USC's kicker last week--blaming the holder for his PAT
miss, I could see the method actor in George trying to assume the
role of real USC kicker.</TE>
<TE>   Bury agreed to be the holder and began carrying on with Costanza
about George's time as a drama major at Boston University, and I know
he was just doing Kramer, because he was getting on my nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Finally Costanza backed up, waited for Bury to spot the ball on
the asphalt parking lot, and then I swear I was watching Lou Groza
kick the Cleveland Browns to victory. George's aim was not only true,
but the ball took off for an easy extra-point conversion, going far
enough to beat anything Gifford might have kicked in his heyday.
"Sign me up," crowed Costanza.</TE>
<TE>   I had found a kicker for USC, and knowing how George's career is
going these days, I figured he'd be free.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm teaching here at USC, I've got my KFC commercials and I just
finished a film," Costanza said with that know-it-all attitude of
his, and I've watched Seinfeld enough to know not a word of it was
probably true. But I played along.</TE>
<TE>   So George, what's the name of your next film?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping they'll change it. It's called: 'The Man Who Saved
Christmas.' "</TE>
<TE>   By December, it could be: "The Man Who Saved the Trojans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I FINISHED interviewing George and turned around to find someone
at USC had swiped my official NFL football. I have my suspicions, and
I could be wrong, but I'd sure like a peek into the athletic
director's trophy case.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON KSPN radio Tuesday afternoon, broadcaster Dave Stone unloaded
on Beau Duran, the Phoenix disc jockey who was fired for making a
disrespectful call to the widow of Darryl Kyle last week while on the
air.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional Stone said, "That kind of cheap ... stunt--there is
no place for it," right after he and his partner, Todd Donoho, had
found a place for it--airing a tape of the cheap ... stunt on their
radio show for the benefit of their audience.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Si Karot:</TE>
<TE>   "Do they actually let you in the Angels' clubhouse after what you
were writing about them earlier this season?"</TE>
<TE>   They said, "No problem," as long as I'm out when the team returns
Friday from its 0-2 start in Minnesota.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Play El Salvador in November</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States men's national team will make its first appearance
since its 1-0 World Cup quarterfinal loss to Germany in June when it
plays El Salvador on Nov. 17 at RFK Stadium in Washington, U.S.
Soccer announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The World Cup was obviously very successful for us," the
federation quoted Coach Bruce Arena as saying, "but now we must begin
the next four-year cycle of building a team capable of qualifying for
the World Cup in Germany in 2006.</LD>
<LD>   "The match against El Salvador will provide an opportunity to get
a first look at some new faces."</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. is 8-1-4 against El Salvador, and defeated the Central
Americans, 4-0, at the Rose Bowl in January en route to winning the
Gold Cup. The November game will be televised live by ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan Honored</TE>
<TE>   Landon Donovan, one of the players responsible for the U.S. World
Cup success, was honored in Beverly Hills, where the San Jose
Earthquakes' forward-midfielder was named Honda player of the year
for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   He defeated two other finalists, goalkeeper Brad Friedel and
midfielder Claudio Reyna, in voting by 277 U.S. soccer reporters and
broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, 20, of Redlands, is the youngest recipient of the award,
and said he felt somewhat embarrassed by that.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make a case for Brad, Claudio or a lot of guys on our
team," he said. "I feel bad [for the other players]. I feel like the
young guy shouldn't win."</TE>
<TE>   Zambrano Fired</TE>
<TE>   Former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano became the MetroStars' former
coach as well Tuesday when he was fired by the New York/New Jersey
team, which failed to reach the Major League Soccer playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Zambrano was 41-37-8 in three seasons. He will remain with the
MetroStars as director of player development.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Games</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, Japan, Thailand and defending champion Iran advanced
to the semifinals of the Asian Games tournament in South Korea, each
with 1-0 victories, but Iran's hopes of retaining its title suffered
a severe blow when veteran forward Ali Daei had to fly home to Tehran
after the death of his father.</TE>
<TE>   Iran defeated Kuwait on a free kick goal by midfielder Eman
Mobali, but the team was left reeling by the loss of its top striker.
Daei had scored three goals in three games in the tournament, but
left before the Kuwait game.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's victory over Bahrain in front of 43,000 fans in
Ulsan, South Korea, came off a penalty kick by its captain, Lee
Dong-Gook. The home team will play Iran in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Japan edged China on a 61st-minute goal by Satoshi Nakayama to
reach the final four for the first time since 1970. In the
semifinals, the Japanese will play Thailand, which overcame North
Korea on a goal by midfielder Noyvach Manit.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic Jams Referee</TE>
<TE>   An automobile accident that caused a tremendous traffic jam
outside Mexico City has resulted in the indefinite suspension of
Mexican referee Antonio Marrufo and three fellow officials.</TE>
<TE>   The start of Saturday's Mexican league game between Puebla and
Atlas had to be delayed for two hours because Marrufo, along with
assistants Guadalupe Martinez, and Marvin Torrenera, and Daniel
Cajas, the fourth official, were stuck in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "The referee has the duty to be at the stadium two hours before
the start of the game," a spokesman for Mexico's soccer federation
said.</TE>
<TE>   Paid Too Much</TE>
<TE>   Former Mexican national team player Ricardo Pelaez, who has come
under criticism since it was revealed last week that he was being
paid $24,606 a month as the director of national teams for the
Mexican soccer federation, resigned from that post Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "My resignation is solely for personal reasons," Pelaez said. "I
am not under pressure from anyone and I have not been fired. I have
already received a lot from football and I don't want this amount
because I am not doing enough to deserve it."</TE>

<KH>TWIN NOTES/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS.
MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>There's No Place Like the Dome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid; Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Left fielder Jacque Jones has spent his four-year major league career
with the Twins, so he never considers a fly ball at the Metrodome to
be routine.</LD>
<LD>   Fielding can be a nightmare at the multipurpose stadium because of
its Teflon-coated fiberglass ceiling. Outs often turn into hits as
players lose the ball against the white backdrop, and Jones has had
some scary experiences.</LD>
<LD>   That's why the former USC standout focuses on defense, and he
plans to be especially attentive in the field against the Angels in
the AL championship series.</LD>
<TE>   One misjudged fly ball can lead to big things, and the Twins are
eager to avoid making TV highlights on popups with a World Series
berth at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have to battle a roof, every time the ball comes to the
outfield, it's not baseball," he said. "It kind of takes away from
the game, it gives one team an advantage if they just get a few
popups in the right place, and it's unfair to the players that have
to deal with it all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't understand how hard it is. It makes playing outside
a lot easier, and you really realize it when you get outside. Yeah,
you have to battle the sun from time to time, and you realize that
you're paid to play in any conditions. But here, no matter what you
do, you're going to lose the ball sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   No one lost the ball Tuesday, and Jones said the Metrodome roof
wasn't much of a problem for Twin outfielders in the division series
victory over the Oakland Athletics. The Twins will try to keep it
that way, continuing to catch countless fly balls and popups during
batting practice. Of course, Jones also knows it may not matter.</TE>
<TE>   "You do all that, but you know that, really, it can be a factor
any time and in any series," he said. "So far it hasn't been, but you
can't ever take it for granted here."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Reed, who will start Game 2 for the Twins tonight, is not
considered a dominant right-hander by any means, but he has had his
way with the Angels the few times he has faced them.</TE>
<TE>   Reed went 1-0 with a 1.84 ERA in two starts against the Angels
last season, and in his only start against them this season, he threw
a complete-game three-hitter, striking out four and walking none in a
5-1 Twin win in Anaheim on May 24.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a pitcher who has an incredible feel out there on the
mound," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He has very, very good
command, changes speed well, and he's not afraid to challenge guys.
He does a great job pitching ahead in counts and putting guys away."</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES * ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</KH>
<HD>Just Your Average, 'Everyday' Save</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In last appearance, Guardado nearly blew Twins'
lead in series-clinching win over A's. Things go much more smoothly
Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins' 2-1 victory over the Angels in Game 1 of the
American League championship series Tuesday night came with an
action-packed Eddie Guardado save, defibrillator not included.</LD>
<LD>   There was the obligatory one-out walk to Tim Salmon--1-2-3 innings
are as rare for Guardado as World Series appearances are for the
Angels--a peculiar pitch-out with a 1-and-2 count to Troy Glaus, and
a grueling at-bat by Glaus, who fouled off three two-strike pitches
before taking a low-and-inside slider for strike three.</LD>
<LD>   But this wasn't the heart-stuck-in-the-throat roller-coaster ride
that Guardado put his teammates, fans and friends through on Sunday,
when the left-hander nearly blew a 5-1 lead, giving up four hits,
including a three-run home run to Mark Ellis, before finishing a 5-4
division series-clinching victory in Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   "I had about 25 voice mail messages when our plane landed [Sunday
night] and the first one was from Rick Aguilera," Guardado said,
referring to the former Twin reliever. "He said, 'What are you doing?
You're giving me a heart attack. I thought you were better than that.
You're going to send me to the hospital.' "</TE>
<TE>   Guardado, a Twin set-up man who made so many appearances from
1993-2001 he is known as "Everyday Eddie," converted 45 of 51 save
opportunities in his first year as a closer. But none was as tortuous
as Sunday, when he needed 28 pitches and went through seven batters,
pushing the Twins to the brink of disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he told Guardado after Sunday's game, Twin Manager Ron
Gardenhire said, "None of it's printable." But a conversation between
the manager and closer during Monday's workout had a much different
tone.</TE>
<TE>   "He went through a tough time in Oakland and scared everybody to
death," Gardenhire said. "He came to me on the field during the
workout and said, 'Don't lose faith.' I said, 'Eddie, I'd never do
that. I've given you the ball. You're one of the big reasons we're
here.' I have all the faith in the world in him."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Gardenhire didn't think twice about going to Guardado
Tuesday night, even though sparkling starter Joe Mays needed only 98
pitches to all but shut down a potent Angel lineup through eight
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He leads the league in saves, he's our guy" said Twin bullpen
coach Rick Stelmaszek. Guardado's nerves got a little wracked during
the eighth inning, while Mays pitched to the eighth, ninth and
leadoff batters in the Angel lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking if Joe goes 1-2-3 here, I get the big-time hitters
coming up," Guardado said. "Oh my God."</TE>
<TE>   Guardado opened with a strikeout of Darin Erstad--no shock there;
Erstad has two hits and seven strikeouts in 15 career at-bats against
Guardado and has always hated dealing with the different arm angles
Guardado uses for his fastball and slider.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon walked, and Garret Anderson flied to right. Guardado just
missed with his slider on a 2-and-2 pitch to Glaus and then doubled
up on the breaking ball, slipping another borderline slider past
Glaus that umpire Ed Montague called a strike, ending the game as a
Metrodome crowd of 55,562 erupted.</TE>
<TE>   "Glaus is a battler," Guardado said. "I knew he was looking
dead-red [fastball] with a full count, but A.J. [Pierzynski, Twin
catcher] put down the three-sign for the slider, I threw it and got
the job done."</TE>
<TE>   The key to the inning, pitching coach Rick Anderson said, was
Guardado featuring his slider over his fastball, which is hardly in
the Troy Percival class.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie said, 'Man, in Oakland I had nothing,' " Anderson said. "He
had nothing because he was forcing it, humping up, trying to
overthrow everything. Today he just let it happen and didn't force
his pitches. That was the difference."</TE>

<HD>Ejection Benches Ball for First Half Against Oregon</HD>

<LD>With three sacks and four tackles for losses, Dave Ball applies more
pressure on quarterbacks than any other UCLA defensive lineman. But
he must learn not to crack when an opponent takes a cheap shot.</LD>
<LD>   Ball, a junior end, must sit out the first half against Oregon on
Saturday because he was ejected in the fourth quarter of the Bruin
victory over Oregon State for throwing a punch.</LD>
<LD>   Although replays showed that Ball reacted to a blow from a Beaver
player, he was chagrined because the personal foul extended an Oregon
State drive that resulted in a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   "I do emotional, stupid things sometimes," he said. "On the
sideline, I was praying they wouldn't score. When they did, my
self-esteem decreased by a level of six."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo had warned his players about Oregon State's
reputation for baiting opponents, reminding them that officials
usually see the retaliatory blow, not the initial one.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers took shots at Bruin offensive tackle Mike Saffer's
broken rib. Saffer finally retaliated and was called for a personal
foul.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at video, you see why players were getting frustrated
..., " Toledo said. "It finally got to the point where they lost
their poise. You can't fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Asi Faoa, a junior, will play in Ball's place, making his first
start. Faoa has been a valuable reserve, making 12 tackles and two
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle had foot surgery Tuesday. He is
expected to be out five weeks.... Running back Manuel White's
hamstring injury will keep him sidelined Saturday.... Free safety Ben
Emanuel is suffering from a neck injury, so Matt Ware is practicing
at free safety as well as cornerback.... Quarterback Cory Paus has a
bruised right shoulder and is not throwing much in practice. Emanuel
and Paus will play Saturday.</TE>

<DH>Trojans' Buchanon now following in his father's footsteps</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Buchanon came to USC to catch passes, not break them up.</LD>
<LD>   He arrived from Oceanside High in the fall of 2001, redshirted
last season and was challenging for a regular spot in the receiving
corps during training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Buchanon's route to playing time, however, changed Aug. 21, the
day the Trojans learned that senior cornerback Kevin Arbet would sit
out the season because of a foot injury.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, as Coach Pete Carroll searched for depth in the
secondary, everything about Buchanon screamed cornerback. There was
size: 6 feet 3 inches. Experience: He played the position in high
school. And bloodline: His father, Willie, was a three-time Pro Bowl
cornerback during an 11-year NFL career.</TE>
<TE>   More than six weeks later, Buchanon is preparing for his third
consecutive start at left cornerback. The No. 20 Trojans play
California in a Pacific 10 Conference game Saturday at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I still miss being a receiver, making plays, making people miss,
getting first downs and touchdowns," Buchanon said. "But I'm finding
I can make plays on defense too."</TE>
<TE>   Like father, like son.</TE>
<TE>   Willie, also a two-way player, was recruited as a junior college
wide receiver by San Diego State in 1970. When he showed up at
training camp, Aztec coaches told him to spend the first five days of
practice on defense and the next five on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "But I only spent half a day on offense," Willie said. "I told
them I would rather hit people than be hit."</TE>
<TE>   Willie became an All-American and was a first-round draft choice
of the Green Bay Packers in 1972. He was more physical than finesse
and intercepted 28 passes in his pro career, including a
league-leading nine in 1978, when he picked off four in one game for
the San Diego Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   "People I talk to said he was like the Deion Sanders of his day,"
said Buchanon, who has seen tape of his father playing for the
Chargers in the classic 1982 overtime playoff victory over the Miami
Dolphins. "When I first switched over, my dad said he knew I should
be a wide receiver, but deep down he wanted me to be a cornerback."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, though, was not necessarily raised to be a football
player. He played several sports in grade school and was not allowed
to play tackle football until high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want him to burn out," Willie said. "I told him coming
into high school, 'You will be behind. As a sophomore, you'll have a
little idea. By the time you're a junior you'll know what's going on,
and as a senior, you can do some things.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was so skinny, he looked like Bambi. My wife once said, 'If he
ever learned to open up his stride, he would be fast.' "</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon picked up speed, and the game, quickly. He helped lead
his team to a San Diego Section division title as a junior and caught
30 passes as a senior before signing with USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw him as a playmaker," said USC assistant coach Kennedy
Pola, who recruited Buchanon. "We knew who his dad was and we knew
along the way that William was going to get bigger and be able to
play on either side of the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon was just beginning to feel comfortable in the Trojans'
multiple-receiver passing game when Arbet was declared out for the
season. One day, Buchanon was emulating the moves of senior wide
receiver Kareem Kelly and junior flanker Keary Colbert. The next he
tried not to fall prey to them.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell him, even after I catch a ball, to continue to go hard,
try to poke the ball, that anything can happen and never give up on
the route," Kelly said. "There are balls that may seem out of range,
but he has such a long frame--everything is within range for him."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon did not play in the opener against Auburn. Junior college
transfer Ronald Nunn started at left cornerback and was replaced at
halftime by freshman Justin Wyatt after suffering a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon played only a few series at cornerback in a rout over
Colorado. But when Nunn injured his knee the next week at Kansas
State, Carroll turned to Buchanon.</TE>
<TE>   It was a trial by fire. Kansas State quarterback Ell Roberson came
off the bench and passed for 134 yards in a 27-20 victory, including
a nine-yard touchdown pass to James Terry in front of Buchanon.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon started for the first time the next week against Oregon
State and made several impressive plays against the pass and the run
as the Trojans shut down quarterback Derek Anderson and shut out the
Beavers, 22-0.</TE>
<TE>   However, last week's 30-27 overtime defeat by Washington State
humbled Buchanon and a defense that had previously been first in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon knocked down a short pass in the end zone that he could
have intercepted. Receiver Sammy Moore also got behind him for a
53-yard reception that set up a Cougar field goal near the end of
regulation and sent the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed a few opportunities," Buchanon said. "I'm kind of mad at
myself about that, but overall, I thought I did a better job. I took
a step forward and that was a positive."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll sees brighter days for Buchanon, who will face another
challenge against Cal quarterback Kyle Boller on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still just a pup at it, so he needs to just keep growing in
his own confidence and be more aggressive," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon still watches closely when Jerry Rice and some of his
other favorite receivers are playing on television. But lately, he
also finds himself drawn to the cornerbacks covering them.</TE>
<TE>   His future, he said, is on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to it," he said. "I'm going to get better and
hopefully become a dominant corner."</TE>
